Exposure was calculated using the number of days the patient received study drug, based on first and last dose dates. For patients not enrolled in the ongoing GEMINI LTS study at the data cut-off date, 16&#x02005;weeks were added to the date of the last dose to account for the known duration of detectable vedolizumab serum concentrations.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> In phase 2 studies, a dose was defined as any amount of infusion, and in phase 3 studies, as &#x02265;75% of the infusion by volume.

For patients who received only placebo, exposure to vedolizumab was calculated as 0&#x02005;days.</p><p>Adverse events (AEs) were defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient administered a pharmaceutical product, which did not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment, and serious AEs (SAEs) were defined as any diagnosis of progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy (PML) or any AE that was considered an important medical event, a congenital anomaly or life-threatening, or resulted in significant disability, hospitalisation or death. AEs and SAEs were classified by intensity (see online <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gut.bmj.com/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1136/gutjnl-2015-311079/-/DC1">supplementary materials</ext-link>) and according to the <italic>Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities</italic> (MedDRA)<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> V.14.0. Verbatim terms defined by MedDRA were used. Exposure-adjusted incidence rates, defined as the number of patients experiencing the event per 100 person-years (PYs) of exposure, were reported for AEs. Days of exposure were calculated from the AE onset date minus the date of first dose plus 1. PYs of exposure were calculated for the first occurrence of each AE, and truncated after a patient experienced the AE, although the patient continued to contribute PYs for different AEs experienced, if applicable. Thus, the total PYs of exposure could differ by AE. Patients randomised to placebo in a placebo-controlled study and then enrolled in an open-label study could contribute to events in either the placebo or vedolizumab group depending on when they experienced the AE. PYs were calculated accordingly for placebo or vedolizumab for each AE. Recognising the disproportionate PYs of follow-up for placebo compared with vedolizumab, statistical comparisons were not performed between the two groups. Calculation of 95% CIs when the number of events was 0 followed the rule of 3 (ie, (0, (3/total PYs)&#x000d7;100)).</p><p>Infusion-related reactions (IRRs) were defined as AEs occurring on the day of or one calendar day after the infusion that were assessed by the investigator as infusion-related. In addition, blood samples for antivedolizumab antibody (AVA) assessment were collected within 30&#x02005;min before dosing in the phase 3 studies and within 2&#x02005;h in the phase 2 studies. Immunogenicity was determined as described elsewhere.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Predictors of serious infections</title><p>A Cox proportional hazards model with time-dependent covariates was used to determine the relative contribution (HRs and 95% CIs) of different factors to the occurrence of serious infections in the phase 3 safety population, which included patients in both treatment arms. Predictors were analysed in the UC and CD populations alone and combined. Factors assessed were age, sex, disease duration, baseline disease activity, prior history of tumour necrosis factor &#x003b1; antagonist (anti-TNF) failure, baseline use of immunosuppressives, on-study use of narcotic analgesics (all opioids) or on-study use of corticosteroids. Patients were considered corticosteroid users in this model if they received corticosteroids within 30&#x02005;days before the infection date. When patients with UC and CD were combined, a common disease activity index was created to measure the contribution of baseline disease activity (see online <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gut.bmj.com/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1136/gutjnl-2015-311079/-/DC1">supplementary table</ext-link> S2).

PYs, multiplied by 100. PYs were calculated as the sum of each patient's contribution, calculated from the days of exposure (ie, AE onset date minus the date of first dose plus 1&#x02005;day). For each AE, the PYs were truncated after a patient experienced the AE and each AE was counted only once per patient. Patients who were randomised to placebo and then rolled over into an open-label study could contribute to events in either the placebo or vedolizumab group depending on when they experienced the AE. PYs were calculated accordingly for placebo or vedolizumab for each AE. When the number of events=0, the 95% CI was calculated based on rule of 3 (ie, (0, 3/total PYs)&#x000d7;100).</p></fn><fn><p>*Includes patients from GEMINI 1.</p></fn><fn><p>&#x02020;Includes patients from studies C13002, C13004, GEMINI 1 and GEMINI LTS.</p></fn><fn><p>&#x02021;Includes patients from GEMINI 2 and GEMINI 3.</p></fn><fn><p>&#x000a7;Includes patients from studies C13004, GEMINI 2, GEMINI 3 and GEMINI LTS.</p></fn><fn><p>&#x000b6;Includes patients from GEMINI 1, GEMINI 2 and GEMINI 3.</p></fn><fn><p>**Includes patients from all six studies.</p></fn><fn><p>&#x02020;&#x02020;Includes MedDRA preferred terms: abdominal pain, abdominal pain lower, abdominal rebound tenderness, abdominal rigidity, abdominal tenderness, abdominal pain upper, GI pain.</p></fn><fn><p>AE, adverse event; CD, Crohn's disease; LTS, long-term safety; MedDRA, Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities; N/A, not applicable; PY, person-year; SAE, serious adverse event; UC, ulcerative colitis.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>Uncommon but important non-infectious events associated with anti-TNFs, such as congestive heart failure exacerbation or demyelination, were not seen with vedolizumab.

One vedolizumab-treated patient taking concomitant methylprednisolone and azathioprine developed <italic>Listeria</italic> meningitis; the infection resolved with treatment.</p><p>The higher rate of GI infections in vedolizumab patients was largely due to gastroenteritis.

<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>The most frequently reported AEs were GI events and infections in patient populations with UC and CD. In general, when adjusted for exposure, AEs were reported more frequently with placebo (419.4/100 PYs) than with vedolizumab (247.8/100 PYs). These exposure-adjusted incidence rates provide an estimate of the number of patients who would experience the event of interest if 100 patients were treated for 1&#x02005;year. Based upon this approach, a patient who experienced the same AE multiple times was counted only once. Given the longer average duration of exposure to vedolizumab, it is possible that a single patient may have experienced the same event more times with vedolizumab than with placebo. The disproportionate PYs of follow-up with vedolizumab compared with placebo&#x02014;a limitation of the present analyses&#x02014;and the low numbers of observed events warrant the need for further investigation. Although the placebo group does not allow for direct comparisons, especially for events occurring beyond 6&#x02005;months of exposure, incidence rates for vedolizumab-treated patients can be compared with that observed in the HealthCore Integrated Research Database (HIRD), one of the largest commercially insured populations in the USA. The HIRD provides estimates of background incidence rates of AEs from 14&#x02005;733 commercially insured US patients with moderately to severely active IBD.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> However, as real-world disease management often differs from that in clinical trials, comparison of outcomes to the HIRD should be interpreted with caution.</p><p>Importantly, we did not observe an overall increase in the risk of infection or serious infection with vedolizumab exposure. The overall incidence rates of infection and serious infection with vedolizumab were 63.5/100 PYs and 4.3/100 PYs, respectively (vs 82.9/100 PYs and 3.8/100 PYs for placebo). For the majority of infections and serious infections, the 95% CIs for placebo events overlapped with the point estimates for vedolizumab events. No indication for serious opportunistic infections, such as disseminated TB, systemic candidiasis, disseminated herpes zoster, extraintestinal cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections or <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> pneumonia, was observed. <italic>Listeria</italic> meningitis was reported in one patient with CD. There were three cases of pulmonary TB with no extrapulmonary manifestations in patients from countries with higher endemic rates of TB relative to the USA and western Europe.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> In a pooled analysis of GEMINI 1 and GEMINI 2 data, the infection profiles in patients who received vedolizumab were similar with or without concomitant corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressives.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> It should be noted that patients receiving placebo may have more active disease and a greater propensity for intestinal infections, which could confound the reported incidence rates. However, the low incidence of infections with vedolizumab treatment is promising and consistent with what has been reported in HIRD (eg, for clostridial infections, we report 0.7/100 PYs (95% CI 0.5 to 1.0) while the HIRD reports 3.1/1000 PYs (95% CI 2.1 to 4.5) for <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> diarrhoea/colitis).<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p><p>These observations, which are consistent with vedolizumab's gut-selective mechanism of action, have important clinical implications. Morbidity and mortality from common infections such as community-acquired pneumonia and opportunistic infection are concerns with existing immunosuppressive IBD therapies.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20&#x02013;22</xref> Epidemiological studies to evaluate whether vedolizumab may represent a safer alternative are needed.</p><p>Enteric infections were infrequent in vedolizumab-exposed patients. Apart from gastroenteritis and abscess, all other enteric infections (eg, clostridial, CMV, streptococcal, appendicitis, diarrhoea, enterocolitis, diverticulitis) were reported with incidence rates of &#x02264;0.8/100 PYs each. All cases of clostridial or CMV infection occurred in patients exposed to vedolizumab. One patient had a streptococcal infection with placebo exposure versus 36 vedolizumab-exposed patients. An increased risk of some GI infections is plausible based on the gut-selective mechanism of action for vedolizumab. To further investigate this potential risk, a prospective patient registry has been initiated to evaluate the risk of enteric and other infections.</p><p>The development of PML, an often fatal complication of JCV infection, is a well-established risk of prolonged treatment with natalizumab, a monoclonal antibody directed to the &#x003b1;<sub>4</sub> integrin.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> In natalizumab clinical trials representing almost 3000 patients with 18&#x02005;months of exposure, there were three cases of PML that occurred with a mean latency of 18&#x02005;months.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> As of June 2015, 566 cases of PML had been confirmed among over 138&#x02005;800 patients exposed to postmarket natalizumab from which PML risk estimates were identified.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Applying these risk estimates to the database of all vedolizumab trials, an average of at least six PML events would have been expected if PML risk with vedolizumab were the same as for natalizumab. In contrast, no cases of PML were observed during vedolizumab clinical development in the context of a rigorous risk monitoring programme. These data suggest that any PML risk with vedolizumab, if present, is likely to be significantly lower than for natalizumab.</p><p>Collectively, these data indicate that vedolizumab treatment is not associated with increased risk of serious and opportunistic infections. Using a Cox proportional hazards model, the factors independently associated with serious infection in patients with UC and CD were younger age, on-study narcotic analgesic use and on-study corticosteroid use. When analysed separately, the same risk factors were identified in patients with CD. In contrast, prior failure with anti-TNFs was an independent risk factor for serious infection in patients with UC, while younger age and concomitant corticosteroid use were not identified in the UC population alone. These data are in agreement with a study by Lichtenstein <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> which reported that on-study narcotic analgesic use (HR, 1.98; 95% CI 1.44 to 2.73; p&#x0003c;0.001) and prednisone therapy (HR, 1.57; 95% CI 1.17 to 2.10; p=0.002) were independently associated with serious infection in patients with CD. In contrast to our model, Lichtenstein <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> identified disease activity and infliximab treatment as independent predictors of serious infection. Of note, older age (HR, 1.08; 95% CI 1.07 to 1.09; p&#x0003c;0.001) was associated with increased mortality risk in their study.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></p><p>The potential for IRRs is a known risk with biological therapeutics, including monoclonal antibodies such as vedolizumab.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Across the six vedolizumab clinical studies, &#x02264;5% of patients experienced an IRR, the majority of which were mild or moderate in intensity. Overall immunogenicity rates with long-term exposure were low, and there was no apparent association between AVAs and IRRs. As with other monoclonal antibodies, treatment with vedolizumab is associated with AVAs. Rate of antibody formation can be reduced by coadministration of immunosuppressives. For individual patients, the balance between safety and protection against immunogenicity for long-term durability of remission should be evaluated.</p><p>Some treatments for IBD increase the risk of cancer. Patients treated with purine antimetabolites have a well-established increased risk of skin cancer and lymphoma.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> We observed no noticeable relationship between the development of malignancy and age, sex, type of malignancy or duration of vedolizumab exposure. The occurrence of four cases of colon cancer out of a population of &#x0003e;2800 patients (0.1/100 PYs) is consistent with published data regarding the incidence of this complication in patients with IBD and is less than what was observed in HIRD (2.1/1000 PYs; 95% CI 1.3 to 3.2).<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>
<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Notably, the incidence of non-melanoma skin cancer in vedolizumab-exposed patients was not greater than in patients who received placebo. Non-melanoma skin cancer is the most common malignancy related to immunosuppression<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> and can be a useful bellwether for this risk. Further, risk of non-melanoma skin cancer is increased when patients are treated with thiopurines.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> All vedolizumab-exposed patients diagnosed with skin cancer had a history of azathioprine therapy, and two continued azathioprine use on study. While vedolizumab does not have a known effect on impairment of T cell mediated cancer surveillance in extraintestinal organs, prospective studies are required to fully evaluate the risk of malignancy in patients receiving vedolizumab long-term.</p><p>In addition to infection, cancer and IRRs, the suppression of systemic immunity by anti-TNFs has been associated with autoimmune complications including psoriatic lesions, demyelination and drug-induced lupus.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>
<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30&#x02013;32</xref> In a recent review of the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database, anti-TNF exposure was associated with a psoriasis-proportional reporting ratio of 9.24 compared with drugs implicated in the development of psoriasis.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Of all neurological AEs with anti-TNFs reported to the FAERS, 153 reports (19.8%) were central nervous system and/or spinal cord demyelination.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> Lupus-like syndrome is estimated to occur in 0.2&#x02013;0.4% of patients treated with anti-TNFs, although some cases may be attributed to unmasking of latent systemic lupus erythematosus rather than true lupus-like syndrome.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> In contrast, no signal for these uncommon anti-TNF-related complications was observed with vedolizumab exposure, although there was one case of cutaneous lupus. Liver dysfunction has been associated with normal IBD progression and immunosuppressive use.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>
<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Although a low incidence of hepatobiliary events was observed among vedolizumab-treated patients only, further study is necessary to determine whether these complications are drug related. Indeed, in the clinical development programme overall, the rates of autoimmune and hepatobiliary events of any type were exceedingly low.</p><p>In conclusion, the integrated clinical trial data set of 2932 patients with moderately to severely active UC or CD presented herein provides evidence that there are no significant safety concerns associated with vedolizumab treatment. Vedolizumab offers a targeted, gut-selective mechanism of action without any clear increase in the risk of serious systemic opportunistic infections or other common complications for a set of diseases that typically require lifelong therapy.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> AP, BGF, J-FC, BA and CM contributed to the design of the vedolizumab integrated analyses and drafting of the manuscript.
