control, pulmonary function, and trunk muscle activity in chronic stroke patients.
[Subjects and Methods] The study included 24 chronic stroke patients who were randomly
assigned, 12 each, to the experimental and control groups, and received neurodevelopmental
treatment. Moreover, the experimental group underwent respiratory exercise. In each
patient, the trunk control was measured using the Trunk Impairment Scale (TIS); muscle
activity of the trunk, through the surface electromyogram; and pulmonary function, using
the pneumatometer. [Results] The intragroup comparison showed significant differences in
TIS, Forced vital capacity (FVC), Forced expiratory volume at one second (FEV1), Rectus
Abdominis (RA), Internal Oblique (IO) and External Oblique (EO) in the experimental group.
The intergroup comparison showed that the differences in TIS, FVC, FEV1, RA, IO and EO
within the experimental group appeared significant relative to the control group.
[Conclusion] Based on these results, this study proved that respiratory exercise was
effective in improving trunk control, pulmonary function, and trunk muscle activity in
patients with chronic stroke.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Trunk</kwd><kwd>Respiratory</kwd><kwd>Stroke</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Stroke is a brain functional disorder caused by rupture or clogging of the cerebrovascular
system, leading to hemiplegia wherein one side of the body is paralyzed and trunk stability
is abnormal<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Stroke patients lose control
of the trunk function due to reduced exercise of the upper and lower limbs and
mal-arrangement of the body that weaken the trunk muscle and cause asymmetrical muscular
activity<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. There is thus difficulty in
maintaining balance because such abnormal trunk ability also affects the proprioceptive
sense<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Moreover, due to the loss of
trunk ability, the lung and chest cannot expand enough, and the paralysis of respiratory
muscles can cause complications such as pneumonia<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, improving the trunk ability is emphasized in
rehabilitation of stroke patients<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Recently, there have been many studies on improving physical function through respiratory
exercise. The results of introducing a respiratory exercise in patients with chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease showed improvement in their endurance and quality of life<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. An exercise therapy using a pneumatometer
was effective in improving the pulmonary function in patients with amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. So far, respiratory exercise
in research has been mostly conducted in patients with respiratory disease, but few studies
have reported the effects of respiratory exercise, using respiratory exercise equipment, on
the trunk control, trunk muscle activity, and pulmonary function of patients with chronic
stroke. This study aims to identify the effects of respiratory exercise on trunk control,
pulmonary function, and trunk muscle activity in patients with chronic stroke.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was performed on 24 patients diagnosed with stroke through CT and MRI more than
6 months ago, and randomly assigned, 12 subjects each, to the experimental (6 males, 6
females) and control (6 males, 6 females) groups. All subjects selected could perform
assignments as they received a score of 24 or more on the Mini-Mental State Examination
(MMSE), could walk 10&#x02005;m or more independently, and had no visual disorder, visual field
defect, and lower limb orthopedic disorder. The hypothesis of this study is that there will
be a significant difference between respiratory exercise on trunk control, pulmonary
function and trunk muscle activity in chronic stroke patients. Before the experiment, the
subjects received sufficient explanation on the purpose and method of this research, and
their consent was obtained. The Dongshin University Research Ethics Board approved the study
protocol, and all the subjects gave their informed consent. For the experimental group the
average age was 61.7 &#x000b1; 6.2&#x02005;years, the average height was 162.5 &#x000b1; 3.4&#x02005;cm, and the average
weight was 64.2 &#x000b1; 5.2&#x02005;kg. For the control group the average age was 59.2 &#x000b1; 4.6&#x02005;years, the
average height was 164.3 &#x000b1; 5.6&#x02005;cm, and the average weight was 62.7 &#x000b1; 8.6&#x02005;kg.</p><p>The experimental and control groups received a neurodevelopmental treatment for 30&#x02005;min a
day, 5 times a week, for 4 weeks. In addition, the experimental group underwent respiratory
exercise using respiratory exercise equipment (Lung Boost Respiratory Trainer MD8000) for
20&#x02005;min a day, 5 times a week, for 4 weeks. Before the exercise, the patients were educated
on the respiratory exercise method. They were instructed not to breathe through their nose
during the respiratory exercise, and to take rest until they calmed down if they felt
fatigued or dizzy, and then resume the exercise. The patient stood with both feet apart at
shoulder width, sat down with the feet resting flat on the floor in a proper posture, put
the respiratory exercise equipment on a head height, held the equipment on one hand, pulled
the chin, and made a neutral posture. The patient held a mouthpiece over the mouth, stared
at the respiratory exercise equipment, and carried out inhalation and exhalation. Difficulty
level 1 without resistance was applied in the first week followed by difficulty level 2 with
50% resistance in the second week, difficulty level 3 with 60% resistance in the third week,
and difficulty level 4 with 70% resistance in the fourth week.</p><p>Trunk control was measured using the Trunk Impairment Scale (TIS). TIS had 17 items,
consisting of 7 points for static balance in the sitting position, 10 points for dynamic
balance, and 6 points for coordination ability. The score ranged from 0 to 23, and the
higher the score, the better the trunk control ability.</p><p>Trunk muscle activity was measured using the surface electromyogram (LXM 5308, Laxtha Inc.,
Daejeon, Korea). The configuration was set at a sampling rate of 1,024&#x02005;Hz, band pass filter
of 20&#x02013;450&#x02005;Hz, and notch filter of 60&#x02005;Hz. The obtained muscle activity signals were analyzed
using the electromyogram software (Telescan 3.11, Laxtha Inc., Daejeon, Korea), by
processing with root mean square (RMS). The body parts with the attached surface electrodes
were rubbed with sandpaper, and the horny layer of the skin was removed with cotton swabs
containing alcohol, in order to reduce the skin resistance. The surface electrodes were
attached to the rectus abdominis, external abdominal oblique, and internal abdominal oblique
muscles. For the normalization of surface electromyogram signal, reference voluntary
contraction was used. The reference contraction value was measured when the patient was
comfortably sitting on a chair, and the reference voluntary contraction value was measured
when the patient stood up naturally from the seated position. The movements were measured
thrice and the average value obtained to minimize measurement errors; the measurement time
was analyzed by collecting 3-s signals that eliminated the first and last 1&#x02005;s and applying
%RVC value from the electromyogram signal recorded by measuring for 5 s.</p><p>Pulmonary function was measured using the pneumatometer. While the patients were
comfortably seated, their forced vital volume (FVC) and forced exhalation volume at 1&#x02005;s
(FEV1) were measured and compared.</p><p>SPSS software version 19.0 was used to statistically process and analyze the collected
data. A paired t-test was performed to compare the extent of trunk control, pulmonary
function, and trunk muscle activity in both groups before and after the study. An
independent t-test was used to compare differences between the groups, and statistical
significance level was set at p=0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The intragroup comparison showed significant differences in TIS, FVC, FEV1, RA, IO and EO

function, and trunk muscle activity in chronic stroke patients. There was a significant
difference in the trunk control of the experimental group, based on the intragroup
comparisons. The trunk control improved more significantly in the experimental group than
the control group, according to the intergroup comparisons. Kim et al.<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that respiration strengthening training was
effective in stabilizing trunk control in stroke patients; Kim<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup> also reported that complex breath exercise was effective in
stabilizing trunk control in stroke patients; these results support those of this study. The
loss of trunk muscle control in stroke patients meant reduced posture stability, and the
muscles connected with respiration were closely related to maintaining posture<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. On a study of correlation among trunk
muscles, trunk control, and pulmonary function in stroke patients, a significant difference
was shown from the trunk control and pulmonary function<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Since the pulmonary function improved after the respiratory
exercise in this study, the trunk control ability is considered to have improved as
well.</p><p>The trunk muscle activity of the rectus abdominis, external abdominal oblique, and internal
abdominal oblique muscles of the experimental group showed significant improvement after
performing the respiratory exercise. There was a significant difference in the trunk muscle
activity of the rectus abdominis, external abdominal oblique, and internal abdominal oblique
muscles on introducing complex respiratory exercise in patients with chronic stroke<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Jo<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that respiratory exercise was effective in stabilizing the
trunk muscle activity of the rectus abdominis, external abdominal oblique, and internal
abdominal oblique muscles in patients with chronic stroke, which was consistent with the
results of this study. When trunk stabilization was needed, the functional changes in the
trunk muscle required the coordination of the tonicity and phasic pain of the diaphragm and
transversus abdominis muscle, facilitating the coordination reaction of the central nervous
system between respiration and trunk movement<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Such results imply that the
improvement of trunk muscle activity due to respiratory exercise has improved trunk
stability as well.</p><p>Kim<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup> showed that FVC and FEV1 improved
significantly after performing a respiratory exercise, and Kim et al.<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that respiration strengthening training positively
affected the pulmonary function of stroke patients, supporting the results of this study.
The results of introducing respiratory exercise in stroke patients with restrictive
ventilator disturbance showed that the endurance of their trunk muscles improved and the FVC
increased resulting in an increase in deep breathing ability and exhalation volume.
Moreover, as the respiratory exercise increased the strength and coordination of trunk
muscles and improved respiratory function, FEV1 is also considered to have improved. This
study confirmed that the respiratory exercise was an intervention that positively helped
improve trunk control, trunk muscle activity, and pulmonary function in patients with
chronic stroke.</p><p>The limitation of this study is the short duration and a lack of follow-up; hence, the
long-term effects of the study could not be determined. Moreover, the small sample size is
insufficient to generalize the results to all chronic stroke patients in choosing the
subjects. An additional study improving these problems is considered necessary.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>None.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Dupre</surname><given-names>CM</given-names></name><name><surname>Libman</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Dupre</surname><given-names>SI</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Stroke chameleons</article-title>. <source>J Stroke
