However, intubation and mechanical ventilation have been associated with acute complications including air leak syndromes, subglottic stenosis, bradycardia due to stimulation of vagus nerve and infection. Moreover, chronic complications such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and retinopathy of prematurity may occur following mechanical ventilation.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] In an effort to decrease ventilator-induced lung injury, alternative techniques of invasive ventilation have been employed.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>General implications of ventilator-induced lung injuries are: Volu/barotraumas, injury related to lung over distention or stretching of pulmonary structures, atelectrauma injury caused by alveolar collapse and biotrauma, injury caused by hyperactive inflammatory responses secondary to bacterial airway colonization.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Because of many complications of mechanical ventilation, gentler modes of ventilation including nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP) are now the primary mode of respiratory support in preterm infants.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] CPAP can improve oxygenation by increasing functional residual capacity and decrease work of breathing by reducing airway resistance.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Therefore, it is useful for treatment of RDS at the earliest signs of respiratory distress, postextubation respiratory support, and stabilization of newborns with labored respiration or cyanosis in the delivery room.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] In addition, CPAP splints the upper airways during respiration and prevents collapse of the pharynx during expiration thereby it is effective for management of recurrent apnea in newborn infants.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>However, the rate of CPAP failure is relatively high and diminishing the time newborns spend in mechanical ventilation is required by using alternative methods instead of mechanical ventilation for management of CPAP failure.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) is a form of noninvasive respiratory support that combines NCPAP with intermittent ventilator breaths and offers more ventilator support than NCPAP.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Some researchers recommended the use of synchronized NIPPV for respiratory support after extubation.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Others proposed NIPPV for initial management of RDS or treatment of apnea of prematurity.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] The primary advantage of NIPPV is maintaining higher mean airway pressure than CPAP. This provides higher capability to recruit collapsed alveoli, sustain end expiratory lung volume, decrease respiratory dead space, improve lung mechanics, and accommodate oxygenation. In addition, NIPPV increases tidal volume and provides sigh breaths, which can increase gas exchange and decreases airway collapse.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>The purpose of this study was to assess the success rate of NIPPV as a noninvasive method for management of CPAP failure and prevention of intubation and mechanical ventilation in premature infants.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Patient and setting</title><p>This was a prospective clinical trial comparing the efficiency of NIPPV and mechanical ventilation for management of CPAP failure in premature infants. During a period of 5 months since November 2012 to April 2013, a total number of 55 consecutive newborns delivered in Alzahra and Shahid Beheshti University Hospitals were enrolled into the study.</p><p>Premature infants with gestational ages (GAs) of 26-35 weeks who had CPAP failure were enrolled to the study. CPAP failure was defined as: The need for FiO<sub>2</sub> more than 60% and maximum CPAP of 8 cmH<sub>2</sub>O for maintaining SpO<sub>2</sub> of 88-95% and/or pH &#x0003c;7.2 and PCO<sub>2</sub> more than 60 and/or more than three episodes of apnea with bradycardia (heart rate &#x0003c;80/min).</p><p>Exclusion criteria were: The need for intubation and mechanical ventilation before allocation, nasopharyngeal pathology; coanal atresia; cleft/lip palate; major congenital anomalies especially thoracic or cardiac anomalies; intra-ventricular hemorrhage (IVH) Grade 3 or 4 on admission, and parental refusal to participate in the research project. Ethic approval was obtained from Isfahan University of Medical Sciences Ethics Committee and informed written parental consent was obtained before participation.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Procedure</title><p>The allocation sequence was included computer-generated random numbers in a blocked design. Infants were randomized to receive either NIPPV or conventional ventilation (CV), from concealed envelopes opened by nonstudy personnel.</p><p>Demographic data including birth weight, GA, Apgar score at 5 min, antenatal steroid use and postnatal age at the time of the entrance to the study, were recorded by one of the investigators. We also assessed the incidence of complications such as pneumothorax, IVH, BPD, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), and patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in the two groups. In addition, the underlying diseases that led to CPAP failure such as RDS, apnea of prematurity and apnea due to other causes were recorded. Cranial ultrasonography for evaluation of IVH was performed on the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> days after birth. Duration of oxygen therapy, length of hospital stay, and duration of respiratory support were recorded.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Variables and assessments</title><p>We used a time cycled, pressure limited neonatal ventilator (bear Cub 750 psv) for newborns allocated to the study. The initial setting for NIPPV were peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 16-20 cmH<sub>2</sub>O, positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 4-6 cmH<sub>2</sub>O, inspiratory time (TI) of 0.4-0.5 s and frequency of 40-60 breaths/min and a flow of 8 L/min. The initial setting for CV group was PIP of 12-20 cmH<sub>2</sub>O (according to patient's need), PEEP of 4-6 cmH<sub>2</sub>O, TI of 0.35-0.4 s and frequency of 40-60 breaths/min and a flow of 8 L/min. Ventilator setting were adjusted so that the target range of SPO<sub>2</sub> (88-95%) was obtained. In both groups, we have taken blood samples for arterial blood gas 1 h after initiation of treatment protocol and then every 6 h or 1 h after each changes in ventilator parameter. Sterile nasal prongs (Argyle, Sherwood Medical Co, St. Louis, MO, USA) were used to provide NIPPV. We selected the proper size of the prongs based on infants&#x02019; weight as follows: Large for infants weighing &#x0003e;1500 g, small for infants 1000-1500 g and x small for infants &#x0003c;1000 g. We did not use a pacifier or chin strap to decrease the risk of air leak syndrome.</p><p>The infants in the NIPPV group were intubated if they needed a PIP of &#x0003e;25 cmH<sub>2</sub>O and/or frequency of &#x0003e;60 breaths/min, and then the patient was treated with CV.</p><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Definitions</title><p>Gestational age was determined by maternal menstrual history.

RDS was defined as the presence of respiratory distress and a characteristic chest radiograph. PDA was established by echocardiography. IVH was confirmed by cranial ultrasonography based on Papile's classification.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] BPD was documented by the need for supplementary oxygen at 36 weeks of corrected GA and characteristic radiographic changes.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Sepsis was diagnosed by a positive blood culture. NEC was diagnosed on the basis of Bell's criteria.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Apgar score was calculated by one of the researchers using five parameters including heart rate, respiratory effort, muscle tone, reflex irritability and color.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] We were treated RDS based on our standard protocols.

To find factors that may increase treatment failure with NIPPV we performed intergroup comparisons [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>].

In addition, treatment failure was higher in newborns who needed more frequent doses of surfactant.</p><table-wrap id="T3" position="float"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Comparison of newborn characteristics based on response to NIPPV</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJPVM-5-1045-g004"/></table-wrap></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec1-4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Because of possible complications of endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation including laryngeal and tracheal injury, increased incidence and severity of BPD and increased hospital acquired sepsis and pneumonia, using noninvasive modes of respiratory care could have many advantages for preterm infants. Our study reveals that NIPPV is a good alternative mode to mechanical ventilation for management of CPAP failure. However, about 26% of newborns who underwent NIPPV for treatment of respiratory failure did not respond to this mode of noninvasive ventilation and needed intubation and mechanical ventilation. We found that newborns with lower postnatal age at entry to the study and lower 5 min Apgar score more likely had NIPPV failure. In addition, the failure rate of NIPPV was higher in newborns who needed more frequent doses of surfactant.</p><p>The higher rate of NIPPV failure in newborns with lower 5 min Apgar score is probably due to decreased central respiratory drive following birth hypoxia. Likewise, the higher rate of NIPPV failure in newborns who needed more frequent doses of surfactant may be due to more severe lung disease and lower pulmonary compliance in these newborns leading to more severe respiratory failure.</p><p>There are a few studies comparing NIPPV and CV for management of respiratory disorders in premature infants. Lampland <italic>et al</italic>. conducted a study to compare the effects of NIPPV and synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV) on markers of physiologic tolerance and lung injury in spontaneously breathing piglets with RDS. They found that interstitial inflammation was significantly higher in SIMV group.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>Another study was done by Bhandari <italic>et al</italic>. on preterm infants with birth weights of 600-1250 g to compare the outcomes of infants with RDS, postsurfactant, extubated to SNIPPV or continued on CV. They demonstrated that use of SNIPPV as the primary mode of ventilation could decrease the need for mechanical ventilation. In addition, more infants in the CV group had BPD and death, compared to SNIPPV group. Nevertheless, there were no significant differences between two groups in the incidence of other morbidities such as pneumothorax, IVH, and NEC.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>We also showed that the total duration of oxygen therapy and total duration of respiratory support did not significantly differ between groups. However, the total duration of oxygen therapy and total duration of ventilator support in our study were shorter than Bhandari's study. We speculated that this difference may be due to lower birth weight and GA of newborns of the Bhandari's study.</p><p>Kishore <italic>et al</italic>. conducted a study to find the failure rate of NIPPV and NCPAP as the primary mode of respiratory support for preterm infants with RDS. They demonstrated that the failure rate (defined as the need for intubation and mechanical ventilation) at 48 h and 7 days was significantly less among infants randomized to NIPPV compared to NCPAP (13.5% vs. 39.5%).[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] We supposed that the higher rate of NIPPV failure in our study is due to the fact that we used NIPPV for infants with CPAP failure and not as the primary mode for management of RDS.</p><p>The beneficial effects of NIPPV could be justified by an explanation of Kiciman <italic>et al</italic>. They had shown that thoracoabdominal motion asynchrony could decrease using nasal SIMV compared to endotracheal CPAP and NCPAP and speculated that this effect may be owing to removal of endotracheal tube resistance or impressive stabilization of the chest wall. Finally, they concluded that nasal SIMV could be an effective mode of respiratory support for premature newborns who need minimal respiratory support.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>There are several categories of studies using NIPPV for respiratory support of premature infants. The first category of studies was compared NIPPV and NCPAP for management of RDS immediately after INSURE technique. Gizzi <italic>et al</italic>. carried out a study to compare synchronized NIPPV and NCPAP used after INSURE technique in preterm newborns with RDS and demonstrated that NIPPV immediately after INSURE procedure could significantly decrease the need for mechanical ventilation.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Similarly, Kugelman <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated that NIMV compared with NCPAP could decrease the need for intubation and mechanical ventilation.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Likewise, Ramanathan <italic>et al</italic>. conducted a study on 110 preterm neonates &#x0003c;30 weeks GA who needed surfactant therapy during first 60 min after birth for RDS and showed that NIPPV compared to NCPAP could reduce the need for intubation and mechanical ventilation and the incidence of BPD in premature infants.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p><p>Recently, Kirpalani <italic>et al</italic>. conducted a study to compare the effects of NIPPV and NCPAP as the first respiratory support during the first 28 days of life and found that 33.9% of newborns in the NIPPV group and 31% of newborns in the NCPAP group experienced BPD. The frequency of air leak syndromes, NEC and duration of respiratory support were not significantly different between groups.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] We also found no significant difference in the rates of BPD and other neonatal morbidities between groups.</p><p>The second category of studies was assessed the effectiveness of NIPPV for prevention of respiratory failure after extubation.</p><p>Friedlich, <italic>et al</italic>. compared the incidence of respiratory failure after extubation in preterm newborns randomized to take either NCPAP or nasopharyngeal synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (NP-SIMV) and found that postextubation respiratory failure was significantly lower in the NP-SIMV group.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</p><p>Recently, Kahramaner <italic>et al</italic>. have reported that using unsynchronized NIPPV is better than NCPAP for prevention of extubation failure in preterm newborns.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</p><p>The third category of studies evaluated the effects of NIPPV for treatment of apnea in preterm infants. Ryan <italic>et al</italic>. compared the effects of NCPAP and aminophylline versus NIPPV alone for management of idiopathic apnea in preterm infants and concluded that NIPPV had no advantage over NCPAP.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] Lin <italic>et al</italic>. showed that NIPPV is more efficient than NCPAP for prevention of recurrent apnea in premature infants.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</p><p>However, the length of hospital stay and duration of ventilation therapy did not differ significantly between groups.</p><p>Although there are few studies evaluated success rate of NIPPV as an initial mode of RDS management and for treatment of apnea of prematurity, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that assessed the success rate of NIPPV for treatment of CPAP failure as an alternative to mechanical ventilation.</p><p>Our study had some limitations. First of all, we did not categorize newborns on the basis of severity of respiratory problem and Apgar score. Therefore, we had relatively high rate of NIPPV failure. If we were excluded infants with very severe RDS and very low Apgar score the failure rate may be decreased.</p><p>Secondly, we did not assess short term complications of intubation such as the severity of pain, bradycardia, laryngeal trauma and long-term complications such as hoarseness and subglottic stenosis in newborns who required mechanical ventilation. In addition, this study is a pilot study with small sample size. Therefore, the lack of significant differences in the rate of complications between two groups may be due to this constraint. In addition, the results should be interpreted adequately.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>It appears that NIPPV is a good alternative to invasive mechanical ventilation in premature newborns with respiratory failure. Anyway some infants did not respond to this mode of respiratory support and require mechanical ventilation specially newborns with lower postnatal age at entry to study, lower 5 min Apgar score and newborns who need more frequent doses of surfactant.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENT</title><p>Thanks to all staff and nurses of Shahid Beheshti and Alzahra University Hospital,
