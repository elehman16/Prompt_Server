Evidence from molecular animal research and epidemiologic investigations indicate that calcium intake may have an influence on body composition, weight and insulin resistance. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of calcium supplementation on body composition, weight, insulin resistance and blood pressure in the face of calorie restriction in obese adults.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>METHODS:</title><p>A double blind randomized placebo-controlled trial on 40 adults with Body Mass Index &#x0003e; 25kg/m<sup>2</sup> was conducted. Subjects were maintained for 24 weeks on a balanced deficit diet (-500 kcal/d deficit) and randomly assigned into two groups with 1000 mg ca/d as calcium carbonate or placebo.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>RESULTS:</title><p>There were no significant differences in variables at the 12th and 24th week between the two groups. The lean mass showed no significant increase in the calcium group at the 12th week compared to baseline and in placebo group at the 24th week compared to the 12th week. The insulin concentration showed a significant decrease in the calcium group at the 12th week compared to the baseline (p &#x0003c; 0.05). The diastolic blood pressure had a significant decrease at the 24th week compared to the 12th week in both groups (p = 0.013-0.009).</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>Results from this study suggest that 24 weeks of supplementation with 1000 mg ca/d did not have any effect on weight, body composition, insulin resistance and blood pressure beyond what can be achieved in an energy restricted diet in obese adults.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Calcium Supplement</kwd><kwd>Insulin Resistance</kwd><kwd>Body Composition</kwd><kwd>Obesity</kwd><kwd>Weight Loss</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>According to the WHO&#x02019;s projections in 2005 nearly 1.6 billion adults were overweight and at least 400 million adults were obese in world.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT1">1</xref> While obesity is related to multiple disease outcomes,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT2">2</xref> it is also a risk factor for certain chronic diseases,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT3">3</xref> such as diabetes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT1">1</xref></p><p>Diet has been reported as a major contributor to alarming prevalence of obesity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT5">5</xref></p><p>Attempts for ameliorating obesity have concentrated on balancing energy as core factor involved in the obesity epidemic through calorie restriction and exercise. Calorie control usually include macronutrients counting example low fat, low-carbohydrate, or high protein diet.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT6">6</xref> But neither the percentage of calorie from fat, carbohydrate, or protein, nor the type of them seem to be important.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT7">7</xref> But by following the above-mentioned strategy, still the role of micronutrients in energy balance and the precise metabolic pathway remains unclear,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT6">6</xref> in spite of a growing body of recent evidence that has emerged in support of an &#x0201c;antiobesity&#x0201d; effect of dietary calcium and dairy products.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT8">8</xref></p><p>An accumulating body of recent animal data suggests that dietary calcium and dairy products, in particular, may have a pivotal role on fat cell metabolism in a way that greater weight loss can occur despite an identical calorie intake. In this case, intracellular calcium plays a critical role in the metabolism of the adiposyte.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT7">7</xref> Increasing dietary calcium without energy restriction may also facilitate a repartitioning of dietary energy from adipose tissue to lean body mass, resulting in a net reduction in fat mass and adiposity, in both mice and humans. In addition, increasing dietary calcium intake during energy restriction accelerates augmentation of body weight loss and fat loss in both mice and humans.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT9">9</xref></p><p>These results are supported by epidemiological observations from NHANES III,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT10">10</xref> the Quebec Family Study,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT11">11</xref> the CARDIA Study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT12">12</xref> and the HERITAGE Family Study.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT13">13</xref></p><p>Several human studies have reported negative relations between high calcium intake and some obesity comorbidities, such as hypertension, diabetes and insulin resistance, and other studies showed an inverse association between calcium intake and body weight, body fat and the risk of becoming obese.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT11">11</xref></p><p>Animal models have shown the mechanism of how low calcium intakes could affect body fat stores.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT11">11</xref> The increase in circulating calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D), which occurs in response to low-calcium diets, stimulates adiposytes via a specific membrane vitamin D receptor to increase influx of calcium across the adipocyte membrane. As a consequence, increase in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> exerts a coordinated regulatory effect on adipocyte lipogenic and lipolytic system, serving to stimulate lipogenic gene expression and lipogenesis and to inhibit lipolysis, lead to increase of lipid storage and adiposity. Furthermore, calcitriol also acts using the nuclear vitamin D receptor to inhibit the expression of adipocyte uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2), thereby limiting mitochondrial fatty acid transport and oxidation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT14">14</xref></p><p>In contrast, a rise in dietary calcium induces a suppression of calcitriol levels, resulting in reduced lipogenic gene expression and increase in lipolyesis and UCP2 expression, thereby reducing lipid storage and adiposity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT10">10</xref> But, dairy sources of calcium exert significantly greater effects than calcium supplement, and this augmented effect of dairy products related to calcium supplement is likely due to the other bioactive compounds, such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, which are found in dairy, which may act synergistically with calcium to attenuate adiposity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT9">9</xref></p><p>The above-mentioned conflicting findings reveal a demand for further investigation in the context of dietary calcium intake and obesity, fat mass and insulin resistance. Thus, the present study was performed to investigate the relationship between calcium supplement intake and obesity, fat mass, insulin resistance and blood pressure, secondary to energy-restriction diets, producing an energy deficit of 500 kcal/d.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-1"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title/><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Study Design</title><p>This study was designed as a randomized placebo-controlled, double-blind trial to determine whether calcium supplementation accompanied with calcium carbonate will accelerate weight and fat loss and decrease the insulin and glucose concentrations and blood pressure induced by caloric restriction in 40 obese adults.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-2"><title>Subjects</title><p>Subjects were recruited to participate by placing advertisements in the Iran University of Medical Science.</p><p>One hundred overweight and obese adults were initially enrolled to participate.

Azadbakht et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT29">29</xref> in another observational study on 827 adults aged from 18 to 74 years observed that dairy consumption was inversely associated with the risk of having metabolic syndrome, which seems somewhat attributed to the calcium. Mennen et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT30">30</xref> in a study which was performed by FFQ on 2537 women and 2439 men concluded that high consumption of bread or dairy products may be related to the risk of metabolic syndrome in men. But because they did not have related data on all major types of the food consumed by the subjects it cannot be concluded that a high consumption of bread or dairy products is a marker of consumption of something else.</p><p>Devies et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT31">31</xref> and Heaney et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT33">33</xref> have reevaluated data from nine studies, including three controlled trials and six observational studies, about calcium intake in which body weight could be assessed as a secondary outcome. They found, significant negative associations between calcium intake and body weight, body fat and/or weight gain.</p><p>In addition to the clinical and epidemiological data, data from animal studies also suggest an effect of calcium on weight. Papakonstantinou et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT34">34</xref> reported that rats fed a high calcium diet which was also supplemented with milk protein had 29% less carcass fat. This was contradicted by similar studies in lean and obese mice and rats reported by Zhang and Tordoff.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT35">35</xref> They could not confirm the positive effects of calcium on body weight or carcass fat content in obese and normal weight rats. This explanation might also apply to other animal studies. Zemel et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT10">10</xref> have reported in a study on mice overexpressing the agouti gene. They documented that dietary calcium supplementation produced a dose-related diminution in weight gain and fat mass.</p><p>A relation between calcium intake and blood pressure has been reported from observational studies in a variety of population,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT36">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT38">38</xref> typically showing a fall in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure of about 0.4 mm Hg for increase of 100 mg in daily calcium intake.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT39">39</xref> All studies that have found a beneficial effect of calcium on blood pressure have been less than 6 months in duration, which suggests that the hypotensive effect of calcium is real, but transient. Griffith et al,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT40">40</xref> who performed a meta-analysis of the effect of calcium on blood pressure, found a small statistically significant effect of calcium on lowering systolic blood pressure independent of baseline blood pressure, and a small trend toward reduction in diastolic blood pressure that did not reach statistical significance. Another important finding has to do with their prior hypothesis is that dietary and nondietary intervention may differ in their effects on blood pressure reduction.</p><p>One of the possible physiological mechanisms for the effect of calcium intake on fat mass is by the calcitrophic hormones, PTH and 1,25 (OH) 2D. Both PTH and 1,25 (OH) 2D have been proposed to decrease fat breakdown and to increase fat synthesis, potentially through increases in the amount of intracellular calcium in adipocytes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT10">10</xref> Dairy sources of calcium exerted significantly greater antiobesity effects when compared with a supplemental calcium carbonate in each of these studies, consistent with the clinical results presented here. Although the additional factors in the dairy responsible for this effect have not been identified yet, but it has been recently suggested that milk is recognized as a rich source of bioactive compounds<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT41">41</xref> that may also act independently or synergistically with the calcium to suppression of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 to favorably affect nutrient portioning, metabolic efficiency, and fat loss.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT42">42</xref></p><p>The above-mentioned discrepancies between different studies may possibly be related to the different amounts of calcium supplement prescribed in different groups, participated in the reviewed studies in this paper, or can be related to the period of supplementation, or both, which all can be evaluated as important factors. For example, discrepancy between many of these studies and the present one about change in body composition is related to the different tools which were used for the assessments. In the present study, body composition assessed by bioelectrical impedance, while others used DEXA.</p><p>On the other hand there should be a possibility of a threshold effect that is, if the calcium intake is &#x0003c; 600 mg daily [such a threshold is suggested by the Quebec Family Study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT11">11</xref>], then weight loss might be diminished.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT7">7</xref> It is possible that calcium enhances weight and fat loss best when individuals have very low baseline intakes (&#x0003c; 500 mg/d).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT28">28</xref> However, Shapses et al found no effect of calcium supplement on weight and fat losses in two groups of women regardless of baseline calcium intake, with some subjects consuming ~700 mg/d of calcium at the baseline, and others using up to ~1000 mg/d, which suggests, there is no threshold effect for usual calcium intake.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT22">22</xref></p><p>It is not clear how these factors contribute to the different studies, which lead to different results. Following this question is suggested to be considered in further research plans.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion the major present findings reveal that a calorie restricted diet with intake of 1 g/d calcium supplementation as the carbonate, for 24 weeks does not significantly lead to alteration in body weight, fat and lean mass. It was found that blood pressure, glucose and insulin concentrations and HOMA-IR and QUICKI between two groups were not significantly different beyond what can be achieved in a behavioral weight loss intervention.</p><p>This was not a short term trial and the length of the study was logical and suitable; however, more longitudinal studies suggested to be conducted in future. Different studies had shown the importance of longitudinal clinical trials.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT43">43</xref></p><p>The strengths of this study include: a six month follow up, a low drop-out rate (15%), and a randomized double-blind controlled trial design. Also comparing with the other studies, subjects in the present study were on a calorie restricted approach. The weakness of this study was the lack of measurement of skinfold thickness.</p><p>But more controlled clinical trial with sufficient numbers of participants are needed to establish whether there is a casual association between calcium intake and body weight and they should take possible confounders into consideration, such as gender, ethnicities, age, degree of obesity and habitual intake of calcium or dairy products.</p><p>There is consistent evidence from randomized controlled trials that calcium supplementation slows postmenopausal bone loss,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT44">44</xref> and there is also some evidence that it prevents fractures in postmenopausal women.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT45">45</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT46">46</xref> Other benefits from the use of calcium supplements have been suggested, including effects on colon cancer,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT47">47</xref> and lipoprotein concentration.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT48">48</xref> There is also observational evidence that calcium intake is inversely associated with cardiovascular disease.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT27">27</xref> So, if established that calcium intake causes a decrease in the BMI and body weight, fat mass and HOMA-IR and blood pressure, the use of the calcium supplement or dairy intake leads to prevention of several diseases.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interests</bold></p><p>Authors have no conflict of interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; Contributions</bold></p><p>MSh designed the study, wrote the proposal, participated in data gathering, most of the experiments and data analysis and also prepared the manuscript.
