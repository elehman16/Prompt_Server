The trial will assess the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the REACH-HF intervention in patients with systolic heart failure and impact on the outcomes of their caregivers.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>A parallel two group randomised controlled trial with 1:1 individual allocation to the REACH-HF intervention plus usual care (intervention group) or usual care alone (control group) in 216 patients with systolic heart failure (ejection fraction &#x0003c;45%) and their caregivers. The intervention comprises a self-help manual delivered by specially trained facilitators over a 12-week period. The primary outcome measure is patients&#x02019; disease-specific health-related quality of life measured using the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure questionnaire at 12&#x02005;months&#x02019; follow-up. Secondary outcomes include survival and heart failure related hospitalisation, blood biomarkers, psychological well-being, exercise capacity, physical activity, other measures of quality of life, patient safety and the quality of life, psychological well-being and perceived burden of caregivers at 4, 6 and 12&#x02005;months&#x02019; follow-up. A process evaluation will assess fidelity of intervention delivery and explore potential mediators and moderators of changes in health-related quality of life in intervention and control group patients. Qualitative studies will describe patient and caregiver experiences of the intervention. An economic evaluation will estimate the cost-effectiveness of the REACH-HF intervention plus usual care versus usual care alone in patients with systolic heart failure.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The study is approved by the North West&#x02014;Lancaster Research Ethics Committee (ref 14/NW/1351).

<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> HF is categorised as either HF with reduced ejection fraction (also known as systolic HF or left ventricular systolic dysfunction), or HF with preserved ejection fraction (also known as diastolic HF). Systolic HF is due to impaired left ventricular contraction, which results in a reduced ejection fraction (usually &#x0003c;45%) and diastolic HF is due to stiffness of the ventricle wall delaying filling of the heart chamber.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>Advances in pharmacological therapies and devices (implantable cardioverter defibrillators and biventricular pacing) have been shown to improve physiological parameters and quality of life, reduce symptoms and decrease mortality and readmission rates.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> However, HF continues to have significant negative impacts on the quality of life of patients and their families or caregivers,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> remains a common cause of hospitalisation, and accounts for a substantial personal and economic burden.</p><p>Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is a process by which patients with heart disease, in partnership with health professionals, are encouraged and supported to achieve and maintain optimal physical health.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> A recent Cochrane systematic review including 33 randomised trials in 4740 individuals with HF showed that participation in exercise-based CR was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of overall hospitalisation (relative risk: 0.75; 0.62 to 0.92, p=0.005) and HF-specific hospitalisation (relative risk: 0.61; 0.46 to 0.80, p=0.0004) and important improvements in patient health-related quality of life.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Based on such accumulating evidence, in 2010 the UK National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommended offering CR based on supervised group exercise for patients with systolic and diastolic HF.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Despite this recommendation, a survey in 2012 indicated that few UK centres (16% of those surveyed) had a specific rehabilitation programme for those with HF.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> The UK uptake of rehabilitation for people with HF therefore remains poor.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> A recent European survey on exercise training in HF concluded that &#x02018;too many patients are still denied a highly recommended therapy&#x02019;.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> We believe two key solutions to this poor provision and uptake are the development of a home-based self-help CR manual designed to meet the needs of those with HF and the close involvement of their caregivers.</p><p>The Rehabilitation EnAblement in CHronic Heart Failure (REACH-HF) research programme was designed to develop and evaluate a health professional facilitated home-based self-help manual rehabilitation intervention to improve self-care and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in people with HF and their caregivers.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Aims and hypothesis</title><p>This trial aims to assess the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the addition of the REACH-HF intervention to usual care in patients with systolic HF and their caregivers.

Randomisation numbers will be computer generated and assigned in strict sequence. At the point of randomisation, participants will be assigned the next randomisation number in the sequence. To maintain concealment and minimise selection bias, randomisation will be performed after the baseline visit by a member of Peninsula Clinical Trials Unit (CTU), independent from investigator teams, using a secure, web-based randomisation system.</p></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>Intervention</title><p>The REACH-HF intervention is grounded in the support needs and priorities of people living with HF and the services that provide care for them. A systematic, six-step Intervention Mapping framework<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> guided intervention development, drawing on research evidence, national and international guidelines and stakeholder consultations with patients, caregivers and health professionals to identify &#x02018;targets for change&#x02019;. In line with Intervention Mapping regulatory processes, underpinning target behaviour patterns and evidence-based change techniques were matched to each behaviour-change target.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> A key element of the intervention development process was an active Patient and Public Involvement group consisting of six people with a range of experiences with HF and three caregivers of people with HF. The intervention development process is described in detail elsewhere (CJ Greaves, C Deighan, P Doherty, <italic>et al</italic>. Development of a facilitated self-care and rehabilitation intervention for people with HF and their care givers: Rehabilitation Enablement in Chronic Heart Failure (REACH-HF). Submitted for publication 2015).</p><p>The REACH-HF intervention is a comprehensive self-care support programme comprising the &#x02018;Heart Failure Manual&#x02019; (HF Manual), with a choice of two exercise programmes for patients, a &#x02018;Family and Friends Resource&#x02019; for caregivers, a &#x02018;Progress Tracker&#x02019; tool and a training course for intervention facilitators.</p><p>Participating patients and caregivers will work through the self-help manual over a 12-week period with facilitation by a specially trained intervention facilitator (cardiac nurse or physiotherapist by background), who will help to build the patient's and caregiver's understanding of how to manage HF. The manual includes information and interactive elements covering a wide range of topics relating to living with/adapting to living with HF, and includes four core elements:
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>An exercise training programme, tailored according to initial fitness assessments, delivered as a walking programme or a chair-based exercise DVD, or a combination of the two (the patient's choice);</p></list-item><list-item><p>Managing stress /breathlessness /anxiety;</p></list-item><list-item><p>HF symptom monitoring (and associated help-seeking);</p></list-item><list-item><p>Understanding and taking medications.</p></list-item></list></p><p>Patients will be encouraged to use the progress tracker booklet, which is designed to collect the following information over the period of the intervention: changes in physical and mental state, intensity of exercise and self-reported walking speed, and degree of completion of self-monitoring sections for physical activity, enjoyable activities, frequency of self-weighing (to monitor fluid build-up), and frequency of self-reported use of stress-management techniques. The Family and Friends resource, a manual for use by caregivers, includes advice on providing support, becoming a caregiver, managing caregiver's own health and well-being and getting help.</p><p>As a pragmatic trial of a self-help intervention which is reliant on the willing engagement of recipients, there are no specific strategies to improve participants&#x02019; adherence to intervention protocol. Intervention delivery may be discontinued at any time at the request of a participant or by the intervention facilitator if they determine that the intervention may be the cause of undue harm.</p><p>Adherence to intervention protocols from the perspective of the intervention facilitators will be ascertained through fidelity assessment described herein.</p></sec><sec id="s3f"><title>Usual care</title><p>In accord with findings of our national survey,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> patients with HF typically do not receive CR, despite NICE recommendations.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> The choice of a usual care (no rehabilitation) comparator in the REACH-HF trial is therefore reflective of the situation for the vast majority of patients with HF. In this trial, intervention and control group patients will receive usual medical management for HF according to national and local guidelines, including specialist HF nurse care. The use of care services, including those provided by specialist HF nurses in the community and in secondary care, will be documented at each follow-up through participants&#x02019; completion of healthcare resource use questionnaires and by collection of concomitant medication usage as reported by participants.</p></sec><sec id="s3g"><title>Outcome measures</title><p>Outcome data will be collected at 4, 6 and 12&#x02005;months following the baseline visit (<xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2015009994TB1">table 1</xref>&#x02014;Tabulated summary of study schedule).

To encourage participant retention and completeness of data, participants may claim travel expenses associated with clinic visits and are provided with postage-paid envelopes to return questionnaires by post. Furthermore, visits may be partially conducted at participants&#x02019; homes if mutually convenient for the research nurse and participant. Participants who are unwilling or unable to travel to research assessments or accommodate home visits are excluded at the point of consent.</p><p>At the baseline clinic visit, after written informed consent has been obtained by the research nurse, the following information will be collected:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Medical history (including comorbidities (number and severity scored with Charlson Co-morbidity Index), New York Heart Association class, HF aetiology, concomitant HF medication and presence of implantable HF devices);</p></list-item><list-item><p>Healthcare resource utilisation over the prior 6&#x02005;months;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Sociodemographic information (ie, date of birth, ethnicity, height, weight, employment status, education level, smoking status).</p></list-item></list></p><p>Participating patients will be asked to:

At the 4 and 12-month clinic visits investigators will record details of any changes to participants&#x02019; HF medication or implantable cardiac devices, details of any hospitalisations and healthcare resource utilisation since the previous visit. Investigators will also check that participating patients have not become contraindicated to exercise testing before conducting the incremental shuttle walk test. Blood samples (collected at baseline and 12&#x02005;months only) will be dispatched to a central laboratory (Royal Cornwall Hospital NHS Trust) for determination of NT pro-BNP levels. Accelerometer devices will be returned by participants using postage-paid envelopes after 7&#x02005;days of wearing. The devices will be returned to the CTU for data extraction. Participant safety will be monitored through recording, reporting and review of all serious adverse events collected from baseline until final follow-up visit.</p><p>Data collected at clinic visits will be recorded on study specific case report forms (CRFs) by the research team at each site. Completed CRFs will be checked and signed at the research sites by a member of the research team before being sent to the CTU. Original CRF pages and completed questionnaire booklets will be posted to the CTU at agreed time points for double-data entry in to the study database. Accelerometer data will be imported directly into the study database. All forms and data will be tracked using a web-based trial management system. Double-entered data will be compared for discrepancies according to a data management plan held in CTU. Discrepant data will be verified using the original paper data sheets.</p><p>Participant names and addresses will be collected for the purpose of managing questionnaire dispatch, intervention delivery and participant interviews. Investigators will ensure that the participants&#x02019; anonymity is maintained on all other documents. Within the CTU, anonymised and identifiable study data will be stored separately, to prevent the identification of participants from research records, in locked filing cabinets within a locked office. Electronic records will be stored by the CTU in a web-based, SQL server database, housed on a restricted access, secure server maintained by the University of Plymouth. Data in the database will be backed up daily. The website will be encrypted using SSL. Data will be collected and stored in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998. Direct access to the trial data will be restricted to members of the research team and the CTU, with access granted to the Sponsor on request. Access to the database will be overseen by the CTU data manager and trial manager.</p></sec><sec id="s3j"><title>Process evaluation</title><p>The process evaluation seeks to assess intervention fidelity, patients' and caregivers' experiences of trial participation, and to explore processes that may be responsible for change in the primary outcome of HRQoL (including intermediate changes in secondary outcomes and changes in self-care behaviour patterns of patients receiving the REACH-HF intervention).<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></p><p>Patient and caregivers&#x02019; views on the intervention will also be explored as part of the process evaluation. Five distinct studies comprise the process evaluation as follows:</p><sec id="s3j1"><title>Process evaluation study 1: Intervention fidelity</title><p>A fidelity checklist developed and piloted as part of the REACH-HF programme (CJ Greaves, <italic>et al</italic> Submitted for publication 2015) will be used to assess fidelity of delivery of the intended intervention processes. This will be achieved by analysing recordings of all contacts (telephone and face to face) between intervention facilitators and 20 purposively sampled patient participants. Contacts will be audio recorded by intervention facilitators and the files made accessible to two researchers who were part of the REACH-HF intervention development team (a chartered health psychologist and a registered nurse (by background)) who will complete the checklist while listening to the recordings. The check list is based on the Dreyfus scale.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> This will clarify how well (or otherwise) intervention components are delivered and received and will also allow researchers to describe variability in fidelity of delivery across patients and facilitators.</p></sec><sec id="s3j2"><title>Process evaluation study 2: Experiences of patients</title><p>Interviews with each of 20 patients selected above will be conducted immediately after completion of intervention delivery and again at 12 months after the baseline visit. The interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Interviews will be conducted according to topic guides covering patients&#x02019; engagement with the intervention, their relationship with their facilitator, involvement of family and friends, use of the manual, behavioural change and psychological adjustments to living with HF.</p></sec><sec id="s3j3"><title>Process evaluation study 3: Experiences of caregivers</title><p>Interviews with up to 20 purposively sampled caregivers (including caregivers of patients participating in Study 1) will be conducted at 4 and 12&#x02005;months. Where possible, the patient and the caregiver will be interviewed separately. Topics covered in the interviews will include the caregiver's role before participating in the REACH-HF trial, their engagement with the intervention, the impact of the intervention, the caregiver's relationships with the patient and the facilitator and the ways in which the caregiver has adjusted his/her behaviour as a result of the intervention. The researcher leading the caregiver interviews will work closely with the researcher conducting the patient interviews and will review the topic guide throughout the study so that questions are informed by relevant emerging topics. Interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed verbatim.</p></sec><sec id="s3j4"><title>Process evaluation study 4: Identification of potential outcomes as mediators of effectiveness</title><p>Observed differences in secondary outcomes at intermediate follow-up points (4 and 6&#x02005;months) provide an indicator of change for participants in the intervention and control groups. Such changes may be predictive of the primary outcome of MLHFQ at 12&#x02005;months. Potential intermediate outcomes that may be considered include exercise capacity, psychological well-being, physical activity and self-efficacy for key behaviours including physical activity.</p></sec><sec id="s3j5"><title>Process evaluation study 5: Use of progress trackers to identify patient changes associated with effectiveness</title><p>As described earlier, the REACH-HF Manual includes a progress tracker which intervention patients will be encouraged to use to track their progress including physical activity, mood, symptoms and self-care actions. At the end of the intervention delivery period, copies of the participants&#x02019; progress trackers will be provided to the research team and digitally scanned. This information together with the number of facilitator contacts and total contact time received, will allow characterisation of individual patient engagement in the intervention. To the extent that this is the case, tracker scores can be used to explore potential changes which indicate likelihood of intervention success.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3k"><title>Economic evaluation</title><p>An economic evaluation will be undertaken to estimate the cost-effectiveness of the REACH-HF intervention plus usual care versus usual care alone in patients with systolic HF. Cost-effectiveness analyses will be undertaken using clinical and resource-use data collected within the trial over a 12-month time horizon. The primary perspective will be that of the UK NHS and Personal Social Services, with a broader perspective, addressing partial patient and societal perspective, considered in sensitivity analyses. The primary economic end point will be the quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), using the EQ-5D-5L, over the 12-month follow-up. The economic evaluation will estimate the incremental cost per QALY associated with the REACH-HF intervention.</p><p>The additional (incremental) costs associated with delivery of the HF Manual, when added to usual care, will be estimated using resource use data collected within-trial, and unit costs for resource use from national published or NHS sources. Resource use is expected to consist of time input from REACH-HF facilitators, supervision for facilitators, training costs for facilitators and consumables (eg, booklets). Data on facilitator time input will be captured via facilitator self-report within trial at participant level, using purpose-designed forms.</p><p>Health, social care and other resource use data will be collected within trial at participant level and are collectively regarded as a secondary outcome measure. Resource use data will be used in combination with unit costs to compare health, social care and other resource use between groups, as perspective employed. Data will be collected from participants by self-reported (interviewer administered) participant questionnaire at baseline, 4-month and 12-month time points. Hospitalisation data (events) will be collected as part of &#x02018;adverse event&#x02019; reporting and HF related medication data as reported by patients will be captured by the research nurse at the research clinics.</p></sec><sec id="s3l"><title>Data analysis</title><sec id="s3l1"><title>Primary and secondary outcomes</title><p>All analyses, quantitative and qualitative, will be conducted according to best practise and reported in accordance with Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines for reporting of clinical trials<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> and appropriate guidelines for reporting process evaluations<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> and qualitative research.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Baseline sociodemographic and health-related variables will be reported descriptively by treatment arm, in order to assess whether the inferential analyses require adjustment for any unbalanced variables.</p><p>The primary analyses for all patient and caregiver outcomes will be based on a between-group, intention-to-treat, complete case approach, using data collected at 12&#x02005;months&#x02019; follow-up. The outcomes will be analysed using the regression method appropriate to the data, that is, linear regression modelling for continuous outcomes, survival analysis based on the Cox proportional hazards regression model for time-to-event data, and Tobit regression analysis for EQ-5D-5L. All analyses will adjust for baseline score of the outcome variable (where applicable), as well as minimisation variables previously described, and sociodemographic and health-related variables that are found to be unbalanced at baseline.</p><p>Secondary analyses will be undertaken on patient and caregiver outcomes as repeated measures analysis using all follow-up assessment points (4, 6 and 12&#x02005;months). In addition, a per protocol analysis of the primary outcome will be performed using 12-month follow-up data. A per protocol definition (based on a minimum level of intervention uptake and adherence deemed necessary to achieve improvement in outcomes) will be agreed prior to the start of data analysis. If there is more than 5% loss to follow-up for the primary outcome at 12&#x02005;months, multiple imputation methods will be used as a sensitivity analysis to address the issue of missing data. The following subgroups will be assessed: the stratification variables of trial centre and severity of HF (NT pro-BNP levels), plus time since HF diagnosis and the inclusion (or not) of a caregiver.</p><p>The potential for differential intervention effects within patient subgroups (ie, moderation by patient characteristics) will be explored using interactions within linear regression modelling for the primary outcome only. Mediation analyses will be used to assess the extent to which secondary outcomes at intermediate follow-up (eg, self-efficacy or physical activity levels at 4&#x02005;months) or progress tracker self-care behaviours (eg, self-reported exercise, stress or anxiety management activities) can explain between-group differences in the primary outcome at 12&#x02005;months. Moderation and mediation analyses will be exploratory in nature as no formal power calculation for interaction effects has been performed.</p><p>Serious adverse events will be presented descriptively by treatment arm.</p><p>All between group outcome results will be presented as means and 95% CIs. No correction of p values for multiplicity of testing will be undertaken. However, the primary outcome (MLHFQ at 12&#x02005;months) analysis will be performed before all other analyses and the p values of all subsequent analyses interpreted in the context of multiple testing. No interim analyses will be performed. All analyses will be conducted by a statistician who is blinded to treatment arm, using Stata V.12.</p></sec><sec id="s3l2"><title>Economic outcomes</title><p>Means (and SDs) for resource use and costs will be presented for baseline assessment, and for resource use over the 12-month follow-up period. Regression methods will be used to estimate mean costs per group and to compare mean costs between treatment and control groups. MLHFQ data will be drawn from the main statistical analyses. QALY data will be derived from trial data on EQ-5D-5L, using a UK algorithm/tariff, in the first instance those derived from Dolan<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> (via van-Hout <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>; although it is expected that a UK tariff will be published at the time of analysis), for the 5-level EQ-5D).

At 4&#x02005;months, patients&#x02019; engagement with, response to and use of the REACH-HF Manual will be characterised and differences between patients noted. At 12&#x02005;months overall use of and benefit derived from the REACH-HF manual, and maintenance of self-care behaviours and coping skills will be characterised and linked to individual differences in 4-month responses.
