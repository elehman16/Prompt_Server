The effects of diet on cardiometabolic risk factors have been studied extensively. Healthy eating as a cost-effective approach to risk reduction in post-myocardial infarction patients is proven to be beneficial, and the &#x0201c;plate model&#x0201d; is one of the practical methods to achieve this objective.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p id="Par2">The study will be conducted as a randomized, single-blind, controlled clinical trial for a period of 3&#x000a0;months. A total of 120 overweight (body mass index &#x0003e;23&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>) inpatients (aged 20&#x02013;70 years) with a history of troponin-positive acute coronary syndrome (ACS) within the 1&#x000a0;month preceding the study will be recruited. Simple randomization will be used in participant allocation. The intervention group will receive the model plate diet. The control group will be provided with routine dietary advice. Other domains, such as advice on exercise and lifestyle modification, will be equalized among patients in both the groups. The visits and evaluations will be done at recruitment (visit 0), 4&#x000a0;weeks, and 12&#x000a0;weeks after the intervention. The primary outcome will be a mean body weight reduction of 10%, and the secondary outcomes will include mean reduction of systolic and diastolic blood pressure, improvement of anthropometric parameters, and improvement of lipid profile and liver enzymes in the test group compared with the control group at 12&#x000a0;weeks following the plate model diet.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">This study protocol is designed to establish the effects of the plate model diet on modification of cardiometabolic risk factors in patients with ACS. This will also be a pioneering study designed to investigate the practicality of the model plate in local settings and in the South Asian region.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par4">Sri Lanka Clinical Trials Registry identifier: SLCTR/2016/22.

Current data on the global impact of CVD show that the highest mortality due to CVD will occur predominantly in developing countries in the next decade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. An estimated 17.5 million people died as a result of CVD in 2012, representing 31% of all global deaths. Of these deaths, an estimated 7.6 million were due to coronary heart disease. More than three-fourths of CVD-related deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. According to another systematic review, the global burden of ischemic heart disease (IHD) increased by 29 million disability-adjusted life-years (a 29% increase) between 1990 and 2010 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par26">There are two approaches to the prevention of CVD, and they are population-wide and individual [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The expected goals of CVD morbidity and mortality reduction can be accomplished only through a combination of both approaches. Although large-scale studies have shown effective strategies to prevent CVD-related deaths in the past decade, most of the evidence was accumulated from the developed regions of the world. Hence, there is a need to conduct studies in different geographic regions, diverse cultures, and various ethnicities to address the paucity of high-quality data in developing countries. The INTERHEART study is a good example of a study with broader geographic and ethnic representation. INTERHEART, representing every inhabited continent, has provided a multitude of relevant data on a global scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The INTERHEART researchers have studied the association of a selection of nine risk factors for myocardial infarction (MI) and their population attributable risk. Their study showed that abnormal lipid levels, smoking, hypertension, diabetes, abdominal obesity, psychosocial factors, alcohol use, reduced consumption of fruits and vegetables, and lack of regular physical activity account for most of the risk of MI worldwide in both sexes and in all age groups in all regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par27">As a &#x0201c;best buyer,&#x0201d; the WHO recommends healthy eating to be one of the most cost-effective preventive strategies on an individual basis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Reduction of salt and fat in the diet and consumption of fruits and vegetables have long been known to yield protective effects on the heart for both primary and secondary prevention of CVD. The investigators in the Lyon heart study examined 605 patients aged 55&#x02013;80 years with previous MI and found that the benefits of the Mediterranean diet could be extended to the secondary prevention of CVD. Those who followed the Mediterranean diet had a 50% to 70% lower risk of recurrent heart disease compared with those who followed a diet similar to the American Heart Association (AHA) Step-1 diet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The combination of diet and statin treatment in preventing cardiovascular events was studied by Pitsavos et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], and they observed a synergistic effect of a combination of the Mediterranean diet with statin treatment on coronary risk. In particular, they observed that the aforementioned combination was associated with a 43% reduction in coronary risk, independent of cholesterol levels and other cardiovascular factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. According to a hospital-based case-control study conducted in India, a significant dose-dependent inverse association between vegetable intake and IHD risk exists. The inverse association was stronger for green leafy vegetables, and persons consuming a median of 3.5 servings of green leafy vegetables per week had a 67% lower relative risk than did those consuming 0.5 serving per week [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par28">Dietary patterns in Sri Lanka are changing at a faster pace than ever because of rapidly evolving urbanization. Consequently, the last 2 decades have seen a threefold increase in the level of obesity among Sri Lankan adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In 2010, it was reported that the prevalence rates of overweight, obese, and centrally obese people in Sri Lanka were 25.2%, 9.2%, and 26.2%, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Obesity-associated metabolic diseases also have reached epidemic proportions in Sri Lanka. The prevalence of metabolic syndrome is 25% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], hypertension approximately 20% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], and dysglycemia 21% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. These comorbid factors invariably increase health care expenditures of obese persons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In 2014, noncommunicable diseases accounted for 75% of the total deaths in Sri Lanka, of which CVD-related deaths alone accounted for 40% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. According to a study conducted in Sri Lanka, a substantial proportion of the adult population fails to follow recommended dietary guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Almost 70% of those studied exceeded the recommendations for starch intake; in contrast, the daily intake of fruit (0.43 servings/day) and vegetable portions (1.73 servings/day) fell well below national recommendations, with only 3.5% of adults consuming the recommended five portions of fruits and vegetables per day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Thus, Sri Lankans consume over 70% of their calories as carbohydrates (mainly refined), whereas only 10% of calories are derived from protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. This is not surprising, because rice is the main staple food in Sri Lanka [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Hence, cutting down the amount of rice per meal might be a solution to the problem of excessive intake of refined carbohydrates and energy.</p><p id="Par29">Using a &#x0201c;model plate&#x0201d; is one of the practical methods to reduce the average portion size of staple food in main meals, which also could ensure the sufficient intake of vegetables and protein foods simultaneously. Food and nutrition experts recommend the &#x0201c;plate model&#x0201d; to control the rice portion and to replace it with nonstarch vegetables [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The local [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and international [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] expert evidence supports the plate model for the promotion of healthy eating, whose aim is at dietary calorie reduction and redistribution of macronutrients in a healthier manner. By devising the plate model, one can ensure an increased intake of complex carbohydrates from dark green leafy salads and nonstarchy vegetables as well as high fiber from whole grain, thus lowering the glycemic load in food. Dietary fiber intake reduces chronic inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], which is one of the postulated pathophysiologies of atherosclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Increased consumption of vegetables ensures the high intake of beta-carotene, vitamins C and E, polyphenols, and minerals, which are vital in sustaining bodily functions. Furthermore, increased intake of plant sterols and stanols decreases the absorption of cholesterol and thereby reduces serum cholesterol levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], particularly low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p id="Par30">Although evidence exists to guide the diet of patients in post-MI rehabilitation, the lack of standard guidelines in Sri Lanka has led clinicians to commence their patients on various untested dietary schedules. Therefore, scientific evaluation of the effects of a balanced diet with the use of a plate model and its impact on coronary risk factor modification needs to be assessed locally as well as globally. In the present study protocol, we are trying to depict the method of one such study to evaluate the effects of a plate model diet on modification of selected cardiometabolic risk factors in post-MI patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Objectives and hypothesis</title><p id="Par31">The aim of the present study is to evaluate the effects of a plate model on modification of selected cardiometabolic risk factors in patients with a history of MI. Our hypothesis is that intake of a healthy diet using the model plate will improve coronary risk factors with an expected mean weight reduction by 10% in the test group after adopting the plate model diet for a period of 12&#x000a0;weeks and reduction of total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, total cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein (HDL) ratio, blood pressure (BP), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) compared with the control group.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par32">This proposed study is an interventional, randomized, single-blind study with parallel subject allocation of patients with a history of troponin-positive acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

A 10% hypothesized difference of participants&#x02019; body weight between the control and intervention groups following the plate model diet at the end of 12&#x000a0;weeks is taken as the primary outcome when calculating the sample size. Because the other biochemical parameters (BP, lipid profile, fasting blood sugar [FBS], and ALT) are prone to vary with medication and compliance with medication, they were not regarded in sample size calculations. A subsequent 5% withdrawal rate and another 15% loss to follow-up (total of 20%) are accounted for in the calculation.

In this article, we present a study protocol designed to evaluate the effects of the plate model as part of dietary intervention to modify cardiometabolic risk factors in post-MI patients over a period of 3&#x000a0;months. To the best of our knowledge, this will be the pioneering dietary interventional study in Sri Lanka and the South Asian region. Overall, this study would provide insight into the extent to which the plate model diet could be applied at the ground level in Sri Lanka. It is likely to uncover possible constraints that hinder the outcome of the results, such as economic barriers, myths and beliefs, lack of affordability, and unavailability of different foods. We believe that the plate model method is a simpler and more effective way of introducing meal planning that is an alternative to the traditional way of exchange-based teaching and meal planning. In this visual method, the plate serves as a pie chart depicting the proportions of the plate that should be covered by various foods. Camelon et al., who conducted the Diabetes Atherosclerosis Intervention Study, explained that this method could be practiced with patients to reinforce the connection between dietary theory and practice, promotion of memory retention, and use of a positive approach to nutrition counseling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p id="Par82">Acknowledging the limitations of the study, present studies show that using the IPAQ-SF may affect the outcome of the data because the correlation of the level of physical activity with objective methods of assessment was less than the acceptable standards [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Furthermore, the social desirability bias may affect the responses given to the FFQ, which is further confounded by the fact that patients with chronic diseases tend to receive a multitude of information from different sources on a daily basis, which may in turn affect their responses. Therefore, weight reduction over time has been chosen as the primary outcome, which is an objective measurement.</p><p id="Par83">Finally, this study will provide insights into a practical model of dietary intervention that could be further developed by future studies to evaluate the long-term effects on morbidity and mortality of patients with CVD. The effectiveness of the model plate and its practicality in other populations with chronic diseases has to be evaluated.</p><sec id="Sec31"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par84">Recruiting.</p></sec></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec32"><title>Additional file</title><p id="Par92">
