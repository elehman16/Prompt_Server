stretching methods for proper swings in order to examine the effects of stretching
exercises on golf swings. [Subjects] The subjects were 20 amateur golf club members who
were divided into two groups: an experimental group which performed stretching, and a
control group which did not. The subjects had no bone deformity, muscle weakness, muscle
soreness, or neurological problems. [Methods] A swing analyzer and a ROM measuring
instrument were used as the measuring tools. The swing analyzer was a GS400-golf hit ball
analyzer (Korea) and the ROM measuring instrument was a goniometer (Korea). [Results] The
experimental group showed a statistically significant improvement in driving distance.
After the special stretching training for golf, a statistically significant difference in
hit-ball direction deviation after swings were found between the groups. The experimental
group showed statistically significant decreases in hit ball direction deviation. After
the special stretching training for golf, statistically significant differences in
hit-ball speed were found between the groups. The experimental group showed significant
increases in hit-ball speed. [Conclusion] To examine the effects of a special stretching
program for golf on golf swing-related factors, 20 male amateur golf club members
performed a 12-week stretching training program. After the golf stretching training,
statistically significant differences were found between the groups in hit-ball driving
distance, direction deviation, deflection distance, and speed.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Special composite stretching exercises</kwd><kwd>Golf swing</kwd><kwd>Posture</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Among the physical strength factors that support golfers&#x02019; athletic performance, muscular
strength, muscular power, muscular endurance, flexibility, balance, cardiopulmonary
endurance, and adroitness are considered important. These physical strength factors are
known to be essential factors for improving athletic performance and preventing sport
injuries. Muscular strength increases through physical strength training, and it has been
reported to increase driver shot driving distance and improve golf accuracy<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Stretching actively or passively stretches muscles, joints, and tendons to enhance
flexibility and reduce the possibility of injuries, thereby contributing to the efficiency
of muscular exertion and the acquisition of high degrees of skills. A general principle of
stretching is increasing muscle lengths to extend the muscle beyond its natural state. To
improve flexibility, muscles should be extended more than their normal lengths by at least
10%<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Since injuries are the most
important problem for players of golf, paying more attention to injuries and learning
correct golf stretching are considered very important for many people who enjoy golf to
minimize their risk of injuries while maximizing their skills.</p><p>In the present study, therefore, stretching exercises were performed by the subjects in
order to examine their effects on golf swing-related factors that can be easily influenced
by continuous and long-term repetitive movements, unstable postures, and excessive force.
The study goal was to examine the effectiveness of stretching exercises for improved swing.
The study investigated stretching for a safer golf swing compared to present stretching
methods for a proper swing in order to examine the effects of stretching exercises on golf
swings.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects were 20 amateur golf club members who were divided into two groups: an
experimental group of 10 subjects performed stretching, and a control group of 10 subjects
who did not. The subjects had no bone deformity, muscle weakness, muscle soreness, or
neurological problems. The experimental and control groups had average ages of 46.20&#x000b1;6.39
and 44.90&#x000b1;6.12&#x02005;years, heights of 174.50&#x000b1;3.81&#x02005;cm and 174.40&#x000b1;4.57&#x02005;cm, weights of 79.50&#x000b1;9.02&#x02005;kg
and 76.10&#x000b1;7.23&#x02005;kg, and BMI of 26.13&#x000b1;3.16&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup> and 25.03&#x000b1;2.32&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup>,
respectively. All the subjects understood the purpose of this study and provided their
written informed consent prior to their participation in the study in accordance with the
ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.</p><p>A swing analyzer and a ROM measuring instrument were used as measuring tools. The swing
analyzer was a GS400-golf hit-ball analyzer (Korea) and the ROM measuring instrument was a
goniometer (Korea). The measured items were driving distance, hit-ball direction, biased
distance of hit-balls, and ball speed after swings. They were measured three times and their
average values were used in the analysis. Special composite stretching programs were
designed to be suitable for golf events. They followed in the same pattern but were tailored
to individual differences. Static stretching and PNF stretching were performed but dynamic
stretching was not. Excessive stretching to a painful extent was avoided and stretching was
performed slowly so that pain could be subjectively endured. The stretching duration range
was 15&#x02013;30 seconds. Each muscle group was repeatedly stretched 3&#x02013;5 times. To enhance
flexibility, the stretching program was implemented for at least 12 weeks. Every time
stretching was performed, the agonistic muscles and the antagonistic muscles were stretched
in turn.</p><p>The study data were processed using the SAS Win 18.0 statistics package. The means and
standard deviations of the swing-related variables were calculated for each item. Two-way
repeated ANOVAs (2&#x000d7;4) was conducted to examine measyrement differences between groups and
between time points. When there were interactions, the groups and time points were
separately classified and the dependent t-test was conducted to examine differences between
groups. One-way ANOVA was conducted to examine differences between time points. The
significance level in all analyses was p=0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>With regard to changes in driving distance by group after the 12-week composite stretching

to the accuracy of impact. Therefore, to improve driving distance and accuracy, an accurate
impact is essential. Most golfers try to make an accurate impact during the golf swing.
However, doing so repeatedly is difficult because of the opposite rotary movements of the
body segments during the back swing and the down swing, and the mobility of the trunk and
the arm joints. Therefore, a golf swing requires effective coordinated movements of various
body segments and the maintenance of body balance<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. For accurate impact during a golf swing, movements throughout all
sections of the golf swing should be made in harmony<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. In particular, extensive rotary movements are required to hit the
golf ball with the golf club in the impact section of the down swing, for which many trunk
muscles are mobilized. If the trunk muscles are mobilized to contract excessively or if the
muscles on one side contract more than those on the other side, the swing will be inaccurate
and the accuracy of the impact will be reduced<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>A golf swing requires sufficient muscular strength and flexibility. Since the force applied
to the waist at the moment of impact is as large as eight times the body weight, harmony
between the muscular strength necessary to endure the force and the appropriate flexibility
is essential. If muscular strength and flexibility are in harmony with each other, the ball
driving distance and accuracy will be improved and injuries due to sudden muscle contraction
will be prevented<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In a previous study of three types of 8-week training (muscular strength training, muscular
strength and flexibility training, and flexibility training), all three groups trained for
approximately 40 minutes per session, three times per week, and they all showed improvements
in overall health condition and club speed. However, only the group that performed
stretching exercises showed a very large improvement in flexibility with an average increase
in ROM of 24%. All the participants recorded lower course scores and longer driving
distances and were not injured in the next season<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Consistent use of muscles can be regarded as an essential element of an efficient golf
swing. The upper limb muscles and the trunk muscles are considered very important for the
golf swing. Improved accuracy and driving distance of the golf swing can be achieved through
coordination of these muscles.</p><p>After implementing the stretching, statistically significant changes were observed in golf
swing-related factors such as hit ball driving distance, hit ball direction deviation, hit
ball deflection distance, and hit ball speed. Therefore, we consider the stretching
exercises were beneficial for the swing patterns of the amateur golfers.</p><p>Enforce the combination of warm up and stretching for 7 days, there was significant
difference for hamstring flexibility<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.
The targeted 40 people (male student) of healthy body are tested to active individual muscle
stretching on right leg. Flexibility is significantly increased and it is improved the
muscle strength output<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The present study, increase the ROM and the ball speed when performed a special composite
to amateur golf players.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Park</surname><given-names>YM</given-names></name><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>ES</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>The influence of left back swing reinforcement training on
