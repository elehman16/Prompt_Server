To achieve these hypotensive techniques are widely used in anesthesia.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Clonidine, which is widely being accepted as anesthetic adjuvant acts by a central &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> adrenergic mechanism reducing sympathetic nervous system output. Besides its antihypertensive effect, it also diminishes requirements for inhaled anesthetics and enhances the effects of sedative, anxiolytic, and analgesic drugs,[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] decreases pressor response to laryngoscopy and intubation,[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] postoperative nausea, vomiting[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and shivering.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>So, this study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of intravenous (IV) clonidine premedication for bloodless surgical field in patients undergoing middle ear or nasal surgery in three different doses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>After approval from the Institutional Ethical Committee, written informed consent was obtained from 90 normotensive patients (American Society of Anesthesiologists I/II), aged 18&#x02013;60 years, of either sex, undergoing routine middle ear or nasal surgery. Patients with heart disease, porphyria, liver or kidney dysfunction, history of allergy, obesity (weight &#x0003e;80 kg), pregnant and lactating women were excluded from the study. Patients were assigned to three groups of 30 each. Group A received IV clonidine 3 &#x000b5;g/kg while Groups B and C received IV clonidine 4 &#x000b5;g/kg and 5 &#x000b5;g/kg respectively, 15 min prior to induction of anesthesia. Two separate IV access were secured. Intraoperative monitoring was done through electrocardiograph, pulse-oximeter for saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>), noninvasive blood pressure monitor, and capnograph for measuring end-tidal carbondioxide (EtCO<sub>2</sub>) using Philips MP30 monitor. Patients were premedicated with IV ranitidine 50 mg, ondansetron 4 mg, midazolam 1 mg along with IV clonidine 3, 4, and 5 &#x000b5;g/kg according to group assigned. Following preoxygenation for 3 min, anesthesia was induced with IV fentanyl 2 &#x000b5;g/kg and thiopentone 5 mg/kg. Tracheal intubation was facilitated with suxamethonium 2 mg/kg. Anesthesia was maintained with O<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O 50:50, isoflurane up to 1.5 Vol% to maintain EtCO<sub>2</sub> between 30 and 40 mmHg. Atracurium 0.5 mg/kg bolus followed by 0.5 mg/kg/h infusion was administered to maintain neuromuscular blocked. Fluid replacement was based on 4.2.1 rule. To aid in achieving a bloodless surgical field, the patients were placed in a 15&#x000b0; flower position, and the surgeons were asked to inject 1% lidocaine with epinephrine 1:100,000 solution at the surgical site before tissue dissection.</p><p>The surgical time was defined as "time from the first infiltration of local anesthetic to the completion of mucosal or skin closure". The hypotensive period commenced 10 min after the start of surgery till the surgeon's request for no hypotension required any longer. The hemodynamic endpoint of anesthetic management was the maintenance of mean blood pressure (MBP) at 60&#x02013;70 mmHg for producing bloodless surgical field. Direct control of MBP was attained with inspired concentration increments of isoflurane up to maximum of 1.5 Vol % as needed. After 10 min if it was unsuccessful, IV fentanyl 1 &#x000b5;g/kg was added. If both the drugs failed to provide the desirable hypotension, IV metoprolol 0.5 mg was given and repeated as required to a maximum dose of 5 mg. If MBP decreased to &#x0003c;50 mmHg, isoflurane was reduced by 0.25%, to a maximum of 0.5%. If hypotension still persisted, a fluid bolus of 250 ml was infused over 15 min and was repeated as necessary.</p><p>On completion of surgery, nitrous oxide and isoflurane were discontinued, and lungs were ventilated with 100% oxygen. Residual neuromuscular blockade was antagonized with neostigmine 2.5 mg and glycopyrrolate 0.5 mg and trachea were extubated following usual extubation criteria. Heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), MBP, SpO<sub>2</sub>, and EtCO<sub>2</sub> were recorded before premedication, baseline value, just after premedication, 5 min after premedication, 10 min after premedication, during laryngoscopy and intubation, 3 min after laryngoscopy and intubation, 5 min after laryngoscopy and intubation, every 5 min interval till first 30 min, thereafter at every 10 min interval throughout the surgery.</p><p>During the hypotensive period, the surgeons were asked every 15 min to rate the bleeding severity score according to the six-point scoring scale:[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>
