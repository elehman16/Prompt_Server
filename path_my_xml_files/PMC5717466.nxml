The presence of symptoms usually suggests locally advanced or metastatic disease <xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. The estimated incidence of urinary retention in patients with advanced prostate cancer is nearly 13.0% <xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Besides acute urinary retention (AUR), chronic urinary retention, bladder stones, and hydronephrosis are the most frequent complications of locally advanced prostate cancer <xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Avoiding further complications, curing retention, and improving the health-related quality of life of these patients are often the main aims of treatment.</p><p id="p0010">There are various treatment options for LUTS/urinary retention including: minimally invasive procedures (stents, laser, etc.), catheterisation, hormonal manipulation, and palliative TURP (pTURP) <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Although pTURP offers immediate relief from BOO, the potential negative oncological effect due to intravascular dissemination of prostate cancer cells and escalation of incontinence makes it less acceptable <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Hormonal manipulation can hence be offered as the first-line treatment for obstructive voiding symptoms in patients with locally advanced/metastatic prostate cancer who are not candidates for curative treatment <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Androgen suppression is known to result in a reduction in the size of malignant, as well as benign prostatic disease, and the re-establishment of spontaneous voiding. However, it may take &#x0223c;2&#x02013;3&#x000a0;months, as there is a delay between hormonal manipulation and tumour response <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p><p id="p0015">Despite the availability of various treatment options, there is paucity of literature in standardising the protocol for management of patients with advanced prostate cancer presenting with AUR or chronic urinary retention. Therefore, the present study was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) in relieving urinary retention in patients with advanced prostate cancer presenting with urinary retention or a high post-void residual urine volume (PVR).</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><title>Patients and methods</title><p id="p0020">The present prospective observational study was carried out between September 2014 and April 2016, and the study protocol was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee.</p><p id="p0025">Patients presenting to our outpatient department with advanced prostate cancer (inclusive of both locally advanced and metastatic prostate cancer not amenable for definitive/curative management) with chronic urinary retention (&#x0003e;200&#x000a0;mL) or with an indwelling catheter for AUR or chronic urinary retention (&#x0003e;200&#x000a0;mL) who had not previously received any hormonal or surgical treatment were enrolled after taking informed consent. Patients with localised prostate cancer eligible for receiving any therapy aimed at cure (radiotherapy/radical prostatectomy) and patients with urethral stricture were excluded.</p><p id="p0030">Initial evaluation included: a thorough clinical history and a detailed physical examination including IPSS (in those with high PVR) and DRE; complete blood panel including haemogram, blood urea, serum creatinine, liver function tests, serum PSA, serum calcium, serum testosterone; urine routine and microscopic examination, and urine culture and sensitivity. Ultrasonography of the kidney, ureter and bladder (USG KUB) was performed to assess the prostate size, upper tract changes, and PVR followed by uroflowmetry to assess the maximum urinary flow rate (Q<sub>max</sub>) and PVR. A Foley catheter was inserted in patients with LUTS with a high PVR (&#x0003e;200&#x000a0;mL). Imaging studies, e.g. bone scans, positron-emission tomography CT/MRI were performed to delineate the extent of the prostate cancer, to classify them as per our inclusion criteria, and to exclude those who were eligible for curative treatment.</p><p id="p0035">All patients were counselled about the various treatment options available. As all patients preferred ADT over other forms of treatment, patients were offered to choose between a LHRH antagonist/agonist or orchidectomy as their choice of ADT. Additionally, &#x003b1;-adrenoceptor antagonist/combined therapy, and calcium and iron supplements were given for at least 1&#x000a0;month after which they had their first trial of voiding without catheter (TWOC). If the first TWOC failed, two additional TWOCs were given each 1&#x000a0;month apart. Channel pTURP was considered if the patient failed a third TWOC or had persistent PVR of &#x0003e;200&#x000a0;mL even after successful TWOC. Irrespective of whether TWOC was successful at the first, second or third attempt, all TWOC-successful patients were investigated after treatment with a renal function test, and measurement of serum calcium, testosterone, and PSA at 3&#x000a0;months. USG KUB and uroflowmetry was also advised at the end of 3&#x000a0;months to assess the improvement of the upper tract, reduction in the size of prostate, and also to assess post-treatment PVR.</p><sec id="s0015"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="p0040">The data were analysed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS&#x000ae;, version 21.0; SPSS Inc., IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA).

Most patients with prostate cancer with AUR regain their voiding ability within 3&#x000a0;months after medical castration. Although favourable results are achieved with ADT <xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, there is still limited information from randomised clinical trials on the impact of ADT on LUTS. Channel TURP still remains the most commonly used treatment for patients with prostate cancer bothered by LUTS or experiencing urinary retention <xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. However, the procedure is not devoid of various complications including bleeding, TUR syndrome and incontinence <xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Hence, our present study was conducted to assess the effectiveness of ADT in obviating the need for channel pTURP in patients with prostate cancer presenting with urinary retention or high PVR (&#x0003e;200&#x000a0;mL), so that ADT could be used as the primary mode of therapy. A significant number of patients with metastatic or advanced prostate cancer present with high PVRs and LUTS, albeit the more common presentation of AUR <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. This was reflected in our present study, where in 55.4% presented with refractory AUR, which was closely followed by LUTS with high PVR (44.6%).</p><sec id="s0030"><title>Reduction in prostate volume</title><p id="p0075">At the baseline visit, patients were primarily treated with either a LHRH agonist/antagonist or bilateral orchidectomy, together with a concomitant &#x003b1;-adrenoceptor antagonist and 5&#x003b1;-reductase inhibitor in all patients. Anti-androgens predominantly non-steroidal were given as and when deemed necessary. Castration is known to reduce prostate volume with continued reduction on long-term therapy <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Original work by Huggins et al. <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> showed a maximal decrease in prostate volume after orchidectomy at 3&#x000a0;months. Our present study had a follow-up duration of 3&#x000a0;months, during which the prostate volume decreased by &#x0223c;31%, which correlates well with most previous studies <xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s0035"><title>Successful TWOC</title><p id="p0080">In a retrospective study conducted by Varenhorst and Alund <xref rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, of 122 patients with prostate cancer with urinary retention, a total of 80 (65.6%) responded to endocrine therapy with mitigation of the urethral obstruction, and the indwelling catheter could be removed. In 35 patients (28.7%), the obstruction was relieved within 2&#x000a0;months, in 58 (47.5%) within 3&#x000a0;months, and in 70 (57.4%) within 4&#x000a0;months. In the remaining 10, the catheter was removed at 4&#x02013;6&#x000a0;months after initiating treatment. Unlike that study, where surgical castration in form of orchidectomy was the mode of management, we used both medical as well as surgical castration as per patient preference. Our present follow-up period was also different, ending at 3&#x000a0;months, whereas those who were catheter-free up to 6&#x000a0;months were recorded as responders in their study. Despite a shorter follow-up, the success rate in our present study was considerably higher. The use of a concomitant &#x003b1;-adrenoceptor antagonist and 5&#x003b1;-reductase inhibitors along with castration could have resulted in the higher success rate. However, this requires further validation and a longer duration of follow-up to substantiate their role as concomitant therapy.</p><p id="p0085">Although success rates have been reported to be higher with ADT, patients have to endure the discomfort of prolonged catheterisation <xref rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. This was reflected in our present study, where only 27 of 101 patients (26.73%) could void at the end of 1&#x000a0;month. In the 97 patients who responded, the mean time until relief of obstruction was 1.9&#x000a0;months as compared to 2.7&#x000a0;months (after orchidectomy) and 3.4&#x000a0;months (after oestrogen therapy) in the Varenhorst and Alund study <xref rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.</p><p id="p0090">Other parameters measured at the 3-month follow-up were serum testosterone, serum PSA, serum calcium, and serum creatinine. Castrate levels of serum testosterone were achieved in all patients, with a mean testosterone level of 21.46&#x000a0;ng/dL. As expected the serum PSA level also significantly dropped to a mean of 2.17&#x000a0;ng/mL. The fall in creatinine was also significant, which probably correlated with the resolution of upper tract changes upon administering ADT. No data regarding this correlation could be obtained from previous studies. ADT leads to a substantial decrease in serum calcium <xref rid="b0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, which is a known side-effect. However, in our present study there was a marginal decrease in serum calcium levels owing to supplementation of calcium and vitamin D.</p><p id="p0095">Mommsen et al. <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> reported that 62% (43/69) of patients with prostate cancer with AUR regained their voiding ability within 3&#x000a0;months after orchidectomy. In patients who were treated with LHRH analogues in a study by Hampson et al. <xref rid="b0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, 21 of 31 patients (68%) voided without the need for surgical intervention after 3&#x000a0;months. Treatment with triptorelin was effective in reducing LUTS severity and improving quality of life in patients with prostate cancer; the mean (SD) total IPSS improved from 14 (5) to 10 (5) at week 24 for patients with moderate-to-severe LUTS in a study by Alexandre Peltier et al. <xref rid="b0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Klarskov et al. <xref rid="b0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> documented statistically significant changes from baseline in numerous objective measures of voiding when 77 patients with prostate cancer were treated with different forms of hormone therapy for 12&#x000a0;months. After 12&#x000a0;months, the median Q<sub>max</sub> increased by 38% (from 8 to 11&#x000a0;mL/s), median PVR decreased by 26% (from 86 to 63.5&#x000a0;mL), median voiding volume went up by 17%, and the median prostate volume was reduced by 37%. The major part of the changes took place within the first month and improvement was maintained through most of the follow-up. Our present study demonstrated equally good results, with an overall mean (SD) Q<sub>max</sub> of 13.61 (2.26)&#x000a0;mL/s, mean IPSS of 5.91, and median percentage decrease in PVR of 85.45% after treatment.</p><p id="p0100">In our present study, four of the 101 patients (3.96%) underwent channel pTURP at the end of 3&#x000a0;months. Fleischmann and Catalona <xref rid="b0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> noticed that neither tumour stage nor grade correlated significantly with the effect of orchidectomy on urination. No correlation could be found between DRE grade, Gleason score and the stage of the disease with successful voiding or failure leading to pTURP in the present study (<xref rid="t0020" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). However, further studies are required to validate the risk factors for pTURP.</p><p id="p0105">On further comparison, of the two modes of management (medical vs surgical castration) the results were comparable across both groups. However, there is no study, to the best of our knowledge, comparing medical and surgical castration in patients with prostate cancer presenting with urinary retention. An interesting finding noted on further sub-analysis was that better results and a faster mean time to successful voiding obtained in those patients treated with a LHRH antagonist (24 patients; <xref rid="t0025" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). A randomised controlled trial comparing degarelix vs goserelin plus bicalutamide for volume reduction, LUT relief and quality-of-life improvement in patients with prostate cancer, showed that at 12&#x000a0;weeks, changes in prostate volume with goserelin and degarelix were similar <xref rid="b0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. However, the mean time to successful voiding was 1.58&#x000a0;months, which was significantly earlier compared to the other two treatment groups.
