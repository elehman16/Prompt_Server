exercise and underwater exercise on chronic stroke patients. [Subjects] A total of 60
patients received exercise for 40 minutes, three times a week, for 6 weeks. [Methods]
Subjects from both groups performed general conventional treatment during the experimental
period. In addition, all subjects engaged in extra treatment sessions. This extra
treatment consisted of unstable surface exercise. The underwater exercise group used
wonder boards in a pool (depth 1.1m, water temperature 33.5&#x02005;&#x000b0;C, air temperature 27&#x02005;&#x000b0;C)
dedicated to underwater exercise, and the land exercise group used balance mats. [Result]
The joint position sense, sway area, Berg Balance Scale showed significant improvements in
both groups. However, the joint position sense test, sway area, and Berg Balance Scale
showed there was more improvement in the underwater exercise group than in the land
exercise group. [Conclusion] The results suggest that underwater exercise is more
effective than land exercise at improving the joint position sense and balance of stroke
patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Underwater exercise</kwd><kwd>Joint position sense</kwd><kwd>Balance</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Most stroke survivors suffer aftereffects of impairments in motor, sensory, cognitive,
perceptive, psychological, social, and physical functions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Additionally, 65% of stroke patients experience loss of tactile
sense, the protection reaction, and proprioceptive sense<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. The proprioceptive sense is closely correlated with balance
ability<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Since declined balance ability
reduces functional activities and increases the incidence rate of falls<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref><sup>)</sup>, one of the physical functions that must be recovered first
in stroke patients is balance ability<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.
However, the body sway applied during land balance training psychologically increases fear
of falling and thus acts as a factor to limit balance training<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this respect, Svedenhag et al. reported that the psychologically
unstable state can be relieved, and mental stability can be induced through underwater
techniques<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Exercise in underwater
environments helps stroke patients to safely and comfortably improve their motor ability by
providing low-risk exercise environments that support their bodies and reduce their fear of
falling and the possibility of sudden damage<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Additionally, the slow-moving environment in water caused by
viscosity and drag force can also help people reduce the velocity-dependent spastic
response<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Noh et al. reported that when 25 chronic stroke patients performed underwater exercise for
eight weeks in a study intended to examine the effects of ai-chi and halliwick exercises on
stroke patients' bodily balance and muscle force, the patients' balance ability and knee
flexor muscle force improved<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Lee
Dong-Jin et al. reported that when 34 chronic stroke patients divided into an underwater
group and a land group received training for 12 weeks in a study intended to examine the
effects of underwater and land task-oriented training on the patients' balance ability, the
underwater group showed larger improvement in static and dynamic balance than the land
group<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Park et al. reported that when
44 chronic stroke patients divided into an underwater exercise group and a land exercise
group had performed exercise for six weeks in a study intended to examine the effects of
underwater exercises using buoyant apparatuses on joint position senses and
Performance-Oriented Mobility Assessment (POMA), the underwater group showed larger
improvement in their joint position senses and POMA than the land exercise group<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Recently, underwater exercise has gained more attention for stroke rehabilitation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, underwater exercises are
considered to be able to satisfy the social demands for more effective and safer therapeutic
interventions. However, studies on underwater exercises are still insufficient, and previous
studies did not apply the same exercise program to underwater and land exercises or
implement underwater proprioceptive sense exercise programs.</p><p>In this respect, this study was intended to implement the same proprioceptive sense
exercise program underwater and on the land in patients with hemiplegia resulting from
stroke in order to examine the effects of the exercise program on the patients' balance
ability.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title> General characteristics of the subjects (M&#x000b1;SD)</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="center" colspan="2" rowspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">UG (n=31)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">LG (n=31)</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Age (years)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">56.1&#x000b1;7.3</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">56.6&#x000b1;10.0</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Height (cm)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">158.2&#x000b1;9.6</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">161.3&#x000b1;6.4</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Weight (kg)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">63.4&#x000b1;9.0</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">61.9&#x000b1;7.9</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Onset (Month)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">15.2&#x000b1;5.1</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">16.1&#x000b1;5.4</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">K-MMSE</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">26.3&#x000b1;3.7</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">27.0&#x000b1;3.4</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="2" colspan="1">Sex</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Male</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">15</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">13</td></tr><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Female</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">16</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">18</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="2" colspan="1">Affected side</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Right</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">14</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">15</td></tr><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Left</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">17</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">16</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>K-MMSE, Mini-Mental State Examination-Korea.

the subjects were selected from chronic stroke patients with onset at least six months
previously, who had no internal medical disease such as diabetes, had no heart disease and
no orthopedic problems, scored 24 or more on the Mini-Mental State Examination-Korea, had
no visual problems, and could walk at least 15&#x02005;m by themselves. These subjects had been
given explanations until they sufficiently understood this experiment. Then the subjects
or their guardians signed consent forms for participation in this experiment. General
characteristics of the study subjects are as shown in <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The proprioceptive sense exercise program in the present study was created referring to
the proposal by Melzer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref><sup>)</sup> and Hupperets
et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref><sup>)</sup> and implemented a total of 18
times, 3 times per week, for 6 weeks from January 2011. All the study subjects performed
exercises for a total of 40 minutes each time consisting of 30 minutes of main exercises,
5 minutes of warming up exercises and warming down exercises underwater or on the land
depending on their groups. The underwater exercise group used wonder boards in a pool
(depth 1.1 m, water temperature 33.5&#x02005;&#x000b0;C, air temperature 27&#x02005;&#x000b0;C) dedicated to underwater
exercise, and the land exercise group used balance mats in an exercise treatment room in
the hospital building. The overall exercise programs for the underwater exercise group and
the land exercise group were the same, and three sets consisting of 10 repetitions of
motions at different levels were performed. The details of the exercise program are as
follows.</p><p>(1) One-legged knee flexion: The subjects placed one foot toward the front and one toward
the rear, with one on the land and the other on the wonder boards (balance mats), and then
bent and straightened the knees while pushing the body forward. (2) Toe stand: The
subjects stood on the wonder boards (balance mats) with the feet comfortably apart
laterally and repeated motions to raise and lower the heels. (3) One-legged stance: The
subjects stood on the wonder boards (balance mats) on one foot (for 30 seconds). (4) Knee
flexion of both legs: The subjects stood with their feet comfortably apart laterally with
one foot in the water and the other foot on the wonder boards (balance mats) and bent and
straightened the knees. (5) Weight shift: The subjects stood with their feet comfortably
apart laterally with one foot in the water and the other foot on the wonder boards
(balance mats) and moved the pelvis laterally.</p><p>The joint position sense test is a method of assessing the position of individual body
segments without a visual aid, and it can also be applied to the proprioceptive sense in
hemiplegic patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this study,
we employed the Biometrics (Biometrics Ltd. UK) motion analysis system that helped us
compose a base unit that digitizes the analog joint angles and an electrogoniometer that
measures the joint motion angle. The joint position sense test was performed as an active
setting-active reproduction test. For the active setting-active reproduction test, the
subjects were asked to actively move their joints within the full motion range, maintain
an arbitrary angle in the middle for 3 seconds, and remember the joint angle as the
reference angle. After 10 seconds of rest, the subjects were asked to press a button while
actively reproducing the reference angle within one second. The zero point of the motion
analysis system operating software was adjusted when the subjects were sitting. After
covering the eyes of the subjects with an eye patch and checking the maximum joint motion
range of the knee joint, a reference angle was set in the middle of the joint motion
range. Measurement was started after allowing the patients to practice sufficiently with
the decided reference angle. The duration for one measurement was seven seconds: two
seconds each at the beginning and the end were discarded, and the three seconds in the
middle were recorded as the measurement value. The measurement was repeated three times,
and the mean value was calculated.</p><p>In this study, balance was measured using a Good Balance system (Metitur, Jyv&#x000e4;skyl&#x000e4;,
Finland). This equipment has been commercialized as equipment for measuring the static and
dynamic balance of the elderly, stroke patients, etc., and is widely used<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. The measuring methods used included
measuring for each 30 seconds while the patient kept his or her eyes open and closed for
30 seconds in each state.</p><p>The Berg balance test was performed by applying daily living motions and is largely
divided into three areas: the ability to maintain postures, the ability to voluntarily
control movements, and reflexes to external factors comprised of a total of 14 evaluation
items. The performance of each item is scored between 0 points at the minimum and 4 points
at the maximum, and thus the full score of the test is 56 points<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>For the data processing in this study, the paired sample t-test was performed to test the
difference before and after the exercise in each group, and the independent sample t-test
was performed to test the difference between the groups. The SPSS 18.0 software for
Windows was used for the analysis, and a significance level, &#x003b1;, of 0.05 was chosen.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><table-wrap id="tbl_002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title> A comparison of pre- and post-intervention JPS, sway area, and BBS in the

underwater exercise in chronic stroke patients. In the results of the present study, joint
position sense errors significantly decreased in the underwater exercise group that
implemented the proprioceptive exercise program, and the decreases in the underwater
exercise groups were more significant compared with the land exercise group. Through these
results, it could be seen that the proprioceptive exercise programs in the present study
were effective in improving proprioceptive senses, and in particular, the underwater
exercise program was more effective. Nashner and Peters stated that after proprioceptive
sense improving exercises, posture swaying when the eyes were closed showed larger
improvement than those when the eyes were open<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the present study, based on the results of functional standing
balance tests, the decreases in swaying areas before and after exercises were performed were
larger when the exercises were performed with the eyes closed than when the exercises were
performed with the eyes open. This is considered to be associated with the fact that when
implementing the exercise programs, the land exercise group performed exercises only within
the limit of stability due to fear of falling, while the underwater exercise group
challenged the limit of stability without any fear of falling. In general, hemiplegia
patients tend to support their weight less with the lower extremity on their paretic side in
standing postures and show asymmetrical characteristics of postures, which reduce the
patients' functional abilities<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref><sup>)</sup> and act
as a major cause of the patients' falling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, equal weight bearing by the lower extremity on the
paretic side should be induced<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref><sup>)</sup>.
However, it is considered that during training using unstable surfaces on the land, patients
will support more weight with the lower extremity on their unaffected side. On the other
hand, during underwater balance exercises, the patients can support their weight with the
lower extremities on both the paretic and unaffected sides in order to maintain balance on
the buoyant apparatus, since the buoyant apparatus will be lost and float away easily if the
patients support their weight only with the lower extremity on their unaffected side.
Therefore, underwater exercises are considered more advantageous for equal weight bearing by
both lower extremities.</p><p>Consequently, through the present study, it could be seen that underwater proprioceptive
sense exercise programs implemented by stroke patients were effective in improving the
patients' proprioceptive sense and balance ability.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><person-group><name><surname>Sabari</surname><given-names>JS</given-names></name></person-group>: Motor control, Motor recovery after stroke, In: Deusen JV &#x00026; Brunt D.
