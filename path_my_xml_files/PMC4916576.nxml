Three-quarters went to hospitals; 18% were admitted and 58% received outpatient treatment. Some (24%) mothers were turned away at facilities and follow-on IDIs showed that some of these untreated babies subsequently died. Independent care seeking for severe newborn illness increased from 55.4% in control to 77.3% in Newhints zones, especially among Q1 where care seeking almost doubled (95.0% vs 48.6%; RR=1.94 (1.32, 2.84); p=0.001).

Studies in rural India and Bangladesh have demonstrated that training community health workers/volunteers (CHWs) to promote essential newborn care (ENC) practices and to identify and manage sick newborns (with home treatment and/or referral to hospital) can result in substantial (30&#x02013;62%) reductions in neonatal mortality.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20&#x02013;22</xref> In addition, this approach has the potential to be equitable.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> No trials have been conducted to date in sub-Saharan Africa where the rates of neonatal mortality are the highest.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p><p>The Newhints cluster-randomised controlled trial (CRT) in rural Ghana evaluated the impact of home visits by community-based surveillance volunteers (CBSVs) on ENC practices and neonatal mortality.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> It achieved improved coverage of key ENC practices and non-significant reductions of 8% in neonatal deaths and 15% in deaths occurring after the first day, the period particularly targeted by the intervention.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> The Newhints intervention adopted a three-pronged approach to increase access to care for sick newborns: first, during home visits in the first week of life, the time of the greatest vulnerability for the newborn,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> CBSVs weighed and assessed newborns for 10-key danger signs and referred to health facilities when any was present. Doing this sent a strong message to the community about the vulnerability of newborns and reinforced the second approach in which CBSVs promoted care seeking for newborn illnesses by counselling families on danger signs and emphasising the need for urgent action when newborns fell ill. Third, they dialogued and problem-solved with families around barriers to seeking care, both during its promotion and at the time of any referral. In addition, CBSVs counselled families on the importance of saving during pregnancy for emergencies.</p><p>In this paper, we present findings on the success of this three-pronged approach, evaluating whether the Newhints intervention has increased access to care for sick newborns (including compliance with referral and independent care-seeking for sick newborns) and in particular assess whether it has reduced inequities in this access.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design</title><p>This study is a prospective study nested within the Newhints cluster-randomised controlled trial.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>An overview of Newhints trial design and study setting</title><p>Details of the Newhints trial design have already been published.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>

In addition, ENC training was conducted in the main health facilities covering both intervention and control zones. The trial covered seven contiguous districts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2015008107F1">figure 1</xref>) in the Brong-Ahafo Region in central Ghana; an area of &#x0223c;12&#x02005;000&#x02005;km<sup>2</sup> with a multiethnic and predominantly (80%) rural population of more than 700&#x02005;000,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> engaged primarily in subsistence agriculture. Educational levels were low and communities, mostly served by unpaved roads, lacked modern infrastructure. The four main hospitals located in the relatively urban district capital towns of Techiman, Kintampo, Nkoranza and Wenchi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2015008107F1">figure 1</xref>) provided comprehensive emergency obstetric and newborn care services and were referral destinations for subdistrict and community-based facilities.

The core components of Newhints were training more than 450 CBSVs, over 9&#x02005;days, to identify pregnant women and conduct five focused home visits (two during pregnancy and three on days 1, 3 and 7 in the first week after birth) to promote ENC practices, weigh and assess newborns and refer to health facilities if any of the 10 danger signs was present (<xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2015008107TB1">table 1</xref>). To reach babies timely after birth CBSVs left their contact details with families to be contacted whenever women delivered. In addition, they increased the frequency of home visits to women who were in their late pregnancy. CBSVs were provided with portable weighing scales with colour-coded bands: red for weights &#x0003c;1.5&#x02005;kg identifying very low birthweight (vLBW) babies; yellow for weights of 1.5&#x02013;2.4&#x02005;kg identifying LBW babies; and green for weights of 2.5&#x02005;kg and above; a digital thermometer; and a timer.</p><table-wrap id="BMJOPEN2015008107TB1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Danger signs for neonatal illness used in Newhints</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/></colgroup><thead valign="bottom"><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Assessment</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Danger sign</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="2" rowspan="1">Ask:</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;How is the baby feeding?</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">

Consent forms were read to them and agreement for participation was indicated with a signature or a thumbprint.

Simple tabulations and cross tabulations were carried out for the outcomes by key maternal (education, place of residence, SEQ), newborn (sex) and other factors (visited by the 2nd day after delivery, issuance of referral card) specific to Newhints. Percentage agreements and &#x003ba; statistics were estimated for agreement between CBSVs and DiPS and between DiPS and clinician assessments. Generalised estimating equations with a log link function were used to estimate the risk ratios of care seeking by SEQs adjusted for clustering, together with 95% CIs.</p><p>Recordings from the IDIs together with the field notes were transcribed into English and exported into NVIVO V.9.2 (QSR International Pty Ltd.

The care-seeking rates for the two groups were similar, 88.9% and 84.8%, respectively.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>The results of this study show that with adequate training and support, CBSVs were able to identify sick newborns and facilitate compliance to referral even in an area where the majority of families rely on subsistence agriculture and have poor access to care. Newhints substantially increased sick newborn access to facility care; CBSV referrals elicited 86.0% (95% CI 81.4% to 89.9%) compliance (unequalled in any previous community newborn intervention) which was prompt and mainly to hospitals. Families' overall care seeking for severe newborn illnesses increased from 55.4% in control zones (similar to baseline levels) to 77.3% within Newhints zones. This increased sick newborn access to care was pro-poor with referral compliance and care seeking higher among the poorest (or rural residents) compared with the least poor (or urban residents).</p><p>Prerequisites for success of such interventions are assessments being carried out, on time and accurately. Families should also be convinced to take sick newborns for care when asked. With only 14&#x02005;months of implementation, Newhints achieved 70% postnatal visit coverage which compares with 73% attained in the Projahnmo-2 trial (Bangladesh)<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02014;one of the highest attained in a community newborn CRT&#x02014;although the latter only attained this in the third year of implementation. Assessment coverage in Newhints was almost universal (more than 95%) and of high quality.</p><p>Newhints reduced all-cause neonatal mortality (NMR) by a modest and non-significant 9%; post-day 1 NMR for singleton babies was reduced by 41% (2&#x02013;65%, p=0.04)<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> in the 7&#x02005;months after improved implementation strategies were introduced. Given the high rates of compliance with referrals and the subsequent dramatic care-seeking differences between intervention and control zones, improved sick newborn access to care could have been a large contributor to any mortality reductions.</p><p>Newhints impact on access to care for sick newborns, in the short duration of implementation, was maximal among the poorest and rural families compared with the least poor and urban. This is contrary to predictions of the inverse equity hypothesis<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> that, in the short term, the impact of such interventions will be maximal among the least poor compared with the poorest. Several reasons could explain the pro-poor results: Newhints was specifically designed to be pro-poor by using existing CBSVs selected and living with community members. In rural settings more than urban, community cohesion is likely to be high and hence CBSV awareness and acceptability of CBSV assessments and referrals may be higher. Geographical distance contributed to delays in care seeking but did not prevent compliance of rural families despite the main hospitals (the preferred care-seeking destination) being located in urban areas.</p><p>Directly observed assessments as implemented in Newhints supervision were liable to the Hawthorne effect where volunteers may want to impress supervisors with their assessment skills. This supervisory approach had the advantage of directly reinforcing volunteer assessment skills and confidence but the quality of CBSV assessment may be an overestimate. In previous validation studies,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>
<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> physician assessments lagged behind CHWs' and since newborn danger signs such as breathing rate or chest indrawing can change rapidly,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> the validity of comparisons remain questionable. Independent confirmation of referral compliance and care seeking was not feasible: Newhints was not able to be present at facilities to record care seeking and facility recordkeeping was poor with babies sent home without treatment having no contact records.</p><p>The Newhints referral process has potential for low specificity as newborns were referred to hospitals when any danger sign was present including signs of local infections. This may increase hospital workload (admissions and bed occupancy), costs and possibly has an impact on quality of care delivered. However, newborn care experts advise prompt care seeking at facilities on the slightest suspicion of infection.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Again, it may be cost-effective treating early disease (requiring minimal resources) to achieve better outcomes than severe disease. Moreover, it would be difficult for programmes to selectively reduce inappropriate care seeking without affecting appropriate ones.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> The feasibility and adequacy of referring local infections to lower level facilities or training volunteers in their management should be explored in African settings.</p><p>Duality of expert opinions for community-based management of sick newborn persists; some are in favour of community-based treatment while others warn about the possibility of developing drug resistance.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> Studies in Asia successfully implemented home-based antibiotic treatment but subsequent referral of severely ill newborns elicited very low and often delayed compliance,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>
<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>
<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35&#x02013;39</xref> with poor subsequent independent care seeking for newborn illnesses.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> In settings where access to health facilities is low, community treatment may be crucial to improve newborn survival. However, this may require more complex algorithms than those used in Newhints and so may be more difficult to implement at scale. Furthermore, if CHWs treat rather than refer sick babies, this may appear to undermine messages that care seeking at health facilities is important when families perceive their babies to be ill in the absence of the CHW.</p><p>In spite of the increased access to care for sick newborns, Newhints achieved only modest reductions in NMR.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Substantial delays at health facilities before first health worker contact, lack of requisite examination before sending babies back home without treatment, some of whom subsequently died, raised questions about the quality of health facility newborn care in the Newhints trial area. A subsequent assessment of newborn care in facilities within the trial area confirmed that despite the Newhints-facilitated ENC training, quality was poor.<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> Quality newborn care at facilities is an imperative if community assessment and referral of sick babies is to succeed in saving newborn lives.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Furthermore, if high quality is not guaranteed, it may fuel community mistrust in health services for newborns and impact adversely on care-seeking practices. Sri Lanka reduced neonatal mortality from 75.5 (1945) to 12.9 (1991) only through coupling high-care seeking with good quality and accessible healthcare.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></p><p>In conclusion, the Newhints trial provides evidence showing that implementing community volunteer-facilitated referral at scale within health system settings in sub-Saharan Africa is feasible and potentially pro-poor. It has demonstrated that home visits by community volunteers are an effective approach, at scale, for improving access to care for sick newborns. Harnessing the potential of CBSVs to link communities to health facilities through facilitated referrals is feasible, acceptable and pro-poor but must be matched with improved quality of newborn care within health facilities.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors express their gratitude to the management and staff of the Kintampo Health Research Centre and the London School for the various ways they contributed to make this study a success particularly Angela Vega, the administrator.
