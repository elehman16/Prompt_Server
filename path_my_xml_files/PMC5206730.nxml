The strains were selected for their differential effects on TLR signalling and tight junction protein rearrangement, which may lead to beneficial effects in a stressed human gut mucosa. Ten healthy volunteers participated in four different intervention periods: 7-day oral intake of either <italic>L. plantarum</italic> WCFS1, CIP104448, TIFN101 or placebo, proceeded by a 4 weeks wash-out period. Lactulose-rhamnose ratio (an indicator of small intestinal permeability) increased after intake of indomethacin, which was given as an artificial stressor of the gut mucosal barrier (mean ratio 0.06&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.04 to 0.10&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.06, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.001), but was not significantly affected by the bacterial interventions. However, analysis in small intestinal biopsies, obtained by gastroduodenoscopy, demonstrated that particularly <italic>L. plantarum</italic> TIFN101 modulated gene transcription pathways related to cell-cell adhesion with high turnover of genes involved in tight- and adhesion junction protein synthesis and degradation (<italic>e.g.</italic> actinin alpha-4, metalloproteinase-2). These effects were less pronounced for <italic>L. plantarum</italic> WCFS1 and CIP104448. In conclusion, <italic>L. plantarum</italic> TIFN101 induced the most pronounced probiotic properties with specific gene transcriptional effects on repair processes in the compromised intestine of healthy subjects.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Impairment of intestinal barrier function has been implicated as an early event in the pathogenesis of various intestinal and systemic disorders.

In a previous study by our consortium, the administration of <italic>L. plantarum</italic> WCFS1 directly into the duodenum of healthy human subjects beneficially contributed to the organization of the epithelial tight junctions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. Next to <italic>L. plantarum</italic> WCFS1, we have selected two more <italic>L. plantarum</italic> strains, <italic>i.e.</italic> CIP104448 (CIP48), and TIFN101 (in previous studies referred to as CIP104450), to be tested in the current study. They were selected based on research wherein these bacterial strains were shown to have differential effects in toll-like receptor (TLR) signalling <italic>in vitro</italic> and to affect both the innate and specific immune system both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. Although it has recently been demonstrated in an <italic>in vitro</italic> model that TLR signalling is involved in regulation of the intestinal barrier function<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>, it is unknown whether these three <italic>L. plantarum</italic> strains have positive effects on intestinal mucosal barrier in human subjects after ingestion, or through which mechanisms these live bacterial organisms may improve the human gut barrier function.</p><p>We hypothesized that daily oral administration of <italic>L. plantarum</italic> WCFS1, CIP48, and TIFN101 over a 7-day period (i) will have positive effects on compromised (due to intake of NSAIDs) intestinal barrier function in healthy human subjects, with regard to intestinal permeability, tight junction protein- and gene expression, and furthermore (ii) will induce alterations in the transcription of pathways involved in mucosal structure and cell function, as measured in duodenal biopsy material.</p><p>Aim of the present randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was to assess the effects of oral intake of the three <italic>L. plantarum</italic> strains over a 7-day period on small intestinal permeability, duodenal epithelial tight junction protein expression and mucosal gene transcription, in healthy human subjects.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><p>Ten healthy volunteers, 7 female and 3 male, with the age between 19 and 48 years (mean 26.3&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;10.1) and a BMI between 16 and 24&#x02009;kg/m<sup>2</sup> (mean 21.8&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2.40) were included in the trial and underwent four intervention periods in a double blind randomised cross over design (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>).

Epithelial-mesenchymal transition pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>), involved in disruption and remodelling of desmosomal adhesion, and pathways that might be involved in restructuring of cell-cell adhesions (<italic>i.e.</italic> macropinocytosis signalling pathway, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>) and cytoskeleton rearrangement (<italic>i.e.</italic> integrin signalling pathway, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7</xref>) were upregulated. Moreover, we observed a combined up-regulation of matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) gene (1.297, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.006), involved in degradation of extracellular structures, and its inhibitors, so-called tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase (TIMP) 1 (1.362, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.006), and TIMP3 (1.243, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.028). TIFN101 also upregulated the muc2 gene (1.286, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.031), encoding for the mucin 2 protein. Furthermore, the glutamate-ammonia ligase (GLUL) gene (1.155, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.022), involved in glutamine biosynthesis pathways, was upregulated, which may enhance energy release based on glutamine biosynthesis of mucosal cells. On the other hand this strain downregulated expression of genes involved in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle II pathway (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Suppl. Figure IIIa</xref>), which may lead to reduced adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production.</p><p>WCFS1 and CIP48 downregulated nitric oxide synthase 3 gene (NOS3) (&#x02212;1.113, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.039 and &#x02212;1.162, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.018, respectively), involved in cell-cell adhesion, and MMP9 (&#x02212;1.178, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.045 and &#x02212;1.218, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.025, respectively), involved in breakdown of the extracellular matrix. CIP48 upregulated genes related to inositol phosphates biosynthesis, components of the cytosolic side of the cell membrane, such as myotubularin related protein 9 (MTMR9) (1.132, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.014), MTMR8 (1.182, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.043), MTMR2 (1.131, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.006), phospholipase-C &#x003b2;4 (PLCB4) (1.131, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.014), and protein tyrosine phosphatase, non-receptor type 2 (PTPN2) (1.187, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.018).</p><p>WCFS1 demonstrated regulation of genes and pathways related to cell division processes and DNA repair (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Suppl.

Finally, CIP48 also inhibited expression of the GADD45B gene (&#x02212;1.223, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.034) in the glutathione-mediated detoxification pathway, involved in cell stress response, and the neuropeptide Y (NPY) gene (&#x02212;1.159, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.022), a protein that influences the fat metabolism.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>In the current study we investigated the effects of oral intake of three <italic>L. plantarum</italic> strains over a 7-day period on small intestinal barrier function under a stressed condition, induced by intake of NSAIDs, in healthy volunteers. Small intestinal permeability was increased after intake of indomethacin, but was not significantly affected by any of the treatments. However, the different interventions did modulate gut mucosal gene transcription related to mucosal structure, enterocyte energy supply, DNA-repair, stress response and cell activity pathways, when compared to placebo, revealing new insights into the mechanisms by which live potentially probiotic organisms may modulate human small intestinal mucosa.</p><p>Intake of indomethacin at baseline and after the intervention period resulted in a significant increase in small intestinal permeability, as reflected by the increased urinary excretion of lactulose versus rhamnose. This confirmed that the NSAID is a potent stressor of small intestinal barrier function, and that this model is well suited to investigate potential beneficial effects of bioactive substances in healthy individuals. The 7-day supplementation period of the different bacterial strains did not significantly affect small intestinal permeability. Previously, Karczewski <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated that a continuous intraduodenal administration of <italic>L. plantarum</italic> WCFS1 over a 6-hr period in healthy subjects (without intake of NSAIDs) increased tight junction-linked localisation of occludin and ZO-1 proteins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. Our results do not confirm these findings which should be explained by pertinent differences in design such as application of indomethacin as stressor and differences in administration of bacteria. The influence of indomethacin on epithelial barrier may have been too pronounced to detect beneficial functional effects induced by the bacterial interventions. However, also differences in route of administration (<italic>i.e.</italic> oral versus intraduodenal) and exposure time (<italic>i.e.</italic> 7 days versus 6&#x02009;hours) may account for the observed difference between these studies.</p><p>Although the interventions did not affect indomethacin induced changes in small intestinal permeability, the three tested <italic>L. plantarum</italic> strains did influence intrinsic repair processes of the small intestinal mucosa on gene transcription level. Differential effects on transcription of genes and pathways involved in mucosal structure maintenance have been observed. The strongest modulatory effects in this respect were demonstrated by <italic>L. plantarum</italic> TIFN101 when compared to placebo. Intake of this bacterial strain influenced the transcriptional response related to the turnover of adhesion molecules and homeostasis of the mucus layer. This is exemplified by alterations of pathways involved in cytoskeleton rearrangement, and upregulation of genes such as actinin alpha 4, several MMP genes but also their inhibitors (TIMP genes). Moreover, the up-regulation of the macropinocytosis signalling pathway, which is one of the mechanisms involved in disruption of intercellular contacts of adherens and tight junctions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>, may lead to increased recycling of adhesive molecules. <italic>L. plantarum</italic> TIFN101 also modulated genes that may be involved in inducing a shift of energy supply of the mucosal cells from oxidative phosphorylation (by TCA II pathway downregulation) towards glutamine production (by increased transcription of glutamine biosynthesis pathways). Glutamine is an important energy source for intestinal epithelial cells and it promotes cell differentiation and proliferation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. Moreover, glutamine deprivation in intestinal epithelial cells was associated with a loss of tight junction proteins which may lead to impaired paracellular permeability<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. On the other hand, glutamine supplementation has been reported to reinforce the intestinal epithelial mucosal barrier<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. Therefore, the effect of <italic>L. plantarum</italic> TIFN101 on the glutamine biosynthesis pathways may be considered beneficial for the intestinal barrier function. Finally, the mucin 2 gene is upregulated by TIFN101. Mucin 2 is produced by the goblet cells and together with related mucin proteins is polymerized into insoluble mucus, which is an important part of the intestinal barrier<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. As the number of goblet cells, and thereby mucin production, is increasing along the proximal to distal axis of the intestine, the effect of TIFN101 on intestinal barrier might also be stronger when it reaches more distal parts of the intestine.</p><p><italic>L. plantarum</italic> WCFS1 showed some negative effects on the transcription of genes and pathways involved in mucosal barrier homeostasis, by downregulation of genes such as claudin 5<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref> and NOS3. The latter gene is linked to maintenance of cytoskeletal proteins, <italic>e.g.</italic> &#x003b1;-tubulin, actinin and vimentin, and tight junction integral membrane proteins, <italic>e.g.</italic> occludin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. Contradictory, <italic>L. plantarum</italic> WCFS1 downregulated MMP9 gene, which leads to inhibitory effects on breakdown of extracellular matrix<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>, suggesting beneficial effects of <italic>L. plantarum</italic> WCFS1 supplementation on mucosal integrity. <italic>L. plantarum</italic> CIP48 demonstrated similar modest effects on gene transcription. NOS3, MMP9, and claudin 19 genes were downregulated after the intervention. Furthermore, genes involved in inositol phosphates biosynthesis, important for cell membrane structure and membrane potential<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>, was upregulated by <italic>L. plantarum</italic> CIP48. Thereby, both strains, <italic>L. plantarum</italic> WCFS1 and CIP48, seem to be involved in maintaining a balance between enhancement and disruption of cell-cell adhesion and mucosal structure, with no direct functional consequences for intestinal permeability and tight junction protein expression.</p><p>We identified more mechanisms by which the three tested <italic>L. plantarum</italic> strains affect the human host on transcriptome level. <italic>L. plantarum</italic> WCFS1 increased the transcription of genes such as BRCA1 and 2 and POT1, which are involved in cell division processes, DNA repair and telomere length regulation, suggesting that this bacterial strain may be involved in the enhancement of epithelial healing after indomethacin induced mucosal stress. The transcription of the NPY gene, which encodes for a neuro-hormone in the leptin signalling pathway was inhibited by <italic>L. plantarum</italic> CIP48. Antagonising NPY-ergic activity has been reported to reduce food intake<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. However, no other effects on satiety related mechanisms were observed in the transcriptome analysis, and therefore the effects on satiety are probably minimal.</p><p>In summary, <italic>L. plantarum</italic> TIFN101 demonstrated regulation of genes and pathways involved in cell-cell adhesion and turnover of adhesion molecules. Furthermore, this strain seems to be able to induce gene transcriptions involved in energy supply of the mucosal cells by affecting both oxidative phosphorylation- and glutamine production pathways. <italic>L. plantarum</italic> WCFS1 modulated the transcription of genes related to DNA repair, possibly based on mucosal tissue healing upon NSAID induced stress, and showed minor negative effects on gene transcription related to mucosal structure. <italic>L. plantarum</italic> CIP48 demonstrated similar effects with respect to DNA repair mechanisms and minor positive effects on gene transcription and pathways related to mucosal structure. Overall our study demonstrates that the effect of bacterial supplementation on gene transcription is highly strain dependent and differs considerably within the same species. In the current study the transcriptome analysis was performed on duodenal biopsies. The effects might even be more pronounced or at least different in more distal parts of the intestine, as the mucosal function along the longitudinal axis of the intestine does vary. Further research is needed to investigate this hypothesis.</p><p>The cross-over design of the present study was preferred over a parallel arms design, to eliminate potential influences of inter-subject differences. An implicit potential disadvantage of a cross-over study is that previous interventions can influence effects of the next tests. To minimize such an influence a washout period of four weeks was chosen, and furthermore the order of the interventions was randomly assigned to each study participant.</p><p>In the present study the significantly regulated genes in the microarray data have not been remeasured by RT-qPCR, which may be a limitation with regard to the interpretation of the transcriptome data. In addition, future research should include <italic>in-vitro</italic> experiments to knock-down regulated genes and pathways in the present study to test the intrinsic processes described above. The difference in dose between the three <italic>L. plantarum</italic> strains used may be a potential limitation of the study. The number of colony forming unites (cfu) is determined by bacterial survival during freeze-drying of the supplements, which differed per bacterial strain. Although a dose-response is possible, it is unlikely that differences observed between interventions are affected by the difference in doses used in the current study. Furthermore, the dose consumed by study subjects per shot was for all three bacterial strains in the range of 10<sup>10</sup>, which are dosages recommended to reach clinical usefulness<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>.</p><p>In previous studies <italic>L. plantarum</italic> WCFS1 was found to modulate multiple pathways in duodenal mucosa, related to lipid biosynthesis, cellular proliferation, cell-death and immune responses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. In the present study, we were able to confirm that <italic>L. plantarum</italic> WCFS1 does affect some similar pathways related to cell function; however, most transcriptional responses were dissimilar. The main difference between the current and previous research was the intake of indomethacin in the present study. While in previous research the effects of <italic>L. plantarum</italic> WCFS1 on healthy intestinal function were investigated, we assessed effect of the three bacterial strains on small intestinal mucosa under a stressed condition. Furthermore, Troost <italic>et al</italic>. administrated a load of <italic>L. plantarum</italic> WCFS1 using oro- and nasogastric catheters during 1 and 6&#x02009;hours<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>, and Van Baarlen <italic>et al</italic>. administered supplements of the same bacterium by oral intake, and assessed effects after 6 hours<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. Therefore, besides the difference in administration route<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>, we measured long term effects (<italic>i.e.</italic> after a 7-day administration period), compared to the short term effects (<italic>i.e.</italic> after 1 and 6&#x02009;hours) assessed in the previous studies. Troost <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated that different supplementation periods lead to different transcriptional responses even between one and six hour administration of the bacteria<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>.</p><p>Comparison with other studies involving transcriptomics in the duodenum reveals that different bacterial species (<italic>i.e. L. acidophilus, L. casei, L. rhamnosus</italic>) induce very distinct gene-regulatory networks and pathways<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>, which were among others related to cell proliferation, hormonal regulation of blood pressure and ion homeostasis. These were not observed in the presented study, in which we used different <italic>L. plantarum</italic> strains. The described previous findings<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref> showed that the selection of the bacterial species as well as well as route and time period of administration of viable microbes may induce different effects on human health. In addition, taking into account these findings, our data indicate that also the selected bacterial strains and the presence of intestinal mucosal distress of the consumer may add to differences in effects of live bacteria on the intestinal mucosa. This pinpoints the need for further research in this area, but also underlines the care in selecting bacteria when testing potential management options of gastrointestinal disorders. The current study contributes to further understanding of complex host-microbe interactions and human intestinal homeostasis, providing leads for future research in this field.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Application of the NSAID indomethacin induced a profound increase in small intestinal permeability, which was not significantly affected by the intake of the three <italic>L. plantarum</italic> strains. However, the tested bacterial strains did modulate intrinsic repair processes on mucosal gene transcription level. <italic>L. plantarum</italic> TIFN101 demonstrated the most pronounced beneficial effects, by among others modulation of gene-transcriptions that are related to mucosal structure. <italic>L. plantarum</italic> WCFS1 and CIP48 induced more moderate transcriptional effects with respect to mucosal integrity.
