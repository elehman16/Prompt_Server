Even today, years after the first application of the fiberscope, anesthesiologists still encounter difficulty in intubation in 90% of cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0004 CIT0005 CIT0006 CIT0007">4&#x02013;7</xref>).</p><p>The conventional fiber-optic nasal intubation method in which the nasal tube is inserted in one step after visualization of the vocal cords by a flexible fiber-optic laryngoscope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0008">8</xref>), two major problems are encountered, i.e. visualization of the glottis and the entry point at the level of vocal cords, and insertion of the fiberscope into the trachea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0008">8</xref>).</p><p>Anesthesia, with or without the use of muscle relaxants, leads to paralysis of oropharyngeal muscles which in turn leads to a backward fall of the oropharyngeal structures such as the tongue and the epiglottis on the posterior wall of the pharynx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0009">9</xref>). As a result, the space is compromised, with little of it available for passing the tube into the trachea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0011">11</xref>). Some maneuvers such as jaw thrust, head flexion, tongue retraction, and use of intubator airways like Berman and Ovassapian have been successfully used to overcome the aforementioned problems. By pressing on the arytenoid cartilage, air passage can be occluded, as is in Selick's maneuver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0012">12</xref>). Use of intubator laryngeal mask airway (ILMA) is another way to facilitate fiberscopic intubation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0013">13</xref>). The goal of the NASAL-18 or the tube-first approach is to minimize the duration the fiberscope is between the cords, and also to reduce the time required to advance the tube into the larynx.</p><p>This study was designed to ascertain whether the facilitated method (NASAL-18) is superior to the conventional fiber-optic nasal intubation, as judged by the time for glottic visualization (T1) and the final time to intubation (T2).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="ss2"><title>Methods</title><p>This study was carried out from January 2008 to June 2008 at the Poursina teaching hospital on 52 patients who were candidates for elective maxillofacial operation of type 1 LEFORTE fracture (miniplate insertion in the upper and lower jaws). Their ages ranged from 25 to 45 years, and they all fell within the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status classes of I and II. Patients were excluded if there was a contraindication for nasal intubation.</p><p>The patients were randomly allocated into two groups of nasal intubation using either the NASAL-18 or the conventional method (control) based on a table of randomization. In the control group, the fiberscope was inserted into the nasal cavity via the nostril and advanced through it till the vocal cords were visualized. Then, the nasal tube, which had been mounted on the scope beforehand, was glided over the scope and advanced through the vocal cords into the trachea. Whereas in the NASAL-18 group, or the tube-first approach, the nasal tube was inserted into the nasal cavity and advanced through it till the mark 18 reached the level of alae of the nose. With the tube advanced to the 18 cm at nare, the tube tip stands just above the larynx and breath sounds are audible through the tracheal tube. With additional anesthesia directed at the larynx (topical lidocaine), run the long scope through the tube, visualize the larynx, and pass between the cords towards the carina. The final depth of insertion of the nasal tube should be 26&#x02013;28 cm at the nare, establishing its correct placement in the trachea as confirmed by bilateral audible breath sounds. Standard monitors including pulse oximetry, capnography, electrocardiography, and non-invasive blood pressure measurement were performed prior to the administration of intravenous medications and starting the nasal intubation. All patients received 2 microgram/kg of fentanyl, 3 mg of midazolam, and propofol at the rate of 30&#x02013;35 &#x003bc;g/kg/min. Atropine (0.5 mg) was used to reduce mucus secretions of airways. After shrinkage of the nasal cavity by the instillation of phenylephrine drops (3 drops in each nostril), lidocaine spray (10%) was used to anesthetize the nasal and oral mucosae. With the use of 5 mL of 2% lidocaine transtracheally, the tracheal and bronchial mucosae were anesthetized. Nasal intubation with a spiral tube #7 followed. Three experienced anesthesiologists in fiber-optic nasal intubation were involved in fibroscopy of patients, and each anesthesiologist performed both techniques. The fiberscope used during this procedure was a Scholly type Flexilux 2000 with a length of 41 cm and a diameter of 3.7 mm. After dipping the fiberscope into the lubricating jelly, we inserted it into the nasal cavity until it reached the pharynx, and an attempt to locate the vocal cords then ensued.</p><p>During this period, patients were awake and co-operated well with the anesthesiologists. Time was recorded in seconds, from the start of insertion of fiber-optic laryngoscope in the nares till visualization of vocal cords (T1) and from this to successful intubation when the endotracheal tube cuff was inflated (T2). If it was necessary, facilitating techniques such as bronchoscopy, head flexion, and jaw thrusts were utilized. A time period of more than 180 s for the procedure or inability to intubate was considered as failed intubation, and the patient was then intubated using a different modality.</p><p>Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) version 12.

Nasal fiber-optic intubation can be as difficult as oral fiber-optic intubation. Differences in the definition of the difficulty between various studies might have produced these differences in the reported incidences; however, other factors such as a different size of fiberscope, or else the type and size of the endotracheal tube, might also have affected the incidence. The major reason for difficulty in advancing an endotracheal tube over a fiberscope is considered to be deviation of the course of the tube from that of the fiberscope (because of the gap between the two) towards the epiglottis, arytenoid cartilage, pyriform fossae, or esophagus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0014 CIT0015 CIT0016">14&#x02013;16</xref>). Marfin et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0005">5</xref>) showed that posterior structures of the laryngeal inlet are the sites of impingement during fiber-optic nasal intubation and suggested anti-clockwise rotation as its solution. Use of a spiral flexible tracheal tube, and aligning number 18 on the tube to the level of the nasal ala, had significantly improved the success rate of fibroscopy in our study. We chose number 18 because when this number is reached at the nasal alae, the endotracheal tube has sufficiently advanced to reach a point close to the vocal cords. In the NASAL-18 method, the tube acts as a tool that provides good alignment to guide the fiberscope through the nasal cavity to face the vocal cords. This may explain why T1 was shorter in the NASAL-18 group, though from this point there was no significant difference between endotracheal intubation times (T2) in the two groups. However, the NASAL-18 technique probably reduced fiberscope twisting as well as mucus secretions and bleeding as a consequence of milder traumatization of the upper airway tract that could be achieved due to a short T1, and all these put together helped to increase the success rate of nasal intubation.</p><p>Utilization of fiberscope without the use of any facilitating techniques has proven to be a difficult task. In this study we could see that the use of NASAL-18 technique allowed us to perform fibroscopy with greater ease and speed. The success rate for a quick and smooth intubation with the NASAL-18 method was about 83.3%, while this rate in the conventional method was at 67%. However, the power of this study to detect such a difference was only 16%. A large sample size is needed to compare the difference in more detail.</p><p>In conclusion, we can state that the NASAL-18 technique facilitates the success of fiber-optic nasal intubation in patients. The NASAL-18 method was found to be easier for the anesthesiologist and resulted in significantly faster glottic exposure. Although this technique needs to be explored by other researchers in larger studies in other craniomaxillofacial anomalies and other difficult cases of airway management, we believe that this technique has the potential ability to be added to the list of routine techniques of fiber-optic nasal intubation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>
