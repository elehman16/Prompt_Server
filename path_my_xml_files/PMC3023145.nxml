          previous investigations have been inconsistent. The present study was designed to
          determine the preventive effect of a dietary supplement from fruits and vegetables on
          common cold symptoms. In a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, healthcare
          professionals (mainly nursing staff aged 18&#x02013;65 years) from a university hospital
          in Berlin, Germany, were randomised to four capsules of dietary supplement (Juice
            Plus+<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) or matching placebo daily for 8 months, including a 2-month
          run-in period. The number of days with moderate or severe common cold symptoms within 6
          months (primary outcome) was assessed by diary self-reports. We determined means and
          95&#x000a0;% CI, and differences between the two groups were analysed by ANOVA. A total
          of 529 subjects were included into the primary analysis (Juice Plus+<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>:
          263, placebo: 266). The mean age of the participants was 39&#x000b7;9 (<sc>sd</sc>
          10&#x000b7;3) years, and 80&#x000a0;% of the participants were female. The mean number
          of days with moderate or severe common cold symptoms was 7&#x000b7;6 (95&#x000a0;% CI
          6&#x000b7;5, 8&#x000b7;8) in the Juice Plus+<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> group and 9&#x000b7;5

          (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0&#x000b7;023). The mean number of total days

It is a viral
      infectious disease of the upper respiratory tract, caused by a variety of viruses, with
      rhinoviruses and corona viruses as the most common. The leading symptoms include sneezing,
      runny or congested nose, sore throat, headache and coughing, typically lasting for about
      5&#x02013;10&#x000a0;d. On average, adults experience two to four colds per
        year<sup>(</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1"><sup>1</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>. Prevalence of the common cold is clearly associated with the seasons. In
      the Northern hemisphere, the frequency of common cold infections increases in autumn and
      winter and decreases in spring<sup>(</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1"><sup>1</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The course of the common cold is usually benign; however, it is a leading cause of absence
      from work and doctor visits, responsible for a marked economic burden including lost
      productivity and treatment costs. In the USA, the common cold is estimated to cause
      twenty-three million days of absence from work and cost $2 billion for over-the-counter
        medication<sup>(</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2"><sup>2</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Since there is no causal treatment for the common cold, therapy focuses on symptom relief. In
      addition, preventive strategies for the common cold include lifestyle measures such as
      avoiding infected people and regular hand washing during the winter<sup>(</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3"><sup>3</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>. Dietary supplements including herbs and vitamins have been suggested in
      the prevention of the common cold, but previous investigations including studies with
      Echinacea, an herbal supplement, found supplements to be not effective for the prevention of
      the common cold<sup>(</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4"><sup>4</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>, or yielded inconsistent results (several studies on the effect of vitamin
      C). A randomised controlled trial from Japan found a significant reduction of common cold
      episodes over a period of 5 years in participants with high-dose <italic>v</italic>. low-dose
      vitamin C intake, but no reduction in the duration or severity of the common
        cold<sup>(</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5"><sup>5</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>. A recently published Cochrane review has found no effect of vitamin C
      intake compared to placebo for the incidence of the common cold (with the exception of
      participants exposed to severe physical stress or very cold environments), while an overall
      reduction of 8&#x000a0;% in common cold duration was reported<sup>(</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6"><sup>6</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Juice Plus+<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (NSA, Collierville, TN, USA) is a dietary supplement
      composed primarily of juice powder concentrate from fruits and vegetables. It contains several
      antioxidants including vitamin C, vitamin E, &#x003b2;-carotene and folate, and it has been
      shown to increase plasma levels of antioxidants and folate and of &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T
      cells, which are believed to strengthen immune function<sup>(</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7"><sup>7</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>. One randomised study reported reduction in work days lost due to illness
      in the Juice Plus+<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> group compared to the placebo group<sup>(</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8"><sup>8</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>; however, the clinical benefit for preventing or reducing common cold
      symptoms over the winter season has not yet been tested in a large adult population.
      Therefore, the aim of the present study was to determine the effect of Juice
        Plus+<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> on the severity and frequency of common cold symptoms in a
      population considered at particular exposure.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1"><title>Methods and materials</title><sec id="sec1-1"><title>Study design and patients</title><p>In a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, volunteer participants were

          other significant cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, pulmonary, renal, pancreatic or liver
          disease; alcohol addiction or drug abuse; pregnancy or lactation; language limitations

          Charit&#x000e9; University Medical Center in Berlin, Germany, and screened by study
          staff. The period of enrolment was from 12 September 2008 to 2 October 2008.</p><p>The subjects were allocated to the Juice Plus+<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> group or the placebo
          group by computerised simple randomisation. The dietary supplement and the matching
          placebo were provided by the study sponsor and packaged in identical white bottles.
          Subjects were required to take four study capsules daily including two capsules in the
          morning with breakfast and two capsules in the evening with dinner over a period of 8
          months.</p><p>Baseline characteristics of subjects were assessed after screening and inclusion in the
          study by questionnaire. Common cold symptoms were documented by participants with a
          validated common cold diary during the entire study period<sup>(</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9"><sup>9</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>. The diary includes the following four symptom categories: cough,
          nasal symptoms, throat symptoms and general symptoms (fever, headache and aches), each
          with a possible severity of none, light, moderate or severe.</p><p>The primary outcome was the number of days with at least moderate (i.e. moderate or
          severe) common cold symptoms within 6 months after an 8-week run-in phase calculated from
          the common cold diary. Secondary outcomes of the present study were days with any common
          cold symptoms, common cold-related days unable to work, days with common cold-related
          medication use and health-related quality of life (SF-12). Compliance was assessed by pill
          count from returned bottles by study staff and calculated as proportion of capsules taken.</p><p>The present study was conducted according to the guidelines laid down in the Declaration
          of Helsinki and in accordance to International Conference on Harmonisation-Good Clinical
          Practice, and all procedures involving human subjects were approved by the Institutional
          Review Board (Charit&#x000e9; Ethics Committee). The study was registered at

        two participants were withdrawn due to chronic respiratory disease, one in the Juice

        (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0&#x000b7;313). Overall compliance was high in both
        the groups with 96&#x000b7;0&#x000a0;% in the Juice Plus+<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> group and
        96&#x000b7;5&#x000a0;% in the placebo group.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Intake of a dietary supplement from fruits and vegetables was associated with a
        20&#x000a0;% reduction in days of moderate or severe common cold symptoms during the
        6-month study period. The number of days with any common cold symptoms was not significantly
        reduced. Thus, the intervention appeared effective in the attenuation of symptom level. This
        finding is corroborated by fewer days with intake of common cold medication and a trend
        towards fewer days absent from work due to the common cold in the verum <italic>v</italic>.
        the placebo group.</p><p>The present study included an 8-week run-in phase, because it was assumed that the
        intervention would not be effective immediately. Indeed, no differences between the two
        groups were observed within the first 2 months of the study, while later in the trial
        (months 3&#x02013;6), a reduction in the days with moderate or severe common cold symptoms
        was found. It appears possible that an earlier and longer run-in phase would have resulted
        in a larger difference between the Juice Plus+<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> group and the placebo
        group.</p><p>Because the present study included only health professionals and primarily nurses, a
        predominantly female professional in Germany, the majority of participants were female,
        limiting the generalisability of the results. In addition, healthcare professionals may
        differ from the general population regarding socio-economic variables or health-related
        lifestyle. However, the reduction of days with common cold symptoms was observed quite
        consistently among several subgroups (e.g. participants with higher or lower fruit or
        vegetable consumption).</p><p>The primary outcome was assessed by a common cold diary, yielding a subjective measure of
        days with the common cold. However, it would be difficult to objectively assess the number
        of days with the common cold in a population consistently over several months. From a
        patient's perspective, the subjectively judged days with a cold might be the outcome of
        choice, and due to the double-blind design, the effect of the intervention should not be
        biased.</p><p>Given the widespread utilisation of concentrated dietary products, the present study has
        potentially important public health relevance. To our knowledge, it is the first randomised
        investigation focusing on the benefits of juice powder concentrate in subjects particularly
        exposed to patient contact. The confirmation of the present findings in other populations
        could contribute to the growing scientific basis of assessing the clinical importance of
        dietary supplements from fruits and vegetables.</p><p>In conclusion, intake of Juice Plus+<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> was associated with fewer number
        of days with at least moderate common cold symptoms. Whether long-term intake of Juice
          Plus+<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> could further reduce severity or even the frequency of common
        cold symptoms and the possible underlying mechanisms should be assessed in future
      studies.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>S. R. was involved in designing the trial and writing the trial protocol, calculated the
