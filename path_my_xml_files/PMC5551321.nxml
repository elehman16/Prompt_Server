id="sec1-4"><title>Discussion</title><p>Pain due to dentinal hypersensitivity is a largely subjective symptom and so achieving effective pain control requires careful assessment and regular review of the patient's experience of dental pain.</p><p>The satisfactory material for the treatment of the dentinal hypersensitivity is required to be nonirritant to the pulp, painless on application, should be easy to apply, rapid acting, long-term effective, and consistent.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Desensitizing pastes are the easy and economical option to relieve dentinal hypersensitivity, and majority of them contain potassium salts to numb the pain of hypersensitivity.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>The mechanism of action of the newer technologies such as pro-Argin and NovaMin seems to be binding of the exposed dentin tubules by the biologically formed product, hence causing reduction in the hypersensitivity.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>Arginine and calcium carbonate at the physiologic pH interact with each other and get bonded to the negatively charged dentin, hence forming a calcium-rich layer onto and into the tubules, consequently sealing them and resulting in the reduction of dentinal hypersensitivity.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>Whereas the herbal paste contains naturally derived potassium nitrate <italic>(Suryakshara)</italic> which seems to help in desensitization of the dental nerves and the other natural ingredients such as spinach <italic>(Palakya)</italic> contains natural oxalates which help in the formation of phytocomplexes and occlude the exposed dentinal tubules, and also the presence of clove (<italic>Lavanga</italic>) controls pain due to the obtundant action of eugenol.</p><p>The purpose of this study was to investigate which paste among these three can alleviate the symptoms of the patient immediately or in shorter duration, and results show that the mean change in VAS scores from baseline to after 2 weeks and from baseline to after 4 weeks was significantly more among Group 1 in comparison to Groups 2 and 3, so the reduction in the hypersensitivity was more in the Group 1 when compared to other groups.</p><p>In this study, the stimuli used were both tactile and evaporative, as it was recommended by Holland <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] that always more than one stimulus should be used because different stimuli stimulate different pain sensations of different intensities.</p><p>Other costly options such as iontophoresis and laser therapy exist, but they carry their own disadvantages such as cost, complex apparatus, and long-term ineffectiveness.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>All the groups
