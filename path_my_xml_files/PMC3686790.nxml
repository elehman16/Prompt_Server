For example, Freud <xref rid="pone.0065360-Freud1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> noted that many parents feel that &#x0201c;the child shall fulfil those wishful dreams &#x02026; which they never carried out&#x0201d; (p. 91). Similarly, Jung <xref rid="pone.0065360-Jung1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> observed that parents often desire their child &#x0201c;to compensate for everything that was left unfulfilled in [their own] lives&#x0201d; (p. 189). To be sure, these ideas are not just relics of an ancient past. Contemporary parenting experts similarly suggest that parents sometimes see their child as an object of their own unfulfilled dreams and ambitions (e.g., <xref rid="pone.0065360-Miller1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0065360-Weinhold1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>). Surprisingly, this hypothesis has never been tested. The present research provides its first empirical test.</p><p>Unfulfilled ambitions, like other lost opportunities, are what people typically regret most in life <xref rid="pone.0065360-Beike1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, and people often try to reframe their unfulfilled ambitions to make them less painful (cf. <xref rid="pone.0065360-Zeelenberg1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>). One way for parents to reframe their unfulfilled ambitions, we suggest, is through their children. Symbolic self-completion theory <xref rid="pone.0065360-Gollwitzer1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065360-Wicklund1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> holds that when people feel they have not fulfilled their ambitions, they often seek out symbols that complete their identities as &#x0201c;successful&#x0201d; individuals (e.g., cheering for a successful basketball player when one has failed in becoming one oneself). Parents may come to see their children as such symbols for their own success, and desire them to fulfill the ambitions they once held for themselves. Parents may feel that in their children their own unfulfilled ambitions can yet come true.</p><p>Of course, not all parents are inclined to transfer their unfulfilled ambitions onto their child. We propose that parents are especially inclined to do so when they see their child as part of themselves, more so than as a separate individual. A long tradition in psychology has held that people often incorporate close others, especially their children, into the self (e.g., <xref rid="pone.0065360-Allport1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0065360-James1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>; for empirical evidence, see <xref rid="pone.0065360-Aron2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0065360-Prelinger1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>). When people incorporate others into the self, they experience a sense of oneness with them&#x02013;&#x0201c;a sense of shared, merged, or interconnected personal identities&#x0201d; (<xref rid="pone.0065360-Cialdini1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, p. 483). They experience the others&#x02019; traits and behaviors as partially their own, and they experience the world partially from the others&#x02019; point of view <xref rid="pone.0065360-Aron2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065360-Cialdini1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065360-Cwir1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Consequently, when parents see their child as part of themselves, they may experience the child&#x02019;s achievements as if they were their own (cf. <xref rid="pone.0065360-Aron2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065360-Gardner1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0065360-McFarland1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>). When these parents feel they have not fulfilled their own ambitions, their child&#x02019;s achievements may easily come to function as a surrogate (cf. <xref rid="pone.0065360-Cialdini2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>). Thus, when parents see their child as part of the self and feel they have not lived up to their ambitions, they may be particularly likely to transfer their unfulfilled ambitions onto their child&#x02013;in an attempt to fulfill through their child the dreams and ambitions they once held for themselves.</p><sec id="s1a"><title>Present Research</title><p>The present research tested this hypothesis. To manipulate the feeling of not having fulfilled one&#x02019;s ambitions, parents were randomly assigned to reflect on either their own unfulfilled ambitions (experimental condition) or others&#x02019; unfulfilled ambitions (control condition). We expected that, when faced with their own unfulfilled ambitions, parents would transfer these ambitions onto their child, but only to the extent that they see the child as part of the self. We studied parents of children aged 8 to 15, because this is a time when pronounced individual differences exist in the extent to which parents perceive their children as part of the self <xref rid="pone.0065360-Collins1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065360-Steinberg1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Method</title><p>Participants were 73 parents (89% mothers) from the Netherlands of a child aged 8 to 15 (53% girls) recruited online (see <xref rid="pone.0065360-Gosling1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, for a review of the representativeness of online samples).

The research ethics committee of the faculty of Social and Behavioral Sciences of Utrecht University approved all procedures.</p><p>In the experiment proper, participants first completed the Inclusion of Other in the Self Scale (<xref rid="pone.0065360-Aron3" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0065360-g001">Figure 1</xref>), a well-established pictorial scale assessing the extent to which people see another person (i.e., their child) as part of themselves (1&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;<italic>not at all</italic>, 7&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;<italic>completely</italic>; <italic>M</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;3.62, <italic>SD</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1.27).

The present study is the first to test this idea, and shows that parents indeed desire their child to fulfill their unfulfilled ambitions, but only to the extent that they see their child as part of themselves. Consistent with symbolic self-completion theory <xref rid="pone.0065360-Gollwitzer1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065360-Wicklund1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, this occurred only after parents were faced with their own unfulfilled ambitions. In the control condition, inclusion of child in the self and transferred ambitions were unrelated. Bridging classical theories on the self <xref rid="pone.0065360-Wicklund1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065360-Aron1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> and parenthood <xref rid="pone.0065360-Freud1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065360-Miller1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, these findings indicate that when parents see their children as part of the self, they may attempt to fulfill through them the ambitions they were unable to fulfill themselves.</p><p>These findings indicate that parents sometimes desire their child to become successful in precisely those domains in which they have failed themselves. At first sight, this seems at odds with the self-evaluation maintenance model <xref rid="pone.0065360-Tesser1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065360-Tesser2" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, which holds that people feel threatened (rather than proud) when a close other, such as their child, performs well in a self-relevant domain. However, more recent research suggests that when this close other is incorporated into the self, people do take pride in the other&#x02019;s successes, even when these successes occur in a self-relevant domain <xref rid="pone.0065360-Gardner1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065360-McFarland1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Thus, incorporating children into the self may allow parents to bask in children&#x02019;s reflected glory.</p><p>Our findings provide novel insight into the psychological benefits of parenthood. Parents generally experience more meaning in life than non-parents do <xref rid="pone.0065360-Baumeister1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065360-Nelson1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, but little is known about <italic>how</italic> parents derive meaning from parenthood. Our research may solve one part of this puzzle: Parents may derive meaning from parenthood by vicariously resolving their unfulfilled ambitions through their children. Basking in children&#x02019;s reflected glory, parents&#x02019; feelings of regret and disappointment about their own lost opportunities may gradually resolve, and make way for pride and fulfillment.</p><p>To be sure, our study does not speak to the adaptive or maladaptive value of seeing children as part of the self. Previous work has found that when people perceive others to be included in the self, their relationships with them tend to be closer and more satisfying <xref rid="pone.0065360-Aron2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065360-Aron3" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Yet, in the context of parent-child relationships, perceiving others (i.e., children) as included in the self may have potential downsides. In particular, when the perceived parent-child overlap is so strong that parents fail to differentiate between their own and their children&#x02019;s perspectives (called &#x0201c;enmeshment&#x0201d;), children may have difficulty establishing an autonomous identity <xref rid="pone.0065360-Green1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065360-Manzi1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>.</p><p>Our findings identify new research directions. One interesting question is whether children&#x02019;s accomplishments actually make parents feel more successful themselves. Symbolic self-completion theory suggests that people feel successful especially when their symbols of success (in this case, their children&#x02019;s successes) are noticed by others <xref rid="pone.0065360-Gollwitzer2" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. This suggests that parents might sometimes feel inclined to showcase their children&#x02019;s accomplishments to the outside world, in an attempt to bolster their own feelings of success. Another question is whether the present findings extend beyond parent-child relationships. Because people readily incorporate close others in the self, regardless of whether they are in vertical (e.g., parent-child) or horizontal (e.g., romantic) relationships <xref rid="pone.0065360-Aron1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, our findings may represent a universal relationship mechanism to deal with unfulfilled ambitions. However, ambition transference might be especially likely to occur in parent-child relationships, for two reasons. First, the parent-child relationship cannot dissolve. Regardless of the quality of the relationship, parents always hold a genetic tie to their children <xref rid="pone.0065360-Wisman1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Second, compared to other relationship partners (e.g., romantic partners and friends), children typically have more time and opportunities ahead of them to fulfill their parents&#x02019; unfulfilled ambitions.</p><p>Our study is not without limitations. First, its sample consisted mainly of mothers. Because mothers may be more inclined than fathers to incorporate their children into the self <xref rid="pone.0065360-Cross1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, ambition transference may be more prevalent among mothers than fathers. Second, our study focused on parents&#x02019; <italic>desire</italic> that their child will fulfill their unfulfilled ambitions. Future research should examine how this desire translates into actual parenting practices (e.g., attempts to influence children&#x02019;s career choices). Third, because the transferred ambitions measure was developed for this study, evidence on its validity is currently limited. Future research needs to corroborate its validity.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Unfulfilled ambitions hurt many of us. An important task for psychologists is to identify how people deal with such disappointments. The present research has identified a striking way in which some parents deal with their unfulfilled ambitions, namely by transferring them onto their successor&#x02013;their child.
