            <abstract>
                <p>Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a chronic disease with an increasing trend in most of
                    the Western Countries. It may significantly impair the individual quality of
                    life (QoL) and also represents a social burden for its economic costs.
                    Levocetirizine (XYZAL; UCB Pharma) as a second generation, nonsedating
                    H1-antihistamine, has been shown to be clinically effective in patients with AR
                    in different randomized controlled trials. The XPERT (XYZAL in Persistent
                    Rhinitis Trial) is the first large, long-term clinical study involving patients
                    with persistent rhinitis as defined by ARIA (Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on
                    Asthma). The XPERT was a 6-month double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter,
                    multinational trial in 551 subjects. Adults with persistent rhinitis sensitized
                    to both grass pollen and house dust mites were randomized to receive
                    levocetirizine 5 mg/d or placebo. Two primary objectives were considered:
                    comparison of the Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ)
                    overall score and Total 5 Symptoms Score (rhinorrhea, sneezing, nasal
                    congestion, and nasal and ocular pruritus) (T5SS) between active and control
                    group over a period of 4 weeks. As secondary endpoints, similar evaluations at 1
                    week and 3, 4, 5, and 6 months, summary scores for a general health status
                    questionnaire (Medical Outcomes Survey Short Form 36), comorbidities,
                    pharmacoeconomic and safety evaluations. Levocetirizine significantly improved
                    both the RQLQ overall score and the T5SS from week 1 to 6 months (<italic>P
                    </italic>&#x0003c; .001). Medical Outcomes Survey Short Form 36 summary scores
                    were also improved in the group treated with levocetirizine with respect to
                    placebo. Treatment cessation because of lack of efficacy, comorbidities, and
                    overall costs of disease, and comorbidities per working patient per month
                    (160.27 vs 108.18) were lower in the levocetirizine group. In conclusion,
                    levocetirizine resulted to improve the quality of life and the symptoms related
                    to AR and also to reduce the overall costs of the disease after 6 months
                    treatment.</p>

            <p>Allergic rhinitis is a frequent chronic disease that may significantly impair
                health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Several studies and epidemiological data
                have shown that allergic rhinitis has an economically remarkable impact caused by
                work days loss, absenteeism, and poor task performance, with a global reduction in
                productivity. It is fundamental to remember the ARIA document published in
                    2001[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] where allergic rhinitis is divided
                into 4 categories: mild intermittent, moderate/severe intermittent, mild persistent,
                and moderate/severe persistent (depending on severity and duration of symptoms and
                quality of life). This classification has been recently confirmed at an
                international level[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] and a stepwise
                pharmacologic treatment is proposed on the basis of ARIA criteria. In all the
                categories mentioned before, a treatment based on the use of a second-generation
                nonsedating H<sub>1</sub>-antihistamine is recommended for the management of
                allergic rhinitis, according to ARIA guidelines.</p>
            <p>Levocetirizine (XYZAL; UCB Pharma, Brussels, Belgium) is an oral, nonsedating
                    H<sub>1</sub>-antihistamine that proved to be significantly effective in
                improving symptoms in patients with allergic rhinitis; it presents a good safety
                    profile[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8"
                    >8</xref>] and, for all these pharmacologic characteristics, is highly indicated
                as a first-line treatment in subjects with persistent allergic rhinitis (PER). The
                XYZAL in Persistent Rhinitis Trial (XPERT) is a remarkable study published in
                    2004,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] providing different clinical,
                HRQoL, and pharmacoeconomic assessments, applied over the long term, and using
                electronic diary cards, to evaluate the efficacy of levocetirizine in both HRQoL and
                economic aspects.</p>
            <p>Two primary outcomes were considered in the trial:</p>
            <p>&#x02022; To analyze and compare the effects of levocetirizine versus placebo on
                HRQoL, as evaluated through the Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire
                (RQLQ) overall score at baseline and after 4 weeks of treatment;</p>
            <p>&#x02022; To compare the mean Total 5 Symptoms Score (T5SS; sum of rhinorrhea,
                sneezing, nasal congestion, and nasal and ocular pruritus; score, 0-15), assessed
                for 24 hours over a period of 4 weeks of treatment.</p>
            <p>Secondary objectives of the study were to compare RQLQ overall score and symptom
                scores after 1 week and 3, 4.5, and 6 months of treatment. Other secondary
                objectives were as follows:</p>
            <p>&#x02022; The comparison of the effects on health status as measured by the Medical
                Outcomes Survey Short Form 36 (SF-36) questionnaire (physical and mental summary
                scores) after periods of 4 weeks, 3 months, 4.5 months, and 6 months;</p>
            <p>&#x02022; The evaluation of the rescue medication use over the 6-month treatment
                period;</p>
            <p>&#x02022; The assessment of levocetirizine safety during the 6-month trial
                period.</p>
            <p>The present survey also provided a relevant analysis of pharmacoeconomic data about
                the treatment of PER. It is a large multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled,
                double-blind, parallel group trial, involving more than 500 patients from 63 centers
                in 5 European countries (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, and Spain); in addition,
                it is the first long-term (6-month) trial carried out with an oral
                H<sub>1</sub>-antihistamine in PER, with important consequential implications on
                guide-lines criteria use and clinical practice.</p>
            <p>In the study, all the patients enrolled were 18 years old at least and presented
                symptoms related to PER (defined as allergic rhinitis symptoms lasting 4 days or
                more per week for 4 consecutive weeks or more per year). They also presented
                positive skin prick test or specific serum IgE (CAP System; Pharmacia Diagnostic,
                Uppsala, Sweden) for house dust mites and one pollen allergen (grass or
                    <italic>Parietaria</italic>, IgE level &#x0003e;3.5 U/mL) at least. Informed
                consent was obtained from all participants and the study was conducted according to
                good clinical practice and the Helsinki Declaration in 1996 and under permission of
                the respective institutional review boards. Demographic characteristics of the
                patients are described in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>.</p>

            <p>Globally considered, 76.4% of patients completed the study treatment, 80.9%
                levocetirizine and 71.8% placebo. Forty-five patients (16.5%) in the placebo group
                dropped out for absent or insufficient efficacy, with respect to 21 (7.6%) in the
                levocetirizine group (<italic>P </italic>= 0.0007 according to the Wilcoxon test).
                Other reasons for dropout were represented by withdrawal of consent for personal
                reasons (15, 5.5% placebo patients; 17, 6.1% levocetirizine patients), adverse
                events (8, 2.9% placebo; 11, 4.0% levocetirizine), and others (8, 2.9% placebo; 4,
                1.4% levocetirizine). One patient receiving placebo was lost to follow-up.</p>
            <p>Patients were enrolled at a randomization visit, after 1 week, if they presented a
                T5SS &#x0003e;6 of 15 for at least 4 days during the run-in period. All the
                randomized patients received 5 mg of levocetirizine or placebo orally each day,
                starting on the evening of the second visit and continuing for 6 months. All the
                patients included in the study were evaluated at the end of the first treatment week
                and again at weeks 4, 12, 18, 26, and 27, after another week's follow-up.</p>
            <p>Patients were excluded if they were pregnant or nursing mothers, women not using a
                medically accepted method of contraception, patients with ear, nose, or throat or
                eye infection during the 2 weeks preceding the first visit, and patients with asthma
                treated daily with other than an inhaled <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-agonist on
                demand. Patients that presented atopic dermatitis or urticaria requiring
                antihistamine or corticosteroid treatment, with other ear, nose, or throat diseases
                such as vasomotor rhinitis or nasal polyps, other clinically significant diseases
                such as glaucoma or cardiovascular or hepatic diseases, or any disorder disturbing
                absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of levocetirizine, were also
                excluded.</p>
            <p>All the patients could use nasal or ocular cromoglycate and, in case of unbearable
                impairment of the allergic rhinitis symptoms, after a minimum of 4 weeks of
                treatment, were permitted a maximum of 20 mg of oral prednisolone once daily for 5
                days, for a maximum of 2 prednisolone courses during the whole study. Compliance for
                both study and rescue medications was evaluated at each visit.</p>
            <p>Health-related quality of life is an important parameter because it considers the
                effect of both disease and treatment on a patient's life as subjectively
                perceived.</p>
            <p>The RQLQ is a disease-specific, validated, and reproducible tool for assessing HRQoL
                and how symptoms and treatments affect patients' physical, social, and emotional
                    status[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. It is characterized by 28
                items and 7 domains. All of the items have a score ranging from 0 (no trouble) to 6
                (major impairment). The RQLQ was completed at visit 2 (randomization) and at visits
                3 to 7, or at the end of the study treatment in case of withdrawal.</p>
            <p>The SF-36 is another well-validated questionnaire to evaluate health status, to
                assess the impact of various diseases, such as allergic rhinitis,[<xref
                    ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and to compare the effects of various
                treatments. Through 36 questions, it measures 8 health dimensions domains condensed
                into 2 physical and mental health summary measures, with scores ranging from 0
                (worst reported health status) to 100 (best reported health status)[<xref
                    ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. All the patients had to complete the SF-36
                at each visit, except visit 3 (week 1), after the RQLQ.</p>
            <p>Rhinitis symptoms were assessed by using the T5SS. This total symptom score measures
                the symptoms normally responding to antihistamines, such as rhinorrhea, sneezing,
                nasal and ocular pruritus, and also nasal congestion, which is one of the most
                bothersome symptoms and maybe the most clinically relevant symptom in patients with
                PER. Through the use of electronic diaries, all the patients recorded their rhinitis
                symptoms daily, with 4-point scale score ranging from 0 (absent) to 3 (severe) for
                each symptom (Minidoc; Arracel, Sittingbourne, United Kingdom).</p>
            <p>The authors also considered the pharmacoeconomic aspect, including estimates for
                direct medical cost and indirect cost in the working population due to PER and to
                comorbidities such as asthma, sinusitis, otitis media, and upper respiratory tract
                infections. Direct costs consisted of the use of medical resources: hospitalization,
                physician visits, and concomitant medications. Indirect costs associated with PER or
                comorbidities, assessed through a weekly questionnaire on Minidoc, included
                absenteeism and presenteeism (that is, lost of productivity while still present at
                work). UCB Pharma clinical trials operations monitored the whole study and helped in
                providing the statistical analyses.</p>
            <p>A total of 724 patients were included at the screening visit, of whom 551 patients
                were randomized to received levocetirizine or placebo treatment.</p>
            <p>Regarding T5SS, a statistically significant difference was observed for nasal and
                ocular symptoms just from the first week after starting the treatment; they remained
                stable for the entire duration of the 6-month treatment period. Nasal congestion was
                improved significantly after the first month of treatment and continued for
                &#x0003e;6 months (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>)[<xref

            <p>The use of cromoglycates, nasal and/or ocular, as rescue medications in case of
                allergic rhinitis impairment, was higher in the placebo group during the first 4
                weeks (62.6% of the patients receiving placebo versus 49.3% of the patients treated
                with levocetirizine; <italic>P </italic>= 0.002); moreover, an increasing trend of
                rescue medication use was observed in the placebo group over the entire 6 months of
                treatment: 13.6% versus 10.8% for prednisolone (<italic>P </italic>= 0.362) and
                75.8% versus 69.4% (<italic>P </italic>= 0.104) for cromoglycates.</p>
            <p>Levocetirizine improved QoL assessed by the RQLQ questionnaire and SF-36 as early as
                the first week of treatment. This improvement of the levocetirizine group versus
                placebo was confirmed for each RQLQ domain (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2"
                    >2</xref>, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). SF-36 summary scores
                followed a similar course[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In the group
                treated with levocetirizine, mean changes from baseline of physical and mental
                summary scores ranged from 3.65 to 5 and from 3.83 to 5.97, respectively, with
                respect to the placebo group where they ranged from 1.61 to 3.37 and from 2.79 to
                3.99. Between the two study groups, significant differences were recorded about mean
                changes after 3 and 4.5 months for the mental component summary score (both
                    <italic>P </italic>values &#x0003c;0.01) and after 4 weeks and 3, 4.5, and 6
                months for the physical component summary score (all <italic>P </italic>values
                &#x0003c;0.01). In a parallel manner to the RQLQ overall score, subjective
                improvement in the health condition seemed related to symptoms relief.</p>

            <p>Comorbidities were considered during the study: the most frequent were represented by
                upper respiratory infections and asthma. In an exploratory analysis of the XPERT
                study, levocetirizine reduced the percentage of patients with at least one asthma
                event to 7.4 (from 13.6 for placebo, <italic>P </italic>= 0.04) and reduced the mean
                number of asthma medication events from 0.23 per placebo patient to 0.11 (<italic>P

            <p>Levocetirizine was well tolerated and safe for a greater than 6-month period, making
                it suitable for chronic treatment. In the placebo group, 193 (70.7%) patients, with
                respect to 192 (69.1%) of the active group, recorded at least one adverse event at
                some point during the 6-month study. Adverse events were commonly represented by
                headache (23.2% placebo versus 24.5% levocetirizine), pharyngitis (20.5% versus
                19.8%), influenza-like symptoms (13.9% versus 14.0%), fatigue (7.0% versus 8.6%),
                sleepiness (1.8% versus 6.8%) and gastroenteritis (5.1% versus 2.9%). No
                hospitalizations occurred.</p>
            <p>Levocetirizine treatment also caused a reduction of the overall cost of the disease.
                All the cost parameters (direct and indirect) in fact presented a significant
                improvement in patients treated with levocetirizine versus placebo group. A
                long-term levocetirizine therapy presented lower costs compared with those of the
                untreated PER and its comorbidities (&#x020ac;350 per patient per month). Loss of
                work days was lower in levocetirizine than placebo group (0.18 days per patient per
                month versus 0.45 days per patient per month). Levocetirizine treatment produced
                cost savings to society of more than &#x020ac;150 per patient per month, consequent
                to patients' major ability to maintain work and daily activities (Table <xref

            <p>In conclusion, XPERT was the first prospective study of levocetirizine in
                ARIA-defined PER. This multicenter, multinational, randomized, double-blind,
                placebo-controlled, parallel-group study was innovative not only in terms of
                definition of allergic rhinitis but also for the large sample (550 patients),
                long-lasting treatment period (26 weeks), the study design, and the aim of the study
                (clinical efficacy, QoL, adverse events, comorbidities, and pharmacoeconomy/economic
                costs). Furthermore, it was closer to the real life and PER study model with respect
                to previous trials. PER frequently has debilitating symptoms that interfere with
                patients QoL, their daily activities, and their productivity. A rapid onset of
                action, effective and long-lasting treatment like levocetirizine appears to have, is
                very important for a satisfying treatment of PER. Levocetirizine is effective
                against all the symptoms related to allergic rhinitis and seems also able to reduce
                the minimal persistent inflammation characterizing patients' mucosal structures
                affected by PER.</p>
            <p>Levocetirizine is well-tolerated, safe, and suitable for continuous and long-lasting
                treatment. Furthermore, a long-term treatment with levocetirizine reduces overall
                costs (direct and indirect costs) for both PER and associated comorbidities, with a
                consequently important impact on socioeconomic aspects.</p>
            <p>Levocetirizine thus satisfies all the ARIA/EAACI efficacy and safety criteria and is
                suitable for long-term treatment of PER as a first-line drug among the
                second-generation antihistamines.</p>
