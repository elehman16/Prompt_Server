In China, 0.9% of the population has CHF, resulting in over four million sufferers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Mortality rates for CHF are high, even for patients compliant with the best available pharmaceuticals and medical devices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par27">Exercise intolerance is a primary symptom among patients with CHF, and a strong determinant of prognosis as well as reduced quality of life. Therefore, exercise has been an accepted adjunct therapy for CHF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], and has become a central component of cardiac rehabilitation. This is known as exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (EBCR) which has been shown to improve CHF patients&#x02019; exercise capacities, as well as their quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. It has thus been widely recommended internationally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Despite its benefits, the uptake of EBCR remains suboptimal, primarily due to low availability, especially in low- and middle-income countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In addition to low availability, multiple barriers such as unaffordability as well as other barriers to exercise&#x02014;often related to practical issues such as time, the practicality of travel to a rehabilitation center, or climate&#x02014;prevent eligible patients from participating in EBCR programs or regular exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Moreover, the hallmark symptoms (fatigue, dyspnea) and safety concerns frequently lead to decreased physical activity, and erode the self-confidence necessary to initiate and maintain regular exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], especially for those with limited mobility.</p><p id="Par28">Similar challenges of this poor EBCR compliance are also faced in China, where the key driver is low availability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. A recent national survey suggested that only 24% of the tertiary hospitals in China have EBCR services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. A local consensus document for EBCR is available in China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], but the practice patterns for EBCR in hospitals, as well as other medical care units, are still rudimentary and not standardized. There are currently few cardiologists who regularly add EBCR to their daily clinical practice for CHF patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Unfortunately, the standardized EBCR delivery models in high-income countries are not contextually feasible in the Chinese setting due to the lack of rehabilitation facilities and trained professionals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The delivery of EBCR in a specific setting should adopt an evidence-based approach, and more importantly, should be culturally appropriate and sensitive to individual needs and preferences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par29">Traditional Chinese exercise can play a role in the field of contextually adapted EBCR programs in China, and a recent systematic review supports its use for cardiovascular disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The physical effects of EBCR are related to its underlying exercise training intensity, and moderate-intensity aerobic exercise is recommended for an EBCR program for CHF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Although traditional Chinese exercise is usually classified as low-intensity exercise for the healthy, it can be considered moderate- or even high-intensity aerobic exercise for patients with CHF, when considering their generally older age and low functional capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In addition, traditional Chinese exercise is not only a physical, but also mental form of aerobic exercise which can improve perceived feelings such as quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. This equipment-free exercise might be ideal for settings with limited resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], as well as for CHF patients, because it can be done at home, reducing barriers such as weather, transportation, and costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par30">Two common traditional Chinese exercises are Tai Chi and <italic>Baduanjin</italic> (also called the &#x0201c;Eight-Silken-Movements&#x0201d; (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>)). They are both commonly accepted as being beneficial to one&#x02019;s health and have become community exercises throughout different regions in China. A multi-center randomized controlled trial (RCT) in the USA has shown that Tai Chi can significantly improve quality of life and motional status in patients with CHF, compared to usual care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Although <italic>Baduanjin</italic> and Tai Chi share some common characteristics, <italic>Baduanjin</italic> is less demanding for older CHF patients because: it has fewer movements (eight versus 24 for Tai Chi); it requires shorter durations (15 min versus 30 min for Tai Chi); and it is possible to do while sitting (versus Thai Chi which only has a standing form). Moreover, <italic>Baduanjin</italic> has been shown to be effective for CHF-related medical issues such as fatigue, cardiorespiratory endurance, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and resting heart rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Therefore, the integration of traditional <italic>Baduanjin</italic> in modern rehabilitation will provide CHF patients with a simple, inexpensive, and widely practicable EBCR delivery model which has the potential to be scaled up throughout China.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Baduanjin (standing and sitting forms) for the BESMILE-HF program</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2018_2531_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par31">Accordingly, a new EBCR program, BESMILE-HF, has been developed at the Guangdong Provincial Hospital of Chinese Medicine (GPHCM)&#x02014;a tertiary care hospital and one of the oldest and largest Chinese medicine hospital groups in China. <bold>BESMILE-HF</bold> is short for the <bold><italic>B</italic></bold><italic>aduanjin</italic>

The program also includes other components recommended in current guidelines such as education, evaluation, and consultancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], as well as a series of adherence strategies. Structured exercise trainings are not sufficient on their own: interventions must also include strategies to increase adherence and to maintain exercise compliance over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Self-efficacy (people&#x02019;s belief and confidence in their capability to exercise across problematic situations) is reported to be the most dominant factor in the uptake and maintenance of exercise among the CHF population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. However, the value of the BESMILE-HF program has yet been proven, and, therefore, a clinical trial is needed.</p><p id="Par32">This study (BESMILE-HF) aims to assess the efficacy, safety, and acceptability of the addition of the BESMILE-HF program to usual medications for CHF patients in China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].

Secondary objectives are to evaluate the effect of the BESMILE-HF program on: exercise performance, exercise self-efficacy, overall quality of life, hallmark symptoms such as dyspnea and fatigue, depression, cardiac function, levels of prognostic biomarkers/inflammatory indicators, hospitalization, use of medications and major adverse cardiac events.

Inspections will be performed regularly by the GPHCM Department of Science Research. All modifications are to be marked on the CRFs. Data managers will then recheck the data before logging it, and promptly notify the research team if any discrepancies are found. The database will be locked after all data has been cleaned. If participants withdraw from the trial during the study period, the reasons must be documented (if participants are willing) and the rate is to be statistically analyzed.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec38"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par115">The EBCR has been recommended in the guidelines for CHF, but it is still in its infancy in China where EBCR services are rare in most regions. The delivery of EBCR should adopt an evidence-based approach, as well as be culturally appropriate and sensitive to individual needs and preferences. The BESMILE-HF study will establish feasibility and provide preliminary evidence on the efficacy and safety of an EBCR program, which will apply <italic>Baduanjin</italic> as the core component in improving exercise capacity and quality of life in patients with CHF. In particular, the BESMILE-HF program has the potential to reach the subgroup of the CHF population with limited physical functional capacity and for whom more intense physical activity is not appropriate.</p><p id="Par116">A limited number of studies have emphasized the importance of individualizing exercise interventions. However, patients&#x02019; experience in CHF exercise interventions have not previously been investigated in the Chinese population. This knowledge would help clinicians and researchers in China to gain a context-specific understanding of adherence issues and how standardized interventions could be adjusted to fit individual needs, capacities, and circumstances. Therefore, the BESMILE-HF study will also explore the experience from participants&#x02019; perspectives using qualitative research.</p><p id="Par117">Methodological challenges for this study will arise from evaluating a complex intervention as part of EBCR such as (1) training of the whole research team, (2) issues pertaining to the exercise records, and (3) additional physical activity monitoring. Furthermore, due to the nature of intervention, blinding is impossible in this trial. We will make every effort to ensure that outcome assessors, laboratory technicians, data managers, and statisticians are unaware of the treatment allocations.</p><p id="Par118">Altogether, the results of the BESMILE-HF study might provide evidence for how to effectively deliver a contextually adapted EBCR program in China. While this study will lead to conclusions specific to the content, the findings are likely to be relevant for settings with similar lifestyles and demographic profiles, especially those with limited resources.</p></sec><sec id="Sec39"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par119">The pilot study is on-going and its recruitment began in August 2017. Data collection will finish in January 2018. Two main parts, including the RCT and the qualitative component of the BESMILE-HF study will commence in 2018.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec40"><p>
