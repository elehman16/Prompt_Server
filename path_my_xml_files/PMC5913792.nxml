The success of this treatment depends on the performance of a single stud attachment that is susceptible to wear-related retention loss. Recently developed biomaterials used in attachments may result in better performance of the overdentures, offering minimal retention loss and greater patient satisfaction. These biomaterials include resistant polymeric matrixes and amorphous diamond-like carbon applied on metallic components. The objective of this explanatory mixed-methods study is to compare Novaloc, a novel attachment system with such characteristics, to a traditional alternative for single implants in the mandible of edentate elderly patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p id="Par2">We will carry out a randomized cross-over clinical trial comparing Novaloc attachments to Locators for single-implant mandibular overdentures in edentate elderly individuals. Participants will be followed for three months with each attachment type; patient-based, clinical, and economic outcomes will be gathered. A sample of 26 participants is estimated to be required to detect clinically relevant differences in terms of the primary outcome (patient ratings of general satisfaction). Participants will choose which attachment they wish to keep, then be interviewed about their experiences and preferences with a single implant prosthesis and with the two attachments. Data from the quantitative and qualitative assessments will be integrated through a mixed-methods explanatory strategy. A last quantitative assessment will take place after 12&#x000a0;months with the preferred attachment; this latter assessment will enable measurement of the attachments&#x02019; long-term wear and maintenance requirements.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">Our results will lead to evidence-based recommendations regarding these systems, guiding providers and patients when making decisions on which attachment systems and implant numbers will be most appropriate for individual cases. The recommendation of a specific attachment for elderly edentulous patients may combine positive outcomes from patient perspectives with low cost, good maintenance, and minimal invasiveness.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par4">ClinicalTrials.gov, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/study/NCT03126942">NCT03126942</ext-link>.

Although a modest decline in the prevalence of this condition was reported for some European countries, there are still large numbers of edentulous individuals worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The prevalence is higher in elderly populations and can be expected to remain high for several decades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Edentulism is associated with greater disability and earlier mortality in the elderly, even after adjusting for confounders such as socioeconomic status and health behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The absence of teeth also poses a major predicament for wellbeing, as it has considerable negative impact on quality of life. Poorer oral function is closely associated with lower self-esteem and psychosocial discomfort [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">The major purpose of dental prostheses is to reduce masticatory impairment and poorer quality of life by replacing the lost teeth. The most common prostheses for edentulism are complete dentures, which cannot completely restore lost function, e.g. chewing performance is only 30% of that for dentate individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Many complete denture wearers are functionally impaired and, consequently, have considerable psychosocial discomfort. Such issues are mostly associated with mandibular dentures, making the mandible the primary target for dental implants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Many clinical studies highlight that the mandibular implant-retained overdenture is a cost-effective choice for edentulous individuals, resulting in better patient satisfaction and oral health-related quality of life compared to conventional dentures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. International consensus statements have recommended the use of two implants in the mandible as the standard of care for edentulism due to favorable results and lower costs than most implant-based treatment methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, this treatment may either not be viable in some cases due anatomic or physiological conditions that are common in elderly patients or may be unaffordable for potential recipients.</p><p id="Par18">The retention of a complete dental prosthesis by a single implant placed in the midline has arisen as a minimal implant-based treatment modality for the edentulous mandible. Single implant overdentures present potential advantages that may lead to their choice for certain patients. These advantages include reduced costs involved with the provision of dental care. This treatment can be especially advantageous for patients with low functional demands, such as the elderly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Other benefits for this specific population include minimum operative time and low morbidity. This latter aspect seems strongly correlated to the number of installed fixtures rather than their dimensions, at least when considering the anterior edentulous mandible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par19">Outcomes of single implant overdentures are favorable considering patient satisfaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and oral health-related quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. These measures are substantially increased after loading a single mandibular implant in conventional denture wearers. When compared to two-implant overdentures, differences in terms of patient satisfaction and oral health-related quality of life were reported to be insignificant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In addition, a recent systematic review revealed no significant between-treatment differences in terms of implant survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. However, treatment success rates tend to improve when avoiding immediate loading [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and machined implants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par20">From the biomechanical standpoint, the use of a single implant is not associated with poorer fixture behavior. Maeda et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] observed a favorable incidence of forces on fixtures when comparing single implant-retained mandibular overdentures to a two-implant retained prosthesis. This was found for both dome-shaped magnets and O-ball attachments. A finite element method simulation of mandibular overdentures suggests that single implants undergo favorable strain compared to numbers in the range of 2&#x02013;4, without harmful loading on abutments, peri-implant bone, or the edentulous ridge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Furthermore, the placement of an implant in the midline does not appear to increase the incidence of denture fractures when compared to two-implant overdentures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p id="Par21">Most studies on single-implant overdentures have used stud attachments, such as O-balls or cylindrical patrices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. These systems tend to considerably improve the performance of mandibular dentures, but require regular maintenance, including change or activation of matrices. Although the incidence of matrix maintenance for single implant overdentures is comparable to that of two-implant alternatives, more than half of patients may need some reactivation, tightening, or reattachment of retentive components over a single year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Such maintenance needs vary considerably among attachment systems and can be minimized by using large O-balls, e.g. 5.9-mm-wide patrices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Nevertheless, this may be clinically inconvenient due to the reduced bulk of denture bases following attachment insertion and, therefore, higher risk of fracture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par22">Alternatives to well-known attachment systems may result in lower maintenance needs and other favorable characteristics. One of those alternatives is a new type of attachment dubbed Novaloc, based on mechanical retention from a polyetheretherketone (PEEK) matrix on a cylindrical patrix, that may be more resistant to wear than the nylon used in other systems. The abutments also receive an amorphous diamond-like carbon surface coating that minimizes roughness and is intended to enhance resistance of the attachment components.</p><p id="Par23">In spite of the potential advantages of the Novaloc system for single implant overdentures, no previous trial has evaluated this system&#x02019;s performance. A search in PubMed for the terms [overdenture* AND (PEEK OR polyetheretherketone OR &#x0201c;Polyether ether ketone&#x0201d; OR &#x0201c;poly-ether-ether-ketone&#x0201d;)] revealed a single report on bar-clip systems (1 December 2017). This suggests that there are no published clinical studies on Novaloc or any other stud system based on PEEK matrices or carbon-coated patrices. An in vitro study, however, shows promising results regarding the long-term retention of PEEK matrices compared to the traditional Locator system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p id="Par24">In this mixed-methods randomized cross-over trial (RCT), we aim to produce evidence of the efficacy of using the Novaloc attachment system to retain single-implant mandibular overdentures, compared to a traditional cylindrical attachment (Locator), for edentate elder patients. The primary outcome of this study is ratings of general satisfaction on visual analog scale (VAS) measures following three&#x000a0;months of use with each attachment type. Through qualitative interviews, we will also describe what characteristics of these systems are considered important to patients when stating their satisfaction and preferences; we will use this rich descriptive data to help explain the quantitative RCT results.</p><p id="Par25">Secondary outcomes include: (1) specific domains of satisfaction (e.g. retention/stability and hygiene); (2) oral health-related quality of life (OHIP-EDENT); (3) economic variables; (4) perceived rotation of the mandibular overdenture; (5) clinician-based outcomes, i.e. success rate of implants/overdentures and clinical complications/maintenance needs; and (6) choice of attachment.</p><p id="Par26">Participants will keep their chosen attachments for another 12-month period and we will evaluate the same outcomes.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Study hypothesis</title><p id="Par27">The primary null hypothesis of the trial is that there is no difference in ratings of patient satisfaction for Novaloc and Locator attachments.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Design</title><p id="Par28">This study is a mixed-methods, superiority RCT in elderly edentulous patients who will use two different attachment types after receiving a single implant in the mandibular midline.

A researcher not involved with the trial will prepare these codes and envelopes, following a simple randomization method stratified by ridge morphology (favorable - Cawood and Howell&#x02019;s class III vs unfavorable/others). In spite of eventual imbalances in the number of participants per sequence, simple randomization can preclude prediction of allocation by researchers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p id="Par47">Although it will not be possible to blind participants and care providers to the treatments, researchers unaware of the participants&#x02019; allocations will conduct the outcomes assessment whenever applicable (blind assessor 1: patient-reported outcomes; blind assessor 2: cost data; refer to &#x0201c;Study Outcomes&#x0201d; below for details). We will also avoid mentioning to participants any expectation regarding performance of one system over the other. Appointments will be organized in such a way as to minimize communication between participants and to prevent potential contamination. We will request that participants keep their attachments confidential and not discuss them with the research member involved in the outcome assessment.</p><p id="Par48">To confirm blinding effectiveness, participants will answer which attachment they think they have (experimental or traditional) at the end of the six-month follow-up and their conviction about the strength of their response from 0 to 10 (&#x0201c;not at all certain&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;extremely certain,&#x0201d; respectively) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Study outcomes</title><p id="Par49">All patient-reported outcomes, except for prosthesis rotation, will be collected at baseline, together with sociodemographic data, including age, gender, level of education, and income.

A three-month period is enough to observe a significant decrease in the retention force of Locators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] but is of unlikely length for adverse events associated with other components. Moreover, a slightly longer period, i.e. six months, results in similar patient satisfaction with mandibular overdentures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Participants will be evaluated again 12&#x000a0;months following the cross-over trial for an appraisal of maintenance needs/adverse events. A 12-month period will be enough to reveal attachment maintenance events for most participants with Locators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], as well as some uncommon events, e.g. denture base fractures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par51">In each assessment session, participants will provide data on:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par52">Satisfaction with overdentures. The McGill VAS Satisfaction questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] will be used to measure general satisfaction (primary outcome), as well as satisfaction with other functional aspects of the prostheses using 100&#x000a0;mm VAS. Other aspects include ability to chew, comfort, stability, aesthetics, ability to speak, and ability to clean. Some of the 13 items in the questionnaire include ability to chew specific foods (lettuce, soft bread, hard cheese, steak, raw apple, and raw carrot). These were selected because they represented different textures and hardnesses and were ranked by a group of complete denture patients from &#x0201c;very easy&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;very difficult&#x0201d; to chew. Patients will rate their ability to chew these foods on a 100&#x000a0;mm VAS with anchors of &#x0201c;not at all difficult to chew&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;impossible to chew.&#x0201d; Patients will be trained to use this type of scale before answering the questionnaires. Previous studies have shown good properties for the McGill VAS Satisfaction questionnaire. Besides good internal consistency and reproducibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], its ability to discriminate between different clinical conditions denotes good construct validity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par53">Oral health-related quality of life. Participants will be asked to complete the Oral Health Impact Profile for edentulous people (OHIP-EDENT), which is an abbreviated version of the original 49-item OHIP that was tested specifically with edentulous populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. This questionnaire is composed of 20 items that can be grouped into subscales, representing different domains/dimensions of perceived impact, such as functional limitation or social disability. This abbreviated version shows good reliability and discriminant validity, similar to the original OHIP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Although seven subscales were originally purported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], we will use a four-domain model as recommended by recent factor analysis studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par54">Overdenture rotation. Patient perception of rotation of the mandibular overdenture will be assessed by two questions, as used by Kimoto et al.

Participants will be evaluated based on a standardized clinical form, which will be completed immediately following each appointment. Overdentures will be classified as successful if they can function in the way that they were intended, with additional retention provided by the attachment system. For the determination of implant success and survival, the implants will be classified at each data collection appointment according to Misch et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Clinical evaluation will also include the following parameters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]: (a) presence of plaque; (b) presence of calculus; (c) depth of peri-implant pockets; (d) bleeding on probing; (e) signs of swelling or inflammation. The presence of suppuration and tenderness will also be noted. Probing depth will be measured at four sites for each implant (mesially, labially, distally, and lingually) using a periodontal probe.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par56">Treatment costs. We intend to gather data on both direct and indirect costs to compare the differences in cost-effectiveness between the two attachments systems. The effectiveness is measured by any difference in overall patient satisfaction (primary outcome) at baseline and at the three- and six-month follow-up visits. The size of the effect may vary at each of the two intervals. This analysis is based on the following assumptions: (1) the total cost at the end of the 6-month evaluation period would be the same between sequences 1 and 2; (2) the implant placements are deemed clinically successful at given intervals (three and six&#x000a0;months post treatment); (3) no surgical or prosthetic complications are encountered during the six-month post-treatment period. Cost-effectiveness between the two attachments systems will be determined by calculating incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER), based on baseline&#x02013;post-intervention differences in satisfaction.</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Sample size estimation</title><p id="Par57">Sample size for the quantitative phase was determined based on the primary outcome of this study (patient satisfaction).

In the case of unbalanced missing data among interventions or loss of 5% (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;1) or more of participants, different strategies will be attempted for imputing primary outcome data, as recommended by Dziura et al.

In the case of &#x0201c;missing not at random&#x0201d; (MNAR) data, we will repeat analyses after a baseline-observation-carried-forward approach (i.e. withdrawn participants will be considered as dissatisfied as before receiving implants).

We will adopt a descriptive approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], conducting individual semi-structured interviews, that constitutes a powerful method to obtain an in-depth understanding of patients&#x02019; experiences and preferences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].</p><p id="Par63">We will conduct individual semi-structured interviews with all study participants (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;26).

Since this is an explanatory mixed-methods design, we will follow appropriate guidelines, in that the interview guide will be developed based on the results of the quantitative outcomes and on which results require further explanation or clarification. Participants will be encouraged to express themselves spontaneously in a conversational manner.
