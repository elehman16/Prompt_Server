As DTG is administered to HIV-1&#x02013;infected women receiving oral contraceptives, assessing the potential for drug interactions was warranted. <bold>Objective:</bold> To determine the impact of DTG on the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of a common oral contraceptive, norgestimate/ethinyl estradiol (NGM/EE; Ortho-Cyclen; Ortho-McNeil-Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc, Raritan, NJ). <bold>Methods:</bold> This randomized, 2-period, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted within 1 menstrual cycle at 1 clinical center in the United States; 16 women were enrolled. Participants received NGM 0.25 mg/EE 0.035 mg throughout the study. During days 1 to 10, they were randomized to receive twice-daily DTG 50 mg or matching placebo with food and switched to the other treatment during days 12 to 21. <bold>Results:</bold> Ratios of area under the concentration-time curve from time 0 until end of the dosage interval (AUC<sub>0-&#x003c4;</sub>), maximum plasma concentration, and concentration at the end of the dosage interval of norelgestromin with DTG treatment to the same PK parameters with placebo treatment were 0.975, 0.890, and 0.932, respectively; for EE, ratios were 1.03, 0.99, and 1.02, respectively. No significant differences in luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and progesterone were detected on days 1, 10, 11, 21, and 22. DTG steady-state AUC<sub>0-&#x003c4;</sub> was similar to historical data. No severe or grade 3/4 adverse events occurred. <bold>Conclusions:</bold> DTG had no effect on NGM/EE PK or PD. NGM/EE can be administered with DTG without dose adjustment.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>integrase inhibitor</kwd><kwd>HIV</kwd><kwd>drug interaction</kwd><kwd>healthy subjects</kwd><kwd>pharmacokinetics</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="section1-1060028015580637"><title>Introduction</title><p>Dolutegravir (DTG; Tivicay; ViiV Healthcare, Research Triangle Park, NC) is an HIV-1 integrase strand transfer inhibitor approved in the United States for once-daily or twice-daily dosing without pharmacokinetic (PK) boosters.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-1060028015580637" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> DTG is metabolized primarily by uridine 5&#x02032;-diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) with cytochrome P450 (CYP) playing a minor role.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-1060028015580637" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> However, DTG displays no significant CYP or UGT inhibition or induction<sup><xref rid="bibr2-1060028015580637" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> and does not require dose adjustments of other drugs that are metabolized by CYP3A, such as midazolam and methadone.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-1060028015580637" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bibr4-1060028015580637" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> DTG is an inhibitor of renal transporters, including organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2), and has the potential to increase the concentration of drugs that are OCT2 substrates, for example, metformin.</p><p>Norgestimate/ethinyl estradiol (NGM/EE; Ortho-Cyclen; Ortho-McNeil-Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc, Raritan, NJ) is a widely prescribed combination oral contraceptive, containing both a synthetic estrogen and progesterone,<sup><xref rid="bibr5-1060028015580637" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> administered as a fixed dose of NGM 0.25 mg and EE 0.035 mg throughout the 21-day dosing cycle, with an additional 7 placebo tablets to maintain a 28-day cycle. Oral contraceptive components are primarily metabolized through the oxidative, reductive, and conjugative pathways. NGM undergoes both oxidative and reductive metabolism. CYP is involved in the oxidative metabolism of EE,<sup><xref rid="bibr6-1060028015580637" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> and the induction of CYP has been shown to increase the clearance of oral contraceptives, thus decreasing their plasma concentration.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-1060028015580637" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="bibr8-1060028015580637" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Clinical evaluations of drug interactions between antiretroviral drugs showed that concentrations of oral contraceptives may be reduced by ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitors, cobicistat-boosted elvitegravir, efavirenz, and nevirapine, and alternative methods of contraception should be used.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-1060028015580637" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Antiretrovirals that do not interact with oral contraceptives provide greater treatment flexibility.</p><p>Because DTG is administered to HIV-1&#x02013;infected women receiving oral contraceptives, a study to assess the potential for a drug interaction was warranted.

Although 50 mg once daily is the most commonly used dose in phase III trials, the 50-mg twice-daily dose is approved in the United States in those resistant to integrase strand transfer inhibitor<sup><xref rid="bibr12-1060028015580637" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> and was selected for use in this study as the most likely scenario in which a potential drug interaction would be observed. The tolerability of NGM/EE and DTG 50 mg twice daily strongly suggests that the more commonly used 50-mg once-daily dose in HIV-1&#x02013;infected individuals will also be well tolerated in combination with oral contraceptives.</p><p>The exposure of DTG with the 50-mg twice-daily dose reported in this trial is higher than in previous studies that evaluated this dose.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-1060028015580637" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bibr13-1060028015580637" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> The increase is a result of administration of DTG with food in this study, which has been shown to increase AUC by 33% to 66%, depending on the fat content of the meal.<sup><xref rid="bibr14-1060028015580637" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> DTG can be given without regard to meals in HIV-infected patients.</p><p>There were limitations to study design and data extrapolation that should be addressed. The traditional study design for evaluating the effect of a drug on an oral contraceptive measures concentration of the estrogen and progestin components during a 28-day period with the oral contraceptive alone and then again in a second 28-day cycle combined with the investigational drug. This study used a nontraditional study design that implemented a 2-period crossover design within 1 menstrual cycle. The advantages of this design include a shorter study duration, which minimizes the number of individuals who may drop out and also limits cycle-to-cycle variability while providing a more stringent evaluation of safety and tolerability. However, the variation in levels of endogenous sex hormones and the expression of drug-metabolizing enzymes within a single menstrual cycle is a limitation of the 1-cycle design and must be taken into consideration. Therefore, in this study, a placebo-controlled crossover design was implemented to minimize this limitation of the 1-cycle design. Previous data suggest that oral contraceptive concentrations will not demonstrate wide variability within a cycle.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-1060028015580637" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="bibr16-1060028015580637" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr17-1060028015580637" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Therefore, we also evaluated whether there was a period effect&#x02014;that is, whether DTG administration in the first part of the cycle had a different effect on NGMN and EE compared with administration in the latter part of the cycle. The results of this analysis demonstrated that the order in which DTG or placebo treatment was given had no effect on concentrations of NGMN and EE.</p><p>NGM/EE is a combination estrogen-progestin oral contraceptive.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-1060028015580637" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Although it was selected in this study for its widespread use and fixed dose throughout the cycle, there are a number of similar products. Most combination oral contraceptives use EE for the estrogen component, whereas the progestin component may include norethisterone, levonorgestrel, gestodene, desogestrel, or NGM.<sup><xref rid="bibr18-1060028015580637" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Although there are some differences in metabolism among oral contraceptives, most oral contraceptives are primarily metabolized by CYP isozymes, including CYP3A4, as well as through sulfate and glucuronide conjugation in the liver and gut.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-1060028015580637" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> The lack of effect of DTG on both the estrogen and progestin components in this study and on CYPs and UGTs based on in vitro data supports its use with caution with other brands of oral contraceptives.</p><p>In conclusion, the results of this study demonstrate that DTG did not affect the PK or PD of combination estrogen and progestin oral contraceptives, indicating that contraceptive efficacy should be maintained during coadministration of these drugs. NGM/EE can be administered with DTG without dose adjustment.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; Note:</bold> ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT01498861.
