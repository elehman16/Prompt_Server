The purpose of this study was to prove the hypothesis that verbal instructions combined with images showing the severe consequences of poor compliance can increase retainer use.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This study was a randomized controlled trial. The sample was recruited from Wenzhou, People&#x02019;s Republic of China, between February 2013 and May 2014, and 326 participants were randomized into three groups. Patients and parents in Group A (n=106) were given routine retainer wear instructions only; in Group B (n=111), images illustrating the severe consequences of poor compliance with Hawley retainer use were shown to patients, combined with routine instructions; and in Group C (n=109), images illustrating the severe consequences of poor compliance with Hawley retainer use were shown to patients and parents, combined with routine instructions.

To solve these problems, retainers are used to prevent relapse until gingival and periodontal reorganization and skeletal growth are completed. Various types of retainers are applied, including fixed retainers, removable Hawley retainers, and vacuum-formed retainers.<xref rid="b7-ppa-9-1525" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b9-ppa-9-1525" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Most orthodontists prescribe 6 months of full-time wear of a removable retainer followed by part-time wear for life.<xref rid="b10-ppa-9-1525" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> It is well known that patient compliance with wearing Hawley retainers is particularly important for retention, because noncompliance can destroy the best treatment outcomes. In cases in which the long-term treatment outcome is unsatisfactory, it is difficult to evaluate to what extent noncompliance contributed, or whether the failure was caused by biological factors. Many researchers have focused on identifying factors correlated with compliance and cooperation. Nanda and Kierl<xref rid="b11-ppa-9-1525" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> attempted to predict patients&#x02019; compliance with retainer use by measuring attitudes toward treatment, social desirability, need for approval, and need for achievement. None of these variables adequately predicted the cooperation of a patient with orthodontic treatment. Mehra et al<xref rid="b12-ppa-9-1525" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> found that patient-related items, such as desire for treatment and relationship with parents, ranked as important factors motivating patients to comply. Verbal praise and communication are rated as important methods for improving compliance. Egolf et al<xref rid="b13-ppa-9-1525" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> found that the pain and inconvenience associated with intraoral elastics or headgear were inversely correlated with compliance. These findings may also apply to retainer wear.</p><p>Many studies have investigated suitable methods for measuring a patient&#x02019;s removable appliance wear time,<xref rid="b14-ppa-9-1525" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="b15-ppa-9-1525" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> so quantifying patient compliance over the whole therapy period can routinely be performed in an orthodontic office.<xref rid="b16-ppa-9-1525" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b18-ppa-9-1525" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> However, few studies have researched the factors that predict compliance with retainer use or interventions that improve compliance with removable appliances or retainers.<xref rid="b13-ppa-9-1525" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Patient compliance was found to be influenced by psychological and sociodemographic traits.<xref rid="b19-ppa-9-1525" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Changes in patients&#x02019; knowledge about the severe consequences of poor compliance could alarm them and increase their retainer use. The primary aim of this clinical trial was to test the effectiveness of verbal instructions combined with images showing the severe consequences of poor compliance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Ethical approval for the study was granted by the Health Research Ethics Board at Wenzhou Medical University (WYKQ2014002). Each patient and parent was given oral and written information and had to provide written consent before being included in the trial. The research was designed as a prospective, randomized controlled three-arm parallel trial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ppa-9-1525">Figure 1</xref>). The sample size for each group was calculated as n=97 (ie, a total of 288 for three groups), based on type II error at 0.10 (90% power), with a 5% significance level to detect a difference of 2 hours of daily wear time (SD =4.2 hours according to previous estimates). To account for possible dropouts and loss to follow-up during the study, we recruited 120 patients in each group. The final number of patients completing the study was 302 patients from Wenzhou, People&#x02019;s Republic of China (age range, 11&#x02013;18 years), wearing Hawley retainers.</p><p>The subjects were recruited for this pilot study between February 2013 and May 2014, based on specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. Patients fulfilling the following criteria were included: age range 11&#x02013;18 years, fixed appliance involving both arches, under treatment before recruitment, and willing to wear a Hawley retainer. Patients with the following conditions were excluded: single-arch or sectional fixed appliance treatment, learning difficulties, cleft lip or palate, craniofacial syndrome, or requirement for tooth replacement on the retainer as a temporary measure.</p><p>A simple randomization with no blocking was used in this research. Eligible patients were randomly assigned to three groups based on computer-generated random sequencing. To avoid subjective bias, we applied a double-blind method. The patients did not know their allocation, and the investigator was blinded to the allocation. Three trained researchers introduced the visual method to the participants and their parents according to the random sequencing. In view of the ethical issues and patients&#x02019; equal rights for oral health education, all patients and parents received routine instructions about retainer wear. The parents/guardians who were living full-time with the patients were asked to receive instructions of retainer wear at the time of recruitment.</p><p>The patients were randomly assigned to one of three intervention groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ppa-9-1525">Figure 1</xref>). Group A (control group) was provided with routine retainer wear instructions only; in Group B, images illustrating the severe consequences of poor compliance with Hawley retainer use were shown to patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ppa-9-1525">Figure 2</xref>); and in Group C, images illustrating the severe consequences of poor compliance with Hawley retainer use were shown to patients and parents.</p><p>According to orthodontic researches and clinic, crowding and space relapse were the most common relapses, and most patients were concerned about it. Thus, we chose classic relapse images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ppa-9-1525">Figure 2</xref>) from our clinic to show to the patients.</p><p>The routine instructions about retainer wear included chairside verbal instructions, a written explanation of recommended wear time, and verbal information for the patient and parents about the results of poor compliance with Hawley retainer use. When the investigator showed the images illustrating the severe consequences of poor compliance with Hawley retainer, he told the treatment history of these two patients and pointed out the relapse in the picture; meantime, he warned the patients about the severe consequences of poor compliance according to their own conditions. The retention protocol required the patients to wear Hawley retainers full-time after debonding and to revisit after 3 months. Full-time compliance meant that patients should wear the retainer at all times except when eating or toothbrushing.</p><p>A questionnaire (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ppa-9-1525">Figure 3</xref>), with a cover letter explaining the purpose of the study, was used to identify how long retainers were worn in the 2 weeks before first revisit and any reasons for not wearing the retainers as instructed. The list of reasons was compiled from interviews with 50 patients who previously wore retainers, and was approved by three professors of orthodontics. After the patient completed the questionnaire, we checked the accuracy of the wear time response by communicating with the parents living with the patient. SPSS software (version 17, SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA) was used to calculate frequencies and percentages and to run one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to detect differences in compliance among the three groups. The significance level (&#x003b1;) for ANOVA was set at <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The demographic characteristics of the participants are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-ppa-9-1525">Table 1</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ppa-9-1525">Figure 1</xref> shows the CONSORT diagram of the clinical trial. Three hundred and sixty patients were recruited and assessed for eligibility. Twenty patients did not meet the inclusion criteria, and 14 patients declined to join in the trial. A total of 326 patients were recruited for the randomized controlled trial (Group A, 106; Group B, 111; Group C, 109); after 3 months of retention, 24 patients (Group A, 9; Group B, 9; Group C, 6) were lost to follow-up because of moving to other places or being unwilling to return for review. <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-ppa-9-1525">Table 2</xref> shows the mean daily wear time of the three groups. The mean daily wear time in Group C (15.09&#x000b1;4.13 hours) was significantly greater than that in Group A (12.37&#x000b1;4.58 hours, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01) and Group B (13.50&#x000b1;4.22 hours, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05). The mean daily wear time in Group B was greater than in Group A, but was not significant (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003e;0.67).</p><p>A total of 244 patients wore retainers for less than 18 hours per day for reasons listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t3-ppa-9-1525">Table 3</xref>. The top three reasons for poor compliance were: &#x0201c;I forget to wear it&#x0201d; (51.2%); &#x0201c;It is bothersome frequently inserting and removing the retainer&#x0201d; (41.8%), and &#x0201c;I do not think it is important&#x0201d; (32%). Other reasons for poor compliance related to the retainer being uncomfortable and affecting appearance and pronunciation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Approaching positive targets and avoiding negative ones is a central requirement in motivation, and avoidance of harmful things reflects a fundamentally evolved motive that influences the way people perceive and respond to their social world.<xref rid="b20-ppa-9-1525" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> The motivation to seek orthodontic treatment is complicated; however, it has been proven that the desire for better dental esthetics is one of the most important motivations.<xref rid="b21-ppa-9-1525" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b23-ppa-9-1525" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> When motivation is lost, there is a danger that a patient&#x02019;s compliance will suffer, and this could lead to premature termination of treatment or a compromised result. External influences play an important role in motivating teenagers to undergo treatment, especially the attitudes and perceptions of family members, which provide the foundation on which a child builds his or her self-perception of dental&#x02013;facial appearance.<xref rid="b22-ppa-9-1525" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="b24-ppa-9-1525" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="b25-ppa-9-1525" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Based on previous research, our study was designed to test the hypothesis that negative images can increase awareness of the results of poor retention and may improve the patient&#x02019;s compliance, and that cooperation from the patients&#x02019; parents is also an important factor.</p><p>The results of this study suggest that patient compliance can be improved by showing severe relapse pictures to the adolescent patients, but the improvement is not significant. These findings differ slightly from the research of Peng et al,<xref rid="b26-ppa-9-1525" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> who educated patients about the severe consequences of biofilm accumulation using visual aids and observed significant improvements in oral hygiene. It was hypothesized that adolescents&#x02019; immature mentality and lack of knowledge about orthodontic treatment (especially, the importance of retention) were the main reasons for poor compliance.<xref rid="b27-ppa-9-1525" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="b28-ppa-9-1525" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> In our study, the highest level of compliance was found in Group C, in which the adolescent patients&#x02019; parents were shown images of severe relapse. This finding, demonstrating that parents play an important role in the cooperation of adolescent patients, is consistent with the results of previous research.<xref rid="b27-ppa-9-1525" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="b28-ppa-9-1525" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> The median wear time was 12.4 hours per day in Group A, which is higher than in previous studies.<xref rid="b29-ppa-9-1525" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="b30-ppa-9-1525" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> This could be because of differences in the study population and timing methods. Previous research has suggested that subjective factors could result in overestimation of compliance, and patients&#x02019; feedback about retainer wear time tends to be subjective;<xref rid="b31-ppa-9-1525" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> therefore, future studies should incorporate the use of an objective instrument to measure retainer compliance.</p><p>In this research, we identified barriers to compliance with removable retainer use during orthodontic treatment. The major reasons for poor cooperation in adolescent patients included: &#x0201c;I forget to wear it&#x0201d;; &#x0201c;It is bothersome frequently inserting and removing the retainer&#x0201d;; &#x0201c;I do not think it is important&#x0201d;; and &#x0201c;It is uncomfortable&#x0201d;. More than half of the subjects (51%) regularly forgot to wear their retainer. Schott and Ludwig<xref rid="b32-ppa-9-1525" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> found that the majority of young patients showed discontinuous wear behavior, with a typical pattern of not wearing the device on some days and then trying to compensate for this by wearing the device more on other days. Therefore, it is important for orthodontists to do whatever they can to encourage patients to wear their retainers. Eppright et al<xref rid="b33-ppa-9-1525" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> found that a text message reminder system was effective for improving oral hygiene compliance in orthodontic patients, and these findings might apply equally well to retainer wear. Once the parents recognized the serious consequences of poor retention, they tended to supervise the patient and remind them to wear the retainer, which could explain why compliance was best in Group C. We should improve patient education about orthodontics to increase knowledge of the importance of retention. In some instances, we may choose a fixed retainer for certain patients to avoid the undesirable results of noncompliance arising from inconvenience or discomfort. It is notable that poor esthetics and effects on pronunciation were not found to be major reasons for poor compliance.</p><p>In general, the ability to predict treatment compliance and retainer wear behavior would be valuable in orthodontic treatment, although it is a very complex issue.<xref rid="b11-ppa-9-1525" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="b12-ppa-9-1525" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Parental influence, the age of the patient, retainer design, the sex of the patient, the orthodontist&#x02019;s prescription, and fear or disregard of relapse are all factors that may influence patient behavior. Our research provides a feasible and effective method to improve patient compliance with retainer use, and this positive effect is consistent with studies in other areas.<xref rid="b19-ppa-9-1525" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="b26-ppa-9-1525" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Most adolescent patients and parents are not profoundly aware of the severe consequences of poor retention. Verbal instruction is an auditory stimulus which works particularly well when combined with visual stimuli.<xref rid="b34-ppa-9-1525" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> This is why relapse images can reinforce perceptions about the results of poor retention and may lead to improved patient compliance. The two main limitations of this study were that it used a subjective method to measure compliance, which could have resulted in an overestimation of compliance,<xref rid="b31-ppa-9-1525" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> and that all the patients were from Zhejiang Province, People&#x02019;s Republic of China, and they had a relatively low level of knowledge about orthodontic retention
