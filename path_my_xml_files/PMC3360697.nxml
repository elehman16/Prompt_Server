Upon topical application of insulin cream, the wound healing time of diabetic animals was normalized, followed by a reversal of defective insulin signal transduction. In addition, the treatment also increased expression of other proteins, such as eNOS (also in bone marrow), VEGF, and SDF-1&#x003b1; in wounded skin.

This study was double-blind and placebo-controlled in design, and conducted in the State University of Campinas, Brazil, from January 2004 to September 2007. Eligible patients were between 18 and 80 years old, both male and female individuals with type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus, and with wounds that had not healed for at least three months, with serum creatinine below 1.5 mg/dL. Patients were excluded: if they did not satisfy the inclusion criteria; if the wounds were infected; if cellulites, venous stasis, inadequate perfusion, or osteomyelitis were present; or if the patients were unable to attend the follow-up. The study was conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the University of Campinas for clinical trials and the Declaration of Helsinki. We also obtained ethics approval for the human study from the University Hospital of the State University of Campinas, where participants were recruited and human experimentation was conducted (Clinical Trials identifier: NCT01295177); The approval is available as supporting information; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0036974.s002">Approval S2</xref>.

All patients had undergone debridement for the ulcer, followed by standard moist gauze treatment with 0.9&#x00025; normal saline for at least four weeks, resulting in no more than a 15&#x00025; reduction in ulcer dimensions. All target wound surfaces were &#x02265;2.0 cm and &#x02264;18 cm in any one dimension after debridement. Peripheral neuropathy was evaluated by two methods: monofilament testing using a Semmes-Weinstein 5.07 (10 g) monofilament and the base of a vibrating tuning fork (C 128 Hz). From January 2004 to September 2007, 46 patients were assessed for eligibility for this study. However, 21 patients were excluded due to at least one of the following exclusion criteria: presence of cellulitis (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;4), venous stasis (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;5), inadequate perfusion (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;2), osteomyelitis (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;7), and patient's inability to attend clinics for follow up (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;3). All patients included in the study provided a written informed consent. Twenty-five patients were initially enrolled; however, three of them did not succeed in completing the protocol due to inability to attend the clinic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0036974-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). All patients included in this study had type 2 diabetes: 11 patients used subcutaneous insulin and oral anti-diabetic drugs, and 11 patients used only oral anti-diabetic drugs. Initial laboratory analysis consisted of leukocyte and platelet count, hemoglobin, glucose, creatinine, and glycosylated hemoglobin. During the follow-up, only glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin were evaluated. The patients were randomly assigned to receive treatment with placebo cream (cream containing vehicle but without insulin; group P), or insulin cream (group I) for eight weeks. The patients were instructed to clean their wounds with sterile gauze and 0.9&#x00025; sterile saline daily prior to assessment, putting the cream (placebo or insulin) and the dressing on afterwards. All wounds were photographed digitally at the beginning of the study and then at least every other week during the weekly visits of the patients to the hospital.

These alterations were completely reversed by topical administration of an insulin cream in diabetic animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0036974-g005">Fig. 5D&#x02013;F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3f"><title>Effect of the topical insulin cream on wound healing in the skin of diabetic patients</title><p>Twenty-two patients, eight females and 14 males, completed the eight-week study protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0036974-g001">Fig. 1</xref>).

However, when the wounded skin of diabetic rats is treated with a topical insulin cream, an acceleration of wound healing occurs, in association with a recovery in the proteins of the insulin signaling pathways <xref rid="pone.0036974-Saltiel1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>.</p><p>Our data show that the expression of proteins involved in early steps of insulin action, i.e., IR/IRS-1,2/AKT, are increased in the healing tissue of wounds, compared to intact skin. AKT has the ability to phosphorylate proteins that regulate lipid synthesis, glycogen synthesis, cell survival, and protein synthesis <xref rid="pone.0036974-Brem1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0036974-Kido1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0036974-Schleicher1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Recently, data from different sources demonstrated that AKT activation is an important step for VEGF release in skin wounds, through a post-transcriptional mechanism in keratinocytes <xref rid="pone.0036974-Goren1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0036974-Nakai1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, and is necessary for vascular maturation and angiogenesis during cutaneous wound healing <xref rid="pone.0036974-Somanath1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Therefore, the increase in this signaling pathway observed in the healing skin of wounds might contribute to the process of tissue repair in skin. Insulin stimulation of ERK involves the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS proteins and/or SHC, which in turn interact with the adapter protein, Grb2 (growth factor receptor-bound protein-2), recruiting the Son-of-sevenless (SOS) exchange protein to the plasma membrane for activation of Ras (one member of a large family of small molecular weight GTP-binding proteins) <xref rid="pone.0036974-Skolnik1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Once activated, Ras operates as a molecular switch, stimulating a serine kinase cascade through the stepwise activation of Raf, MEK (protein kinase that activates MAP kinases), and ERK. Activated ERK can translocate into the nucleus, where it catalyzes the phosphorylation of transcription factors, initiating a transcriptional program that leads to cellular proliferation or differentiation <xref rid="pone.0036974-Boulton1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0036974-Saltiel2" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Our results also show that protein levels of SHC and ERK are increased in the wounded skin, suggesting that the ERK signaling pathway can also play a direct pivotal role in the regulation of cellular growth and differentiation. It is important to emphasize that ERK activation is essential for keratinocyte pro-migratory signaling pathways <xref rid="pone.0036974-Galkowska1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0036974-Gazel1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0036974-Boulton1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0036974-Avruch1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0036974-Cheng1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0036974-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>.</p><p>Furthermore, we observed that tissue expression of these proteins is attenuated in wounded skin of diabetic rats compared with the increase observed in wounded skin of control rats. Therefore, we can suggest that the abnormal insulin signaling observed in wounded skin of diabetic rats might contribute to the impaired wound healing observed as a complication of diabetes. There are probably several mechanisms that can attenuate insulin signaling in the wounded skin of the diabetic. First, it is known that elevated levels of glucose affect insulin signaling by regulating the expression of several genes, including the insulin receptor gene, at both the transcriptional and translational levels <xref rid="pone.0036974-HaugueldeMouzon1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Moreover, hyperglycemia was shown to inhibit insulin action as a result of serine phosphorylation of IRS through a PKC-mediated mechanism, which may in turn increase the degradation of IRS proteins <xref rid="pone.0036974-Berti1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0036974-Muller1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>.</p><p>In accordance with a downregulation of insulin signaling proteins in wound healing of diabetic animals, Goren et al. showed that insulin signaling proteins, including IR&#x003b2;, IRS-1, IRS-2, and phosphorylated GSK3&#x003b2; were almost absent in acutely healing skin from ob/ob mice <xref rid="pone.0036974-Goren2" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. It is important to mention that in this type 2 diabetes obese animal model, leptin is absent and there is an increase in circulating TNF&#x003b1;. In this regard, this previous study showed that the administration of leptin or the infusion of anti-TNF&#x003b1; reversed the alterations in insulin signaling proteins and improved wound healing. Our data, by using a hypoinsulinemic animal model of diabetes showed that not only IR/IRSs/PI3k/Akt pathway but also the SHC/ERK pathway are downregulated in the wounded skin of diabetic animal. In addition, we show that the insulin cream can completely restore these alterations.</p><p>A previous study showed that diabetic rat serum stimulated collagen synthesis to a significantly lesser extent than normal rat serum <xref rid="pone.0036974-Verhofstad1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. On the other hand, topical use of insulin improves wound healing <xref rid="pone.0036974-Hanam1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> and it is known that insulin stimulates [<sup>3</sup>H]thymidine incorporation into human skin fibroblasts <xref rid="pone.0036974-Flier1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0036974-Chaiken1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. In addition, insulin strongly and specifically stimulates collagen synthesis in skin fibroblasts <xref rid="pone.0036974-Verhofstad1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. These data encouraged us to prepare a cream containing insulin, with the aim of accelerating wound healing in diabetes. Our data shows that the insulin cream normalizes the wound healing in the skin of diabetic rats and, in parallel, induces a recovery in the tissue level of all proteins involved in early steps of insulin action.</p><p>The molecular mechanisms by which insulin accelerates wound healing in diabetes seem to be many. The increase in proteins involved in the early steps of insulin action may play a role, since AKT and ERK have important growth and development effects. Additionally, the use of inhibitors of these pathways reduced the effect of insulin, suggesting that insulin uses both pathways to increase wound healing. At least two important substrates of AKT&#x02014;GSK3&#x003b2; and eNOS&#x02014;may have an important role in wound healing <xref rid="pone.0036974-Schleicher1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0036974-Kapoor1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. GSK3&#x003b2;, when phosphorylated by AKT, has a reduced activity. It was recently demonstrated that mice harboring a fibroblast-specific GSK3&#x003b2; deficiency exhibit elevated collagen production, reduced apoptosis, and accelerated wound closure <xref rid="pone.0036974-Kapoor1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. Thus, an increase in GSK3&#x003b2; phosphorylation, and a consequent reduction in its activity, may be one mechanism by which AKT can increase wound healing. AKT can also phosphorylate eNOS and promote NO production <xref rid="pone.0036974-Dimmeler1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0036974-Fulton1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, enhancing blood flow, cell survival, morphogenesis, and angiogenesis, even in the setting of ischemia <xref rid="pone.0036974-Atochin1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0036974-Yu1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. The multitude of AKT substrates and their described effects on various cellular functions may contribute, at least in part, to the beneficial effect of the insulin cream in wound healing, since this cream increases AKT protein expression and phosphorylation in the wounded skin of diabetic rats. Our data clearly show that the use of this insulin cream is an efficient manner to activate the AKT and ERK pathways, which are essential in the control of wound healing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0036974-g007">Fig. 7</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0036974-g007" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0036974.g007</object-id><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>Effect of insulin on cellular and molecular mechanisms of wound healing in diabetes.</title><p>Insulin induces activation of IR/SHC/ERK and IR/IRS/PI3K/AKT pathways in wound healing, which are canonical insulin signaling pathways. On the upper right-hand side, AKT is shown to increase VEGF (probably from macrophages, fibroblasts and epithelial cells) that will induce the phosphorylation and activation of eNOS in bone marrow, with consequent mobilization of EPCs to the circulation. SDF1&#x003b1; induces the homing of these EPC at the injury site, where they participate in neovasculogenesis.

The regulation of this process is complex and involves activation of eNOS in the bone marrow by VEGF (produced in the wounded skin), enhancing the mobilization of EPC, which is recruited to the cutaneous wound site by an increase in tissue levels of SDF-1&#x003b1; <xref rid="pone.0036974-Brem1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0036974-Gallagher1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Our data, in accordance with results of a previous paper <xref rid="pone.0036974-Gallagher1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, showed that this complex process is downregulated in diabetic rats. However, interestingly, the use of an insulin cream in wounded skin, increased the tissue expression of VEGF, increased eNOS phosphorylation in the bone marrow, and increased SDF-1&#x003b1; in the wounded skin of diabetic animals. It is important to emphasize that the treatment of diabetic animals with subcutaneous insulin for one week was not able to restore eNOS phosphorylation or increase SDF-1&#x003b1; in the wounded skin of diabetic animals (data not shown).</p><p>In diabetic patients, growth factors are major technological advances that promise to change the face of wound healing <xref rid="pone.0036974-Gerber1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0036974-Papanas1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0036974-Embil1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0036974-Smiell1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. The most important growth factors used are recombinant human platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (CSF), and epidermal growth factor. Many clinical trials have used these growth factors and shown only a mild improvement in wound healing <xref rid="pone.0036974-Embil1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0036974-Smiell1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. In addition, these growth factors are usually very expensive. Our results, with diabetic patients randomized to receive topical insulin or placebo in a prospective, double-blind and placebo-controlled clinical trial, show that the application of a cream containing insulin is able to significantly improve wound healing in these patients and, although the patients had very different sizes of ulcers, we observed complete healing at week 15 in all the 22 patients that used this cream. Previous pilot studies in animals or humans have employed topical insulin to accelerate wound healing in diabetes and, although these studies were not well designed, they all show an effect of insulin on this process <xref rid="pone.0036974-Hanam1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0036974-Gerber1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0036974-ApikogluRabus1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0036974-Belfield1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0036974-Weringer1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0036974-Madibally1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0036974-Greenway1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0036974-Wilson1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0036974-Rezvani1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0036974-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. The insulin cream we made allowed us to prepare a homogenous cream, and improved the adherence of the cream to the surface of the wound. This product is practical and easy to use and, as demonstrated, is completely safe and did not induce hypoglycemia.</p><p>In contrast to other growth factors, insulin is much cheaper and available everywhere. Thus, with these results, we may suggest that a cream containing insulin is a cheaper and efficient adjunctive active wound therapy for diabetic patients.</p><p>In summary, our results show that tissue expression of IR, IRS-1, IRS-2, SHC, ERK, and AKT are increased in wound healing tissue, compared to intact skin, suggesting that the insulin signaling pathway may have an important role in wound healing. We also found that these pathways were attenuated in the wounded skin of diabetic rats, when compared to the wounded skin of normal rats, in parallel with an increase in the time for wound closure. Therefore, an insulin cream administered on the wound skin of diabetic animals, improved wound healing, and reversed the reductions observed in proteins of the insulin signaling pathways. In addition, the treatment also increased the expression of other proteins, such as eNOS (also in bone marrow), VEGF, and SDF-1&#x003b1; in wounded skin. In diabetic patients, this insulin cream was able to improve wound healing, offering a genuine, cheap and efficient treatment for this devastating complication of diabetes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0036974.s001"><label>Approval S1</label><caption><p>
