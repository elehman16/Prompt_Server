Physical inactivity plays a crucial role in the development of systemic consequences of COPD including skeletal muscle weakness and osteoporosis [<xref rid="pone.0144989.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Furthermore, low physical activity levels have been associated with decreased exercise capacity [<xref rid="pone.0144989.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], increased hospital admission rate and increased mortality [<xref rid="pone.0144989.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Based on these observations, daily physical activity behaviour should be a key target for therapeutic interventions aiming to induce long-term health benefits.</p><p>Even though pulmonary rehabilitation leads to clinically important improvements in terms of exercise tolerance [<xref rid="pone.0144989.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0144989.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and whole-body endurance capacity almost doubles [<xref rid="pone.0144989.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], the observed benefits do not consistently translate into enhanced physical activity levels [<xref rid="pone.0144989.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The limited effect of conventional exercise training to enhance physical activity illustrates that inducing a change in physical activity behaviour merits perhaps a more comprehensive approach than simply targeting the underlying exercise intolerance and muscle dysfunction [<xref rid="pone.0144989.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Principles of motivational interviewing have been used to obtain lifestyle changes in several health behaviours including smoking [<xref rid="pone.0144989.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], dietary habits [<xref rid="pone.0144989.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], substance abuse [<xref rid="pone.0144989.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and physical activity [<xref rid="pone.0144989.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In terms of physical activity behaviour, this patient-centred approach focuses on the identification of personal barriers precluding an increase in daily physical activity and stimulates the patients to actively search for solutions to overcome these barriers. Enhancing motivation to lead a more active life and self-efficacy to perform daily life activities plays a central role in this process.</p><p>To date, one group investigated the feasibility of a physical activity counselling program in addition to pulmonary rehabilitation in patients with COPD [<xref rid="pone.0144989.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0144989.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]]. The authors concluded that this strategy can be effective, but changes in physical activity were rather limited (less than 20% increase) and similar to previously observed changes after pulmonary rehabilitation alone [<xref rid="pone.0144989.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Furthermore, physical activity was measured with pedometers, which precludes investigating changes in intensity of performed physical activities. Therefore, the aim of this trial is to investigate whether the addition of a physical activity counselling program to a conventional multidisciplinary pulmonary rehabilitation program results in enhanced daily levels of physical activity as measured with validated activity monitors. The baseline and three month data obtained by the Sensewear activity monitor in this trial have been reported for the full cohort in a methodological paper by Demeyer et al [<xref rid="pone.0144989.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec007"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec008"><title>Study design</title><p>This study is a two-armed randomized controlled trial, reported according to the 2010 CONSORT statement.</p><p>Both groups attended a comprehensive outpatient pulmonary rehabilitation program in University Hospital Gasthuisberg, Leuven. The intervention group was offered an additional physical activity counselling program, whereas the control group received equal face to face attention (sham program).</p><p>Outcome measurements were performed before and after three and six months of rehabilitation. Daily physical activity levels were assessed for seven consecutive days using two activity monitors (MoveMonitor and Sensewear Pro Armband). Clinical evaluations including assessment of pulmonary function, peripheral muscle force, six-minute walking distance and quality of life were performed at the same time points, but not on the same days. All tests were performed by experienced health professionals that were blinded to group allocation. The multidisciplinary team providing pulmonary rehabilitation was also blinded to group allocation.</p><p>Patients were informed about the study protocol prior to the start of rehabilitation. Written informed consent was obtained at that moment. Patients who agreed to participate wore the activity monitors for one week prior to start of rehabilitation and were then, after stratification for daily number of steps (&#x0003c; 5000 daily steps versus &#x02265; 5000 daily steps), randomised 1:1 into an intervention and a control group. Group allocation was performed using sealed opaque envelopes in random block sizes of four and six (unknown by the investigators)[<xref rid="pone.0144989.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>The study <bold>was</bold> approved by the local ethics committee (Commissie Medische Ethiek UZ Leuven) on April 15<sup>th</sup> 2009 and inclusion was initialized immediately after. The study was registered at the clinicaltrials.gov online database (NCT00948623). Registration was erroneously done after commencement of inclusion, but before the first patients reached the end of the study, ensuring a prospective power calculation and choice of primary endpoint. The authors confirm that all ongoing and related trials for this intervention are registered.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Patients</title><p>Consecutive patients with stable COPD that were referred for outpatient pulmonary were screened for inclusion between April 2009 and August 2011. Follow-up was finished in February 2012. Exclusion criteria were diagnoses other than COPD, inability to walk without walking aids, orthopaedic problems impairing daily activities, diagnosed psychiatric or cognitive disorders, progressive neurological or neuromuscular disorders, nickel allergy (which precludes measurement of physical activity with the Sensewear device) and a hospitalisation during the previous four weeks. Patients who did not speak the Dutch language were also excluded.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Pulmonary rehabilitation</title><p>Patients in both groups attended a six-month comprehensive multidisciplinary pulmonary rehabilitation program including exercise training as a key component. Individual appointments with other health care providers (pulmonologist, psychologist, occupational therapist, dietician, social worker, respiratory nurse) were scheduled and repeated if deemed necessary. These professionals were unaware of the study. An education program included sessions about understanding their disease, the role of exercise training, dealing with breathlessness, adequate inhaler use, advice on how to adapt daily life activities, psychological aspects, nutritional aspects and social and financial aspects. Each session was provided by a member of the multidisciplinary team. No specific education session on changes in daily physical activity was included, although all patients were informed that being more active in daily life is important to obtain long-term health benefits. During exercise training, patients performed cycling exercise, treadmill walking, stair climbing, arm ergometry and resistance training of upper and lower limbs [<xref rid="pone.0144989.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Training frequency was three sessions per week during the first three months and two sessions per week during the second three month period. Training duration increased from 40&#x02013;60 minutes at the start of the program to 60&#x02013;90 minutes after 6 months, including resting periods. Patients performed endurance training or interval training at moderate to high intensity (initially 60% to 70% of maximal workload achieved during maximal incremental cycle ergometry and mean speed as measured during a six-minute walking test). Resistance training consisted of three sets of eight repetitions with an intensity of 70% of one-repetition maximum. The overall training load was increased gradually during the course of the program, using a Borg scale rating of 4 to 6 on dyspnoea or perceived exertion as an indicator of adequate training intensity [<xref rid="pone.0144989.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Physical activity counselling program and sham attention program</title><p>The intervention group participated in a physical activity counselling program, consisting of eight individual sessions. These sessions were spread out over the six-month rehabilitation program. Each session lasted for 20 to 30 minutes. During the initial counselling session, the patients&#x02019; motivation to change physical activity behaviour and their confidence to actually perform this change (self-efficacy) were evaluated on a scale from 0 to 10 [<xref rid="pone.0144989.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0144989.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Physical activity levels were assessed objectively during the week prior to each session, using a Sensewear Pro Armband. During the counselling sessions, feedback on physical activity levels was provided and, depending on the patient&#x02019;s motivation to change, different counselling approaches were used. The communication style used during the counselling sessions emphasized a collaborative, empathic, non-judgmental atmosphere. When patients reported high scores on motivation to change (&#x02265;8/10) the focus of the counselling intervention was on action planning, goal setting, facilitating barrier identification, and relapse prevention [<xref rid="pone.0144989.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In the case of low scores on motivation (&#x02264;8/10) we aimed to enhance motivation by using a communicative approach based on motivational interviewing. We tried to help these patients to explore their ambivalence towards change and to express their reasons for change (e.g. a decisional balance exercise was performed by asking individuals to list benefits and costs of changing and not changing behavior in parallel columns). In contrast to an expert model (asking questions and giving advice) we followed the spirit of motivational interviewing to gradually enhance motivation of these patients towards behaviour change. All counselling sessions were carried out before or after the regular exercise training sessions by a research assistant that was briefly trained in the principles of motivational interviewing prior to start of the study. All research assistants were Master in Science in Physiotherapy and had no prior experience with the motivational interviewing approach. They all had however an exercise physiology background and specific expertise in respiratory physiotherapy. Prior to the start of inclusion, three individual training sessions of 60 minutes in the principles of motivational interviewing were organised by an experienced health psychologist (FD). No formal assessment was performed to grade the skill levels of the providers, but interviews with patients were video-taped and discussed with the health psychologist involved in the study design. The latter was done in individual or group sessions over the first few months of the study.</p><p>Patients in the control group received a sham attention program. Duration and timing of the individualized sessions were similar to the intervention group, but the general health status of the patient and the progression during training was discussed during the conversations. Intermediate evaluation of physical activity was performed, but no structured feedback was provided.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Physical activity assessments</title><p>Physical activity measurements were performed with two activity monitors, the Minimod<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (McRoberts BV, The Hague, the Netherlands) and the SenseWear Pro Armband (SWA; BodyMedia, Inc., Pittsburgh, PA, USA).</p><p>The Minimod is a small (64x62x13mm) and lightweight device (68gram, including batteries) that contains a three-axial piezocapacitive sensor measuring at high time-resolution (100Hz). The piezocapacitive sensor enables the measurement of both static and dynamic accelerations in a range of -2/+2g with a resolution of 2mg. In this trial the device was used to assess daily walking time.The Minimod was inserted in an elastic belt and positioned on the lower back at the height of the second lumbar vertebra, nearby the body&#x02019;s centre of mass, according to the instructions of the manufacturer. This device has recently been validated in patients with COPD [<xref rid="pone.0144989.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>The Sensewear Pro Armband (85x54x20mm, 79g) is worn on the right upper arm and integrates information from a biaxial accelerometer with signals from non-invasive sensors measuring physical parameters such as changes in body temperature, near body ambient temperature, heat flux, and galvanic skin resistance. Together with individual characteristics including gender, age, height and body mass these monitors&#x02019; outcomes are used to estimate energy expenditure utilizing proprietary equations developed by the manufacturer. The device has recently been validated in patients with COPD [<xref rid="pone.0144989.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0144989.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. After analysis of raw data the daily time spent performing various intensities of activity (expressed in metabolic equivalents or METs) were evaluated. In this trial, the time spent at an energy expenditure above 3.6 METs was considered at least moderate intense activity time. The time spent at an energy expenditure above 2.0 METs was considered at least mild intense activity time.</p><p>Daily walking time (MoveMonitor) and daily time spent in at least moderate intense activities (the time spent at an energy expenditure above 3.6 metabolic equivalents of task (METs); SenseWear) were a priori defined as primary outcomes of the study. Daily steps (MoveMonitor) and time spent in at least mild intense activities (the time spent at an energy expenditure above 2.0 METs; SenseWear) were secondary outcomes.</p><p>Assessments were performed on 7 consecutive days and patients were instructed to wear the activity monitors continuously from waking up until going to bed, except during showering or bathing. A break of one week was introduced in the rehab program to perform the three months evaluation. Days during which patients wore an activity monitor for less than 8 hours were not counted when calculating average values. Valid measurements were obtained on 5&#x000b1;1 days (baseline), 5&#x000b1;1 days (three months) and 4&#x000b1;1 days (six months) respectively. Only week days (Monday to Friday) were used in the analysis to minimise the measurement variability [<xref rid="pone.0144989.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Clinical assessments</title><p>Spirometry and whole body plethysmography were performed according to the European Respiratory Society guidelines for pulmonary function testing (Jaeger Master Screen Body; CareFusion; Germany)[<xref rid="pone.0144989.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].

One hundred and seventy patients were screened before the start of rehabilitation and 89 were eligible for inclusion. Main reasons for ineligibility were the absence of COPD, nickel allergy, orthopaedic problems influencing daily physical activity levels, inability to speak Dutch and cognitive disorders. Nine patients declined to participate, hence 80 patients (age 66&#x000b1;7 yrs, 81% male, FEV<sub>1</sub> 45&#x000b1;16% of the predicted value) were randomised into the intervention (n = 40) and the control group (n = 40). During the first three months of rehabilitation, 19 patients (23%) dropped out of the study (10 in the intervention group, 9 in the control group), whereas 11 (14%) patients dropped out during the second three-month period (2 in the intervention group, 9 in the control group). Consequently, 28 patients in the intervention group and 22 patients in the control group completed the intervention (62.5% of the initial study population). Eighty-two per cent of planned counselling sessions were actually delivered to the patients who completed the study. Two patients withdrew their consent during the program, whereas the remained dropped out of the rehabilitation program, due to severe respiratory worsening (n = 6), orthopaedic problems (n = 3), oncological problems (n = 3), or personal reasons (n = 16) and were either not capable or unwilling to perform any follow up measurements and therefore lost-to follow up.</p><fig id="pone.0144989.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0144989.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Patient flow chart.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0144989.g001"/></fig><p>Baseline characteristics (<xref rid="pone.0144989.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) are similar in the intervention and control groups with the exception of measurements of daily physical activity, with median values that were higher in the intervention group.

Despite clinically relevant improvements in exercise tolerance and health-related quality of life, improvements in daily physical activity levels were small in both groups. The addition of individual activity counselling did not enhance activity behaviour in our patient sample.</p><sec id="sec017"><title>Interpretation of findings</title><p>Our pulmonary rehabilitation program enhanced exercise tolerance (+45m in six-minute walking distance) and health-related quality of life (+21 points in CRDQ total score) in patients with moderate to very severe COPD to a similar extent as reported previously in our program [<xref rid="pone.0144989.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0144989.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The observed increases in six-minute walking distance and Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire score exceeded the proposed minimal important difference for these measures [<xref rid="pone.0144989.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0144989.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The effects of pulmonary rehabilitation programs in terms of physical activity levels in literature are heterogeneous, ranging from no change to a 40% increase [<xref rid="pone.0144989.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Part of the problem with all of these former trials is the absence of treatment fidelity measures. However, our findings for different physical activity outcomes lie within the range reported in literature.</p><p>Elements of motivational interviewing have been used to alter physical activity behaviour in various populations other than COPD including patients with cancer, type II diabetes [<xref rid="pone.0144989.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], obesity [<xref rid="pone.0144989.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], congestive heart failure [<xref rid="pone.0144989.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], adults at risk for cardiovascular disease [<xref rid="pone.0144989.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0144989.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] and healthy adults [<xref rid="pone.0144989.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0144989.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Meta-analysis reveals that this intervention only yields a significant increase in physical activity levels in a minority of published trials in chronic disease populations [<xref rid="pone.0144989.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].</p><p>In most studies, unfortunately, physical activity was quantified using questionnaires. The use of self-report instead of objective measurements might have overestimated changes in physical activity in the positive trials. Altenburg et al [<xref rid="pone.0144989.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] evaluated the effect of adding individual activity counselling based on motivational interviewing to a rehabilitation program using a pedometer. The authors reported a 15&#x02013;20% increase in daily steps in the intervention group, compared with a 5&#x02013;10% decrease in the control patients who only received pulmonary rehabilitation, confirming our lack of change in physical activity after pulmonary rehabilitation [<xref rid="pone.0144989.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Baseline physical activity levels were similar in the study of Altenburg et al. and our study. In contrast with our study, during which feedback on physical activity levels was only provided during scheduled study visits, the patients constantly received instant feedback from a pedometer to continuously provide feedback on their current physical activity levels [<xref rid="pone.0144989.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. This might be a useful tool in short-term goal setting, providing an incentive towards a higher daily physical activity level [<xref rid="pone.0144989.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The long-term effect of this intervention might be limited, as the difference between groups disappeared one year after the end of the intervention in the study of Altenburg et al [<xref rid="pone.0144989.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>The minimal important difference in terms of physical activity outcomes has not yet been reported in patients with COPD. ASCM guidelines propose that elderly people should engage in 30 minutes of moderate intense physical activity on at least five days per week in order to improve and maintain their health [<xref rid="pone.0144989.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. It is suggested that this translates to a daily average step count of approximately 7000 steps [<xref rid="pone.0144989.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. However, in patients with advanced COPD these goals might not be realistic [<xref rid="pone.0144989.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The aim of an activity enhancing intervention should be to reduce sedentary behaviour and to set individual goals of physical activity in light of their disease status, symptoms and past health behaviour [<xref rid="pone.0144989.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec018"><title>Methodological considerations</title><p>Our patients were markedly inactive during baseline assessment. Baseline physical activity levels were lower compared with previous studies performed in the same centre in patients with similar age and disease severity (e.g. mean daily walking time of 40 minutes compared to 44 and 55 minutes respectively)[<xref rid="pone.0144989.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0144989.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. We assessed physical activity behaviour with the Sensewear armband (79g) and the MoveMonitor activity monitor (68g), whereas the older trials used an older version of this device, the Dynaport activity monitor, which consists of a waist and a leg sensor, connected to a wire (total weight 375g). Possibly patients were more continuously aware of wearing an activity monitor when wearing the bulky device, which might have influenced physical activity behaviour.</p><p>Although the used devices have proven general validity to assess physical activity levels in patients with COPD [<xref rid="pone.0144989.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0144989.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], we did not specifically calibrate every individual device. Therefore, occasional measurement errors cannot be excluded.</p><p>We could speculate that the timing of the counselling intervention was not optimal. We were targeting very inactive patients that were by default confronted with a sudden increase in the amount and intensity of their physical activities (i.e. three 90-minute high-intensity exercise sessions per week). Possibly, this might have affected the patients&#x02019; readiness for inducing an extra increase in activities at home. In a future trial, it would be interesting to provide the same intervention in the final stage of pulmonary rehabilitation (e.g. during the final four weeks) and during the first months after the end the program. This period would typically be the period that people are expected to translate the gains in physical capacity into a more active lifestyle, in order to maintain training results on the longer term. Further research is needed to investigate the mode of delivery of behavioural interventions in patients with COPD during pulmonary rehabilitation programs.</p><p>Also, we did not systematically record adherence to the pulmonary rehabilitation program. Consequently we cannot exclude the possibility that attendance rates were different between study groups. The similar increase in exercise tolerance and health-related quality of life however suggests that adherence was sufficiently high in both groups.</p><p>Lastly, we acknowledge that the health care providers did not have prior experience with the MI approach which might have been a problem. The current approach was however chosen on purpose to make our intervention clinically feasible and broadly applicable. The potential feasibility of this approach is also supported by recently published data showing that an MI intervention can be effectively applied by a physical activity specialist after two training sessions [<xref rid="pone.0144989.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. However, it would be reasonable to speculate that aspects such as training and experience of motivational interviewing methods influence the effectiveness and we cannot rule out that this might have improved the effectiveness of our intervention. Additionally both the intervention and sham control intervention were delivered by the same research assistants, but both type of sessions were recorded and viewed by a health psychologist to prevent contamination.</p></sec><sec id="sec019"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This trial found no additional effect of eight individual activity counselling sessions during pulmonary rehabilitation to enhance physical activity levels in inactive patients with severe COPD. The optimisation of individual behavioural changes during pulmonary rehabilitation warrants further investigation.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec020"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0144989.s001"><label>S1 CONSORT Checklist</label><caption><title>CONSORT 2010 checklist.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0144989.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0144989.s002"><label>S1 Protocol</label><caption><title>Study protocol as approved by the local ethical committee.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0144989.s002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank Veronica Barbier, Iris Coosemans, Ilse Muylaert and the whole staff of both the Respiratory Rehabilitation Department and Clinical Trial Unit at the University Hospitals Gasthuisberg, Leuven, Belgium for providing the exercise training and performing the clinical tests.
