Current control strategy involves mass drug administration with praziquantel to the endemic population. To complement and sustain on-going preventive chemotherapy, we developed a health educational game named Schisto and Ladders&#x02122; and tested its potential for the control of schistosomiasis among schoolchildren living in Imala-Odo, a highly endemic community near Abeokuta, Nigeria.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">One hundred school children were randomly selected and divided into intervention and control groups through balloting. Their knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) concerning schistosomiasis transmission, control and prevention were assessed using structured questionnaires. Schisto and Ladders&#x02122; game were given to the intervention group and the popular Snake and Ladders&#x02122; game to the control group. Both games were played for 2 months under the supervision of their class teachers. A post-KAP assessment was carried out in both groups, including focus group discussions (FGDs) to investigate knowledge and the impact of the games.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Knowledge about urinary schistosomiasis and its transmission significantly improved (P&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.000) in the intervention group (68.0%) compared to the control group (8.0%). FGDs showed that the frequency of visits to dam water also significantly reduced (P&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.048) in the intervention group (18.0%) compared to the control group (40.0%). There was a significant increase in knowledge regarding risk behaviours, prevention and control of schistosomiasis among the intervention group, but no new knowledge gained in the control group.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">This study demonstrates the potential of the health education game Schisto and Ladders&#x02122; for teaching basic health education and promoting behavioural changes among schoolchildren in endemic communities.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Schistosomiasis control</kwd><kwd>Health education game</kwd><kwd>Schisto and Ladders&#x02122; knowledge</kwd><kwd>Attitude</kwd><kwd>Practices</kwd><kwd>Schoolchildren</kwd><kwd>Prevention</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par7">Schistosomiasis remains a public health challenge with over 600 million people at risk of infection worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The transmission of the disease is linked to contact with infected water bodies such as rivers, streams, pools and lakes containing cercaria in endemic communities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Schistosomiasis is common in school-aged children whose water contact pattern includes recreational and domestic activities such as bathing, swimming, washing clothes or kitchen utensils and fetching of water, which are common among primary school children between the ages of 5&#x02013;15&#x000a0;years old [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">Current control of schistosomiasis is majorly through preventive chemotherapy treatment with Praziquantel either school-based or community-based [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Although preventive chemotherapy substantially reduces the infection burden and parasite-associated morbidity, immediate re-infection is not usually prevented, and school children in high-risk communities get re-infected rapidly requiring repeated treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Recent studies in Mali and Kenya have shown the persistent prevalence of schistosomiasis in school children after repeated preventive chemotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. However, evidence exists suggesting that proper school-based health education can influence health-seeking behaviour and reduce prevalence of infection among school children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Hewlett and Cline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] adapted health education to local conditions in Cameroon, targeting health education at children. Their study reported a dropped in prevalence from 21 to 7% after 2&#x000a0;years. Complimenting health education with deworming program has been suggested as a potential way of breaking parasite&#x02019;s transmission cycle by preventing contamination of the environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Complementary interventions such as improvement in water and sanitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and health education have been advocated, as additional efforts essential to sustain the gains of preventive chemotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. It is against this background we are reporting a newly developed health educational game Schisto and Ladders&#x02122; and its potential to promote behavioural changes for schistosomiasis control by increasing knowledge of schistosomiasis among school children in an endemic community near Abeokuta, Nigeria.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par9">The study was an intervention trial involving an intervention group that played the Schisto and Ladders&#x02122; game and a control group that played the Snake and Ladders (placebo) for 2 months. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected from both study groups. Pre-and post-test questionnaires administered to both groups were used to obtain quantitative data while qualitative data was collected during focus group discussions (FGD). Data were collected from April to August 2014.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study area</title><p id="Par10">The study was conducted at Abeokuta North Local Government Primary School, Imala-Odo. The school is the only primary school in this community and has no toilet facility or water supply apart from the non-functional borehole sited in front of the school. Imala-Odo is a highly endemic community for schistosomiasis since 1991 after the establishment of the Oyan Dam [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. This disease has persisted over the years in this community [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The major occupation of members of the community is fishing and farming. There is no communal toilet facility, electric power supply, pipe borne water, good road network and proper waste disposal system. The community depends on the dam water for their domestic, recreational and occupational activities. An assessment of the prevalence of urogenital schistosomiasis in the school was 89.0%.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Ethics considerations</title><p id="Par11">Prior to commencement of study, meetings were held with the parents, caregivers, teachers and headmistress of the school children and were briefed about the objectives of the study. The community has previously been surveyed for schistosomiasis and was thus familiar with researchers which made the acceptance of the study easier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Selected participants were given consent form from school which was taken home to be assented to by signing or thumb printing by parents. Ethical approval was granted by the ethical review board of Ogun State Ministry of Health, Abeokuta. Permission to enter the school was obtained from the State Universal Primary Education Board, Abeokuta.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>The Schisto and Ladders&#x02122; game</title><p id="Par12">Schisto and Ladders&#x02122; game is a board game (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a) designed from the popular Snake and Ladders game (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). The game aims to elicit positive behavioural changes in players by informing and educating the players about schistosomiasis, its transmission, control, and prevention. The game is based on the concept of reward for good health behaviours by moving up a ladder and punishment for risky health behaviours by being bitten by the <italic>Schistosoma</italic> worm. The game has several health education messages presented in the children-friendly pictorial form. Health educational messages presented in the board game include mode of transmission of the infective stage (cercaria), behavioural risks associated with transmission (risk factors for transmission of infection), symptoms of infection and information on what to do to seek treatment, prevention of reinfection and control strategies. The game can be played by a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 4 persons, to allow for proper interaction and assimilation of the health education messages and warnings on the board. The game starts when a player throws a 1 with a dice. A player moves up when he/she gets to the foot of a ladder and goes down when he gets to the head of the <italic>Schistosoma</italic> worm. Players are self-guided by the health messages on each square of the board. The players count the number shown on the dice when thrown and the first player to get to the square marked 100 wins the game.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>

They were randomly split into two equal groups of 50 pupils for intervention and 50 pupils for control respectively (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). A pre-test questionnaire specific to understanding participants&#x02019; knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) about schistosomiasis, its transmission, pathology and control were administered to both study groups. The health education board game Schisto and Ladders&#x02122; was distributed to the intervention group, and the ordinary Snake and Ladders board game were given to a control group. The pupils were taught how to play both games. The games were played daily among pupils of the same cadre during the 30&#x000a0;min long break for 2 months under the supervision of their class teachers. The person that came last in a round was replaced by someone else in the next set of the game. A post-test questionnaire was administered at the end of 2&#x000a0;months to both intervention and control groups. Participants in both intervention and control group including the teachers were blinded to the study objectives to eliminate bias.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Flowchart for study design and selection of pupil for playing the test and control games</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13104_2017_2545_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig>

The service of a trained social scientist was employed for the FGD. Ten pupils from each group without gender bias were selected randomly for the FGD. Sessions were held separately for the test and control groups. Some of the questions asked during the FGD include what activity makes one to be bitten by the Schisto worm to test for knowledge about risk behaviours, what are the symptoms of infection and what should be done when one discovered he/she is having symptoms of infection. A portable electronic voice recorder was used in recording the conversations of the FGDs.

This study designed and tested an innovative health educational game named Schisto and Ladders&#x02122; as a tool for teaching simple schistosomiasis transmission, control, and prevention messages to school aged children. School children in the intervention group had more increase in the knowledge about schistosomiasis than their counterparts in the control group. The significant improvement in the knowledge of school children about the causes of urinary schistosomiasis and transmission after playing Schisto and Ladders&#x02122; points to the potential of this game to complement and sustain the gains of school-based mass drug administration programmes. It was evident that captions and pictures used in development and designed of games are essential ingredients for learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. This finding supports the hypothesis that visual games can be helpful in the control of disease as shown by the development of an animated health education cartoon at preventing worm infection in Chinese school children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. It is thus imperative to find innovative ways, such as the use of games with health education messages to teach children about diseases, methods of transmission, personal and domestic hygiene and proper health seeking behaviour in endemic schistosomiasis communities. Focus group discussions showed that the pupils liked the game wanting to play the game every day to learn more about schistosomiasis.</p><p id="Par24">Behavioural change indicated by the frequency of visit to the dam water, though reduced, did not markedly change in the intervention group after playing the Schisto and Ladders game. This observation may be due to the absence of alternative water sources in the community, making it difficult if not impossible for the pupils not to visit the dam water despite their awareness of contracting schistosomiasis. Pupils majorly reduced frequency of playing in water, but the same could not be said about other water related house chores activities like washing and bathing which they are likely to be compelled to do by parents and guardians. Provision of alternative safe water supply through repairs and rehabilitation of existing borehole in the community will help in reducing water contact activities of school children with dam water.</p><p id="Par25">Health education among peers has been recognized to play a leading role in catalysing behavioural change in school children. The findings of this study showed that a platform of cross-communication exists among peer groups even within schools. Pupils within the control group did enquire from those within the intervention group what their game was? Although not intended, we found this scenario difficult to control as the nature of the school settings allow pupils to mix freely during short-breaks and closing periods. However, the effect of this was limited by pupils not been aware of post-test assessment and FGDs. Also, game playing was independently handled by different teachers in different arms of the classes. This cross communication among peers can, however, be further utilized in improving the delivery of health education messages in schools and beyond as parents learn easily from their wards, and acquired knowledge is usually transferred from school to home and communities.</p><p id="Par26">The major limitation of this study is the sample size, which reduced the power and limited the conclusion that can be drawn from the study. Also, the choice of control group being in the same school also affected the study as there was evidence of cross-communication between intervention and control group. Further study with larger sample size and in different cultural settings with more schools participating is needed to validate the game.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par27">This study demonstrated the potential of the health education board game Schisto and Ladders&#x02122; for teaching basic health education and promoting behavioural changes among schoolchildren in a friendly and enjoyable way. We believe it can be use in schistosomiasis endemic communities to substantially increase compliance to mass drug administration campaign and reduce reinfection rate among schoolchildren.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>KAP</term><def><p id="Par5">knowledge, attitude, and practices</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FGD</term><def><p id="Par6">focus group discussion</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>UFE conceived the study, CUE, ASO, HOM, AAA and OMA designed the game.
