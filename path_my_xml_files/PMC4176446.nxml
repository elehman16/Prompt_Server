Addition of a cure step prior to the AS-PCR reaction restored the accurate measurement of mutant frequencies with mismatched AS-PCR primer and template (0 = 0.04%, 0.5 = 0.44%, 1 = 0.94%, and 10 = 9.5%). These results demonstrate the potentially deleterious effects of sequence polymorphisms when present within the AS-PCR primer targets, resulting in inaccurate minor variant frequency estimates.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Genotypic, Phenotypic, and Minor Variant Drug Resistance</title><p>Among the 131 participants with incident infections, none had FTC- or TDF-selected mutations or reduced phenotypic susceptibility (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="JIU233F1">1</xref>). As previously reported, DR was detected exclusively in those initiating PrEP during unrecognized acute infection at study entry. Of these, genotypic and phenotypic resistance to FTC was seen in 2 of 2 participants randomized to FTC/TDF and 1 of 8 randomized to placebo with mutations M184V and I, with maximally increased fold change half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) values for FTC [<xref rid="JIU233C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].

Viruses from 6 participants (3 FTC/TDF, 3 placebo) had other single nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI; M41L), nonnucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI; K103N/E), or protease inhibitor (PI)&#x02013;selected (I85V) SDRM [<xref rid="JIU233C33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="JIU233C34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="JIU233TB1">1</xref>). The participant with acute infection who was randomized to placebo had multiclass resistance mutations M184V, T215Y, K103N, and P225H. These mutations, appearing in the absence of drug exposure, likely result from acquisition of resistant virus from a treatment-experienced source.

Of those randomized to FTC/TDF, plasma virus from 48/48 (100%) was assayed by qMVA and 47/48 (98%) by deep sequencing. Plasma virions from all subjects randomized to placebo (83/83) were assayed by both ultrasensitive tests (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="JIU233F1">1</xref>). The viral load (95% confidence interval [CI]) for samples tested was sufficiently high for detecting mutants at 0.5% in both randomization arms (mean, 95% CI, FTC/TDF 5.24 log<sub>10</sub> cps/mL, 5.00&#x02013;5.48; placebo 5.13 log<sub>10</sub> cps/mL, 4.98&#x02013;5.29; <italic>P</italic> = .44).</p><p>Of the seroconverters randomized to FTC/TDF, none showed minor variant mutations above the BCO at K65R or K70E.

Repeat testing by qMVA using an independent amplification product yielded a value just below the BCO of 0.5% (0.43%), most likely reflecting normal variation bracketing the established cutoff rather than selected resistance<italic>.</italic> Among those randomized to placebo, 1 participant had 0.69% K65R by qMVA and 1.64% by deep sequencing. Another subject showed minor variant M184V by both qMVA (1.26%) and 454 sequencing (2.75%). In summary, minor variant DR mutations were rare, and when detected, were measured at very low frequencies.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Longitudinal Monitoring of FTC-resistance Mutations</title><p>The proportion of contemporaneous Mut:WT species was monitored over time in both participants with unrecognized infection prior to FTC/TDF randomization (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="JIU233F3">3</xref>). Minor variant frequencies by qMVA and 454 sequencing were highly concordant. At study entry, the subject in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="JIU233F3">3</xref>, panel A, showed high viral load consistent with acute infection, WT genotype, and no detectable minor variant DR. At first evidence of seroconversion (study week 4), there was partial virologic suppression with detectable study drug in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) (TFV-diphosphate [DP] = 18.7 fmol/10<sup>6</sup> cells, FTC-triphosphate [TP] = 0.944 pmol/10<sup>6</sup> cells). The genotype revealed mixed M184M/V, with predominance of the Mut codon (84% by qMVA, 85% by 454 sequencing), consistent with selection by FTC. Following study drug withdrawal at the SC visit, plasma viral load increased to 5.42 log<sub>10</sub> cps/mL, and M184V waned to &#x0003c;0.5% within 14 weeks, remaining at background levels through 52 weeks of follow-up.

To address drug resistance in the context of measured drug exposure, we examined the plasma FTC and TFV and intracellular PBMC FTC-TP and TFV-DP levels in all participants with incident infection where at least 1 measurement was detectable within 90 days prior to or including the seroconversion visit (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="JIU233F4">4</xref>).

Overall, detection of PrEP-selected DR mutations was infrequent. Bulk genotypic and phenotypic resistance assays revealed FTC-associated mutations (M184V or I) exclusively in participants exposed to FTC/TDF during acute infection, of which 1 had confirmed WT virus at entry [<xref rid="JIU233C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. TDF-selected mutations were not observed in PrEP recipients. Of the 48 infected participants randomized to FTC/TDF, minor variant FTC-selected DR (M184I) was detected in 2 participants, 1 by qMVA (0.53%) and another by deep sequencing (0.75%), of which only the former had detectable FTC within the estimated infection window. Taken together, clinically significant DR selected by PrEP was limited to those who initiated drug after established infection, and was associated with FTC exposure.</p><p>The emergence of PrEP-associated viral mutations where PrEP was initiated during acute infection was also reported for men and women in the TDF2 study and HIV serodiscordant couples in Partners PrEP, respectively [<xref rid="JIU233C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="JIU233C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Consistent with the findings in iPrEx, and the Bangkok Tenofovir study, PrEP-selected mutations were absent among seroconverters infected postrandomization. This may reflect drug concentrations or exposure duration that were insufficient to prevent infection and select for drug resistance. In all PrEP study reports, efficacy significantly increases when measured drug exposure is taken into account [<xref rid="JIU233C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. By contrast, in the Fem-PrEP trial, PrEP-associated DR in SC randomized to the FTC/TDF arm was noted exclusively in those infected postrandomization [<xref rid="JIU233C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Seroconversion in 3 of 4 women occurred within 8 weeks of study entry, raising the possibility of emergent infection during PrEP initiation. Taken together, these results underscore the importance of recognizing the rare individual with acute seronegative infection, through sensitive HIV RNA testing, or 4th generation antigen-antibody combination enzyme immunoassays. Other potential strategies where such diagnostic testing is impractical include delaying PrEP initiation in individuals with symptoms consistent with acute viral infection syndromes.</p><p>In the absence of continued drug selection, the FTC-resistant viruses proportionately waned within the infected host over time, reaching background levels by 24 weeks. This is consistent with our findings measuring the time-course of transmitted M184V reversion and WT outgrowth in ARV-naive subjects [<xref rid="JIU233C37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="JIU233C38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], and reflects the impaired replication capacity in viruses carrying FTC-selected mutations [<xref rid="JIU233C39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="JIU233C41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The contribution of archived, low-frequency M184V/I in the proviral DNA reservoir to treatment response is not known. Long-term persistence of K103N is detected as minor variants in untreated infants exposed to single-dose nevirapine at birth [<xref rid="JIU233C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In a meta-analysis [<xref rid="JIU233C42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], there is increased risk of treatment failure with preexisting NNRTI minor variant resistance, but reduced risk is noted with minor variant NRTI resistance comparable to frequencies seen in our study (approximately 1%).</p><p>The FTC-resistant viruses associated with PrEP exposure had phenotypic susceptibility profiles predicting durable suppression with current second-line regimens based on World Health Organization recommendations [<xref rid="JIU233C43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The response to regimens containing FTC or lamivudine (3TC) for viruses harboring isolated M184VI mutations is difficult to predict, although use of a boosted PI is an option to minimize the risk of virological failure. The mutations M184VI confer hypersusceptibility to ZDV and TDF [<xref rid="JIU233C40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="JIU233C44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], raising the possibility of successful ZDV- or TDF-based dual NRTI regimens combined with a fully active NNRTI or integrase inhibitor, thus sparing 2nd-line boosted PI-based regimens.</p><p>In iPrEx, antiretrovirals were withdrawn at first evidence of infection, with clinical follow-up consistent with the in-country standard of care. However, recent insights into the potential clinical benefit of very early treatment initiation warrants reconsideration of this strategy, as therapy intensification during hyperacute infection might attenuate the course of HIV spread and decrease viral reservoir size [<xref rid="JIU233C45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="JIU233C46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Indeed, the decreased frequency of seroconversions in subjects undergoing acute infection at randomization detected in the active arms compared with placebo in iPrEx (2 vs 8) and CAPRISA 004 (1 vs 7) may reflect attenuated infection when antiretrovirals are started during the Fiebig 1 infection stage or earlier [<xref rid="JIU233C47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].</p><p>A better understanding of the FTC/TDF dose and dosing patterns that are associated with prophylactic effects and selection for drug resistance is important for evaluating risk-benefit ratios of PrEP. In a case-control substudy of iPrEx participants, the frequency of drug detection in infected participants within a 90-day infection window was significantly lower (11%) than that seen in uninfected controls (51%), but equivalent at time points farther from infection, indicating increased risk of infection during periods of low drug exposure [<xref rid="JIU233C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. We find that such periods of low drug exposure were not sufficient for selection of drug resistance. One subject who had detectable HIV-1 RNA when starting PrEP rapidly developed FTC resistance; his drug concentrations were TFV-DP 18.7 fmol/10<sup>6</sup> PBMCs and FTC-TP 0.95 pmol/10<sup>6</sup> PBMCs at the seroconversion visit 4 weeks later, by which time M184V was selected. This indicates that these concentrations of drug were sufficient to select for resistance, while being in the prophylactic range for those who are uninfected when starting PrEP [<xref rid="JIU233C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="JIU233C48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. This case, and the lack of FTC or TDF resistance among those with incident infections, suggests that concentrations of drug required to overcome viral fitness barriers to DR selection are also sufficient to prevent HIV infection.</p><p>There are limitations in directly extrapolating our findings to other settings of PrEP use. The iPrEx study design included monthly serologic monitoring of PrEP recipients and termination of PrEP at seroconversion. Current guidelines for PrEP in clinical settings indicate HIV-1 monitoring at at least 3-month intervals [<xref rid="JIU233C49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], potentially increasing drug exposure duration and risk of DR if infection occurs. The absence K65R or K70E in iPrEx may be due to insufficient duration of TDF exposure. Among PrEP users with preexisting infection in other trials, K65R appeared after 4 weeks of TDF PrEP in 1 person [<xref rid="JIU233C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], and after 7 months of FTC/TDF PrEP in another [<xref rid="JIU233C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In GS-934, a randomized study of FTC/TDF/efavirenz (EFV) versus 3TC/TDF/EFV in infected ART-naive subjects, 2/19 developed M184V or I while none developed K65R or K70E after treatment for a median of 16 weeks postvirologic failure [<xref rid="JIU233C50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. In clinical practice, PrEP may be used intermittently, started, and stopped as people change their sexual practices; the frequency and nature of DR in these or other settings may differ from that reported here.</p><p>In summary, we found DR in iPrEx SC was limited to those initiating PrEP with unrecognized infection. In 8 participants with measurable systemic drug levels near the infection window, PrEP-selected DR with a potential clinical impact was absent, due to insufficient levels or exposure duration. Continued surveillance of PrEP exposure and DR in seroconverters from ongoing PrEP demonstration projects will extend these findings from randomized controlled trials.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supplementary Data</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/infdis/jiu233/-/DC1">Supplementary materials</ext-link> are available at <italic>The Journal of Infectious Diseases</italic> online (<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/">http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/</uri>).
