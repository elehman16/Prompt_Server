The ultimate aims of treatment are to minimize the impact of the current exacerbation, and by ensuring complete resolution, reduce the risk of relapse. In the absence of superiority studies of antibiotics in AECOPD, evidence of the relative efficacy of different drugs is lacking, and so it is difficult for physicians to select the most effective antibiotic. This paper describes the protocol and rationale for MAESTRAL (<bold>m</bold>oxifloxacin in <bold>AE</bold>CB<bold>s</bold> [acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis] <bold>tr</bold>i<bold>al</bold>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.clinicaltrials.gov">www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>: NCT00656747), one of the first antibiotic comparator trials designed to show superiority of one antibiotic over another in AECOPD. It is a prospective, multinational, multicenter, randomized, double-blind controlled study of moxifloxacin (400 mg PO [ per os] once daily for 5 days) vs amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (875/125 mg PO twice daily for 7 days) in outpatients with COPD and chronic bronchitis suffering from an exacerbation. MAESTRAL uses an innovative primary endpoint of clinical failure: the requirement for additional or alternate treatment for the exacerbation at 8 weeks after the end of antibiotic therapy, powered for superiority. Patients enrolled are those at high-risk of treatment failure, and all are experiencing an Anthonisen type I exacerbation. Patients are stratified according to oral corticosteroid use to control their effect across antibiotic treatment arms. Secondary endpoints include quality of life, symptom assessments and health care resource use.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>AECOPD</kwd><kwd>moxifloxacin</kwd><kwd>amoxicillin/clavulanic acid</kwd><kwd>clinical trial design</kwd><kwd>exacerbation</kwd><kwd>antibiotic</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD), which is usually associated with chronic bronchitis, drive progressive lung function decline in patients,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-copd-6-373">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-copd-6-373">3</xref> are major contributors to mortality, morbidity and reductions in quality of life,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-copd-6-373">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-copd-6-373">9</xref> and the resulting hospitalizations markedly increase health care costs.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-copd-6-373">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-copd-6-373">10</xref> The mainstays of AECOPD treatment are intensification or addition of short-acting bronchodilators, and in selected patients, antibiotics with or without systemic corticosteroids.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-copd-6-373">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-copd-6-373">11</xref> However, treatment failure rates in many recent antibiotic studies are high, which could be related to inadequate antibiotic efficacy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-copd-6-373">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-copd-6-373">13</xref> Incomplete resolution of the initial exacerbation may also influence the risk of relapse: many patients experience a further exacerbation within a few weeks,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-copd-6-373">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-copd-6-373">14</xref> with relapse rates varying between antibiotics.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-copd-6-373">14</xref> Therefore, it is likely that improving clinical outcomes requires the use of the most effective antibiotic available.</p><p>Proof of superiority of one antibiotic over another in AECOPD is lacking,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-copd-6-373">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-copd-6-373">11</xref> as are high-quality clinical data to inform clinical guidelines.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-copd-6-373">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-copd-6-373">16</xref> Although there are many comparative studies of different antibiotics in AECOPD, no single drug has yet shown superiority for the primary endpoint in a clinical trial.

The primary objective of MAESTRAL is to compare the efficacy of a 5-day course of moxifloxacin to that of a 7-day course of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid in the treatment of outpatients experiencing AECOPD who are at high risk of treatment failure. The study is powered to show clinical superiority between antibiotic treatments.

Data collected at each visit are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-copd-6-373">Table 2</xref>.</p><p>Assessment of clinical response to therapy is based on determination of the effect of therapy on auscultatory findings, chest pain/discomfort, cough frequency, dyspnea, sputum purulence, sputum consistency, and sputum volume. Clinical response is assessed as: clinical improvement (during therapy only), clinical failure, indeterminate, clinical cure, continued clinical cure, and clinical relapse (definitions are given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="t5-copd-6-373">Supplementary Section 3</xref>). Clinical failure rates can be assessed during nonprotocol-defined visits as well as during therapy, at end of therapy, and at the 4 and 8-week post-therapy visits. Premature discontinuations due to study drug failure will also be treated as failures. For patients who discontinue study drug for reasons other than efficacy, the assessment at 8-week post-therapy visit will be used where completed. For those patients who do not return for the 8-week post-therapy visit, the response will be considered missing.

These patients have all had an acute exacerbation at enrollment and have received the study drug for a minimum of 48 hours (cases of clinical failure) or received &#x02265;80% of study medication (cases of clinical cure). All have data for clinical evaluation at 8 weeks post-therapy (except for clinical failures prior to the 8 weeks post-therapy visit) and have no protocol violations. The intent-to-treat (ITT)/safety population includes all patients randomized who received at least one dose of study drug and with one observation after initiation of study treatment. The microbiologically valid population is drawn from the PP population and comprises all patients with at least one PPB cultured from sputum provided prior to start of therapy and where a bacteriological evaluation is available during the study. The ITT with causative organisms population includes patients valid for ITT with at least one pretherapy PPB.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistics</title><sec><title>Sample size calculation</title><p>To power MAESTRAL for superiority, the objective is to ensure that 540 valid PP patients are enrolled in each treatment arm; therefore, at least 1350 COPD patients with an Anthonisen type I exacerbation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-copd-6-373">21</xref> are required to be randomized. Patients will be drawn from across 30 countries. This high number of patients is driven by a 6% margin &#x02013; a more rigorous definition of failure rates than the standard 10% normally used in noninferiority trials.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-copd-6-373">30</xref></p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Primary analysis</title><p>The primary aim of the study is to show noninferiority (defined as a difference in failure rates of &#x02264;6% using a one- sided test at a level of 2.5%) of moxifloxacin vs amoxicillin/clavulanic acid in the PP population. If noninferiority is statistically proven, the possibility that moxifloxacin is superior to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid will be tested in the ITT population, using a one-sided test at the 2.5% level. The primary ITT analysis will be clinical failure vs all other evaluations (clinical cure, indeterminate, and missing). Two sensitivity analyses are planned: (1) missing responses will be combined with indeterminates and clinical failures in an overall nonsuccess category, and (2) missing and indeterminate responses will be excluded and only cures or failures will be considered. The 95% two-sided confidence interval (CI) of the difference of two clinical failure rates (treatment group &#x02018;moxifloxacin&#x02019; minus treatment group &#x02018;amoxicillin/clavulanic acid&#x02019;) will be calculated using Mantel&#x02013;Haenszel weights for the strata (geographic region and stratification by corticosteroid use, as outlined in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="t4-copd-6-373">Supplementary Section 2</xref>). If the upper limit of the CI is &#x0003c;6%, it will prove that treatment with moxifloxacin is clinically no less effective than treatment with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. If the upper limit of this CI is &#x0003c;0, superiority of treatment with moxifloxacin will be proven. To check the appropriateness of the calculation of the Mantel&#x02013;Haenszel weighted CIs, the Breslow&#x02013;Day test, or Zelen&#x02019;s test, will be performed to test for homogeneity of odds ratios across strata. If the test indicates a treatment-by-stratum interaction, exploratory analyses will be performed to find the source of this interaction. If such a source is found, the Mantel&#x02013;Haenszel weighted CI will be calculated using weighting based on variables explaining the interaction.</p><p>Demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized by treatment group for the PP and ITT populations and compared using the Cochran&#x02013;Mantel&#x02013;Haenszel test adjusted for strata and region.</p><p>Secondary clinical and bacteriological endpoints will be analyzed as for the primary analysis, but using appropriate patient populations and time points. Clinical and bacteriological outcomes at a variety of time points (during therapy, end of therapy, 4 weeks post-therapy, and 8 weeks post-therapy) will be investigated in subpopulations of special interest, such as those with and without coadministration of systemic corticosteroids. The full list of subpopulations of interest is given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="t6-copd-6-373">Supplementary Section 4</xref>.</p><p>AECB-SS and SGRQ scores will be determined and analyzed separately. The main analysis for the SGRQ data will compare the mean change from baseline in the total SGRQ score between treatment groups 8 weeks after the end of therapy. For AECB-SS, the means, standard deviations, medians, minimums, and maximums will be provided for the total score and change from baseline in total score at each visit, by treatment group.

Most of these trials have been powered to show noninferiority, making it difficult for physicians to select the &#x02018;best&#x02019; antibiotic for a particular patient.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-copd-6-373">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-copd-6-373">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32-copd-6-373">32</xref> MAESTRAL aims to address all these issues by recruiting sufficient patients (n &#x02265;1350) to allow the study to be powered for superiority and by setting an innovative long-term primary endpoint of clinical failure at 8 weeks post-therapy.</p><p>Traditional clinical trial endpoints occur soon after the end of treatment and cannot provide data on clinical failures or relapse rates occurring more than 2 or 3 weeks post-treatment. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-copd-6-373">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-copd-6-373">31</xref> Consequently, they may not be long enough to reveal any clinically relevant differences in treatment regimens that emerge in the weeks following the completion of therapy. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33-copd-6-373">33</xref> Indeed, it has been suggested that future clinical trials should be designed to assess longer-term endpoints.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34-copd-6-373">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35-copd-6-373">35</xref> The suitability of an endpoint measured 8 weeks from the end of antibiotic treatment is supported by the fact that patients tend to relapse and exacerbations cluster such that there is a high risk of recurrent exacerbation in the 8 weeks after an initial exacerbation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33-copd-6-373">33</xref> In addition, in the MOSAIC study, the most significant differences between treatments in terms of time-to-treatment failure, relapse, or requirement for further antibiotics occurred during the first 8 weeks after treatment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36-copd-6-373">36</xref></p><p>Patient selection is a recurring problem in published trials. It is now well established that underlying patient characteristics such as older age, higher exacerbation frequency, presence of concomitant cardiopulmonary disease, and a higher severity of underlying airway obstruction are key determinants of poor outcome in AECOPD.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-copd-6-373">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36-copd-6-373">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37-copd-6-373">37</xref> Exacerbations become more frequent and more severe as the underlying COPD progresses, but some patients have more exacerbations than others, which appears to be an independent susceptibility phenotype.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38-copd-6-373">38</xref> Those who are particularly susceptible to exacerbations have worse health status and faster disease progression than infrequent exacerbators.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38-copd-6-373">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39-copd-6-373">39</xref> One explanation might be that some patients remain at high risk for recurrent exacerbation in the 8-week period after initial exacerbation,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33-copd-6-373">33</xref> possibly due to differing levels of ongoing lung and systemic inflammation in frequent and infrequent exacerbators.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40-copd-6-373">40</xref> In most published antibiotic trials to date, patient populations are highly heterogeneous and may include relatively young and fit patients as well as those who are elderly and/or more severely ill. Indeed, there is even a lack of consensus on how to define patients&#x02019; illnesses. While distinctions are made between acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis (AECB) and AECOPD, COPD, and chronic bronchitis often coexist, are treated in parallel in the clinical setting, and most antibiotic intervention studies include patients with and without documented airflow obstruction. Enrollment of patients with AECB, mild COPD, or normal lung function will dilute the actual effect and increase the perceived efficacy of antibiotics due to high spontaneous rates of recovery. This makes it harder to show superiority of one antibiotic over another,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-copd-6-373">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-copd-6-373">31</xref> as most of these patients would recover even without an antibiotic. As individuals at high risk of poor outcomes have high rates of failure and relapse,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-copd-6-373">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41-copd-6-373">41</xref> MAESTRAL is enriched with patients at risk of poor outcomes (ie, those &#x02265;60-years-old who have experienced &#x02265;2 exacerbations in the previous year, have moderate-to-severe COPD according to the GOLD spirometric criteria,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-copd-6-373">16</xref> and who are experiencing an Anthonisen type I exacerbation).</p><p>Patients with COPD are likely to be taking a range of medications to treat the exacerbation, the underlying COPD, and any concomitant illness. However, in many trials there is only limited evaluation of concurrent medication, the use of which could affect clinical outcome and create bias between antibiotic treatment groups.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-copd-6-373">31</xref> MAESTRAL tackles this issue by recording all concomitant medications for the full duration of the study. Physicians are instructed not to change patients&#x02019; regular maintenance inhaled and oral COPD therapy during the study, but the need for any change in dosage or additional respiratory medication, such as bronchodilators and inhaled steroids, will be assessed.</p><p>Treatment of the current exacerbation often requires an antibiotic plus one or more other treatments, such as oral corticosteroids or an increased dose of a long-acting beta-agonist.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-copd-6-373">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-copd-6-373">11</xref> To date, whether antibiotics are of benefit in moderate-to-severe exacerbations when a short course of corticosteroids is coadministered has been studied in very few large, well-designed trials.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-copd-6-373">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-copd-6-373">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-copd-6-373">12</xref> Because steroids can assist in the clinical resolution of an exacerbation, inconstant steroid treatment in the arms of an antibiotic trial can confound interpretation of the results. Mandating oral corticosteroids in all patients or making their use an exclusion criteria in this study are both inconsistent with current guidelines and make recruitment in a large study difficult. In MAESTRAL, the unique approach of stratifying patients for the concomitant use of oral corticosteroids to treat the current exacerbation is used to control for the use of concomitant corticosteroids. However, no inference on the clinical efficacy of steroid treatments can be drawn from this study because the allocation of steroids was not randomized.</p><p>Ensuring that patients most likely to be experiencing a bacterial (as opposed to, for instance, viral) exacerbation are enrolled in the trial is an important aspect of the MAESTRAL study design. Therefore, an Anthonisen type I exacerbation must be confirmed by the investigators. Where an AECOPD has a bacterial etiology, symptom resolution of that exacerbation will likely be influenced by bacterial eradication; the underlying mechanism is thought to be due to resolution of the inflammatory response to bacteria.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42-copd-6-373">42</xref> By choosing patients with Anthonisen type 1 exacerbations, the study population is enriched with patients in whom bacteria play a significant role and who should benefit most from antibiotic therapy. Anthonisen type I exacerbations have been shown to have a high frequency of bacterial pathogen isolation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-copd-6-373">4</xref></p><p>The MAESTRAL study uses recommended antibiotics, moxifloxacin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. Both drugs are commonly used for therapy of more severely ill patients with an AECOPD in most countries where the MAESTRAL trial is conducted, are recommended in a number of guidelines for this patient group,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-copd-6-373">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43-copd-6-373">43</xref> and have shown good efficacy in AECOPD.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-copd-6-373">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-copd-6-373">24</xref> Furthermore there is evidence that fluoroquinolones, such as moxifloxacin, have resulted in better bacteriological eradication than some other drug classes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-copd-6-373">23</xref> This was seen in the MOSAIC study,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-copd-6-373">20</xref> in which moxifloxacin was equivalent to standard comparators for short-term clinical outcomes, but was superior with respect to bacteriological eradication and resulted in fewer exacerbations in the 8 weeks following treatment than comparators.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-copd-6-373">20</xref> MAESTRAL has built upon the design and outcomes of MOSAIC in a number of ways. As well as using the 8-week endpoint, MAESTRAL enrolls patients identified in a post hoc analysis of MOSAIC data as having a high risk of relapse.</p><p>In the majority of noninferiority trials, sample size is calculated in order to detect a difference between treatment groups in failure rates of &#x0003c;10%. Conversely, in MAESTRAL, the high number of patients recruited was driven by a 6% margin for noninferiority, which is a much more rigorous definition. The use of a superiority protocol follows Food and Drug Administration guidance on trial design, which cautions that noninferiority trials have previously failed to show a benefit of one antibiotic over another.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44-copd-6-373">44</xref> A further novel element in the design of MAESTRAL is the inclusion of AECB-SS and SGRQ questionnaires. Such patient-reported outcomes can provide important insights into clinical outcomes like symptom improvement and quality of life, as well as providing information that will enable the DRC to make informed decisions about the true clinical outcomes. Use of repeated spirometry measurements in MAESTRAL is also an innovative feature for an antibiotic trial, ensuring that only patients with moderate or severe COPD are enrolled and providing another means of monitoring response to treatment.</p><p>DRC members receive patient information in a blinded fashion for those who were clinical failures or had an indeterminate response. Through assessment of all documented clinical information and investigator decisions (although the DRC are blinded to clinical outcome assessments by investigators), the DRC is able to assess whether the patient is a true failure or relapse. This includes going back to investigators via the study managers (ie, in a blinded fashion) to challenge a decision. For example, when the clinical information suggests a clinical relapse, but antibiotic or oral steroid are not prescribed, it may be because the patient attended another clinic; whereas when clinical information suggests stability, but an antibiotic or steroid are prescribed, further questioning of the investigator could reveal that it was not prescribed for a relapse. The DRC also decides, based on prescribing habits, on steroid use that is a violation of protocol vs steroid use that is continued because of persistent symptoms, ie, clinical failure.</p><p>There are potential limitations to the design of MAESTRAL. The choice of clinical failure at 8 weeks post-therapy as the primary endpoint is based on the best evidence available, but may not prove to be the optimum duration &#x02013; potentially an even longer timescale might be desirable. However, it should also be noted that long-term follow-up can be subject to multiple confounders. Additionally, while steps have been taken to control for concomitant medications and oral corticosteroid use, stratification was limited to corticosteroid use and not undertaken for the use of long-acting bronchodilator and/or inhaled corticosteroids (though the inhaled medications were used at a stabilized dose).</p><p>Despite these limitations, it is anticipated that MAESTRAL will provide further evidence as to the most appropriate study design for trials of antibiotics in AECOPD, and it should also provide some information about the extent of the relative roles of antibiotics and systemic corticosteroids in the treatment of AECOPD. Irrespective of whether noninferiority or superiority is achieved, the results should add further to the debate on optimal trial design in this condition. It is hoped that MAESTRAL may also help to inform guidelines and allow physicians to optimize clinical outcomes and reduce AECOPD-related health care costs through appropriate patient profiling and antibiotic choice.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><p>
