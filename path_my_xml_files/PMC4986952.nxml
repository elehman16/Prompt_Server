LTP in hippocampus is supposed to be involved in learning and memory formation [<xref rid="pone.0161117.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. LTP of synaptic transmission in nociceptive pathways has been considered to be an underlying mechanism behind central sensitization [<xref rid="pone.0161117.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0161117.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Various conditioning electrical stimulation (CES) protocols have been used to induce LTP in the central nervous system <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0161117.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0161117.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and the perceptual correlates in pain on humans [<xref rid="pone.0161117.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0161117.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The CES induced LTP-like pain amplification in healthy humans has been considered to be a surrogate model of hyperalgesia and allodynia in patients [<xref rid="pone.0161117.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0161117.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0161117.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Different frequencies of CES is intended to mimic different nociceptor discharging frequencies following tissue damage, e.g., 10 Hz CES mimic the low frequency discharging of C- fiber nociceptors during certain natural inflammatory pain conditions [<xref rid="pone.0161117.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0161117.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], whereas 100 Hz bursts mimic the initial high frequency discharging immediately after a tissue injury [<xref rid="pone.0161117.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Among them, 10 Hz electrical stimulation has previously been shown to induce LTP of field potentials in the spinal dorsal horn by electrical stimulation of the tract of Lissauer which has a high percentage of small fibers transmitting nociceptive activity [<xref rid="pone.0161117.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Similarly, 10 Hz CES of primary afferent fibers can induce LTP of spinothalamic tract neurons which were also involved in the nociception transmission [<xref rid="pone.0161117.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In humans, continuous 10 Hz CES has been shown to induce long-lasting facilitation of perceived pain intensity to mechanical stimuli similar to the traditional high frequency (100 Hz) bursts CES [<xref rid="pone.0161117.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Moreover, low frequency CES is associated with higher neurogenic superficial blood flow increase (neurogenic inflammation) than high frequency CES [<xref rid="pone.0161117.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0161117.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>However, no studies so far have shown the reliability of 10 Hz CES induced pain amplification and inflammatory changes before potential translation of this human model to pharmacological testing or pain modulation studies. Test-retest reliability is an assessment of the measurement error (variation) that can be deemed to be acceptable. It is quantified by the extent to which the measurements are consistent [<xref rid="pone.0161117.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0161117.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The traditional reliability tests include assessments of relative and absolute reliability [<xref rid="pone.0161117.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The relative reliability refers to the degree to which individuals maintain their position over repeated measurements usually by use of intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC); in contrast, the absolute reliability refers to the degree to which repeated measurements vary for individuals and is traditionally measured by the coefficient of variation (CV) and Bland-Altman analysis [<xref rid="pone.0161117.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Additionally, sample size estimation has now been proposed to be an alternative to traditional measures of absolute and relative reliability [<xref rid="pone.0161117.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0161117.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0161117.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>The aim of the present study was 1) to measure the test-retest reliability of sensory and neurogenic inflammation measurements in 10 Hz CES paradigm within and between sessions, and 2) to estimate the sample sizes needed for mechanical and electrical stimulation outcome measures of hyperalgesia and dysesthesia, and imaging technologies used for assessing neurogenic inflammation. The sample size estimations can be used for future crossover and parallel pharmacological testing or pain modulation studies when employing the 10 Hz CES paradigm.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Subjects</title><p>The experiments were performed on 20 subjects (8 females and 12 males ranging in the age from 20 to 36 years; mean age 24 years) after obtaining approval from the Research Ethics Committee of the North Denmark (N-20120046). All subjects participated in a training session and two experimental sessions. During all sessions, the subjects were seated in a reclining chair with the right arm placed comfortably on the table in a room with temperature at 22~24&#x000b0;C. Exclusion criteria were prior or current skin disease, neurological disease, any history of chronic pain as well as drug abuse or suffering from ongoing pain. All subjects gave written informed consent prior to their inclusion in the study. The study was performed according to the Declaration of Helsinki.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Conditioning Electrical Stimulation (CES)</title><p>Cutaneous electrical stimulation from a constant current stimulator (DS5; Digitimer Ltd; Welwyn Garden City, UK) was applied to the right forearm 7cm distal to the cubital fossa. The electrical stimuli were applied using an epicutaneous pin electrode (EPE) consisting of a circular array (diameter: 10 mm; area: 79 mm<sup>2</sup>) of fifteen cathodal electrodes each with a diameter of 0.2 mm, protruding 1 mm from the base, and a large circular stainless steel plate served as anode with an inner diameter of 20 mm and an outer diameter of 40 mm placed concentrically around the cathodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0161117.g001">Fig 1<italic>A</italic></xref>) (Biurrun Manresa <italic>et al</italic>., 2010). This electrode has been verified to induce pain/stinging at low stimulation intensities compared with conventional cutaneous patch electrodes because the diameter of the cathodes is smaller so high current density is achieved in the epidermal layers where the nociceptive A&#x003b4;- and C-fibers terminate (Mouraux et al., 2010; M&#x000f8;rch et al., 2011). The individual electrical detection threshold (DTh) was determined using the method of limits: three series of electrical pulses with increasing and decreasing stimulus intensities at a step size of the 3% present stimulation intensity. In each series of stimulation pulses, all subjects stopped the stimulation when feeling the electrical pulse upon increasing the intensities, and then stopped again when the electrical pulse became insensible upon decreasing the intensities. The electrical stimulus intensities were recorded as the DTh each time they stopped. The final DTh was determined by the geometric mean of the six DThs in three series of assessments. 10 Hz CES (pulse duration: 1 ms) was used for induction of LTP-like pain. This CES process lasted 50 sec and consisted of 500 rectangular 1 ms pulses applied (continuous train, no bursting) at 10&#x000d7; DTh evoking a clearly painful sensation.</p><fig id="pone.0161117.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0161117.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Experimental setup.</title><p>(A) 10 Hz conditioning electrical stimulation was applied at the volar forearm 7 cm distal to the cubital fossa via a circular array of pin electrodes in two sessions.

The first training session was aimed to familiarize the subjects with the different stimulus modalities and gaining experience with rating these stimuli. This arrangement helps to reduce any systematic errors, i.e., learning effects [<xref rid="pone.0161117.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The data obtained during the training session was not analyzed further. The 10 Hz CES paradigm for inducing LTP-like pain was repeated on two different days separated by at least one week for the individual subject. All subjects were blinded throughout the study with respect to the sequence of the pinprick stimuli and rationale of the study. A set of outcome measures similar to the study by Xia et al., 2016 was applied at the right forearm three times before and six times after the CES with 10 min interval [<xref rid="pone.0161117.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0161117.g001">Fig 1<italic>B</italic></xref>). The assessments consisted of neurogenic inflammation imaging using laser speckle blood-flow imagery for measuring superficial blood flow (SBF) and infrared thermography for measuring skin temperature (ST), assessments of pinprick and light-stroking perception intensities surrounding the conditioned site (heterotopic), perceived intensity to homotopic single electrical stimulation (SES) and heat pain threshold (HPT) at the conditioned site. To evaluate perceived stimulation intensity, a VAS was used that was anchored from 0 (no sensation) to 100 (the most intense pain imaginable) where 30 indicated the pain threshold [<xref rid="pone.0161117.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0161117.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0161117.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The same researcher performed all experiments to rule out the inter-rater variation.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Perception Features of CES</title><p>The subjects were asked to rate continuously the magnitude of pain induced by the 10 Hz CES using a hand-held VAS device. These VAS ratings were sampled by a computer. All subjects were further asked to describe the quality of the CES using the short-form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ). The SF-MPQ consists of sensory (S) and affective (A) dimensions of pain, evaluative overall intensity of total pain experience (E), and present pain intensity (PPI) index of the standard MPQ. PPI is the average pain intensity of the 10 Hz CES that all subjects gave after finishing rating the conditioning process. All rating scores were added together to get a total quantitative value (Melzack, 1987).</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Neurogenic Inflammation</title><p>To assess the possible excitation of peptidergic nerve fibers and observe the temporal changes of SBF in the area surrounding the conditioned site, a Full-Field Laser Perfusion Imager (FLPI) was used to assess the SBF index (MoorFLPI; Moor Instruments Ltd, Axminister, Uk). The changes in ST in the area surrounding the conditioned site were measured using infrared thermography (Thermovision A40; FLIR; Danderyd, Sweden). The SBF and ST were measured in a round area with a diameter of 15 mm concentric to the circular pin electrodes. The measured area did not cover the area of pinprick stimuli.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Light-Stroking Stimuli</title><p>A cotton swab was used for light stroking stimuli (~100mN) for assessing the tactile perception around the conditioned site.

The subjects gave a perception rating to the light-stroking with a distance of 1 cm moving at a speed of 1&#x02013;2 cm/s using the VAS as mentioned above.

The data (pre- and post- CES) was included in the statistical analysis. The VAS ratings of light-stroking stimuli and the SBF index were logarithmically transformed to obtain the lognormal distribution. The one-way repeated measure analysis of variance (RM-ANOVA; SPSS v. 21.0) was used to determine differences between the SF-MPQ scores of CES in two sessions. The two-way RM-ANOVA (the time and conditioning sessions were within-subjects factors) was used for SBF, ST, HPT, pain perception intensities to light-stroking and pinprick stimuli, and SES to determine the systematic bias between two sessions and the effect size of the CES. Greenhouse-Geissers method was used for the correction of non-sphericity. Bonferroni-Holm adjustment was used for multiple comparisons. The data is presented as mean values&#x000b1;SEM (standard error of the mean). <italic>P</italic>-value&#x0003c;0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.</p><p>The relative reliability was assessed using intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) whereas the absolute reliability was assessed using coefficient of variation (CV) and Bland-Altman analysis.

Sample size estimations for crossover and parallel study designs were also estimated as a valid alternative approach for assessing the reliability in the present study.</p><p>The ICC two-way mixed model (type: consistency) was used to estimate the relative reliability both within and between sessions. The reliability related to the consistency of a test or measurement was quantified by ICC which is variation between subjects divided by the total variation in the data [<xref rid="pone.0161117.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The ICC ranges from 0 (no agreement) to 1 (perfect agreement). Even though there is no consensus on the cut-point values, values above 0.75 are usually suggested to indicate good reliability and below 0.75 to indicate fair to poor reliability [<xref rid="pone.0161117.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The ICCs of single measures for crossover (ICCwi) and parallel (ICCbt) study design were reported. Coefficient of variation (CV) was used for estimating the absolute reliability and is the standard deviation (SD) divided by the mean (<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>) of each measurement for each individual.

Sample size estimation is the basic step before starting studies using the 10 Hz CES induced neurogenic pain sensitization model. Reproducible assessment methods combined with an adequate sample size (number of subjects) can help to establish a reliable study design. The outcome measures of neurogenic inflammation and pain sensitization induced by the 10 Hz CES in the present study showed acceptable reliability, especially for application in crossover study designs.</p><sec id="sec026"><title>Features of 10 Hz CES</title><p>In the present study, the pain intensity during the 10 Hz CES process was high for 20 s then gradually decreased. The declining pain sensation during the 50 s conditioning process may be due to habituation, i.e., subjects gradually got used to the stimulus when that stimulus is applied repeatedly [<xref rid="pone.0161117.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0161117.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. 10 Hz electrical stimulation paradigm was applied to mimic the low frequency discharge of C-fiber nociceptors during neuropathic or inflammatory pain conditions. During neurogenic or inflammatory conditions, sustained low frequency C-fiber barrage of the central nervous system may contribute to hyperalgesia [<xref rid="pone.0161117.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0161117.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0161117.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In fact, C-fiber nociceptor discharge is able to follow low frequency (1&#x02013;10 Hz) electrical stimulation [<xref rid="pone.0161117.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The pain perception intensity during the conditioning process in session one was higher than during session two whereas the SF-MPQ scores and PPI were not different between the two sessions. The PPI is an average value which subjects gave for rating the pain intensity during the conditioning process. These results indicate that the overall pain experience for 10 Hz CES process is relatively stable between sessions. However, the systematic error, i.e. a learning effect, is likely to contribute to the session difference in rating the pain during the conditioning process. It is likely that subjects in session two perceived less pain as a result of their prior experience in session one [<xref rid="pone.0161117.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec027"><title>Neurogenic Inflammation&#x02013;Vascular Outcome Measures</title><p>Peptidergic nerve endings, mainly C-fibers, after being activated by nociceptive electrical stimulation can release neuropeptides, e.g., substance P, calcitonin gene-related peptide [<xref rid="pone.0161117.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. These substances induce neurogenic inflammation as a consequence of capillary vasodilatation, plasma extravasation, attraction of macrophages, or degranulation of mast cells [<xref rid="pone.0161117.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0161117.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. In the present study, the SBF significantly increased after 10 Hz CES most probably indicating the activation of these C-fiber nociceptors [<xref rid="pone.0161117.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. It took one hour for the blood flow to return to the level 10 min before CES. This allows time for observing potential drug effects on neurogenic superficial blood flow changes. The average skin temperature at the site of the blood flow flare, however, showed a declining tendency during the whole observation period. One possible reason could be that exposing the arm for one full hour could lead to gradually lower skin temperature and thereby less superficial blood flow. This will eventually also lead to lower skin temperature. However, the decline of skin temperature was halted for 20 minutes after 10 Hz CES which may indicate that 10 Hz CES indeed induced an increase in skin temperature for a short time period possibly counteracting the skin cooling. As a consequence, the skin temperature kept stable for 20 minutes after CES. Therefore, the skin temperature may not be a good indicator for neurogenic inflammation induced by the 10 Hz CES paradigm as it appears to be affected by surrounding circumstances.</p><p>A reliable assessment of neurogenic inflammation in cutaneous hyperalgesia models is extremely important as it is related to the extent of irritation on the peripheral afferents [<xref rid="pone.0161117.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0161117.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0161117.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Furthermore, it can be used for assessment of drug effect [<xref rid="pone.0161117.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0161117.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. In previous studies, the SBF has been used as an indicator for measuring neurogenic inflammation in many neurogenic hyperalgesia models as drugs may interact with peripheral afferents affecting the release of neurogenic transmitters [<xref rid="pone.0161117.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0161117.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0161117.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. From ICC values (ICCwi = 0.79, ICCbt = 0.62) and sample sizes estimation (Ncr = 3, Np = 13) in the present study, SBF has good reliability for measuring the neurogenic inflammation both in crossover and parallel study designs. The Bland-Altman plot showed that the level of equality was within the CI indicating acceptable agreement between two sessions. Hence, it is recommended to include this parameter when using the 10 Hz CES paradigm in potential drug testing studies.</p></sec><sec id="sec028"><title>Heterotopic Pain-LTP</title><p>In the present study, pain ratings to pinprick stimuli (heterotopic hyperalgesia) and light stroking (dysesthesia) around the conditioned site were found to increase after 10 Hz CES. The increased perception ratings lasted until the end of the observation period (one hour). In previous studies, high frequency, repetitive, electrical stimulation of primary nociceptive C-fibers has led to dynamic mechanical allodynia and mechanical hyperalgesia surrounding the conditioned area [<xref rid="pone.0161117.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0161117.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0161117.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. TRPV1-positive C-fibers (major contribution) and TRPV1-positive A-fibers (minor contribution) were found to be the main inducers of heterotopic pain-LTP [<xref rid="pone.0161117.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Furthermore, TRPV1-negative A-fibers were found to be the main afferents for mediating secondary pinprick hyperalgesia, but without taking effect in the induction of heterotopic LTP-like pain amplification [<xref rid="pone.0161117.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. In the present study, the perception intensity to non-painful pinprick stimulation (125 mN) also increased after 10 Hz CES, and therefore, both nociceptive and non-nociceptive pinprick neurotransmission seem to be facilitated by CES. Furthermore, our results support the notion that heterotopic pain-LTP reflects central mechanisms, but not peripheral mechanisms [<xref rid="pone.0161117.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Firstly, the pinprick stimuli located outside of the blood flow flare indicating no direct influence from sensitized peripheral nociceptors due to the inflammatory mediators [<xref rid="pone.0161117.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Secondly, the neurogenic inflammation indicators and the sensory changes had different time courses; the decrease in superficial blood flow after 10 Hz CES did not follow the increase in pinprick perception. Furthermore, it took 30 min for the pain ratings to light-stroking stimuli to reach a plateau which is also not synchronized to the vascular findings.</p><p>Regarding the measures of heterotopic pinprick hyperalgesia, the non-painful (125 mN) and mild painful (294 mN) stimulators in session one were higher than in session two. In addition, as shown in the Bland-Altman plot, the level of equality was not within the CI of the mean difference, which indicates a bias between sessions. For the painful (491 mN) stimulus, however, no significant difference was observed between the two sessions. Moreover, the most reliable results were also obtained with the heaviest pinprick stimulus (491 mN) for crossover (ICCwi = 0.90, Ncr = 6) and parallel (ICCbt = 0.88, Np = 54) study designs. The higher weight of the pinprick stimulus, the higher ICC values and smaller sample size were shown. Therefore, the painful pinprick method is a reliable indicator for the facilitation of A&#x003b4;-fiber pathway mediating heterotopic pinprick hyperalgesia. The session effect found for 125 mN and 294 mN pinprick testing may indicate that the subjects were more familiar with the experimental process, and therefore responded with smaller pain ratings (learning effect) [<xref rid="pone.0161117.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The pain perception rating for light-stroking was reliable (ICCwi = 0.96, ICCbt = 0.89) with acceptable sample sizes (Ncr = 2, Np = 33) for measuring the pain perception at the facilitated non-nociceptive A-&#x003b2; fiber pathway both in crossover and parallel study designs.</p></sec><sec id="sec029"><title>Homotopic Pain-LTP</title><p>In the present study, the pain perception to SES at the conditioned site did not increase after 10 Hz CES. This indicates the absence of homotopic pain-LTP. In van den Broeke&#x02019;s study (2012), the pain intensity of SES did also not increase after 100 Hz CES in both conditioned and unconditioned skin sites, despite the coexistence of enhanced event-related potentials in the central nervous system [<xref rid="pone.0161117.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] while a declining perception intensity was also observed in another study only with a minor change in the homotopic pain [<xref rid="pone.0161117.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This was hypothesized to be caused by 1) the counter effects of LTP and long-term depression which resulted from the concurrent activation of C-fiber and A-&#x003b4; fiber pathways by conditioning electrical stimulation, respectively [<xref rid="pone.0161117.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]; 2) the habituation because of repetitive electrical stimuli [<xref rid="pone.0161117.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]; 3) the hypoesthesia which can be induced by 20 Hz continuous CES at C-fiber strength [<xref rid="pone.0161117.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]; or 4) a technical reason that the repositioning of the electrode may mask the pain amplification resulting in a statistical type-2 error in the present study. The technical reason cannot be avoided in the present study. Because of the measurement of the neurogenic inflammation, the electrode had to be removed and then placed back to the same skin area for the sensory testing. Reposition of the electrode could also change the impedance between the skin and electrode, which may influence the stimulation intensity.</p><p>The HPT was found to increase after 10 Hz CES, which indicates that heat pain hyperalgesia was also absent which was in agreement with the observations by Lang et al. (2007) for 100 Hz conditioning stimulation [<xref rid="pone.0161117.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. This might reflect the same mechanisms for the absence of increased pain perception to single electrical stimulation. Thermal hyperalgesia at the stimulation/injury area is a typical feature of primary hyperalgesia and has been demonstrated to be largely due to the primary afferents sensitization [<xref rid="pone.0161117.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Therefore, the absence of heat hyperalgesia at the conditioned area in humans indicates a lack of peripheral sensitization in the 100 Hz and 10 Hz CES models; alternatively, the HPT measurement employed in the present study is not a good indicator for testing the heat hyperalgesia compared with suprathreshold heat stimuli [<xref rid="pone.0161117.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0161117.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. The LTP in the C fiber pathway is both NMDA receptor and AMPA receptor-dependent [<xref rid="pone.0161117.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0161117.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. The inhibitors of calcium/calmodulin dependent protein kinase II, protein kinase A, protein kinase C, and phospholipase C have been shown to prevent induction of spinal LTP in the signal transduction pathways indicating that LTP induction is calcium dependent [<xref rid="pone.0161117.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0161117.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0161117.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. LTP induction also relies upon other molecular players such as substance P and the neurokinin 1 receptor [<xref rid="pone.0161117.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In human studies, low-dose of ketamine has been reported to prevent hyperalgesia at the conditioned site in the 100 Hz CES paradigm, but not able to affect secondary hyperalgesia or allodynia at adjacent skin areas [<xref rid="pone.0161117.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. In the present study, the pain perception intensity to SES for testing the homotopic pain-LTP showed an acceptable, relative reliability both in within and between sessions (ICCwi = 0.94, ICCbt = 0.85). However, the minor effect of 10 Hz CES on the homotopic pain amplification observed in the present study led to a large number of subjects required in potential crossover and parallel studies. This indicates that additional future studies are needed to understand the complex homotopic pain amplification mechanisms.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec030"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The present study showed that in the 10 Hz CES paradigm, the induced neurogenic inflammation and heterotopic mechanical hyperalgesia outcome measures are reliable for a period of at least one hour and between two CES sessions with at least one week interval. Assessment of superficial blood flow is highly reliable and recommended for assessment of neurogenic inflammation in both potential crossover and parallel drug testing studies. In potential crossover drug testing studies, heavy painful (491 mN) pinprick stimulation reliably assessed heterotopic mechanical hyperalgesia Assessment of dysesthesia by light-stroking stimuli showed an excellent reliability in both potential crossover and parallel drug testing studies. However, the absence of homotopic hyperalgesia indicates the complex mechanisms when applying different patterns of CES, which need further research. In conclusion, it is important to select adequate assessment tools and study designs with good reliability before conducting experiments to test drug effects. The results from this study can be an essential link between animal and human nociception studies and make the 10 Hz CES paradigm an alternative for inducing pain LTP in healthy humans.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0161117.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Malenka</surname><given-names>RC</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Bear</surname><given-names>MF</given-names></name>. <article-title>LTP and LTD: an embarrassment of riches</article-title>. <source>Neuron</source>. <year>2004</year>;<volume>44</volume>: <fpage>5</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>21</lpage>. <comment>doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2004.09.012">10.1016/j.neuron.2004.09.012</ext-link></comment>
