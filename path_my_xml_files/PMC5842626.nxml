Children&#x02019;s opportunities for risky play have eroded over time, limited by parents&#x02019; fears and beliefs about risk, particularly among mothers. We developed a digital tool and in-person Risk-reframing (RR) workshop to reframe parents&#x02019; perceptions of risk and change parenting behaviours. The purpose of this paper is to describe our RR intervention, rationale and protocol for a randomised controlled trial to examine whether it leads to increases in mothers&#x02019; tolerance of risk in play and goal attainment relating to promoting their child&#x02019;s opportunities for risky play.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">We use a randomised controlled trial design and will recruit a total of 501 mothers of children aged 6&#x02013;12 years. The RR digital tool is designed for a one-time visit and includes three chapters of self-reflection and experiential learning tasks. The RR in-person tool is a 2-h facilitated workshop in which participants are guided through discussion of the same tasks contained within the digital tool. The control condition consists of reading the Position Statement on Active Outdoor Play.</p><p id="Par3">Primary outcome is increased tolerance of risk in play, as measured by the Tolerance of Risk in Play Scale. Secondary outcome is self-reported attainment of a behaviour-change goal that participants set for themselves.</p><p id="Par4">We will test the hypothesis that there will be differences between the experimental and control conditions with respect to tolerance of risk in play using mixed-effects models. We will test the hypothesis that there will be differences between the experimental and control conditions with respect to goal attainment using logistic regression.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par5">The results of this trial will have important implications for facilitating the widespread change in parents&#x02019; risk perception that is necessary for promoting broad societal understanding of the importance of children&#x02019;s risky play. In addition, the findings may provide relevant information for the design of behaviour-change tools to increase parental tolerance of risk.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par6">ClinicalTrials.gov, ID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">NCT03374683</ext-link>.

More recently, opportunities for unstructured play have been linked to children&#x02019;s mental and physical health, including promoting physical activity, mental wellbeing, and executive function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In particular, the importance of outdoor play for promoting physical activity has been recently capitalised upon by numerous governments and public health campaigns in order to address the growing obesity epidemic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par13">The opportunity to engage with risk is a fundamental part of play. Typically occurring outdoors, risky play involves experimenting with uncertainty and overcoming fears [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Sandseter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] outlines six categories of risky play, including play at speed (e.g. game of chase), heights (e.g. climbing trees), with tools (e.g. building a fort), near dangerous elements (e.g. fire, water, cliffs) and venturing out without adults (e.g. walking to school with friends). Scholarship investigating risky play has intensified in the last decade and has identified that exposure to risky play can help children to gain mastery, promote self-confidence and social skills, and reduce anxiety and depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. A systematic review found positive associations with physical activity and social health, negative associations with sedentary behaviour, and no association with injury risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Four- and 6-year-old children participating in a 14-week intervention that involved engaging in activities reflecting the different types of risky play improved their reaction time in detecting risk, increased self-esteem and decreased conflict sensitivity relative to their pre-intervention performance, as well as when compared to an age-matched control group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. A cross-sectional study compared 5-year-olds with and without ready access to unsupervised outdoor play opportunities and found more developed motor skills, social behaviour, independence and conflict resolution in the former group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Furthermore, experience with risk during childhood is believed to assist with developing risk-management strategies, and the ability to negotiate decisions about substance use, relationships and sexual behaviour during adolescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par14">Children&#x02019;s independent mobility, which refers to their freedom to travel around their neighbourhood by themselves without adult supervision, is one example of outdoor risky play and may be important for facilitating other opportunities for risky play [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However, opportunities for outdoor risky play regarding independent mobility have been increasingly eroded over time. In England, the percentage of children aged 7&#x02013;11 years who were allowed to travel to school alone in 1971 was 86%. This dropped to 35% in 1990 and then to 25% in 2010 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Australian research reported that 12% of Australian children aged 8&#x02013;12 years were not permitted to go anywhere without an adult, and 32% had an independent mobility range of less than one block [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Canadian research with 9&#x02013;13-year-old children found that on average 94.5% of the participants&#x02019; time was spent less than 400 m from their homes and that they spent only a very small portion of their time in the larger neighbourhood context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par15">Numerous international studies have identified that parental fears, attitudes about social dangers, and perceptions of the value of free play and outdoor autonomy exert a strong influence on children&#x02019;s outdoor risky play opportunities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In a 16-nation study, traffic safety concerns, followed by fear of strangers, were the strongest factors investigated that influenced parents&#x02019; decisions regarding children&#x02019;s independent mobility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Children&#x02019;s risk taking in play is also limited by fear of serious injury and of disapproval and censure from other parents and adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Such parental anxieties have led to a &#x02018;backseat&#x02019; and &#x02018;bubble-wrapped&#x02019; generation, relying on automobile-based commuting and little unstructured outdoor play time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p id="Par16">Societal shifts to promote children&#x02019;s outdoor risky play may benefit by reframing parents&#x02019; beliefs about risk, which in turn may reduce anxiety-based caregiving. In particular, because mothers typically express greater concerns and place more limits on children&#x02019;s activities than fathers, they are an important target audience for efforts to promote change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Bundy and colleagues developed the Risk-reframing (RR) workshop, a 2-h, in-person group session in which parents and educators are led through a series of reflection points designed to change attitudes and behaviours related to children&#x02019;s outdoor play [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Its effectiveness has been previously documented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. However, the workshop format and length have significant resource implications, limiting its availability and amenability to large-scale distribution.</p><p id="Par17">Digital tools for health-behaviour change have become increasingly popular as vehicles for intervention delivery. They can provide an efficacious, convenient and cost-effective means of combining broad reach with the tailored approach of in-person interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Using Bundy et al.&#x02019;s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] RR workshop as a starting point, we used the principles of health-behaviour change and social cognitive theory to develop a RR intervention to reframe parents&#x02019; attitudes and behaviours about their children&#x02019;s outdoor risky play [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] consisting of an RR digital tool (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://outsideplay.ca">https://OutsidePlay.ca</ext-link>), and an in-person facilitated workshop (with PowerPoint slides and facilitator manual). Having two versions of the RR intervention may help maximise the reach and flexibility of the intervention, such that it can be accessed independently by anyone and be shared broadly with their network in addition to being offered as a workshop with a standardised delivery protocol by organisations, schools and recreation providers that work with parents. The purpose of this paper is to describe the RR intervention, our rationale and protocol for a randomised controlled trial to evaluate whether it influences mothers&#x02019; attitudes and self-reported behaviours relating to facilitating their child&#x02019;s opportunities for risky play.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Study aims, research questions, and hypotheses</title><p id="Par18">Our aim is to assess the effectiveness of the RR intervention to increase mothers&#x02019; tolerance for risky play and attain a behaviour-change goal relating to providing risky play opportunities for their 6&#x02013;12-year-old children.

The TRiPS is scored on a logit scale and we know from previous data collection among parents of 5&#x02013;13-year-old children that scores on the TRiPS range from 0.20 to about 1.95 with standard deviations in the range of 1.78 to 1.82 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. With a sample size of 81 mothers in each condition, a test that averaged the differences in TRiPS score from baseline to the first assessment will have 80% power at a 0.05 level of significance to detect a difference of 0.75 with the control condition when the standard deviation is 1.82 and the correlation between repeated observations is 0.75. From our previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], we expect needing to complete baseline assessments among 501 mothers who will then be randomised into the three conditions. From our previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], we are assuming a 65% retention rate at our first assessment (<italic>n</italic> = 325) and a 75% retention rate at our second assessment, which would result in a final sample of 244 mothers, corresponding to 81 in each condition.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Intervention</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>RR digital tool</title><p id="Par37">We adapted Bundy and colleagues&#x02019; RR in-person workshop [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] using social cognitive theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] to incorporate health behaviour-change techniques (BCT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] that were amenable to a stand-alone online platform that was efficient, taking little time to understand and use, and would not require repeated visits to the tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. For example, the use of associations, and reward and threat were not deemed possible as they would require an external assessor and/or repeat visits to the tool. We sought to address common concerns about risky play and engage participants in self-reflection tasks to consider how these concepts applied to their parenting approach. The participant proceeds through three chapters, as outlined in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. The tool takes 15&#x02013;45 min to complete, depending on participants&#x02019; movement through each task. Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> also outlines the BCT and social cognitive theory constructs that correspond to each task. Not reflected in the table are the following social cognitive theory constructs: social support, normative beliefs, and reinforcement and punishment. Social support (along with BCT 3.3 Social support (emotional)) is being addressed via encouraging participants to share the digital tool with their co-parent and social networks to promote discussion and change. Related to this, sharing the digital tool with their network may help prompt a shift in normative beliefs about risky play among their peer group. Reinforcement and punishments are not addressed because the tool involves interaction at one time point and these constructs would emerge after mothers try to make changes. For example, a punishment could be that their child is injured while engaged in risky play; a reinforcement could be that their child seems more confident since having more opportunities for risky play.

This four-page document summarises the issues and research regarding children&#x02019;s access to outdoor play and provides recommendations for various stakeholders. It was developed by a cross-sectoral consortium of researchers, practitioners and stakeholders. It states that &#x02018;Access to active play in nature and outdoors &#x02013; with its risks &#x02013; is essential for healthy child development&#x02019; and recommends increasing children&#x02019;s opportunities for self-directed play in all settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. The Position Statement includes recommendations for parents, educators, health professionals, administrators and various levels of governments to address the barriers to children&#x02019;s outdoor play. Recognising the role of widespread risk aversion in limiting play, the Position Statement addresses common misconceptions and encourages that danger be differentiated from risk and outdoor play and fun be valued as much as safety.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Study data</title><sec id="Sec14"><title>Measurement occasions and follow-up</title><p id="Par41">Participants will complete a questionnaire package at three time points: baseline (T1), 1 week post intervention (T2) and 3 months post intervention (T3). Long-term change is unlikely if participants do not make initial changes, thus, the 1-week follow-up was selected to assess short-term effectiveness, while still providing participants sufficient time to make their initial planned changes. The 3-month follow-up will assess long-term effectiveness once participants have had several months to reflect on the intervention and implement change.</p><p id="Par42">Survey data will be collected and managed using REDCap.

The scale is based on Sandseter&#x02019;s six-category model of risky play [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Goodness-of-fit statistics for TRiPS have been found to be in the acceptable range [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Examination of logical item hierarchy indicated that items that were relatively difficult to endorse (e.g. &#x02018;Would you let the child play near the edge of steep cliffs?&#x02019;) were located higher on the hierarchy than those that were easier to endorse (e.g. &#x02018;Would you let the child play in the backyard supervised?&#x02019;). The Person Separation Index was 2.63, indicating that the measure separated persons into more than two distinct groups, such as more and less risk tolerant. The Person Reliability Index was 0.87 indicating that the instrument was able to consistently differentiate between those scoring high versus low. Self-perceived risk tolerance was highly positively associated with scores on TRiPS, and the mean score increased with age of the child [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].</p><p id="Par45">The secondary outcome measure is self-reported behaviour change<italic>.</italic> Behaviour change is being measured by their self-reported progress on attaining the goal they set for themselves within the RR tool.

The potential benefits are that participants learn more about the importance of children&#x02019;s outdoor risky play. Also, potential benefits could come from changes in parenting practices that allow the child to engage in more risky play. The study has been approved by the University of British Columbia/Children&#x02019;s and Women&#x02019;s Health Centre of British Columbia Research Ethics Board (Certificate #H15&#x02013;03271).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par54">Children&#x02019;s engagement in risky play has been associated with a multitude of developmental, physical and mental health outcomes. Despite this, children&#x02019;s opportunities for risky play show steady decline across generations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Parent fears and exaggerated perceptions of risks, such as abduction and traffic injury, are a major deterrent to children&#x02019;s engagement in risky play [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The RR tool seeks to address and reframe parents&#x02019; beliefs about risk and shift their parenting approach. Using established behaviour-change techniques grounded in social cognitive theory, the RR tool provides an innovative evidence-based, rigorously designed method to influence individual and societal views on children&#x02019;s risky play. The digital tool can be easily and widely shared for broad reach, and the in-person workshop can be integrated into the pre-existing curriculum of organisations that work with parents.</p><p id="Par55">This study will comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness of the digital and in-person workshop versions of the RR tool. It will also add to the understanding of the potential effectiveness of digital technology in influencing parental attitudes and behaviours with regard to risky play. The findings will provide rich data to inform widespread RR efforts to increase opportunities for outdoor risky play among children.</p><sec id="Sec24"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par56">Recruitment for the study began on 30 November 2017 and is anticipated to be completed by 31 December 2018.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec25"><p>
