In the flexible<sub>MIB</sub> group, subjects received one EE 20&#x02005;&#x000b5;g/DRSP 3&#x02005;mg tablet per day for a flexible number of cycles (between three and 13). The minimum duration of active treatment in this group was 24&#x02005;days (&#x02018;mandatory phase&#x02019;). After the mandatory phase, the cycle could continue up to 120&#x02005;days or until the subject experienced three consecutive days of breakthrough bleeding or spotting (&#x02018;flexible phase&#x02019;), when they were advised to take a 4-day tablet-free interval (i.e. hormone-free interval). In the conventional regimen group, subjects received EE 20&#x02005;&#x000b5;g/DRSP 3&#x02005;mg once daily for 13 cycles (over 1&#x02005;year). Each cycle comprised 24&#x02005;days of active hormonal intake followed by 4&#x02005;days of placebo tablets (as a hormone-free interval). In the fixed extended regimen group, subjects received EE 20&#x02005;&#x000b5;g/DRSP 3&#x02005;mg once daily for three cycles; each cycle comprised 120&#x02005;days of uninterrupted active hormonal intake followed by a 4-day tablet-free interval.

For each sample, the exact sampling time and the time of the preceding drug intake were recorded. Following collection in 9 ml serum monovettes or vacutainers without anticoagulant, blood samples were coagulated at room temperature for 20&#x02013;30&#x02005;minutes, before being centrifuged at 3000&#x02005;rpm for 10&#x02005;minutes.

The structural (sub-)model describes the relation between the administered dose of a drug and the changes in serum concentrations over time. The covariate (sub-)model describes the relation between a patient-specific characteristic (covariate) and the structural (population mean) PK parameter. The third (sub-)model is the stochastic model with two levels of stochastic (or random effect) model parameters that describe the variability between population mean estimates and observed concentrations.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref> Population PK models for EE and DRSP were developed and fitted to the data by means of non-linear mixed-effects modelling using the NONMEM<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> software package (Version VI.2 level 2; Icon Development Solutions, Ellicott City, MA, USA). The first-order conditional estimates approximation with interaction was used for estimation. Graphical and statistical exploration of the data was performed using S-Plus<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> for Windows (Version 8.0 Professional, Insightful Corp., Seattle, WA, USA).</p><p>Population PK models for EE and DRSP were developed based on available models describing data from a Phase I PK study with 21-day administration of EE/DRSP.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref> Based on the comparability of the study populations in terms of age and other demographic characteristics, it was assumed that the PK properties of both compounds in the current Phase III study population were similar to those in the previous Phase I study population.</p><p>The structural models of EE and DRSP were optimised by evaluating the presence of putative differences in PK between occasions. To this extent, clearance, central volume of distribution (V2) and bioavailability (F) were estimated separately per visit.</p><p>Covariate analyses were performed separately for the PK of EE and DRSP. Based on prior knowledge, it was decided to include age, body weight (BW), body mass index (BMI), and the influence of alcohol, smoking, ethnic group and concomitant medications (CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers and acetaminophen) in the analysis. Data on age, BMI, BW, number of cigarettes and alcohol consumption were collected at both Week 3 and Week 27. Alcohol, smoking and concomitant medication use were included in the model only if reported in at least 10% of the population.</p><p>Covariate analysis was performed using a forward inclusion (<italic>p</italic>&#x02264;0.01) and backward elimination procedure (<italic>p</italic>&#x02264;0.001) in NONMEM.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>
