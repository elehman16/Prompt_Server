functions in treadmill-exercised Thoroughbred horses (n=5, 3 to 7 years old), using
recently developed techniques for measurement of serum d-ROMs for oxidative stress, and
BAP for antioxidative markers. Also, the effect of nasogastric administration of
hydrogen-rich water (HW) or placebo water preceding the treadmill exercise on these
parameters was examined. Each horse was subjected to a maximum level of treadmill exercise
in which the horses were exhausted at an average speed of 13.2 &#x000b1; 0.84 m/sec. Blood samples
were taken 4 times, immediately before the intake of HW or placebo water at 30 min
preceding the treadmill exercise, immediately before the exercise (pre-exercise),
immediately after the exercise (post-exercise) and at 30 min following the exercise. In
all horses, both d-ROMs and BAP values significantly increased at post-exercise. The
increase in d-ROMs tended to be lower in the HW trial, as compared to the placebo trial at
pre-exercise. The increase in BAP was considerable at approximately 150% of the
pre-exercise values in both the HW and placebo treatment trials. The BAP/d-ROMs ratio was
significantly elevated at post-exercise in both treatment trials, while a significant
elevation was also observed at pre-exercise in the HW trial. BAP, d-ROM, and the BAP/d-ROM
ratio tended to decline at 30 min after the exercise, except BAP and BAP/d-ROMs in the
placebo trial. These results demonstrate that the marked elevation of oxidative stress and
anitioxidative functions occurred simultaneously in the intensively exercised horses, and
suggest a possibility that HW has some antioxidative efficacy.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>BAP</kwd><kwd>d-ROMs</kwd><kwd>exercise</kwd><kwd>hydrogen-water</kwd><kwd>Thoroughbred</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Exercise training is known to produce oxidative stress, which is possibly derived from
mitochondria functions and the other cellular metabolisms [<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,

increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS) with free radicals in extracellular space in
skeletal muscles, blood and the other organs. The excessive increment of free radicals is
considered to induce tissue damage such as inflammation, necrosis and apoptosis, and may delay
the recovery from fatigue of skeletal muscle [<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].
Recently, a new technique for indirect measurement of ROS has been developed in clinical
medicine, and it is a more convenient technique than the method utilizing electron spin
resonance (ESR) that serves as a direct measurement of free radicals. To examine ROS in
humans, instead of ESR, Diacron-Reactive Oxygen Metabolites (d-ROMs) are used as an indicator
of the total amount of free radicals in ROS and non-ROS free radicals in the blood and
cerebrospinal fluid [<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="r42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Although many reports regarding the
correlation between d-ROMs changes and diseases or physical stress in humans have been
published, there have been few reports about d-ROMs in experimental animals [<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] or domestic animals [<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Fazio, F. <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]
reported a significant linear regression between d-ROMs and homocysteine values in
Thoroughbred horses after a 2,100-meter race. The possibility of increment of antioxidative
capacity by exercise training and the existence of daily rhythms of anti-oxidative parameters
has been suggested in horses [<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>It is known that the antioxidative system functions to protect the living body from oxidative
stress. Recent advances have also provided a fast and convenient method for measuring the
antioxidative potency in the blood by analysis of its reduction ability. The BAP (Biological
Antioxidant Potential) test, which has been recently developed in the clinical and sports
science fields [<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], reflects the reduction ability, the
amount of electron (e<sup>&#x02013;</sup>) supply, of the blood.</p><p>We conducted preliminary experiments using three non-Thoroughbred horses at the Animal
Resource Science Center of the University of Tokyo, to measure serum d-ROMs, BAP and
electrocardiograms of the horses before and after being exercised by a veteran rider with
5-min trotting repeated twice at 5- or 10-min intervals. We obtained valuable data indicating
clear increases in serum d-ROMs and BAP after the exercise, and conducted that it would be
necessary to demonstrate the oxidative and antioxidative changes in Thoroughbred horses under
the controlled condition of physical exercise on a treadmill, because such horses have
received regular daily trainings as athletes and the intensity of the exercise can be
experimentally controlled.</p><p>The evaluation of effects of dietary supplements on human athletes and animals has been
carried out through the examination of d-ROMs and BAP in the blood. The effects of vitamin E
supplementation on serum d-ROMs were examined in periparturient heifers, and showed that
decrease in d-ROMs was not observed after the supplementation [<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. A significant decrease in d-ROMs was recognized throughout the post-surgery
period in patients with esophageal cancer who were given an immuno-enhanced diet for 5 days
before surgery [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Recently, Aoki, K. <italic>et
al.</italic> [<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] reported there were no significant
changes in d-ROMs and BAP values of two groups of young soccer players, one orally given
placebo water and the other hyrdrogen-rich water (HW), after exercise at a load of 75% of
VO<sub>2</sub> max, even though the oral intake of HW prevented the elevation of the blood
lactate level. Only a few references are available on changes in d-ROMs and BAP induced by
physical exercise. Therefore, it is of interest to clarify, using recently developed
techniques, how the oxidative stress and antioxidative capacity are changed, and whether HW
affects these oxidative parameters, in Thoroughbred horses which are subjected to a high level
of exercise.</p><p>The objectives of this study were to demonstrate the exercise-induced alteration of serum
oxidative and antioxidative activities through measurements of d-ROMs and BAP, and the effects
of HW intake on these parameters in Thoroughbred horses under strictly controlled conditions
of treadmill exercise.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Horses</title><p>Five Thoroughbred horses (two females and three geldings), aged 4 to 7 years old with
body weight of 493.8 &#x000b1; 26.6 (mean &#x000b1; SD) kg, belonging to The Equine Research Institute,
Japan Racing Association, were assigned to the experiment. These horses had been routinely
grazed for 2 months and specially trained for treadmill exercise prior to this study.</p></sec><sec><title>Supplementation of hydrogen water</title><p>Hydrogen-rich water (HW) was made by special equipment (High Density Hydrogen Water,
Melodian Co., Tokyo, Japan) for the present study. The HW consisted of filtrated water
(pH=6.82) with a concentration of molecular hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) higher than 1 ppm.
Fresh HW that was made about 3 hr before the treadmill exercise was stored in an aluminum
bag (10 <italic>l</italic> in volume) and tightly sealed in order to prevent hydrogen gas escape. Two
liters of HW were administered into the esophagus via a nasogastric catheter 30 min before
the treadmill exercise. For the placebo trial, the same volume of normal water without
hydrogen was administered by the same method.</p></sec><sec><title>Experimental protocol</title><p>The overall protocol of this study is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>An illustration of the overall experimental procedure of the present study. Horses
were exercised with increment of load every 2 min at speeds of 1.6, 3.6, 7, 10, 12
and 13 m/s until they were exhausted. The first treadmill exercise was performed
after placebo administration and the second treadmill exercise was performed after
hydrogen-rich water (HW) administration, after one-week interval. Two litters of
placebo water or HW were administered to the esophagus by a nasogastric catheter in
each horse at 30 min before the treadmill exercise. Blood samples (serum) were
collected 4 times: 30 min before the exercise, immediately before the exercise,
post-exercise, and at 30 min after the exercise.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jes-24-001-g001"/></fig>. Treadmill exercise on a 6% incline was performed by each horse. Each horse was
exercised on the treadmill with stepwise increases of exercise intensity every 2 min, at
treadmill running speed of 1.6, 3.6, 7, 10, 12, 13 and 14 m/sec, until the horses became
thoroughly exhausted. By thoroughly exhausted, we mean that the horses were too exhausted
to maintain their position at the front of the treadmill with humane encouragement. The
average exhaustion speed was 13.2 &#x000b1; 0.84 m/sec.</p><p>The first treadmill exercise was performed after the placebo administration, and the
second treadmill exercise was performed after the HW administration, after one week
interval. In order to measure serum d-ROMs and BAP, venous blood samples of 10 m<italic>l</italic> were
collected. The blood samples were collected from the jugular vein immediately before the
administration of placebo water (distilled water) or HW, 30 min before the treadmill
exercise. Blood samples were also collected at pre-exercise, immediately before the onset
of treadmill exercise, at post-exercise, immediately after treadmill exercise, and at 30
min after the end of treadmill exercise. In addition to the samples, blood was collected
at 10:00 and 13:00 on a day without treadmill exercise from all five horses to determine
their background levels of d-ROMs and BAP.</p></sec><sec><title>Measurements of d-ROMs and BAP</title><p>The measurement of d-ROMs was performed using a colorimetric method of final derivatives,
i.e., hydroperoxide produced by free radicals, in which hydroperoxide in the serum reacts
with N, N-Diethyl-p-phenylenediamine to form [A-NH<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x02013;</sup>]<sup>+</sup>
using a free radical analyzer (FREE carpe diem, WISMERLL, Tokyo, Japan). This d-ROMs test
was invented and developed by Carratelli, M. and the validity of this method has been
demonstrated by comparisons with the results of the electron spin resonance (ESR) method,
which serves as a direct measurement of unpaired electrons [<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The BAP test was simultaneously carried out using the same blood sample.
BAP was determined by color reaction of thiocyanate which reflects reduction potency from
Fe<sup>3+</sup> to Fe<sup>2+</sup> due to electrons (e<sup>&#x02013;</sup>) in the blood using
the same free radical analyzer.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The d-ROMs, BAP and BAP/d-ROMs values were statistically evaluated using two-way
repeated-measures analysis of variance (two-way repeated-measures ANOVA). In addition, the
statistical significance of differences was tested by two-factor ANOVA with only one
observation in each cell at pre-exercise, post-exercise and 30 min after exercise for each
of the placebo and HW groups, and the Dunnet test was used to compare post-exercise and 30
min after exercise data with that at pre-exercise. Wilcoxon&#x02019;s signed-rank test was also
used to examine the data of the blood samples at 30 min before treadmill exercise, before
the placebo or HW administration, in order to examine if the basal conditions were the
same. For all the data, differences were considered significant if the P value was less
than 0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>On the days of placebo and HW administration, the mean values of d-ROMs immediately before

exercise such as supra-maximum exercise might play an important role in enhancing
inflammation of the muscle. However, concurrent action of protective factors, represented by
various antioxidative substances such as super oxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, peroxidase,
glutathione (GSH), homocysteine, ascorbic acid (vitamin C), &#x003b1;-tocopherol (vitamin E) and
some minerals, might be enhanced or recruited against the oxidative stress. Therefore, the
balance of oxidative and antioxidative functions in tissues and blood are thought to be more
important than the production of oxidative substance alone. In the present study,
significant increases in d-ROMs and BAP were induced by the intensive treadmill exercise
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_003">Figs. 3</xref> and<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_005">
5</xref>), and were accompanied by elevation of the BAP/d-ROMs ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_006">Fig. 6</xref>).</p><p>There are several reports on the association of exercise with oxidative stress in equine.
It has been suggested that biochemical parameters such as lipid hydroperoxides, which are
indicative of oxidative stress, are changed by exercise, and that the changes are
exacerbated during exercise at high temperature and humidity [<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Also, the exercise-induced increase in plasma lipid peroxide was
reduced by allopurinol-induced inhibition of xanthine oxidase, which resulted in the
formation of ROS during exercise [<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Changes in
blood contents of malondialdehyde (MDA) and GSH were evident in race horses (ten 3 year-old
stallions) subjected to physical exercise with a progressive strength of training [<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], where the plasma MDA and GSH significantly increased
after the ride and the increase in MDA was still present at 18 hr after the exercise.</p><p>The present study demonstrated that the oxidative parameter (d-ROMs) and antioxidative
parameter (BAP) in the blood were clearly and simultaneously elevated by intensive treadmill
exercise of Thoroughbred horses. The finding of increase in d-ROMs may be supportive of the
finding of increased lipid hydroperoxidase in horses after exercise [<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Moreover, in the present
study the marked increase in BAP observed at post-exercise and rapid return to the
pre-exercise level at 30 min after the exercise is worthy of note. This evidence implies
that antagonistic action to strong oxidative stress is designed to onset in rapid
time-course and BAP recovery to the pre-exercise level occurs within a short period after
the exercise. This antioxidative function may be reinforced by exercise training of
Thoroughbred horses because the antioxidative capacity has been suggested to be improved by
exercise training [<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>Some evidence of the efficacy of dietary supplementation with antioxidants has previously
been presented. The antioxidative influence of vitamin E and selenium supplementation in
3-year-old stallions has been reported [<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The
antioxidant capacity, total antioxidant activities and thiobarbiturate reactive substances
in Thoroughbred race horses were elevated after a race, and the intravenous administration
of ascorbate reduced the oxidative stress, although the creatine kinase activities were not
influenced by the administration [<xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p><p>In recent years, possible therapeutic effects of HW, which contains molecular hydrogen
(H<sub>2</sub>), have been noticed in experimental studies with animals. In rats with
periodontitis, the intake of HW for 4 weeks lowered serum levels of ROS and oxidised
low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol [<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In mice
subjected to physical restraint stress for 10 hr per day for 6 days each week, the enhanced
oxidative stress in the brain was inhibited by drinking HW [<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In addition, the inhalation of H<sub>2</sub> gas protected the brain from
ischemia and reperfusion-induced damage in the rat [<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Brain slices derived from mice administered hydrogen-rich pure water for 33
days showed significantly less superoxide formation than the control [<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In a rat model of sepsis, the intraperitoneal administration of
hydrogen-rich saline inhibited the increase of oxidative responses, such as ROS and
malondialdehyde, in the hippocampus in a dose-dependent manner [<xref rid="r43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Also, drinking HW significantly suppressed intimal hyperplasia of
the inferior <italic>vena cava</italic> in the rat [<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. All these findings suggest that HW has an antioxidative property. It is of
interest to understand the biochemical mechanism of the antioxidative action of HW. The
antioxidative action of molecular hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) has been described in detail
[<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. H<sub>2</sub> dissolved in culture medium of
PC12 cells significantly decreased the level of hydroxyl radicals (&#x000b7;OH) without decreasing
the level of in super oxide anion radicals (O<sup>&#x02013;</sup><sub>2</sub>&#x000b7;) or hydrogen peroxide
(H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) derived from mitochondria. Accordingly, it is plausible that
HW inhibits the formation of hydroxyl radicals.</p><p>The absorption of HW from the digestive organs and its time-course change in the body was
described in a rat study [<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Hydrogen in the blood
was detected at 3 min after the direct instillation of saturated HW into the stomach, and
the half-life of hydrogen in the muscle was estimated to be approximately 20 min after the
instillation. Therefore, it is assumed that the molecular hydrogen is rapidly absorbed by
the digestive organs and most of it can be metabolized within one hour in the living body.
In the present study, the d-ROMs value showed a tendency to decrease already at pre-exercise
after the intake of HW, compared to the placebo intake. In addition, there were significant
increases in the BAP/d-ROMs ration in the HW trial, compared with the placebo trial, at
pre-exercise, post-exercises and 30 min after exercise (two-way repeated-measures ANOVA),
while no significant difference was found in the same horses at 30 min before the treadmill
exercise. This finding may indicate that the HW administered into the digestive tract of the
horse is rapidly distributed throughout the body after administration and acts to reduce a
part of free radicals in the blood. In addition, the earlier recovery of the BAP/d-ROMs
ratio in the HW trial, compared to the placebo trial, may reflect lesser amounts of free
radicals (d-ROMs) during and immediately after the exercise, as compared to the placebo
trial.</p><p>In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that oxidative and antioxidative changes in
the blood are significantly induced by treadmill exercise of Thoroughbred horses, and that
the recent developed measurements, i.e. d-ROMs and BAP tests, are useful and convenient
methods for determining exercise-related physiological changes in horses. Furthermore, we
suggested a possibility that the supplementation of hydrogen-rich water has efficacy in
lowering oxidative stress in horses.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Aiko</surname><given-names>S.</given-names></name><name><surname>Kumano</surname><given-names>I.</given-names></name><name><surname>Yamanaka</surname><given-names>N.</given-names></name><name><surname>Tsujimoto</surname><given-names>H.</given-names></name><name><surname>Takahata</surname><given-names>R.</given-names></name><name><surname>Maehara</surname><given-names>T.</given-names></name></person-group><year>2012</year>
