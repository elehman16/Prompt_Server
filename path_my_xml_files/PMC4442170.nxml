It has one of the lowest survival outcomes of any cancer because over two-thirds of patients are diagnosed when curative treatment is not possible. International research has focused on screening and community interventions to promote earlier presentation to a healthcare provider to improve early lung cancer detection. This paper describes the protocol for a phase II, multisite, randomised controlled trial, for patients at increased risk of lung cancer in the primary care setting, to facilitate early presentation with symptoms of lung cancer.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/analysis</title><p>The intervention is based on a previous Scottish CHEST Trial that comprised of a primary-care nurse consultation to discuss and implement a self-help manual, followed by self-monitoring reminders to improve symptom appraisal and encourage help-seeking in patients at increased risk of lung cancer. We aim to recruit 550 patients from two Australian states: Western Australia and Victoria. Patients will be randomised to the Intervention (a health consultation involving a self-help manual, monthly prompts and spirometry) or Control (spirometry followed by usual care). Eligible participants are long-term smokers with at least 20 pack years, aged 55 and over, including ex-smokers if their cessation date was less than 15&#x02005;years ago. The primary outcome is consultation rate for respiratory symptoms.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>Ethical approval has been obtained from The University of Western Australia's Human Research Ethics Committee (RA/4/1/6018) and The University of Melbourne Human Research Committee (1&#x02005;441&#x02005;433). A summary of the results will be disseminated to participants and we plan to publish the main trial outcomes in a single paper. Further publications are anticipated after further data analysis. Findings will be presented at national and international conferences from late 2016.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p>Australian New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry ACTRN 1261300039 3752.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>PRIMARY CARE</kwd><kwd>PUBLIC HEALTH</kwd><kwd>ONCOLOGY</kwd><kwd>PREVENTIVE MEDICINE</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Strengths and limitations of this study</title></caption><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The CHEST-Australia Trial represents the first trial in Australia to test this type of intervention and measure its impact on health care consultations.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The trial builds on preliminary evidence from the Scottish CHEST Trial, which showed promising results for altering symptom appraisal and help-seeking behaviour.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Information from this trial will enable planning of a larger phase III international trial to further assess the impact of the CHEST Intervention on clinical outcomes.</p></list-item></list></boxed-text><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Lung cancer is the commonest cancer worldwide;<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> in Australia, there were 11&#x02005;280 new cases and 8099 deaths due to lung cancer in 2010, making it the leading cause of cancer death.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Lung cancer ranks second for men and fourth for women when considering all causes of death. This reflects its relatively high incidence (58 per 100&#x02005;000 for males and 31 per 100&#x02005;000 for females), which is still rising in women, and its low relative survival, only 7.8% of males and 9.3% of females survive beyond 5&#x02005;years.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p><p>There is extensive literature spanning several decades on the concept of &#x02018;diagnostic delay&#x02019; in cancer.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> This recognises that patient pathways to presentation to healthcare and initial management in primary care are key determinants of cancer patient outcomes.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Much of the research on cancer diagnostic delay has suffered from lack of a theoretical model and precise definitions of key time points along the diagnostic pathway. Walter <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> published a systematic review of cancer diagnostic studies that applied the Andersen Model of Total Patient Delay.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> On the basis of their review, they have modified this theoretical framework, producing The Model of Pathways to Treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2015008046F1">figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="BMJOPEN2015008046F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Model of pathways to treatment.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen2015008046f01"/></fig><p>The model proposes four key intervals:
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>The <italic>Appraisal Interval.</italic> The review found that the nature of the symptoms was the most important factor determining the duration of the Appraisal Interval. Misattribution of symptoms either to a previous benign or concurrent condition or non-recognition of the seriousness of symptoms contribute to longer Appraisal Intervals.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p></list-item><list-item><p>The <italic>Help-Seeking Interval.</italic> Various factors may contribute to this interval including patient factors such as competing events (eg, holidays), and emotional ones such as fear. This includes fear of the consultation and examination, or of the diagnosis and treatment.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Access to primary care and sanctioning help-seeking by family or friends, so that patients do not perceive themselves as wasting the doctor's time, are also important factors.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p></list-item><list-item><p>The <italic>Diagnostic Interval.</italic> Depending on the healthcare setting, this may involve a series of healthcare visits, referrals and investigations, and often represents a complex process. System factors including the role of primary care as a gatekeeper, and access to investigations and specialist care, are key factors determining this interval.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>The Pre-Treatment Interval.</italic> The time from formal cancer diagnosis to initiation of treatment is also strongly influenced by several healthcare system factors such as access to staging investigations and specialised treatments.</p></list-item></list></p><p>Several studies have explored symptom appraisal and help-seeking in people recently diagnosed with lung cancer. Two studies of lung cancer patients from Western Australia have found that normalisation of respiratory symptoms is very common with mean patient delays to seek help of 47&#x02013;80&#x02005;days, respectively.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Campbell and colleagues<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> interviewed 360 Scottish patients with lung cancer; of these, 50% had experienced symptoms for more than 14&#x02005;weeks before presenting to a doctor (median 99&#x02005;days; IQR 31&#x02013;381&#x02005;days). The duration of these patient delays should be compared with reported lung cancer median volume doubling times of 98&#x02005;days.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Factors associated with longer symptom appraisal and help-seeking included living alone, a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and longer pack years of smoking. In contrast, haemoptysis, new onset of shortness of breath and cough were associated with earlier consulting. Another English study had similar findings: most patients recalled having symptoms for many months before seeking help, but these symptoms were not recognised as serious, were attributed to everyday causes, and therefore not acted on.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>
<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> There was reluctance to seek help among some people, partly because they were unsure whether their symptoms were normal and, for some, because of the stigma associated with smoking. Furthermore, patients may not discuss all their symptoms of lung cancer when they do visit their general practitioner (GP), suggesting patients need to be empowered to recognise the significance of symptoms and report them to healthcare providers.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Patients may also need clear guidance on reasons to revisit their GP if their symptoms persist, an important safety-netting function of general practice.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p><p>Further evidence for the potential to improve lung cancer outcomes by earlier diagnosis comes from the US National Lung Cancer Screening Trial, which found a 20% relative reduction in lung cancer mortality from annual low-dose CT.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> However, the uncertain cost-effectiveness and feasibility of implementing national lung cancer screening programmes means that other approaches to timely diagnosis of lung cancer are still needed. The search for useful biomarkers of lung cancer shows promise, but is still at the validation stage,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> suggesting an alternative strategy is to attempt to diagnose lung cancer earlier through prompt recognition and investigation of symptoms suggestive of the disease, particularly in those at higher risk.</p><p>Public awareness campaigns for educating patients on symptom awareness have shown promise, but many have limited reporting outcomes. Lung cancer &#x02018;signs and symptoms&#x02019; intervention studies such as &#x02018;Show us your lungs&#x02019; (Australia),<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> &#x02018;Be clear on Cancer (UK),<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> &#x02018;I'll tackle it soon&#x02019; (UK),<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> aimed to raise awareness of the signs and symptoms of lung cancer, and promote help seeking behaviour. The &#x02018;I'll tackle it soon&#x02019; study showed that a combined public awareness campaign and GP education programme led to increased chest X-ray referrals by 20% and lung cancer diagnoses by 27%.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></p><p>While patient level interventions show promise in increasing cancer awareness,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> there has been limited research on interventions delivered to individuals at increased risk of lung cancer aimed at promoting earlier presentation to healthcare. The Chest Trial in Scotland was the first to show preliminary evidence that this approach could alter consulting patterns in this population.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>
<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> In this trial, a theoretically-based intervention, which comprised of a primary-care nurse consultation to discuss and implement a self-help manual, was tested, followed by self-monitoring reminders. The key objectives of the intervention were as follows, with the relevant underlying theories in parentheses: (1) Increase the salience and personal relevance of symptoms (Illness Action Model<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). (2) Improve knowledge of symptoms by introducing chest disease prototypes (Illness Action Model and Illness prototypes<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>
<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). (3) Reinforce the benefits of early intervention in lung cancer and other chest disease (Theory of Planned Behaviour<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>
<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). (4) Sanction early consultation (Zola's triggers<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). (5) Tackle barriers to consultation (Theory of Planned Behaviour<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>
<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). (6) Develop personalised action and coping plans (Social Cognitive Theory and Implementation Intentions).<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>
<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Intervention components 1 and 2 aim to reduce the Symptom Appraisal Interval, while components 3&#x02013;6 aim to reduce the Help-Seeking Interval. Based on consumer feedback the intervention was designed specifically without any mention of smoking cessation, which was seen as a barrier to engagement. Furthermore, the focus was on chest disease broadly, including the early detection of lung cancer, COPD and other chronic respiratory conditions. This was to reduce potential effects of fear and nihilism surrounding lung cancer.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>

The total consultation rate was significantly higher in the intervention group (adjusted consultation ratio 1.15, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.27 p=0.005) with a median number of consultations in the year after intervention of 8 (IQR 4&#x02013;11). The adjusted consultation ratio for new chest symptoms also increased but this did not reach statistical significance (ratio 1.19, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.53). Participants in the intervention group intended to consult sooner with symptoms. There were non-significant increases in chest X-ray requests and referrals to respiratory medicine in the intervention group.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></p><p>The Scottish CHEST Trial therefore provides important preliminary evidence for the potential efficacy of the intervention in altering symptom appraisal and help-seeking behaviour. However, stronger evidence is required before this research can inform practice and policy. In particular, evidence is required on the generalisability of the intervention in other populations and the effect on clinical outcomes as well as consulting behaviours.</p><p>Preliminary phase I research in Australia with consumer focus groups was conducted to review the CHEST self-help manual and provide feedback on the overall intervention. In addition, the intervention was piloted on 11 participants recruited from a general practice in Perth, Western Australia. This work resulted in modifications to the language used in the consultation and self-help manual, and led to the development of the CHEST Australia Trial: a phase II, multisite, randomised controlled trial that aims to test the modified CHEST Intervention in an Australian population and measure the effect of the intervention on consultation rates for chest symptoms.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>The phase II trial is a multisite randomised controlled trial.

Health service utilisation data will be collected at 12&#x02005;months by general practice medical record audit and accessing Medicare and PBS data. This data will not be collected for participants who formally withdraw from the trial.</p></sec><sec id="s2i"><title>Participant data and study management</title><p>All participants are allocated a unique identifying code. Questionnaire data are entered into a custom built Oracle database (on a secure server held at the University of Western Australia) to allow scoring of the measures in the questionnaire and enable patient tracking through the study.</p></sec><sec id="s2j"><title>Sample size and power calculation</title><p>Data from the Scottish trial was used to inform power calculations.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Assuming that the primary end point of consultations for respiratory symptoms follows a Poisson distribution, and that the expected average rate over 12&#x02005;months in the study population will be 1.06 for control patients and 25% higher for intervention patients, a sample of 534 will provide at least 80% power to reject the null hypothesis of no difference between the groups at the two-sided 5% level of significance. The primary end point will be measured from the medical record audit, thus minimising attrition. Accounting for the same attrition rate observed in the Scottish trial, we require a total sample of 550 participants.</p></sec><sec id="s2k"><title>Analyses</title><p>All randomised patients will be considered eligible for inclusion in the analysis in accordance with the intention to treat analysis principle. Appropriate methods for dealing with missing end point data will be addressed and informed by a blinded review of the data. The baseline characteristics of the two arms will be described using summary statistics. Possible consent bias will be assessed by comparing demographic and clinical variables of participants against those who declined participation, and possible differential attrition will be assessed by comparing baseline characteristics of those who withdraw or die against those who remain in the study. These comparisons will be performed using a two sample t test (or non-parametric equivalent) for continuous variables and &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test for categorical variables. The primary analysis will be a comparison between the two groups on consultations rate for respiratory symptoms using a Poisson regression model, with general practice included as a factor. Comparisons between groups on continuous secondary end points will be undertaken using a linear model that includes general practice as a factor and the baseline value as a covariate (where applicable). Comparisons between groups on categorical secondary end points will be performed using logistic regression with general practice fitted as a factor. The analyses performed on the primary and secondary end points will be repeated adjusting for additional baseline covariates (eg, number of consultations in 12&#x02005;months prior to randomisation, gender, comorbidities, smoking status, MRC Dyspnoea Score) as part of a sensitivity analysis. Point estimates of the treatment effect will be presented with two-sided 95% CIs and two-sided p values. Unadjusted p values from secondary analyses are interpreted in proper context and will be clearly labelled.</p><p>The health economic analysis estimates the cost of CHEST minus any cost-savings due to avoided healthcare utilisation through early diagnosis. Benefits will be extrapolated from the primary end points and via the AQOL-8D quality of life questionnaire. Results will be presented in terms of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. Many of these model parameters will not be powered for statistical significance. Therefore, mean estimates of resource utilisation will be used and CIs are generated by boot-strapping the data. Uncertainty will be explored using probabilistic sensitivity analysis.</p><p>The CHEST-Australia Trial represents the first trial in Australia to test this type of intervention and measure its impact on healthcare consultations. Information from this trial will enable planning of a larger phase III international trial to further assess the impact of the CHEST Intervention on clinical outcomes.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>This trial is supported by the Cancer Australia Primary Care Collaborative Cancer Clinical Trials Group (PC4).
