The study aimed to investigate whether tocotrienols improves glycemic control, insulin sensitivity, and oxidative stress in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>This study was a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized trial. A total of 50 patients, aged 35-60 years, with T2DM treated by noninsulin hypoglycemic drugs were randomly assigned to receive either 15 mL/day tocotrienols (200 mg) enriched canola oil (<italic>n</italic> = 25) or pure canola oil (<italic>n</italic> = 25) for 8 weeks. Fasting blood sugar (FBS), fasting insulin, total antioxidant capacity (TAC), malondialdehyde (MDA), and homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) were determined before and after the intervention. The data were compared between and within groups, before and after the intervention.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>Baseline characteristics of participants including age, sex, physical activity, disease duration, and type of drug consumption were not significantly different between the two groups. In tocotrienol enriched canola oil, FBS (mean percent change: &#x02013;15.4% vs. 3.9%; <italic>P</italic> = 0.006) and MDA (median percent change: &#x02013;35.6% vs. 16.3%; <italic>P</italic> = 0.003) were significantly reduced while TAC was significantly increased (median percent change: 21.4% vs. 2.3%; <italic>P</italic> = 0.001) compared to pure canola oil. At the end of the study, patients who treated with tocotrienols had lower FBS (<italic>P</italic> = 0.023) and MDA (<italic>P</italic> = 0.044) compared to the pure canola oil group.

No participants had taken any vitamin or mineral supplements for at least 1-month prior to the study. The objectives and protocol of the study were explained to the participants, who expressed their written informed consent to participate. Five patients, two in tocotrienols enriched canola oil group (one person due to immigration and the other due to changing in treatment protocol) and three in pure canola group (first one due to inability to walk to center, second due to unavailable enough blood serum and the third due to unwilling to end the study), withdrew the study [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>].

In the lab, 29,400 mg Vitrenol added to 810 g canola oil. Thus, a tablespoon of canola oil (15 mL) contained approximately 525 mg Vitrenol, 200 mg total tocotrienols, 69.3 mg &#x003b1;-tocotrienols and 87.15 mg &#x003b3;-tocotrienols. Adding tocotrienols to canola oil did not change its appearance, taste or smell.

Participants ingested 15 mL/day of the oil after lunch or dinner, as preferred, by adding a tablespoon of the oil to their cooked foods or salad. Since Vitamin E isomers are sensitive to heat and oxidation, they were requested to avoid using the oil in the cooking process. They were also asked to maintain their usual diet and physical activity throughout the study.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Biochemical evaluations and other measurements</title><p>Blood samples were collected before and after the intervention after 10-12 h overnight fast and before taking the hypoglycemic drugs.

Continuous associations between fasting glucose concentrations &#x0003e;100 mg/dL and risk of death suggest that hyperglycemia may be directly relevant to premature death in diabetes. These findings also reinforce the need to control and maintain FBS near to normal concentrations in DM.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>In our study, 525 mg/day tocotrienols rich Vitamin E, equivalent to 200 mg/day tocotrienols, for 8 weeks reduced FBS by 15.4% in individuals with T2DM; this reduction was also significant compared with the pure canola oil group at end of the study (<italic>P</italic> = 0.006). TRF supplementation in streptozotocin-induced diabetic (STZ-diabetic) rats caused an improvement in glycemic status by decreasing FBS concentrations and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C).[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] In an earlier intervention study in human, 6 mg/kg TRF treatment, in two divided doses, for 60 days did not affect either fasting plasma glucose or HbA1C in patients with T2DM.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Differences in glucose concentrations at baseline in those participants compared with ours may cause the inconsistent findings. The glucose concentrations in those participants were close to normal (mean &#x000b1; SD: 113.5 &#x000b1; 11.8 mg/dL) and they were glycemically stable, but our participants had a higher mean glucose concentration of 153.8 &#x000b1; 55.5 mg/dL. Therefore, it seems that the blood glucose concentration might be a determinant of response to the tocotrienols supplementation and the hypoglycemic effect of tocotrienols are more likely to be observed in individuals with high FBS concentrations or poor glycemic control. The mechanisms of hypoglycemic activity of tocotrienols have not yet fully understood. It has been suggested that tocotrienols (and not tocopherols) can improve insulin sensitivity through activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). Binding of tocotrieols to PPAR promotes insulin mediated glucose uptake through increasing the expression of glucose transporter 4.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] In addition, previous studies indicate improved liver structure and function following Vitamin E[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] or TRF treatment.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] Therefore, the reduction in FBS observed in our study can also be attributed to improved hepatocellular function and reduced release of glucose from the liver.</p><p>Concentrations of antioxidants are lower in diabetes because of excessive production of reactive oxidative specious and increased oxidative stress. A weakened antioxidant defense system, in turn, can intensify oxidative stress.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] The present study demonstrated that TRF improved oxidative status in diabetes patients; since it significantly increased TAC and decreased lipid peroxidation. Although at baseline the tocotrienols enriched canola oil group appeared to be exposed to higher oxidative stress, as documented by lower TAC and higher MDA, redox status was improved at the end of the study to a larger extent than in the pure canola oil.</p><p>In animal studies, tocotrienols administration could increase TAC in hypertensive rats.[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] Furthermore, TRF enhanced the concentrations of Vitamin C and superoxide dismutase activity and prevented an increase in MDA and DNA damage in STZ-induced diabetic rats.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] In a dose-response study in healthy individuals, the administration of 320 mg TRF was associated with a small significant increase (9.2%) in plasma TAC compared to baseline, in which was not significant compared with untreated group.[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] TRF supplementation in middle-aged and older adults at dose of 160 mg/day for 6 months attenuated serum advanced glycosylation end products and protein carbonyl content, the markers of protein oxidative damage, only in the individuals &#x0003e;50 years. MDA concentrations were also reduced in the &#x0003e;50 years old group after 3 months and remained low thereafter, but the change did not achieve statistical significance.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] This age-dependent response to TRF supplementation might reflect that TRF supplementation in a population with the well-maintained antioxidant defense could not confer further improvement.</p><p>Tocotrienols may reduce the oxidative damage directly by exerting their antioxidant activity and as a consequence of improved counteracting the oxidative damage. In addition, the production of free radicals due to hyperglycemia might also be reduced by tocotrienols administration through a better control of glycemia. Reduced oxidative stress can improve insulin sensitivity, which in turn might decrease plasma triglyceride and free fatty acid through down-regulation of lipolysis. This down-regulation of lipolysis induced by the effect of insulin on adipose tissue might also lead to a decline in lipid peroxidation.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]</p><p>Tocotrienols are thought to have greater antioxidant properties than &#x003b1;-tocopherol.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Indeed, tocotrienols have a unique conformation because of their three double bonds hydrocarbon tail which allows for better distributions in the fatty layers of the cell membrane.[<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref><xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] Only pharmacological doses of &#x003b1;-tocopherol were associated with improving insulin action, inflammatory or oxidative markers.[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref><xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] The tocotrienols rich Vitamin E mixture in the present study contains 38.4% tocotrienols and 12.6% tocopherol. Therefore, the improved redox status in our study does not seem to be attributed to tocopherols. However, tocopherols might affect the responses to tocotrienols; as an example, it has been demonstrated that TRF preparations containing 20% or more &#x003b1;-tocopherol attenuate the hypocholesterolemic effect of &#x003b3;-tocotrienols.[<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]</p><p>In this study, we added tocotrienols to canola oil in order to improve its absorption and patient compliance. Because of the low content of tocotrienols in edible natural sources, it does not seem that the dietary sources can provide sufficient amounts of tocotrienols.[<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] Thus, promoting intakes of tocotrienols through supplements appears prudent especially in patients with diabetes. Fortification of oil with this vitamin is an appropriate way to increase its intake.</p><p>Some limitations of our study should be mentioned. First, we did not measure blood levels of active components of the supplementation to confirm the compliance with treatment. Previous studies indicate that blood concentrations of tocotrienols cannot be detectable in the fasted state, even after supplementation with tocotrienols.[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref><xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] Since the blood samples were collected after 10-12 h of fasting in the present study, plasma tocotrienols concentrations were not an appropriate marker to confirm treatment compliance in our study. However, plasma tocopherol concentrations could be used instead of tocotrienols. Second, since we did not measured lipid profile in our study, we could not show the possible effect of tocotrienol on lipid metabolism in our study. Finally, not measuring any inflammatory markers and hepatic enzyme concentrations are the other limitations of our study. Therefore, we could not determine the possible mechanism of the effectiveness of tocotrienols in our study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Administration of 525 mg tocotrienols rich Vitamin E or 200 mg total tocotrienols added to canola oil for 8 weeks were well-tolerated and improved blood glucose, antioxidant capacity, and oxidative stress in T2DM patients with poor control of glucose. The optimal doses and duration of TRF administration to show the most favorable effects on T2DM patients remain to be determined. Furthermore, studies with individual tocotrienols are needed since the pure components may lead to different responses as compared to the mixture. Investigations of the effects of tocotrienols on hepatocell function, hepatic enzyme concentrations, and inflammatory markers are also required to elucidate the mechanisms of tocotrienols actions.</p><sec id="sec2-7"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>This study was supported by grants from Vice Chancellor of Research, Iran University of Medical Sciences, M/994 (Tehran, Iran).</p></sec><sec id="sec2-8"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec1-6"><title>AUTHOR'S CONTRIBUTION</title><p>All authors were involved in the concept and design of the study.
