The lack of imprinted genes occurs by three mechanisms, namely deletion of the 15q11.2-q13 region (found in 65&#x02013;75% of individuals), maternal uniparental disomy (found in 20&#x02013;30% of individuals), and an imprinting defect when the genomic region that manages the imprinting process is defective (1&#x02013;3% of individuals) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The estimated prevalence of PWS is 1/10,000 to 1/30,000 people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. At an early age, infants have severe hypotonia and feeding difficulties followed by weight gain and subsequent hyperphagia during childhood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Due to altered body composition and depressed basal metabolic rate in adults with PWS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], lifelong energy restriction is required to circumvent the development of morbid obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par12">Constipation is a common problem for individuals with PWS. A study of adults with PWS showed that 40% of these individuals have constipation symptoms, including having less than three defecations per week, sensation of anorectal obstruction, straining during defecation, and having hard stools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Although adequate dietary fiber may be achievable in children with PWS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], this may be a challenge in adults with PWS, particularly given their low energy needs and, thus, limited food choices. Certain probiotics, &#x0201c;<italic>live microorganisms that when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit to the host</italic>&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], have been shown to improve constipation symptoms in otherwise healthy adults. Probiotics have been shown to significantly decrease transit time, increase stool frequency, and improve stool consistency, particularly <italic>Bifidobacterium lactis</italic> strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. This study will build on previous literature reporting on the efficacy of probiotics in adults with constipation and will examine the effect of <italic>Bifidobacterium animalis</italic> ssp. <italic>lactis</italic> B94 (<italic>B. lactis</italic> B94) in adults with PWS. The aim of the study is to determine the effect of <italic>B. lactis</italic> B94 on stool frequency, stool form (a proxy for transit time), gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, and fecal microbiota in adults with PWS. It is hypothesized that <italic>B. lactis</italic> B94 will increase stool frequency, decrease the percentage of slow transit stools, and improve GI symptoms. The primary outcome of the study is weekly stool frequency (difference between treatments), whereas secondary outcomes are weekly stool frequency (percentage change from baseline), stool form (percentage change in slow transit Bristol Stool Form Scale (BSFS) 1 and 2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] from baseline and between treatments), GI symptoms, and compliance (recorded intake of the provided and remaining supplements).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design</title><p id="Par13">A 20-week randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled crossover study will be carried out (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

Potential subjects will be identified and contacted by their physician. The study coordinator will then meet with interested individuals, provide them with a full description of the study, and enroll those eligible. Potential subjects will be included if they have a genetically confirmed diagnosis of PWS and are 18&#x02013;75&#x000a0;years of age, willing to have height and weight measured and to provide demographic information (e.g., age, race, sex), willing to consume <italic>B. lactis</italic> B94 and placebo each for a 4-week period, willing to complete a daily record of stool number and form throughout the 20-week period, willing to complete the GSRS monthly, and willing to provide information about their dietary intake every 4&#x000a0;weeks.

The IP will be <italic>B. lactis</italic> B94 at a dose of 15 billion colony forming units (CFU) in Veggie capsule #1 made with potato starch and magnesium stearate, and the placebo will contain potato starch and magnesium stearate (Lallemand Health Solutions Inc., Mirabel, Canada). Prior to delivery to the study site, the IP and placebo will be coded by an unblinded employee of the manufacturer. The IP and placebo will be coded with five codes each, so in the event of an adverse event that requires unblinding of the effected subject, information about most remaining subjects will remain blinded.

In a circumstance that a professional intervention is necessary due to an adverse event, the PI will contact the study&#x02019;s affiliated physician and appropriate authority or organization pertinent to the circumstance of the event. If deemed necessary, the manufacturer of the capsules will be contacted to unblind the subject (one of 10 codes). As there are no known risks for consuming the probiotic, <italic>B. lactis</italic> B94, no negative side effects or adverse events are expected and, thus, no data monitoring committee is needed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Outcomes</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Stool form</title><p id="Par21">Stool form will be assessed using the BSFS, a simple tool for estimating intestinal transit time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The BSFS classifies stools into seven categories, including type 1, separate hard lumps, like nuts; type 2, sausage-shaped, but lumpy; type 3, like a sausage but with cracks on the surface; type 4, like a sausage or snake, smooth and soft; type 5, soft blobs with clear-cut edges; type 6, fluffy pieces with ragged edges, a mushy stool; type 7, watery, no solid pieces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. These types are categorized into slow transit (types 1 and 2), normal transit (types 3&#x02013;5), and fast transit (types 6 and 7).</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>GI symptoms</title><p id="Par22">GI symptoms will be assessed using the GSRS, a 7-point scale that evaluates symptoms of GI disorders, where 1 represents no discomfort at all and 7 represents very severe discomfort over the past week [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], who reported that, for constipated subjects, the mean frequency of bowel movements per week was 3.8 at baseline, 4.4 in the second week for those on placebo, and 5.1 in the second week for those on treatment. Data were simulated for each of the two experimental designs for 10,000 subjects assuming correlated Poisson random variables with mean weekly bowel movements as given above. Either the weekly totals as simulated or the averages of the weekly totals for each period (baseline, intervention) were used in subsequent analyses. For the simulations, all washouts were assumed to have the same mean as the placebo (4.4 bowel movements/week) and no temporal trend within each intervention or washout period was assumed. A correlation of 0.35 for the repeated observations on a subject was assumed. This value was obtained from previous studies involving measurement of weekly total bowel movements such as that of Baird et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. All power analyses were based on using a type I error rate of 0.05 and no correction for possible multiple comparisons. A cross-over study with five time periods, i.e., 4&#x000a0;weeks of baseline, 4&#x000a0;weeks on one treatment, 4&#x000a0;weeks of washout, 4&#x000a0;weeks on the alternative treatment, and 4&#x000a0;weeks post-treatment, was considered. Within each time period, the weekly totals to obtain an average total within each period for each subject were averaged. Hence, the value for any time period for a subject is the mean of the 4 weekly totals. Hypothesis testing included the F-tests in the ANOVA table for &#x02018;Period&#x02019; and a <italic>t</italic> test of the difference between the product and placebo. The recommended sample size for this model is 26 to determine a difference between treatments. If the weekly means and then the treatment differences by averaging the least squares means are tested after analysis, the same sample size is required, confirming the appropriate sample size of 26. A washout of 4&#x000a0;weeks is expected to be sufficient to minimize any carryover effects. However, with a possibly high dropout rate of approximately 25% (due to the length of the study), a sample size of 36 is targeted. The targeted sample size is feasible as recruitment will be from a population that includes individuals participating in residential programming and those residing in the community at large.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="Par30">For the primary outcome of stool frequency, data will be analyzed using a general linear mixed model with intervention, week, period, sequence, and the interactions of period, sequence and intervention with week (weekly data), as the main fixed effects.
