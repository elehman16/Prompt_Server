However, the active compound(s) responsible for the protective effects of tea are unknown. Although many favorable cardiovascular effects <italic>in vitro</italic> are mediated by epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), its contribution to the beneficial effects of tea <italic>in vivo</italic> remains unresolved. In a randomised crossover study, a single dose of 200&#x02009;mg EGCG was applied in three different formulas (as green tea beverage, green tea extract (GTE), and isolated EGCG) to 50 healthy men. Flow-mediated dilation (FMD) and endothelial-independent nitro-mediated dilation (NMD) was measured before and two hours after ingestion. Plasma levels of tea compounds were determined after each intervention and correlated with FMD. FMD significantly improved after consumption of green tea containing 200&#x02009;mg EGCG (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01). However, GTE and EGCG had no significant effect on FMD. NMD did not significantly differ between interventions. EGCG plasma levels were highest after administration of EGCG and lowest after consumption of green tea. Plasma levels of caffeine increased after green tea consumption. The results show that EGCG is most likely not involved in improvement of flow-mediated dilation by green tea. Instead, other tea compounds, metabolites or combinations thereof may play a role.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Consumption of tea is associated with reduced progression of atherosclerosis and lower cardiovascular mortality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. However, the substance(s) mediating the favorable cardiovascular effects of tea <italic>in vivo</italic> have not yet been identified. Tea contains high amounts of polyphenols with significant biological activities. The green tea catechin epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) is the physiologically most active compound <italic>in vitro</italic>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. A large number of <italic>in vitro</italic> studies and animal experiments provide evidence of the beneficial effects of EGCG on cardiovascular parameters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Stimulation of nitric oxide (NO) production by endothelial cells and subsequent NO-dependent vasodilation in isolated vessels are two of the most prominent cardiovascular actions of EGCG <italic>in vitro</italic>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Owing to promising results at the cellular level, EGCG has become extensively applied in human intervention studies. More than 80 studies with EGCG, which encompass a wide range of clinical applications, were registered on clinicaltrials.gov as of October 2016. It is largely unknown, however, whether the beneficial cardiovascular effects of EGCG <italic>in vitro</italic> can be reproduced in humans.</p><p>To elucidate this matter, we investigated the contribution of EGCG to tea-induced changes in flow-mediated dilation (FMD). Impaired endothelial function represents an early marker for later cardiovascular events<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. It had been previously shown that consumption of green tea<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> as well as of black tea<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> improved FMD in humans. A recent meta-analysis demonstrated that short- and long-term tea consumption increases endothelial-dependent vasodilation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. The role of single tea compounds, and especially of EGCG, to the described cardiovascular effects, however, remains unclear. We studied the impact of a single dose of EGCG in three different application forms (green tea beverage, GTE, and isolated EGCG) on FMD in healthy volunteers. The amount of ingested EGCG (200&#x02009;mg) corresponds to approx. 0.5&#x02009;l of green tea. The results provide insights into the potential role of EGCG and other tea compounds in the beneficial cardiovascular effects of green tea <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Interventions had no influence on plasma levels of cardiovascular risk markers</title><p>A total of 207 men responded, and interviews were conducted with these volunteers to assess for eligibility. 56 subjects fulfilled the inclusion criteria, including the time requirements, and were enrolled in the study.

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study shows for the first time that EGCG is most likely not involved in tea-induced improvement of endothelial function in humans. Although EGCG plasma levels were highest after intake of EGCG and lowest after consumption of green tea, only green tea improved FMD. It has been consistently demonstrated that green tea improves endothelial function in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. The results of our study confirmed these findings. Although not statistically significant, a minor effect on FMD was also observed for GTE in our study.</p><p>Green tea and EGCG stimulated NO production in endothelial cells by activating endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and induced vasodilation in aortic rings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. However, the contribution of EGCG to the effects of green tea <italic>in vivo</italic> remains elusive. In our study, we observed no effect of 200&#x02009;mg isolated EGCG on endothelial function in humans. Widlansky <italic>et al</italic>. found an acute (but not long-term) improvement in FMD with 300&#x02009;mg EGCG in patients with coronary artery disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. However, apart from different EGCG doses used, in contrast to our study Widlansky <italic>et al</italic>. observed no differences in the absolute FMD between EGCG and placebo after supplementation. A numerical lower baseline FMD before EGCG as compared to before placebo could have contributed to their results. <italic>In vitro</italic>, significant effects of EGCG on NO production and vasodilation were obtained only at concentrations of 1&#x02009;&#x000b5;M or higher<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, concentrations that were not achieved in plasma in our study and in Widlansky <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Surprisingly, mean plasma levels of EGCG in our study were inversely associated with changes in FMD between interventions (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). All of the above results make a substantial contribution of EGCG to the vasodilating effects of green tea <italic>in vivo</italic> very unlikely.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Inverse relationship between FMD and EGCG plasma levels after the interventions. FMD gradually increased with the number of compounds present (i.e., with the complexity) of the intervention (upper panel), but EGCG plasma levels are inversely proportional.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41598_2017_2384_Fig6_HTML" id="d29e1328"/></fig>
</p><p>Stimulation of endothelial NO production and vasodilation in isolated vessels have also been described for EC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. In a small study by Schroeter <italic>et al</italic>., the administration of 1&#x02013;2&#x02009;mg/kg body weight of EC resulted in improved FMD in three subjects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. However, EC supplementation for 4 weeks (100&#x02009;mg/d) had no significant effects on FMD in 35 subjects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Consumption of 442&#x02009;ml green tea in our study resulted in the intake of 23&#x02009;mg EC, which is much less than the amount of EC ingested in the study by Schroeter <italic>et al</italic>. EC plasma levels in our study were very low and did not parallel changes in FMD between interventions. In line with previous reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, EC was fully conjugated and not present in the free form in plasma. Therefore, the involvement of EC in the effects of green tea on FMD is rather unlikely. Mean plasma levels of the other catechins ECG and EGC were also very low and showed no correlations with FMD, indicating that both catechins are in all likelihood not involved in the improvement of FMD by green tea. Also, the sum of all catechins showed no correlation with FMD.</p><p>What other compounds could potentially contribute to the effects of green tea? Caffeine is present in high amounts in green and black tea. Consequently, plasma levels of caffeine substantially increased after consumption of green tea in our study. However, the published data on the role of caffeine on flow-mediated dilation are conflicting. A cup of decaffeinated coffee had no effect on FMD in healthy adults, whereas caffeinated coffee (with 80&#x02009;mg of caffeine) even declined FMD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. In a similar study, decaffeinated coffee resulted in a slight increase in FMD, whereas caffeinated coffee significantly decreased FMD in healthy subjects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Consumption of green tea significantly improved FMD, however, the corresponding amount of caffeine contained in this tea (125&#x02009;mg) did only slightly increase FMD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Likewise, a significant improvement of FMD was observed two hours after consumption of black tea, but an equivalent dose of 200&#x02009;mg caffeine had no effect<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. But there is also evidence that caffeine exerts beneficial effects on endothelial function. A single dose of caffeine acutely improved FMD in patients with stable CAD, and increased forearm blood flow<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Chronic coffee consumption was associated with higher FMD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, and moderate coffee consumption resulted in a decreased risk of cardiovascular diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. An improved FMD was also observed after administration of a green tea extract containing caffeine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. In addition, an inverse association with risk of CVD and stroke was shown for higher coffee and green tea consumption<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Tea (mainly black) as well as moderate coffee consumption have been shown to decrease the risk for coronary heart disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Taken together, these studies point to a cardiovascular risk reduction for both tea and coffee.</p><p>In black tea, the amount of EGCG (and of other catechins) is much lower compared to green tea, depending on the degree of fermentation. Theaflavins and thearubigins, the major polyphenolic compounds in black tea, are too large for substantial absorption into the circulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Green and black tea are, however, equally effective in the improvement of FMD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, and both teas contain a similar amount of caffeine. However, other compounds including plasma metabolites of tea polyphenols, such as methylated compounds/phase I-breakdown or gut microbial metabolites (in addition to glucuronidated and sulphated substances), could also be involved. Although EGCG can be methylated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, very low<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>, or no methylated (or otherwise metabolised) EGCG<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> was found in human plasma after consumption of a green tea extract or green tea. An inverse association between the degree of urinary flavonoid O-methylation (4OMGA) and FMD after consumption of black tea indicates that methylation of tea flavonoids could rather affect endothelial function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. However, the influence of other (as yet unknown) phase I-breakdown or gut microbial metabolites on tea-induced FMD cannot be fully excluded.</p><p>Some study limitations should be acknowledged. The observed correlation between caffeine plasma levels and FMD is only weak and does not prove a role of caffeine in tea-induced endothelial function. A study with caffeine and hot water, EGCG and green tea or with caffeinated and decaffeinated green tea would be required to verify the role of caffeine in tea-induced FMD. Although EGCG did not mediate the effects of green tea on FMD in our study with healthy subjects, a contribution of EGCG to tea-mediated improvements of endothelial dysfunction cannot be fully excluded. Even though the amount of EGCG used in our study (200&#x02009;mg) corresponds to a nutritionally relevant dose that can be consumed by drinking tea, it does not necessarily reflect habitual tea drinking of several cups per day. Also, it should be noted that the contributions of single tea compounds to tea-induced FMD cannot be generalised for other cardiovascular, neurological, or anti-tumor effects of green tea.</p><p>In summary, our data indicate that EGCG is not involved in changes of FMD by green tea. The lack of an impact of EGCG on tea-induced improvements in endothelial function clearly points out that caution is indicated when translating promising <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments using a single isolated compound from a food matrix into the human situation. In light of many ongoing human studies with EGCG it will be of considerable interest to study the contribution of this promising <italic>in vitro</italic> candidate to other putative beneficial health effects of green tea.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Study population</title><p>Healthy men between 20 and 50 years were recruited by press advertisements.
