Adhesive capsulitis occurs in approximately 2-5% of the general population which is 2-4 times more common in women than men, and is most frequently seen in individuals between 40 and 60 years of age the disease is more common in patients with diabetes mellitus, rotator cuff lesions, thyroid disorders, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Diseases, cerebrovascular accident, myocardial infarction, inflammatory arthritis, trauma, and prolonged immobilization. Frozen shoulder has many complications such as sleep disturbance, impaired performance in daily activities, and personal grooming. The disease has three phases: In the first phase (pain phase), synovitis, thickening of the joint capsule, synovial fluid loss, and decreased ROM are observed. The duration of this phase is approximately 10-36 weeks. In the second phase (frozen phase), pain is decreased and joint capsule fibrosis, thickening of the rotator cuff tendons, and loss of joint space are seen. The duration of this phase is approximately 4-12 months. In the third phase (resolution phase), joint ROM again increases gradually and the patient gradually returns to normal daily activities. The duration of this phase is approximately 12-42 months. The disease is treatable although treatment is usually long and creates many problems for the patients. Intra-articular corticosteroid injections, physical therapy, supraclavicular nerve block, acupuncture, daily activities modification, etc., are traditionally used in this condition.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] In physical therapy, various modalities such as joint mobilization,[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] heat, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, exercise, distension arthrography and manipulation under anesthesia, arthroscopic and open surgical release are used early in the rehabilitation process; however, passive joint glides and nonpainful passive ROM exercises might be beneficial. Early scapular stability exercises and closed chain rotator cuff exercises can be instituted. As the patient's symptoms improve, active-assisted and active ROM activities can be added, along with open chain and proprioceptive exercises. The Pendulum and University of Washington (Jackins) exercises are useful for improving the shoulder's ROM.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Shockwave through generating low-energy waves and electromagnetic excitation could be effective in this condition due to increasing the regional blood flow, neovascular changes, enzymes release, reduction of inflammatory cytokines, and increasing the flexibility of the collagen fibers and tendons in that area. This type of treatment has been used in other orthopedic conditions such as tendinitis,[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] plantar fasciitis,[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and lateral epicondilitis[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] the healing process of wounds[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and fractures[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and satisfactory results have been achieved. There is also limited number of investigations to evaluate the usefulness of shockwave therapy in frozen shoulder. This study aimed to determine the effect of extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT) in the treatment of patients with frozen shoulder admitted to Isfahan University of Medical Sciences hospitals in 2011 and 2012.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study design and participants</title><p>This clinical randomized trial study was performed in Kashani Hospital, Isfahan, Iran in 2011 and 2012.</p><p>The study population was the patients with frozen shoulder who were admitted to Isfahan Medical University hospital. The patients were examined by a hand surgeon sub-specialist. After providing the necessary X-ray and injection of 40 mg triamcinolone (Hexal AG) into the involved shoulder joint, the patients were referred to the physical medicine and rehabilitation clinic. Exclusion criteria were history of previous surgery on the shoulder, history of shoulder fracture, cancer, inflammatory disorders, bleeding disorders, and unwillingness to participate in the study. Then, the patients completed a consent form to participate in the research. After that, the enrolled patients were randomized into two groups using random allocation software.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Proscure and variable assessment</title><p>All the patients received analgesics (meloxicam 15 mg daily), and activity modification to reduce pain, and were advised to perform Pendulum exercises (swinging arm forward and back, side to side, and around in circles for 5-10 times) and stretching the back of the involved shoulder 30 s twice a day. If the patient tolerated it progressed by wall walking and University of Washington (Jackins) exercises, the patients were blind to the study. The patients in the intervention group received shock wave therapy once a week for 4 weeks. The focus probe sets were used and in each session, patients received ESWT from anterior and posterior directions (on the average 1200 shocks between 0.1 and 0.3 mJ/mm<sup>2</sup>) up to the maximum threshold of pain tolerance in the shoulder. The control group received sham shockwave therapy once a week for 4 weeks while the device was turned off and placed on the patient's shoulder for the same period of time. The device used in this study was the standard electromagnetic shockwave (Doulith SD1). This procedure was performed with patients in the sitting position on a chair after applying the coupling gel. Pain and disability score were assessed with the Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI) questionnaire before the treatment, immediately after the intervention, and 2 and 5 months after the intervention. The SPADI questionnaire was completed for each patient by the physician in each session. The SPADI questionnaire's is a self-administered instrument developed to measure pain (five items) and disability (eight items) associated with shoulder complaints. For the five pain items, &#x0201c;no pain&#x0201d; scored zero and &#x0201c;the worst imaginable pain&#x0201d; scored 10; for the eight disability items, &#x0201c;no difficulty&#x0201d; received zero score while &#x0201c;difficulty requiring assistance&#x0201d; received 10 scores. The SPADI demonstrates good internal consistency, test-retest reliability and criterion and construct validity. It also appears to be able to detect change in patient status over time. The SPADI should therefore prove to be a useful instrument both in clinical practice and in clinical research.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] The ROM of the involved shoulder was measured by a goniometer in flexion, abduction, extension, internal, and external rotation.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>The obtained data were analyzed with the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 20.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA), using independent <italic>t</italic>-test, paired <italic>t</italic>-test, Chi-square test, and repeated measures ANOVA.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> shows a total of 40 patients with frozen shoulder were randomly divided into two groups.

Other methods such as distension arthroscopy and manipulation under anesthesia are recommended and although, the risk of general anesthesia is considered for all of these conditions. Since some patients have diabetes and cardiac problems, surgery methods have more complications. ESWT has positive results in orthopedic conditions such as tendinitis, plantar fasciitis, lateral epicondilitis and rotator cuff disease. Since the rotator cuff problem is one of the predisposing factors for frozen shoulder and ESWT is effective in this condition, ESWT may also be useful in frozen shoulder. Durante <italic>et al</italic>. (2006) studied patients with similar conditions. One group of the patients were treated with extracorporeal shockwave combined with physiokinesiotherapy and the second group were treated with physiokinesiotherapy alone.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Patients received 2500 shocks from anterior and lateral directions with energy between 0.07 and 0.11 mJ/mm<sup>2</sup> two sessions per week 2 weeks. All patients were followed for 6 months. About 30% of the patients showed excellent response, while 30% of patients showed poor response, as well. 10% of patients in the second group showed complete response. According to arthroscopic findings, adhesions occur more in the descendent fold and surrounding synovium, therefore, stimulation from anterior and posterior directions is more effective rather than the lateral direction. In the current study, the amount of the energy was higher than the study by Durante; other researches on the rotator cuff tendonitis have reported more effective responses with higher energy; therefore, it is better to increase the level of energy and decrease the number of shocks. In the present study, the better response to treatment was likely due to proper session intervals.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>According to the findings of this study and in comparison with similar studies, ESWT has positive effects on acceleration of the healing process of frozen shoulder. Considering the significant side-effects of other therapies such as surgery, patients with frozen shoulder can take advantage of ESWT because of its noninvasive, safe nature, low costs, no need for hospitalization, fewer visits of patient in the hospital, and the lack of significant adverse events during the treatment.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-6"><title>RECOMMENDATION</title><p>Since systematic reviews on plantar fasciitis have revealed effective response to the use of the radial shockwave probe, the authors suggest that the efficacy of the radial probe in comparison with the probe focused on the treatment of frozen shoulder be evaluated in future studies.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>This study was supported by a grant from Isfahan University of Medical Sciences (Grant no: 391061).
