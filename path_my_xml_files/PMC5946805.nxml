A planned unmasked review of efficacy data by the independent data monitoring committee in November, 2016, showed that the number of patients with a confirmed or unconfirmed complete response with GEM-P was non-significantly inferior compared with CHOP and the trial was closed early. At a median follow-up of 27&#x000b7;4 months (IQR 16&#x000b7;6&#x02013;38&#x000b7;4), 23 patients (62%) of 37 assessable patients assigned to CHOP had achieved a complete response or unconfirmed complete response compared with 17 (46%) of 37 assigned to GEM-P (odds ratio 0&#x000b7;52, 95% CI 0&#x000b7;21&#x02013;1&#x000b7;31; p=0&#x000b7;164).

We investigated GEM-P chemotherapy (gemcitabine, methylprednisolone, and cisplatin) compared with CHOP in previously untreated patients with peripheral T-cell lymphoma. We searched PubMed on Dec 4, 2017, for English-language articles published from January, 1998, to October, 2017, and searched abstracts from the American Society of Hematology and American Society of Clinical Oncology published between 2015&#x02013;17 with the search terms &#x0201c;T-cell lymphoma&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;chemotherapy&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;gemcitabine&#x0201d;, excluding studies in which patients with non-nodal peripheral T-cell lymphoma forms were assessed exclusively. We identified 30 reports showing activity of gemcitabine in peripheral T-cell lymphoma; three with gemcitabine as monotherapy and nine with a combination of gemcitabine with platinum and steroids predominantly in pretreated populations, including three retrospective reports on GEM-P specifically in peripheral T-cell lymphoma. Different combinations of gemcitabine with other novel drugs, with or without the addition of platinum, in the treatment of peripheral T-cell lymphoma were also reported in the scientific literature, including one randomised trial that assessed the combination of gemcitabine, cisplatin, prednisolone and thalidomide versus CHOP in treatment-naive patients. However, there were no reported randomised studies on the combination of gemcitabine, platinum, and steroids alone versus CHOP in the front-line setting.</p><p id="para50"><bold>Added value of this study</bold></p><p id="para60">Our phase 2 trial is one of the few randomised studies in previously untreated patients with peripheral T-cell lymphoma and is an important addition to the evidence-base. The findings confirm the poor outcomes for peripheral T-cell lymphoma within a prospective trial cohort and indicate that CHOP should remain the reference regimen at present. Our trial was the first prospective study to assess an <sup>18</sup>F-FDG-PET-CT response in patients with peripheral T-cell lymphoma as part of a pre-planned substudy, and the data suggest that <sup>18</sup>F-FDG-PET-CT might be a more sensitive tool than contrast-enhanced CT for determining response in peripheral T-cell lymphoma, as it might better distinguish between a residual fibrotic mass present after chemotherapy versus viable tumour. Furthermore, obtaining a complete response by <sup>18</sup>F-FDG-PET-CT was independently prognostic for superior progression-free survival in multivariable analysis, whereas complete response by CT was not. Additionally, we reported the incidence and pattern of CNS relapse in peripheral T-cell lymphoma from a prospective trial. Determination of the subtype of peripheral T-cell lymphoma in our study was revised for around a fifth of the patients, highlighting the diagnostic challenges in peripheral T-cell lymphoma. Despite GEM-P showing non-significant inferiority for the endpoint of CT-based confirmed and unconfirmed complete response compared with CHOP, there were no differences in either progression-free survival or overall survival between the groups; future study design in this indication should be powered for primary endpoints of survival rather than complete response, which might not be an accurate surrogate endpoint (particularly when assessed by contrast-enhanced CT) in peripheral T-cell lymphoma.</p><p id="para70"><bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold></p><p id="para80">Taken together, current evidence supports the use of gemcitabine as an effective therapy in the management of peripheral T-cell lymphoma. However, our randomised phase 2 study did not suggest superiority of GEM-P over CHOP in the front-line setting for previously untreated patients and therefore, CHOP should remain the reference regimen in this indication for previously untreated patients. Although GEM-P has shown efficacy in patients with peripheral T-cell lymphoma, at present it should be reserved for patients with relapsed or refractory disease. A superior upfront induction regimen is urgently required for patients with treatment-naive peripheral T-cell lymphoma, and future incorporation of novel drugs could enhance the efficacy of front-line therapy in this indication.

Administration of supportive medication, including antiemetic therapy, prophylaxis for tumour lysis, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), prophylaxis for <italic>Pneumocystis jirovecii</italic> pneumonia, fluid and electrolyte administration relating to cisplatin, and administration of prophylaxis for CNS relapse, was given in accordance with local practice.</p><p id="para180">Criteria for withdrawing a patient from study treatment were interruption of study treatment for more than 3 weeks for reasons of toxicity (or for &#x0003e;4 weeks for reasons other than toxicity), disease progression, withdrawal of consent, unacceptable treatment-related toxicity, pregnancy, patient non-compliance, or other events precluding further administration of study drugs as judged by the study chief investigator (DC).</p><p id="para190">On completion of study treatment, patients with a complete response or unconfirmed complete response could proceed to high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem-cell transplantation at the local investigator's discretion. Consolidation radiotherapy to sites of initial bulk or residual disease was also permitted at the end of treatment at the investigator's discretion.</p><p id="para200">Patients were assessed at baseline, at each attendance for treatment, 30 days after completion of treatment, and subsequently every 3 months for 1 year, then every 6 months until year 2, and every year thereafter for a maximum follow-up of 5 years. Laboratory monitoring with a full blood-cell count (haemoglobin, white cells, neutrophils, and platelets) and biochemistry (sodium, potassium, urea, creatinine, calcium, magnesium, phosphate, lactate dehydrogenase, total bilirubin, liver transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, serum albumin, and blood glucose concentrations) were done at baseline, on each day of treatment, and at 30 days after completion of study treatment. At baseline all patients had a contrast enhanced CT scan of the neck, thorax, abdomen and pelvis and an <sup>18</sup>F-FDG-PET-CT scan done within 28 days of randomisation, and a bone marrow biopsy was required within 6 weeks of randomisation. CT scans were also required during treatment (after cycles 2 and 4 for patients on CHOP and after cycles 1 and 3 for patients on GEM-P). Both a contrast enhanced CT scan and an <sup>18</sup>F-FDG-PET-CT scan were done at the end of treatment. Any clinical suspicion of relapse or progression was confirmed radiologically or on bone marrow aspirate or trephine if disease was marrow-based only.</p><p id="para210">All patients enrolled were required to submit their diagnostic tissue for central histopathology review within 28 days of randomisation; CT and <sup>18</sup>F-FDG-PET-CT responses were also centrally assessed.

Before the formal interim analysis, interim results from a planned unmasked independent review of efficacy data by the independent data monitoring committee in November, 2016, showed that fewer patients had achieved a complete response or unconfirmed complete response with GEM-P than with CHOP. The committee concluded there was a high likelihood that GEM-P would be inferior to CHOP at the end of the trial, as indicated by the one-sided 80% CI for difference. The trial was subsequently closed to recruitment and all patients treated in the GEM-P group were offered the option to change to CHOP off-study at the time of study closure as per the recommendations of the data monitoring committee and trial management group.

End-of-treatment response by <sup>18</sup>F-FDG-PET-CT or CT was assessable in 70 patients (89%) of 79 (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 10</xref>); although the incidence of complete response as determined by <sup>18</sup>F-FDG-PET-CT was lower in the GEM-P group than in the CHOP group, the difference between groups was less marked than between-group differences for complete response assessment by contrast-enhanced CT. The proportion of agreement between <sup>18</sup>F-FDG-PET-CT and contrast-enhanced CT for determining a complete response was 77&#x000b7;3%. For 40 patients with a complete response by <sup>18</sup>F-FDG-PET-CT on completion of study treatment, the corresponding contrast-enhanced CT data were: 24 (60%) with a complete response, seven (18%) with an unconfirmed complete response, five (13%) with a partial response, two (5%) with stable disease, and two (5%) with progressive disease.</p></sec><sec id="cesec100"><title>Discussion</title><p id="para450">The number of complete responses or unconfirmed complete responses in the GEM-P group was non-significantly inferior to the CHOP group, indicating that the primary endpoint of the trial would not be met. A planned subgroup analysis showed that the effect was consistent across subgroups.</p><p id="para460">As part of a preplanned analysis, we also assessed the proportion of agreement between contrast-enhanced CT and <sup>18</sup>F-FDG-PET-CT for determining a complete response, and found it to be around 77%. This discrepancy was probably mainly due to the presence of persistent non-FDG-avid nodes discernible on contrast-enhanced CT after chemotherapy and <sup>18</sup>F-FDG-PET-CT might be better able to distinguish between a residual fibrotic mass following chemotherapy versus viable tumour in peripheral T-cell lymphoma. The rate of early withdrawal before completing study treatment for reasons other than disease progression was higher in the GEM-P group with more participants withdrawing for toxicity and by choice; there were also two deaths on treatment with GEM-P, both due to lung infections. Patients treated in the CHOP group had more febrile neutropenia than those in the GEM-P group; by contrast, patients treated with GEM-P had more thrombocytopenia of all grades and grade 3 or worse than those treated with CHOP, although this did not lead to a substantial increase in bleeding events. GEM-P was also associated with a significant increased risk of grade 1-2 tinnitus, which led two patients to withdraw early from the study.</p><p id="para470">Relative dose intensity was lower in the GEM-P group than in the CHOP group, although this might mainly reflect the dose modifications that were required with the GEM-P regimen according to blood results on the day of treatment. However, there were two separate instances where a day of GEM-P treatment was incorrectly omitted rather than delayed, resulting in two protocol violations, although it seems unlikely that this modification would have significantly negatively affected the primary endpoint assessment in the GEM-P arm. At the median follow-up of 27&#x000b7;4 months there was no difference in either 2-year progression-free survival or overall survival between the treatment groups. In a Cox regression analysis of the ITT population, significant risk factors associated with superior overall survival included a complete response at end of treatment determined either by CT or by <sup>18</sup>F-FDG-PET-CT, and autologous stem-cell transplantation consolidation in first remission in univariable analysis. However, no factors remained independently significant for overall survival in multivariable analysis. In multivariable analysis of the factors associated with progression-free survival, presence of a raised lactate dehydrogenase concentration at presentation was prognostic of inferior progression-free survival, whereas a low or low-intermediate risk international prognostic index score or a complete response to study treatment determined by <sup>18</sup>F-FDG-PET-CT was independently associated with superior progression-free survival.</p><p id="para480">The number of patients who withdrew from the study for reasons other than disease progression was higher in the GEM-P group than in the CHOP group, and consequently more patients receiving GEM-P proceeded to second-line chemotherapy. This might explain the absence of a survival difference between arms at this time, as the numbers undergoing autologous stem-cell transplantation in first remission were similar between groups, although this remains to be further investigated. However, given that the inferior incidence of complete responses and unconfirmed complete responses in the GEM-P group was not associated with inferior progression-free survival or overall survival for these patients, complete response (particularly when assessed by contrast-enhanced CT) might not be an accurate surrogate endpoint in peripheral T-cell lymphoma. Future studies in this area should therefore better investigate this point, and perhaps should be designed with primary endpoints that incorporate survival. Indeed, measuring endpoints such as 24-month event-free survival in peripheral T-cell lymphoma might be an important predictor of overall survival; one study showed that patients achieving 24-month event-free survival had superior overall survival compared with those who did not reach this milestone.<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref></p><p id="para490">Although our study closed early to recruitment, this phase 2 trial is an important addition to the prospective evidence-base for this rare subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and is, to our knowledge, the third randomised trial reported with treatment-naive patients with peripheral T-cell lymphoma. All participants had the diagnosis and subtype of peripheral T-cell lymphoma confirmed centrally by two expert lymphoma pathologists; for around 23% of patients with peripheral T-cell lymphoma the subtype was revised, highlighting that there are challenges to accurately diagnosing peripheral T-cell lymphoma. Additionally, although extensive future work is necessary, our study reports, to our knowledge, the first dedicated prospective trial to assess <sup>18</sup>F-FDG-PET-CT responses in patients with peripheral T-cell lymphoma, all of which were done at accredited sites, underwent central quality control, and were centrally assessed by an expert <sup>18</sup>F FDG PET-CT physician. Our study also adds important data from a prospective trial cohort on the incidence of CNS relapse in peripheral T-cell lymphoma, which at the time of writing has been reported in two patients with peripheral T-cell lymphoma not otherwise specified and occurred during study treatment.</p><p id="para500">However, the limitations of our study also need to be acknowledged. Firstly, and most importantly, as the trial closed early to recruitment it was not adequately powered to assess the primary study endpoint. Another potential limitation of the study is in the interpretation of dose intensity for GEM-P; this regimen was administered weekly for 3 weeks out of 4, with the dose adjusted on each day of treatment in accordance with the blood counts on the day of treatment, which is in contrast to CHOP where treatment is administered once every 3 weeks allowing more time for count recovery.</p><p id="para510">Despite the absence of international consensus on the gold-standard therapy for previously untreated patients with peripheral T-cell lymphoma, CHOP has been adopted by many countries as the reference regimen.<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> With the exception of ALK-positive anaplastic large cell T-cell lymphoma<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> the outcomes with CHOP or CHOP-like therapy appear to be suboptimum, with a 5-year overall survival of only 38&#x000b7;5%, as reported in a meta-analysis.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> Attempts to surpass outcomes with CHOP have proven largely unsuccessful, except a subgroup analysis by the German High-Grade NHL Study Group that showed improved event-free survival but no overall survival benefit with CHOEP for younger patients (&#x02264;60 years) with peripheral T-cell lymphoma with normal lactate dehydrogenase concentrations treated within aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma clinical trials.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> Therefore, optimising therapy for newly diagnosed patients remains an important unmet medical need.</p><p id="para520">MDR-1/Pgp is known to be overexpressed in peripheral T-cell lymphoma<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> in the lymphoma cells, residual lymphocytes, and endothelium,<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> and this might account for the reported efficacy of the nucleoside analogue gemcitabine in peripheral T-cell lymphoma, which is not a substrate of the efflux pump.<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> The activity of intravenous gemcitabine monotherapy (1200 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle) was first reported in 1998 in a phase 2 study<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> of 13 patients with relapsed or refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma unspecified or patients with mycosis fungoides with an objective response of 69% and complete response of 8%.

More patients also withdrew from the GEM-P group than from the CHOP group for reasons other than disease progression. The dose of cisplatin 100 mg/m<sup>2</sup> administered in GEM-P was associated with more grade 1&#x02013;2 tinnitus (compared with CHOP), which led three patients to withdraw early before completing study treatment; this dose therefore appears to be at the upper limit of what is tolerable in terms of ototoxicity, but further assessment of the dosing limit would be necessary to establish tolerability. Nevertheless, we have revised the dose of cisplatin administered with GEM-P at The Royal Marsden Hospital (London, UK) to a total dose of 75 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, in line with the dose used in other regimens containing gemcitabine and platinum,<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> with the expectation that this might reduce the incidence of ototoxicity.</p><p id="para550">Although our data show that GEM-P has efficacy in terms of response and survival in peripheral T-cell lymphoma, in our randomised study it was inferior to CHOP for treatment-naive patients with this disease. One possible exception for the use of this type of regimen upfront might be when front-line anthracycline-based chemotherapy is contraindicated to avoid cardiotoxicity. In conclusion, although further studies are warranted, our phase 2 randomised trial suggests that CHOP should, for the time being, remain the reference regimen for previously untreated patients with peripheral T-cell lymphoma and that GEM-P is best reserved for the relapsed and refractory setting at present.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="bibl10"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref10"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Vose</surname><given-names>JM</given-names></name><name><surname>Armitage</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Weisenburger</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>International peripheral T-cell and natural killer/T-cell lymphoma study: pathology findings and clinical outcomes international T-cell lymphoma project</article-title><source>J Clin Oncol</source><volume>26</volume><year>2008</year><fpage>4124</fpage><lpage>4130</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">18626005</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref20"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Pautier</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Devidas</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Delmer</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Angioimmunoblastic-like T-cell non Hodgkin's lymphoma: outcome after chemotherapy in 33 patients and review of the literature</article-title><source>Leuk Lymphoma</source><volume>32</volume><year>1999</year><fpage>545</fpage><lpage>552</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">10048427</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref30"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Simon</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Peoch</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Casassus</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Upfront VIP-reinforced-ABVD (VIP-rABVD) is not superior to CHOP/21 in newly diagnosed peripheral T cell lymphoma.
