training on the balance ability and gait endurance of chronic stroke inpatients. [Subjects
and Methods] The participants were 30 patients who had stroke &#x0003e;6 months previously,
resulting in a disability such as hemiparesis. The participants were randomly divided into
the group task-oriented circuit training group and the individual task-oriented
circuit-training group. They performed eight types of modified task-oriented training.
Balance ability and gait endurance were measured by using the Berg balance scale
questionnaire and the 6-min walk test, respectively, before and after the experiment.
[Results] Significant differences were observed between before and after the intervention
in all variables. There was a significant difference between groups in Berg balance scale
scores; however, no significant differences were seen in the timed up and go test and the
6-min walk test. [Conclusion] The results of this study indicated that group exercise can
better improve the balance ability of chronic stroke inpatients after stroke than can
individualized exercise intervention.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Stroke inpatients</kwd><kwd>Task-oriented circuit training</kwd><kwd>Balance ability</kwd><kwd>Gait endurance</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Stroke, a representative chronic neurological disease, is categorized according to the
location of damage and causes different disabilities in patients, such as motor, perception,
cognitive, and language disabilities<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Hemiparesis occurs in stroke inpatients and is a common disability that could restrict joint
movement and reduce the ability of muscle contraction. In addition, motor disability can
cause imbalance of the left and right sides of the body<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>, reduce balance ability and gait endurance, and induce a fear of
falling when performing physical activity<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Exercise therapy is gradually being recommended as a component of stroke rehabilitation
programs for preventing adverse effects and improving function in patients. Several
studies<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup> have demonstrated the
effects of training programs in preventing physical inactivity and improving gait ability in
chronic stroke patients.</p><p>The task-oriented training designed by Shepherd and Carr in the 1980s is a kind of exercise
therapy for stroke patients that is based on the motor learning theory, with emphasis on
motor skill re-training. This method is a treatment that focuses on maximizing the
effectiveness of the inner sense needed in task performance and then improves the adaptation
ability<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In a previous study<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>, it was shown that
task-oriented training better improves functional ability than does traditional exercise
intervention. In advanced studies<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>
related to task-related training, it has been attempted to enhance the effects of
intervention programs by controlling the parameters of stroke patients. Recently, group
task-oriented intervention in circuit classes has been proposed as a method of improving the
performance ability after stroke in task practice<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. In another study, it was shown that group task-oriented
intervention was as effective in improving gait ability as individual task-oriented circuit
training<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Centered task-oriented
training also can be an effective intervention to improve balance ability confirmed by using
the Berg balance scale (BBS) in stroke inpatients<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>However, the effectiveness of task-oriented intervention between groups and individuals
after stroke has not been investigated in recent studies. Therefore, the purpose of this
study was to analyze the effect of task-oriented circuit training for comparing the
differences between individualized and group-oriented interventions on the balance ability
and gait endurance of stroke inpatients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects were 30 patients who developed hemiparesis at least 6 months previously,
diagnosed at the Department of Neurosurgery of G hospital. They were randomly divided into
the group task-oriented circuit training (GTCT) group (n=15; 8 males, 7 females; mean age,
50 &#x000b1; 9.3&#x02005;years) and the individual task-oriented circuit training (ITCT) group (n=15; 10
males, 5 females; mean age, 54 &#x000b1; 7.1&#x02005;years). Three subjects in the GTCT group and four
subjects in the ITCT group were dropped from this study owing to personal reasons. Finally,
23 subjects were enrolled in the present study. This study was approved by the University of
Sunmoon Research Ethics Review Committee (SM-201504-007-1; May 29, 2015), and the study
protocol was conducted in strict accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Written
informed consent was obtained from each subject. Patients were excluded if they had other
neurological problems such as dependent gait, surgical lesions affecting walking, sight and
vestibular lesions affecting balance, or a score of &#x0003c;23 on the Mini-Mental State
Examination-Korea.</p><p>The program was carried out in the exercise therapy room of G hospital for a total of 18
times, 3 times a week for 6 weeks. Each group was composed of two or three patients, and
each group was designated a partner to enhance optimal exercise performance though the
subjects&#x02019; motivation and enhanced competitive spirit. The task-oriented circuit training
intervention program consisted of eight types of modified exercise including straight leg
raise, kicking a ball toward the wall, sitting up and walking, obstacle walking, treadmill
walking, maximal speed walking, sitting on a Swiss ball, and playing a video game for
50&#x02005;min, and was conducted according to the type of circuit training. Warm-up and cool-down
for 5&#x02005;min were performed before and after exercise, respectively.</p><p>Dynamic balance was measured by using the BBS and timed up and go (TUG) test, and gait
endurance was measured through the 6-min walk test (6MWT). The BBS is used to measure the
static and dynamic balance ability of adult neurology inpatients, with 0 as the lowest
point, 4 as the highest point, and 56 points as the perfect score (the higher the score, the
better the balance). The TUG test was done with the subject first seated on a 50-cm-high
chair with armrest; then, the time from standing up and walking up to 3&#x02005;m to the time the
patient returns to the chair was measured. The 6MWT was done on a 50-m rectangular track on
which the participants were instructed to walk as fast as they can and sit thereafter.
Balance and gait endurance were measured before and after the experiment.</p><p>The collected data were processed and analyzed by using the Windows SPSS/PV ver. 17.0
statistics program. For the participants&#x02019; common characteristics, an independent t-test was
used to determine the descriptive statistics and the differences between groups. To compare
the groups before and after the training program, a paired t-test was used. The significance
level was set at &#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p><xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Difference of balance ability and gait endurance between interventions</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th colspan="2" align="left" rowspan="1"/><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">GTCT</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ITCT</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="2" colspan="1">BBS score</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pre</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">44.5 &#x000b1; 3.8</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">41.8 &#x000b1; 3.8</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Post</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">52.1 &#x000b1; 2.52</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">45.7 &#x000b1; 6.3<sup>*#</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="2" colspan="1">TUG (s)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pre</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">18.1 &#x000b1; 6.5</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">18.7 &#x000b1; 5.8</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Post</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">14.3 &#x000b1; 6.1<sup>#</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">16.1 &#x000b1; 4.7<sup>#</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="2" colspan="1">6MWT (m)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pre</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">252.5 &#x000b1; 94.0</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">256.2 &#x000b1; 98.9</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Post</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">345.5 &#x000b1; 131.4<sup>#</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">297.2 &#x000b1; 81.3<sup>#</sup></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Values are means &#x000b1; standard deviation. *Significant difference between groups

BBS (p&#x0003c;0.05); no significant differences were found in TUG and 6MWT between the two
groups.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The results in the BBS, TUG, and 6MWT in this study showed an increase in both groups, and
only the BBS parameter showed a significant difference between the two groups. In addition,
the variations in the TUG and 6MWT scores were more greatly increased in the GTCT group than
in the ITCT group; however, the results did not show a significant difference between the
two groups. In the study by English et al.<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>, the participants of a task-oriented circuit training program
showed a significant increase in BBS scores. In Dean et al.&#x02019;s study<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>, it was also confirmed that a task-oriented circuit
training program resulted in a significant decrease in the TUG score. In the present study,
group training was shown to be more effective than individual therapy in improving balance
ability and gait endurance. These results indicate that participants in the GTCT group (who
exercised with other inpatients with hemiparesis) developed psychological stability owing to
the encouragement they received from each other, conclusively increasing the effectiveness
of the exercise.</p><p>However, in Salbach et al.&#x02019;s study<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>, no
significant difference was observed between pre- and post-evaluation in the BBS and TGU
scores in 91 stroke patients who participated in a 10-cycle task-oriented circuit training
program. Although the intervention method in the previous study was similar to that of the
present study, the method of selecting the subjects was different. That is, the participants
of this study were hospitalized during the experimental period, whereas the subjects in the
previous study were outpatients. As inpatients require exercise more than outpatients, it
was considered that exercise is more effective in inpatients.</p><p>In this study, the 6MWT was used to measure the effect of the applied intervention on gait
endurance. In the study by Lord et al.<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>,
the 6MWT was found to be an effective measurement method for gait endurance. In previous
studies<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup> related to gait ability in stroke
patients, circuit-based rehabilitation was shown to lead to improvements in gait endurance.
In another study by Salbach et al.<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>, the
distance and speed of gait in chronic stroke patients were significantly increased after a
task-oriented circuit program for 6 weeks. In the present study, the distance of the 6MWT
was significantly increased after the applied intervention program for 6 weeks in both
groups. The positive results of walking in this study were consistent with those of the
study by Manning et al.<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup> in which gait
endurance and speed were improved through gradually increasing the speed of the
treadmill.</p><p>In conclusion, the effectiveness of a task-oriented exercise intervention was shown through
the application of group task- and individual task-intervention to chronic stroke
inpatients. The results of this study indicate that group training is more effective in
maintaining balance ability in stroke inpatients with hemiparesis than individualized
training.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><person-group><name><surname>O&#x02019;sullivan</surname><given-names>SB</given-names></name><name><surname>Schmitz</surname><given-names>TJ</given-names></name></person-group>: Physical Rehabilitation, 5th ed.
