Alirocumab is available as a single 1&#x02009;ml injection in two doses (75 and 150&#x02009;mg) to be administered once every 2 weeks (Q2W).

In six studies from the ODYSSEY program enrolling patients receiving background statin therapy (at maximally tolerated dose in four of the six studies), the starting dose of 75&#x02009;mg Q2W was sufficient for the majority of patients (56.6&#x02013;92.0%) to achieve prespecified LDL-C goals.

The analysis includes only those patients with at least one study drug injection after week 12 to allow for an assessment of the effect of the dose increase (which would only be apparent from week 16 or beyond). Furthermore, data were analyzed using an on-treatment approach, which included only data collected while the patient was receiving study treatment. Other efficacy endpoints included the proportion of patients achieving risk-based LDL-C goals. Clinic visits occurred at baseline (week 0) and subsequently at weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, and 24 and at weeks 36 and 52 for trials lasting longer than 24 weeks (later time points are not included from the 104-week COMBO II study and the 78-week FH I and II studies). Patient blood samples for lipid and safety laboratory assessments were obtained after a 10-h overnight fast. All lipid measurements and laboratory tests were performed using standard procedures by a central laboratory (Medpace Reference Laboratories, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA, Leuven, Belgium, and Singapore; or Covance Central Laboratory, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA and Geneva, Switzerland). Total and free PCSK9 concentrations in serum were quantified using a validated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method (Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc., Tarrytown, New York, USA). LDL-C was calculated using the Friedewald formula at all sampling points, reflecting the most commonly used method in clinical practice. LDL-C was also measured by ultracentrifugation and precipitation (&#x003b2;-quantification) in the case of triglycerides more than 400&#x02009;mg/dl (4.5&#x02009;mmol/l) and at weeks 0 and 24 in all studies included in the pooled analysis. Investigators remained blinded to laboratory data (except clinical safety tests) throughout the study.</p><p>Safety was assessed by reporting of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), defined as those events occurring after the dose of study treatment administered at week 12 (following potential up-titration to 150&#x02009;mg Q2W) and up to 70 days after the last dose.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistics</title><p>This analysis presents baseline, efficacy, and safety data according to whether patients had alirocumab dose increase or not. No formal statistical comparison between these two groups was performed as they were postrandomization subgroups; hence, the statistical analyses presented are descriptive. For assessment of the impact of baseline parameters (LDL-C, BMI, etc.), odds ratios and <italic>P</italic>-values were calculated from a multivariate logistic regression. Factors were selected using a stepwise approach with an entry/stay significance level of 0.05.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Effect of dose increase on LDL-C reductions</title><p>These six trials included a total of 2181 patients; 1291 were randomized to receive alirocumab.

In this respect, a baseline LDL-C level further from goal was the single best predictor for requiring a dose increase, which suggests that alirocumab 150&#x02009;mg Q2W may be the most appropriate starting dose in these patients. The European Medicines Agency allows a starting dose of 150&#x02009;mg Q2W for patients who require reductions in LDL-C more than 60% <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>. (e) In addition to having higher baseline LDL-C, patients who required alirocumab dose increase were younger (&#x0003c;50 years), more often women, and were more likely to have BMI more than 30&#x02009;kg/m<sup>2</sup>, as well as higher baseline free PCSK9 levels (&#x0003e;400&#x02009;ng/ml). These observations add considerably toward our understanding of alirocumab clinical responsiveness.</p><p>Previous subgroup analyses from individual trials have lacked power to define factors associated with differences in LDL-C lowering following alirocumab according to BMI, age, or baseline PCSK9 levels, although a weak heterogeneity between men and women has been reported <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>. The absolute differences between groups on the basis of requirement for dose titration were small. For example, 30.6% of patients with BMI more than 30&#x02009;kg/m<sup>2</sup> required a dose increase compared with 23.0% of those with BMI less than or equal to 30&#x02009;kg/m<sup>2</sup> (a difference of only 7.6%), yet BMI was a significant determinant of dose response. In addition, because there is an established link between BMI and increased levels of LDL-C <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, this link may be explained by higher baseline levels of LDL-C in patients with higher BMI. These findings should therefore be treated with caution; further evidence would be required to support changes in starting dose based solely on these patient demographics, and the underlying biological mechanisms would require further investigation. In addition, the differences due to age may be linked to a higher proportion of HeFH patients in the less than 50 years age group. The mean age of alirocumab-treated patients in the ODYSSEY FH I and II studies, which exclusively recruited HeFH patients, ranged from 52 to 53 years <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> compared with 59&#x02013;64 years across the other four studies <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>. HeFH is associated with higher baseline LDL-C levels and therefore a higher likelihood of a dose increase, as with BMI.</p><p>The additional 14.2% reduction in LDL-C achieved by increasing alirocumab dose from 75 to 150&#x02009;mg Q2W is consistent with the LDL-C reductions observed across the alirocumab phase 3 program with 75 and 150&#x02009;mg doses (44.1&#x02013;54.0 and 61.0% LDL-C lowering, respectively) <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>. However, data from the ODYSSEY LONG TERM study of alirocumab 150&#x02009;mg Q2W versus placebo in 2341 patients with high cardiovascular risk suggest that a longer duration of 150&#x02009;mg dose treatment results in additional LDL-C reduction. In the LONG TERM study, 80.7% of patients had reached risk-based LDL-C goals of less than 70 or less than 100&#x02009;mg/dl at week 24, and 79.3% were below 70&#x02009;mg/dl at week 24, irrespective of initial risk. These patients had received 150&#x02009;mg alirocumab Q2W for 24 weeks rather than 12 as in the current analysis <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>.</p><p>The ongoing ODYSSEY OUTCOMES study (NCT01663402) also uses a dose-titration strategy. In this study, the starting dose of 75&#x02009;mg Q2W can be increased to 150&#x02009;mg Q2W after 8 weeks if the patient&#x02019;s LDL-C level is greater than or equal to 50&#x02009;mg/dl at week 4. Unlike the other clinical studies of Q2W dosing, this study design allows for downward dose titration from 150 to 75&#x02009;mg Q2W in the event that a patient&#x02019;s LDL-C falls below 25&#x02009;mg/dl. This design is intended to allow as many patients as possible to reach LDL-C levels of less than 50&#x02009;mg/dl, while minimizing the number with LDL-C less than 15&#x02009;mg/dl. The design of ODYSSEY OUTCOMES will allow individualized treatment by selecting the most appropriate dose for each patient, and will further inform understanding of alirocumab dose response and its relationship with clinical outcomes.</p><p>One limitation of the current analysis is that only 26.3% of all patients included required alirocumab dose increase. Therefore, the potential effect of alirocumab dose increase on 73.7% of the study population was not evaluated. On the basis of the results discussed above, those patients who did not have a dose increase might be expected to have additional reductions in LDL-C with a dose increase to 150&#x02009;mg Q2W.</p><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This analysis shows that when alirocumab dose was increased from 75 to 150&#x02009;mg Q2W among statin-treated patients not achieving treatment goals, an additional 14.2% LDL-C reduction was observed. Furthermore, 60.9% of patients who required a dose increase to 150&#x02009;mg/dl subsequently achieved the protocol-specified LDL-C goals at week 24.</p><p>Patients most likely to require dose titration usually had higher baseline LDL-C levels, were younger (age &#x0003c;50 years), were more often women, with BMI more than 30&#x02009;kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and had elevated baseline PCSK9 levels. This flexible alirocumab dosing strategy provided comparable safety profiles for both doses used. The benefits of a two-dose treatment option and the impact of treatment on clinical outcomes and safety are being further examined in the ODYSSEY OUTCOMES trial.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank the following individuals for their contributions in reviewing the manuscript: William Sasiela, Robert Pordy, and Eva-Lynne Greene of Regeneron, and Jay Edelberg and Michael Howard of Sanofi.</p><p>J.J.P.K., D.J.K., C.P.C., H.E.B., P.M., and M.F. were involved in the design of the analysis, collection, and interpretation of data, and critical review of drafts; L.V.L. and J.M. were involved in the interpretation of data and critical review of drafts.</p><p>This analysis was funded by Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
