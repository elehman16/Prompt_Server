A bioequivalence study was carried out in 40 healthy volunteers according to an open label, randomized, two-period, two-sequence, crossover, single dose, and fasting conditions design. The test and reference formulations were administered in two treatment days, separated by a washout period of seven days. Plasma concentrations of rizatriptan were obtained by the LC/MS/MS (Liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry) method. Log-transformed AUC<sub>0-t</sub> (area under the plasma concentration-time curve from zero to the last measurable concentration) and C<sub>max</sub> (maximum plasma concentration) values were tested for bioequivalence based on the ratios of the geometric means (test/reference). The t<sub>max</sub> (time to reach maximum plasma concentration) was analysed nonparametrically. The 90% confidence intervals of the geometric mean values for the test/reference ratios for AUC<sub>0-t</sub> and C<sub>max</sub> were within the bioequivalence acceptance range of 80%&#x02013;125%. According to the European Guideline, it may therefore be concluded that the test formulation of rizatriptan 10 mg orodispersible tablet is bioequivalent to the reference formulation (Maxalt<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Max 10 mg oral lyophilisate). The safety profile of both formulations was consistent with the summary of the product characteristics.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Antimigraine agent</kwd><kwd>rizatriptan</kwd><kwd>bioequivalence</kwd><kwd>pharmacokinetics</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-scipharm-84-00514"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>A migraine is the most common headache disorder encountered in clinical practice. Approximately 25% of women and 9% of men are affected by this disorder. More than half of these patients complain of severe or very severe headache and of significant limitations of their social and work activities, with some confined to bed by the attacks [<xref rid="B1-scipharm-84-00514" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>It is generally recognized that the primary cause of migraine headaches lies in the brain and may be related to cortical hyperexcitability and brainstem nuclei dysfunction. Activation of the trigeminovascular system leads to release of vasoactive neuropeptides, resulting in vasodilation of the meningeal vessels and neurogenic inflammation. Both peripheral and central sensitizations have a role in migraine pain. The International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-II) describes migraine as a recurrent headache disorder manifesting in attacks lasting 4&#x02013;72 h. Typical characteristics of the headache are unilateral location, pulsating quality, moderate or severe intensity, aggravation by routine physical activity, and association with nausea and/or photophobia and phonophobia [<xref rid="B2-scipharm-84-00514" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>The objective of acute migraine therapy is to restore the patient&#x02019;s ability to function by rapidly and consistently alleviating the head pain and the associated symptoms. The introduction of triptans into the market in 1993 increased the therapeutic options in migraine patients considerably. Triptans are effective drugs for the acute treatment of migraines, and are the drugs of choice for disabling migraine attacks. The currently available triptans show many similar characteristics, but there are also some clinically relevant pharmacological differences. Amongst the triptans, oral rizatriptan has been reported to be more effective than sumatriptan, naratriptan, and zolmitriptan. In a crossover study, rizatriptan was found to be superior to the ergotamine and caffeine combination in relieving acute migraine attacks [<xref rid="B3-scipharm-84-00514" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-scipharm-84-00514" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-scipharm-84-00514" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-scipharm-84-00514" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Rizatriptan binds selectively with high affinity to human 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> (5-hydroxytryptamine) and 5-HT<sub>1D</sub> receptors and has little or no effect or pharmacological activity at 5-HT<sub>2</sub>, 5-HT<sub>3</sub>; adrenergic &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>, &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>, or &#x003b2;; D<sub>1</sub>, D<sub>2</sub>, dopaminergic, histaminic H<sub>1</sub>; muscarinic; or benzodiazepine receptors. The therapeutic activity of rizatriptan in treating migraine headaches may be attributed to its agonist effects at 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> and 5-HT<sub>1D</sub> receptors on the extracerebral intracranial blood vessels that are thought to become dilated during an attack and on the trigeminal sensory nerves that innervate them. Activation of these 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> and 5-HT<sub>1D</sub> receptors may result in constriction of pain-producing intracranial blood vessels and inhibition of neuropeptide release that leads to decreased inflammation in sensitive tissues and reduced central trigeminal pain signal transmission [<xref rid="B7-scipharm-84-00514" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Rizatriptan is rapidly and completely absorbed following oral administration. The mean oral bioavailability of the oral lyophilisate is approximately 40%&#x02013;45%, and mean peak plasma concentrations (C<sub>max</sub>) are reached in approximately 1.58 h. The time to reach maximum plasma concentration (t<sub>max</sub>) following administration of rizatriptan as the oral lyophilisate formulation is delayed by 30&#x02013;60 min relative to the tablet. Rizatriptan is minimally bound (14%) to plasma proteins. The volume of distribution is approximately 140 litres in male subjects, and 110 litres in female subjects. The primary route of rizatriptan metabolism is via oxidative deamination by monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A) to the indole acetic acid metabolite, which is not pharmacologically active. <italic>N</italic>-monodesmethyl-rizatriptan, a metabolite with activity similar to that of the parent compound at the 5-HT<sub>1B/1D</sub> receptors, is formed to a minor degree, but does not contribute significantly to the pharmacodynamic activity of rizatriptan. The plasma half-life of rizatriptan in males and females averages 2&#x02013;3 h. The plasma clearance of rizatriptan averages about 1000&#x02013;1500 mL/min in males and about 900&#x02013;1100 mL/min in females; about 20%&#x02013;30% of this is renal clearance. Consistent with its first pass metabolism, approximately 14% of an oral dose is excreted in urine as unchanged rizatriptan, while 51% is excreted as indole acetic acid metabolite. No more than 1% is excreted in urine as the active N-monodesmethyl metabolite. If rizatriptan is administered according to the maximum dosage regimen, no drug accumulation in the plasma occurs from day-to-day [<xref rid="B7-scipharm-84-00514" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>According to the European Guideline [<xref rid="B8-scipharm-84-00514" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], two medicinal products containing the same active substance are considered bioequivalent if they are pharmaceutically equivalent, or pharmaceutical alternatives and their bioavailabilities (rate and extent) after administration in the same molar dose lie within acceptable predefined limits. The aim of the study reported here was to compare the rate and extent of absorption of two oral formulations of rizatriptan 10 mg (test: orodispersible tablet, reference: oral lyophilisate) in a single dose, two-period, two-sequence, crossover, and randomised study in healthy volunteers. As a secondary objective the safety of both formulations was assessed.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-scipharm-84-00514"><title>2.

Study Design </title><p>The study was conducted in a single dose, two-period, two-sequence, fasting, open label, crossover randomised design, comparing the bioavailability of a new generic formulation (test) and a trade name formulation (reference) of rizatriptan 10 mg.</p><p>During each period, the volunteers were admitted to the Phase I Unit. After an overnight fasting period of at least 8 h, they received one 10 mg rizatriptan orodispersible tablet (test) or one 10 mg rizatriptan oral lyophilisate (reference) formulation according to the randomisation scheme. Each volunteer was assigned randomly to one of the sequences. The medication was placed on the tongue (without swallowing) after wetting the mouth with 20 mL of plain water. Each subject was asked to allow the tablet to orally dissolve and not to chew until completely disintegrated. The resulting suspension was swallowed. No water was provided.</p><p>During the hospitalization (until +24 h post-dose), caloric and liquid intake were controlled and standardized by the investigator&#x02019;s team. Following drug administration, study subjects continued in fasting conditions for a minimum of 4 h and standard meals were served at scheduled times (+4 h, +8 h, and +13 h after drug administration). No fluid intake was allowed from 1 h before until 2 h after drug administration.</p><p>In the second period, the volunteers received the alternate product (test or reference) after a wash-out period of one week.</p><p>Blood samples (3 mL each) were collected into polypropylene tubes treated with K<sub>2</sub>EDTA (dipotassium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) at pre-dose (baseline), 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1.00, 1.25, 1.50, 1.75, 2.00, 2.25, 2.50, 2.75, 3.00, 4.00, 6.00, 8.00, 10.00, 12.00, and 24.00 h post-dosing in each period.

The method involved a solid-phase extraction procedure followed by HPLC (high-performance liquid chromatography) with MS/MS (tandem mass spectrometry) detection. Calibration curves were linear in the range of 100.5&#x02013;40,200.0 pg/mL with coefficients of correlation &#x02265;0.9979. The validated stability period of the samples covered extensively the period between the first blood draw and completion of the analytical determination.

Pharmacokinetic and Statistical Analysis</title><p>The pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated according to a non-compartmental method and were calculated individually for each subject from rizatriptan levels in plasma using Phoenix<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> WinNonlin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> version 6.2 software (Pharsight, CA, USA). The pharmacokinetic analysis was done using the actual times of blood draws, and concentration values below the limit of quantification were set to zero for the analysis.</p><p>For the purpose of bioequivalence analysis, the primary pharmacokinetic parameters were AUC<sub>0-t</sub> (area under the plasma concentration-time curve from zero to the last measurable concentration) calculated according to the linear trapezoidal rule and C<sub>max</sub> (maximum plasma concentration) observed directly from experimental data. Other evaluated pharmacokinetic parameters were AUC<sub>0-&#x0221e;</sub> (area under the plasma concentration-time curve from zero to infinity) estimated by extrapolating to infinity AUC<sub>0-t</sub>, t<sub>max</sub> (time to reach the maximal plasma concentration), and t<sub>1/2</sub> (terminal half-life time).</p><p>The sample size was determined by taking into account published data [<xref rid="B12-scipharm-84-00514" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] that showed a maximum coefficient of variation around 24%, derived from the residual variability obtained in the analysis of variance (ANOVA) after log-transformation for C<sub>max</sub>. According to the approach of Zhang [<xref rid="B13-scipharm-84-00514" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], a total of 36 volunteers were considered sufficient to achieve a power of 90% with an alpha level protection of 0.05, assuming the a priori maximum difference of 5% between formulations. Finally, it was estimated that 40 subjects should be enough to meet the 80%&#x02013;125% bioequivalence range with a statistical power of at least 90%, to take into account the possibility of observing dropouts/withdrawals and possible variations about the estimated intra-subject CV (coefficient of variation). </p><p>The bioequivalence assessment was done using a parametric approximation for AUC<sub>0-t</sub> and C<sub>max</sub> after logarithmic transformation. For each parameter, the confidence interval for the difference between formulations on the log-transformed scale is obtained from the ANOVA (analysis of variance) model. This confidence interval is then back-transformed to obtain the desired confidence interval for the ratio on the original scale. The software used was Phoenix<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> WinNonlin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> version 6.2. The statistical significance was established at <italic>p</italic> &#x02264; 0.05 for all statistical tests.
