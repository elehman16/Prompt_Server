The individual patient&#x02019;s condition is, though imperfectly, reflected by tumor markers, such as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and total alkaline phosphate (total ALP).

The observation of &#x0003c;5 CTCs/7.5 mL blood before start of treatment or 2&#x02013;3 months posttreatment indicated a favorable prognosis, both among patients on first-line treatment and in those on second-line therapy. However, the length of overall survival associated with a favorable CTC count was reduced after second-line therapy compared with first-line treatment.</p><p>When starting cytotoxic treatment in mCRPC, in particular in scientific trials, today&#x02019;s clinicians are at an increasing degree challenged to estimate future life expectancy in the individual patient. In clinical trials that evaluate new anticancer regimens in mCRPC patients, overall survival is an important endpoint, requiring reliable prognostic criteria to adjust for the heterogeneity of the patients. Routinely available biomarkers, such as PSA, hemoglobin, total ALP, LDH, and results from new imaging techniques serve only limitedly as valid objective prognostic parameters, even if combined in multivariate models. The presence of severe pain and/or of a reduced performance status is recognized as a subjectively assessed prognostic factor.<xref rid="b5-rru-6-121" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b9-rru-6-121" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> In this situation, clinicians need more objective biomarkers associated with survival. Indeed, investigators have recently become aware of the prognostic significance of the number of an mCRPC patient&#x02019;s previous therapeutic attempts. Reanalyzing data from a previously randomized trial, Halabi et al have thus published a prognostic nomogram restricted to patients with second-line therapy.<xref rid="b5-rru-6-121" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> CTC counts may represent new independent prognostic factors in such models.</p><p>However, differences as to prognostic information emerging from CTC determinations have to be expected, related to the number of preceding therapeutic attempts: Compared with men on first-line treatment, favorable CTC counts were in our pilot study, significantly less often observed in patients on second-line therapy. Nevertheless, the prognostic role of these CTC findings was maintained if the patients on first- and second-line treatment are analyzed separately, though with differing survival duration. We were surprised that significant survival differences emerged in a cohort of only 41 patients, even when our three groups were analyzed separately. Whether one should use categorized CTC counts,<xref rid="b6-rru-6-121" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> probably preferred by clinicians, or present CTC results as continuous variables<xref rid="b7-rru-6-121" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> remains debatable. The fact that none of the patients of the placebo arm (group 3) experienced reduction of CTCs indicates sufficient robustness of our technique.</p><p>Due to small numbers within each group, no survival analyses were made according to the decrease of pretreatment elevated CTCs, as done by Olmos et al<xref rid="b6-rru-6-121" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> and Scher et al,<xref rid="b7-rru-6-121" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> though significant differences were observed in the paired samples as to the event of decrease to a favorable CTC count.</p><p>Our findings support clinical experience regarding survival of mCRPC patients related to the number of the individual patient&#x02019;s previous treatment courses. Only the most recent trials of drugs have considered this effect, as for example the abiraterone trials.<xref rid="b18-rru-6-121" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="b19-rru-6-121" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> In these trials, the progression-free survival of the chemotherapy-na&#x000ef;ve patients exceeded that of patients who received abiraterone after docetaxel by approximately 10 months. A comparable though smaller difference of progression-free survival was observed in patients in the placebo arm of the ALSYMPCA trial,<xref rid="b13-rru-6-121" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> when docetaxel-na&#x000ef;ve patients are analyzed separately from those after docetaxel failure (&#x0223c;8 months before docetaxel vs &#x0223c;3 months post-docetaxel). These observations again indicate that the number of previous therapeutic attempts represent prognostic factors requiring new nomograms.<xref rid="b5-rru-6-121" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b9-rru-6-121" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> In the future, an increasing number of mCRPC patients will receive third- and fourth-line treatment, emphasizing the need for taking into account the number of preceding therapeutic attempts in addition to &#x0201c;traditional&#x0201d; prognostic factors (PSA, total ALP, LDH, pain, performance status). The identification of reliable prognostic factors is particularly important for clinicians at tertiary referral hospitals as their patients with mCRPC will have received several new hormonal or cytotoxic therapies prescribed by private specialists or uro-oncologists at local hospitals with oncological units before they finally are referred to a tertiary academic uro-oncological unit for inclusion in trials testing experimental drugs.</p><p>Our survival data are generally below those documented by Olmos et al,<xref rid="b6-rru-6-121" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> probably due to the fact that our hospital acts as a tertiary referral hospital. More than 80% of the patients, especially those in group 2 and group 3, used opiates due to highly advanced mCRPC with multiple bone metastases on bone scan.</p><p>Apart for the small size of our cohort, several limitations of our entirely descriptive study must be considered. Though the life expectancy was estimated to be &#x0003e;6 months in all of our patients at start of treatment, the vast majority of them had advanced bone metastases, as commonly seen in patients referred to a tertiary referral hospital. Therefore, findings on CTCs in relation to the number of therapeutic attempts may differ at institutions seeing earlier cases of mCRPC. Due to the small number of patients, the risk of type 2 errors must not be overlooked. Therefore, no multivariate analysis was performed. Finally the inclusion of patients on placebo/BCS only may be debatable. However, we consider BCS as a relevant second-line management in many patients with mCRPC and have therefore included these patients in our analyses.</p><p>We consider it a strength that we differentiated our findings between first-line and second-line treatment, though we are aware of the need for larger patient cohorts to facilitate multivariate analyses including treatment line as a covariate.</p><p>In conclusion, CTC determination performed before or shortly after initiation of treatment among patients with mCRPC provides clinically worthwhile prognostic information. Favorable CTC counts (&#x0003c;5 CTCs/7.5 mL blood) are significantly more often observed in men on first-line than on second-line treatment, the former findings associated with significantly longer survival than those observed in men with second-line therapy. The final significance of a favorable CTC count before or early during treatment of mCRPC has to be determined by multivariate analyses taking into account the number of preceding therapeutic attempts together with traditional prognostic factors.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>The authors report no conflicts of interest in this
