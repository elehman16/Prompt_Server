The anabolic steroidal principle from Cissus quandrangularis shows a marked influence on the rate of fracture healing by influencing early regeneration of all connective tissues involved in the healing and quicker mineralization of callus. There was shortening of about two weeks in the duration of bone healing.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>]</p><p>The hastening in the fracture healing was attributed to the stimulation of all cells of mesenchymal origin, namely, the fibroblasts, chondroblasts and osteoblasts, by Cissus quandrangularis.</p><p>Thus Cissus quandrangularis builds up the chemical composition of the fractured bone namely mucopolysachrides, collagen calcium phosphorus and others as well as its functional efficiency.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>]</p><p>In our study intermaxillary fixation was removed at the third or fourth week in cases which were treated by Harjor and Osteoseal, there was no mobility no tenderness. At the sixth week there was a significance rise in serum calcium both ionic and total, and serum phosphorus also. In another study there was no significance alternation in the serum calcium level at the third week.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] Radioactive Ca64 bone uptake decreased in the first week, followed by a gradual increase in subsequent weeks, and came to normal in six to eight weeks. It seems that Harjor increases the efficacy of the fracture healing mechanism which functions under the rule of maximum economy deposition of calcium is just enough safe joining of the broken parts of bone and entire remodeling process comes to end faster.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>]</p><p>In another study the early radiographic evidence of periosteal reactin and bony dissolution in the Harjor-treated group indicates a faster healing process.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] Active constituents of Cissus quandrangularis may stimulate the proliferation and differentiation of mesenchymal cells (MSCs) and promote new bone formation through the WntLRP5-B-Creatnin signaling pathway of pre-osteoblast formation. It can be used to treat various bone disorders and can also be used as a preventive measure for disorders that lead to decreased bone mineral density.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>]</p><p>The role of nutrition in bone healing is the most important factor which influences bone healing, Calcium is effective but cannot be utilized just by increasing the uptake&#x02014;the ability of absorption of the calcium also has to be increased. Lysine is an amino acid that helps in the absorption of calcium, Vitamin C is essential nutritionally to make the collagen that helps the body form healthy bones. It also promotes bone healing. Asprin and anti-inflammatory drugs can retard bone healing. The damaged cells in the fractured area release a large amount of prostaglandin these are important in first stage of tissue repair, and as so causes pain, and if blocked by pain killers for longer duration can affect n bone healing. The antioxidant and antimicrobial activities are also reported by Murthy <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>]</p><p>The plant extract serves as a rich source of calcium ion, when reacted with CO2 lead to formation of calcite crystals of highly irregular morphology indicating that bioorganic molecules present in extract modulate the crystals morphology.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>]</p><p>The leaves and stems of Moringa olifera are known to have a large amount of their calcium bound in calcium oxalate crystals more vitamin than carrot, more calcium than milk more iron than spinach more vitamin c than orange and more potassium than in Banana.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>]</p><p>One tablespoon of (8 g) of leaf powder will satisfy about 14% of protein, 40% of calcium, 23% of iron, and all the vitamin A needs of a child aged one to three years.

It helps prevent bone density loss, supplies natural, herbal calcium and minerals for strong bones and teeth, speeds healing of fractured bones, promotes healthy bone growth and increases bone mineral density in osteoporosis. It is a combination of Harjor, Shajan and Neem.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>]</p><p>Osteoseal should be avoided during the first three months of pregnancy and should not be recommended in higher doses for the rest of the pregnancy due to its neem content which has some anti-fertility and abortive properties.</p><p>Neem is to prevent infection in the fractured bone joint and surrounding tissues as well as to support the analgesic anti-inflammatory action of these two herbs.</p><p>Harjor showed clinical efficacy in the treatment of fractures,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] our study also showed reduction in intermaxillary fixation time from six weeks to three to four weeks with Ostoeseal, followed by Harjor, followed by Moringa, and in cases of placebo there was no reduction in time of intermaxillary fixation [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>].
