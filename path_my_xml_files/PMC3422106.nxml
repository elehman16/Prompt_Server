The study was approved by local ethics committees or institutional review boards of all participating centers, and conducted in accordance with the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonization and Good Clinical Practice guidelines. Written informed consent was obtained from participants prior to study entry. All participants underwent a 28-day screening phase and a 90-day run in phase to confirm HMB objectively, as previously described.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-ijwh-4-271">10</xref> Women meeting the inclusion criteria received either E<sub>2</sub>V/DNG or placebo for seven 28-day cycles of treatment. The women completed electronic diaries documenting the presence and intensity of menstrual blood loss on a daily basis, and were also required to collect all used sanitary protection (pads and tampons) so that menstrual blood loss could be objectively measured using a modified version of the alkaline hematin method. The primary efficacy variable was the proportion of women with a complete response (ie, restoration of completely normal menstruation, defined using a composite of eight stringent criteria)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-ijwh-4-271">10</xref> during a 90-day on-treatment phase compared with a 90-day run in phase.</p><p>Work productivity and activities of daily living outcomes were measured using the modified Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire (mWPAI)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-ijwh-4-271">12</xref> at baseline, day 84 during treatment, and day 196 at the end of treatment. The mWPAI, with a modified recall period, asked patients to assess subjectively the effect of HMB on their ability to work and perform regular daily activities during the preceding 12 weeks (as opposed to 7 days with the unmodified WPAI). Participants subjectively rated their level of impairment in work productivity and activities of daily living on a 10-point Likert scale, with higher values indicating higher impairment. Because the effects of HMB vary across menstrual cycles (depending on variations in bleeding intensity and the duration of each cycle), data from several cycles were required to account for this potential variability. Although the prolonged 12-week recall window with the mWPAI has not been validated, it has the advantage of increasing the likelihood of capturing the variable effects of HMB on work productivity (both absenteeism and presenteeism) and activities of daily living across the cycles.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Work productivity and activities of daily living outcomes were summarized using descriptive statistics. In our study, work productivity refers to presenteeism, ie, impairment while at work or reduced on-the-job productivity, rather than overall work impairment associated with both absenteeism (work time missed) and presenteeism. Due to the small number of observations in some countries, bootstrapping was used to provide estimates that are appropriate for accurate statistical inference. Bootstrapping relies on repeated samples that are randomly created from original data (excluding patients with missing baseline data) to increase the stability of the computed statistic. In this study, 1000 samples were created and used to calculate baseline values, including standard errors and confidence intervals for work productivity and activities of daily living.</p><p>Multivariate analyses were undertaken with Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods in WinBUGs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-ijwh-4-271">13</xref> to obtain estimates of the impact of treatment on work productivity and activities of daily living impairment at visit 7 (day 84) and visit 11 (end of treatment) using pooled data from the two Phase III HMB studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of E<sub>2</sub>V/DNG in the US/Canadian and European/Australian setting.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-ijwh-4-271">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-ijwh-4-271">11</xref> Impairment of both work productivity and activities of daily living at day 84 and at end of treatment served as dependent variables within the model. Relevant covariates were chosen in a stepwise approach to improve model convergence and provide the best model fit for the observed data, measured using the deviance information criterion.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-ijwh-4-271">14</xref> Relevant variables included in the model were race, education level, standardized blood loss at baseline, baseline global Psychological General Well-Being Index score, treatment arm, and country-specific random effects. The robustness of the findings was tested using different distributional assumptions; both normal and gamma distribution was assumed for the work productivity and activities of daily living impairment variables.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-ijwh-4-271">15</xref> Country-specific work productivity and impairment in activities of daily living were then estimated at day 84 and 196 (end of treatment) using the distributional assumption that resulted in a minimum deviance information criterion. The actual baseline work productivity and activities of daily living impairment values were used because the variables available in the clinical trial lacked predictive power.</p><p>Consistent with the WPAI scoring manual,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-ijwh-4-271">12</xref> a direct relationship was assumed between work productivity or activities of daily living and the Likert Scale response from 0 to 10 in the calculation of the impairment value. For example, a response of 1 on the Likert Scale was assumed to be equivalent to a 10% productivity reduction or impairment in activities of daily living, and a response of 9 was assumed to be equivalent to a 90% productivity reduction or impairment in the activities of daily living. An individual reporting work productivity or activities of daily living of 3 at baseline and 2 at the end of treatment thus had a 10% point improvement in work productivity or impairment in activities of daily living.</p><p>Average weekly salary data in a given country were used to provide a common reference point for all countries. However, it was understood that due to the nature of HMB, the weekly estimate would have a monetary impact equivalent to a month&#x02019;s impact. Where only hourly average salary data were available, an estimate was obtained by assuming a 40-hour work week.</p><p>Patients were also asked to record the duration of their bleeding during each cycle. The average number of days with bleeding per month pooled across the two Phase III studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of E<sub>2</sub>V/DNG in the US/Canadian and European/Australian settings were calculated (over the 3-month efficacy period) as 6.9 at baseline and 5.5 at the end of treatment.</p><p>The monetary value associated with work productivity and activities of daily living at baseline was calculated by multiplying the mean salary (obtained from the International Labor Organization [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ilo.org">http://www.ilo.org</ext-link>] statistics) by the mean impairment based on the mWPAI response and mean duration of bleeding to obtain the monthly estimate, separately for the E<sub>2</sub>V/DNG and placebo groups. The monthly monetary estimate of work productivity and activities of daily living was again calculated at the end of treatment using the same method. The gain in work productivity and activities of daily living, in monetary terms, was thus the difference between baseline and end of treatment in each treatment group.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Clinical outcomes</title><p>The clinical outcomes of this study have been published in full elsewhere.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-ijwh-4-271">10</xref> In brief, 108 and 62 women in the E<sub>2</sub>V/DNG treatment and placebo groups, respectively, were included in the analysis (excluding those subjects with missing data). Of these, a significantly higher proportion of women in the E<sub>2</sub>V/DNG group (44; 40.7%) had a complete response to treatment (ie, a return to &#x0201c;menstrual normality&#x0201d;) compared with women in the placebo group (1; 1.6%; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-ijwh-4-271">10</xref> During the 90-day efficacy period, mean menstrual blood loss in the E<sub>2</sub>V/DNG group was reduced by 458.4 &#x000b1; 409.6 mL compared with baseline, whereas the reduction in the placebo group was 93.2 &#x000b1; 268.0 mL; adjusted between-treatment difference in volume of menstrual blood loss was 373 mL lower in the E<sub>2</sub>V/DNG group (95% confidence interval 490&#x02013;255 mL; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001). The marked decline in menstrual blood loss with E<sub>2</sub>V/DNG, already apparent after cycle 1, was accompanied by significant improvements in hemoglobin, hematocrit, and serum ferritin concentrations.</p></sec><sec><title>Work productivity and activities of daily living</title><p>Baseline work productivity and impairment in activities of daily living varied considerably across countries; work productivity impairment ranged from 18% in Sweden to 73% in Poland (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ijwh-4-271">Figure 1</xref>, where 1 on the Likert Scale was assumed to be equivalent to a 10% impairment value), whereas impairment in activities of daily living ranged from 30% in the UK to 65% in Poland (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijwh-4-271">Figure 2</xref>). Consistent with greater improvement in underlying symptoms with E<sub>2</sub>V/DNG treatment, improvements from baseline to the end of treatment were observed in all countries in work productivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ijwh-4-271">Figure 1</xref>) and activities of daily living (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijwh-4-271">Figure 2</xref>) to a greater extent in the E<sub>2</sub>V/DNG group. End of treatment reduction in impairment of work productivity ranged from 14% in Sweden to 32% in Poland, and activities of daily living levels ranged from 14% in Sweden to 28% in Poland. Variations across the countries in terms of percentage improvement in work productivity and activities of daily living in both treatment groups are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-ijwh-4-271">Table 1</xref>. Across all the countries, E<sub>2</sub>V/DNG treatment improved work productivity and activities of daily living from baseline to the end of treatment to a greater extent than placebo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijwh-4-271">Figure 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Monetary outcomes</title><p>Monthly monetary gains (or savings) in work productivity and activities of daily living (in purchasing power parity US$, 2008)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-ijwh-4-271">16</xref> resulting from treatment of HMB with E<sub>2</sub>V/DNG are presented (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-ijwh-4-271">Table 2</xref>).

Based on data from a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase III trial, the results demonstrate that E<sub>2</sub>V/DNG has a consistent, significant, and positive impact on work productivity and activities of daily living across the countries assessed. In many of the countries, the improvement in work productivity and activities of daily living from baseline to end of treatment was found to exceed 50% for both outcomes.</p><p>Furthermore, this study shows that there is a substantial burden associated with HMB, in that productivity loss and impairment in activities of daily living at baseline (ie, pretreatment) consistently reached the 35%&#x02013;45% range (100% denoting complete productivity loss or activities of daily living impairment), with the highest country-specific average at almost 75%. This finding is consistent with previous research indicating high burden levels associated with HMB, based primarily on US women. On a per patient basis, annual lost productivity due to HMB and/or &#x0201c;dysfunctional uterine bleeding&#x0201d;, encompassing the value of lost income and lost household activities, has been estimated to be $2291 per affected woman in the USA.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-ijwh-4-271">17</xref> In addition, there is also productivity loss associated with missed school or curtailed educational pursuits. Nonetheless, indirect cost data associated with absenteeism or presenteeism specific to education (as opposed to employment) are lacking and constitute a gap in current HMB research.</p><p>The episodic nature of HMB and the fact that the disease affects women who are active participants in the labor force requires a broader approach to evaluating the burden of HMB than simply examining its clinical characteristics, treatment, and costs of medical care. Although clinical aspects of the disease will remain important, the high impact of HMB on productivity outcomes documented in our findings underscores the need to incorporate measures of productivity loss in the evaluation of health care interventions for HMB. Clear documentation of improvements in productivity outcomes associated with new therapeutic options should, therefore, be considered important from the public health perspective.</p><p>Available data have demonstrated that successful treatment of HMB increases participation in the labor force and decreases work absenteeism.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-ijwh-4-271">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-ijwh-4-271">23</xref> Although not directly assessed, the available data from our study would be indicative of increased participation in the labor force and decreased work absenteeism with E<sub>2</sub>V/DNG treatment relative to placebo. Treatment with E<sub>2</sub>V/DNG was associated with at least a 34% improvement in the HMB-related monetary burden in work productivity and activities of daily living compared with placebo. Although both E<sub>2</sub>V/DNG and placebo were associated with monthly gains greater than at baseline, the monthly gains associated with the E<sub>2</sub>V/DNG treatment arm were greater than those in the placebo group. Our data suggest that treating HMB with E<sub>2</sub>V/DNG may be beneficial to society through enhanced work productivity and reduced economic losses.</p><p>A strength of our study was that the analysis drew upon data collected prospectively during a randomized clinical trial. Randomized trials are generally accepted as the gold standard in determining treatment effect because they provide the least biased evidence.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-ijwh-4-271">24</xref> In addition, although some of the individual countries had small sample sizes which could lead to high uncertainty regarding country-specific estimates of work productivity and activities of daily living, bootstrap and Bayesian methods were used to provide more reliable estimates. However, a limitation of clinical trials is that they usually recruit a narrowly defined patient population, and as such, may not be applicable to the general population of women with HMB in actual clinical practice.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-ijwh-4-271">25</xref></p><p>In summary, our results show that E<sub>2</sub>V/DNG treatment improves work productivity and activities of daily living in European and Australian women with HMB without underlying organic pathology to a greater extent than placebo. The greater improvements in work productivity and activities of daily living with E<sub>2</sub>V/DNG treatment are also consistent with the greater response to treatment achieved over placebo. However, observational studies in women with self-reported HMB (as opposed to clinical trials assessing HMB confirmed with objective measures) are needed to confirm our findings in the real-world setting.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1-ijwh-4-271"><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>This study was funded by Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals, Berlin, Germany, the manufacturer of E<sub>2</sub>V/DNG.
