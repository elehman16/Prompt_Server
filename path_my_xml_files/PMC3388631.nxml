However, there are significant gaps in the implementation of 'best-care' practices in non-academic hospitals, where a majority of critically ill patients are managed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Scales and colleagues conducted a cluster randomized trial to examine the effectiveness of a multi-faceted quality intervention approach, targeting community intensive care units (ICUs) to improve adoption of six evidence-based care practices over time. Fifteen ICUs were randomized to two groups, which were studied over a twelve month period and divided into three study phases. During each phase, one group of ICUs actively received quality improvement (QI) interventions targeting one particular best care practice, and simultaneously served as the control for the paired group of ICUs receiving interventions targeting another evidence-based practice. The odds ratio of improvement over time was calculated for each practice, in both the active and control group, and reported as ratio of the odds ratio over time. The summary ratio of ORs for all practices indicated greater adoption of evidence-based practices in intervention ICUs than controls.</p><p>The greatest strength of the study lies in its sophisticated design and analysis. The trial had a pragmatic approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], using easy to monitor process measures rather than clinical outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], and targeting community ICUs, which face immense challenges in implementation of evidence-based practices. Furthermore, the design facilitated the delivery of quality measures to every ICU by having an 'active control' model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], thereby enhancing individual participation and motivation. A broad range of quality improvement measures were instituted, targeting diverse evidence-based practices.</p><p>The main limitation of the study is exposed by the lack of substantial improvement in rates of adoption over time for most practices, despite delivery of a comprehensive quality improvement package. This may be due to high rates of baseline adherence for most process-of-care measures studied. Furthermore, the study showed an improved delivery of interventions to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia and catheter-related blood stream infections in the intervention group compared to the control group ICUs. However, the control ICUs had high baseline adherence rates for both practices. Thus a ceiling effect in the control group may have partially explained the comparatively high rate of change over time in the intervention group. Additionally, the basis for a positive trend in adoption rates in control ICUs also remains in question. One wonders whether increased embracement of evidence-based practices, particularly in the control group, was simply related to being observed in the study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], or whether interventions targeting one practice had beneficial 'cross-over effects' on adoption of other diverse practices. Finally, the strategies chosen to accomplish behavior change are known to generally exert only modest effects on clinicians' behavior.</p></sec><sec><title>Recommendation</title><p>Moving forward, the study offers new insight to accomplish meaningful quality improvement in the community setting. Although the telecommunication network proved to be a crucial tool in delivery of QI interventions, many frontline clinicians identified relatively easy-to-implement approaches, such as regular audit and feedback, and 'friendly inter-ICU competition', to improve outcomes over time. An important area of future research may be to explore whether more potent behavioral interventions, such as changing default plans of care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and including forced reminders, result in larger effects that are sustainable over time. This methodically sound study has created a benchmark for future quality improvement research.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="B1"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Samama</surname><given-names>MM</given-names></name><name><surname>Cohen</surname><given-names>AT</given-names></name><name><surname>Darmon</surname><given-names>JY</given-names></name><name><surname>Desjardins</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Eldor</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Janbon</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Leizorovicz</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Nguyen</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Olsson</surname><given-names>CG</given-names></name><name><surname>Turpie</surname><given-names>AG</given-names></name><name><surname>Weisslinger</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><article-title>A comparison of enoxaparin with placebo for the prevention of venous thromboembolism in acutely ill medical patients.
