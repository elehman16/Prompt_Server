Chronic subacute inflammation is associated with obesity, insulin resistance and T2D, and atherosclerosis (reviewed by Shoelson et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] and Libby [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]). Anti-inflammatory salicylates, which inhibit the nuclear factor (NF)-&#x003ba;B signaling pathway, are being studied as a potential new class of drugs for the treatment of these disorders, and recent studies have shown that targeting inflammation with salsalate can improve glycemia in patients with obesity and T2D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>).</p><p>Diabetes exerts its proatherogenic actions in part by disturbing endothelial homeostasis. Endothelium-dependent vasodilation, a marker of atherosclerosis, is impaired in patients with atherosclerotic risk factors, including diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Endothelial function in peripheral conduit arteries reflects function in the human coronary circulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>), and impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation predicts cardiovascular events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Flow-mediated, endothelium-dependent dilation (FMD) can be quantitated as an index of vasomotor function, and the noninvasive nature of the technique permits repeated measurements over time to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions that may affect vascular health. Thus, we sought to test the hypothesis that targeting inflammation will improve endothelial function. We evaluated FMD as an informative surrogate marker of cardiovascular health following a therapeutic trial of salsalate, a novel agent being evaluated to treat T2D.</p><sec id="s1"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><sec id="s2"><title>Trial design</title><p>The Targeting Inflammation Using Salsalate in Type 2 Diabetes (TINSAL-T2D) stage 2 trial was conducted as a single-mask lead-in, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical trial. In brief, the protocol, approved by human subject institutional review boards at each institution, included 1 week of screening; a 4-week, single-masked placebo run-in; a baseline evaluation before treatment; and a 48-week treatment period, with computer-generated (1:1) randomized allocation to salsalate (3.5 g/day divided) or a placebo that appeared identical, as described in detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Inclusion criteria included T2D, age 18 to 75 years, and HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels of 7&#x02013;9.5% (53&#x02013;80 mmol/mol) at screening. Concomitant oral diabetes medication had to be at stable dosages for at least the previous 8 weeks. Patients who received low-dose aspirin (81&#x02013;325 mg/day) also were eligible for the trial. Key exclusion criteria included use of thiazolidinediones, insulin, or glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists; chronic use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, anticoagulants, or uricosuric agents; and impaired renal function with an estimated glomerular filtration rate &#x0003c;60 mL/min and/or urinary albumin &#x0003e;300 &#x000b5;g/mg creatinine. The Effect of Targeting Inflammation Using Salsalate on Flow-Mediated Dilation (TINSAL-FMD) was conducted as an ancillary study to the parent trial. Seven academic sites within the United States participated in the ancillary study. The protocol was approved by the human subject institutional review boards at each institution.</p><p>Vascular function studies were performed at baseline (visit 3, week 0) before randomization; at 3 months (visit 7, week 12); and at 6 months (visit 9, week 24). All nitric oxide potentiating drugs (e.g., phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors) were suspended for 1 week, and all antihypertensive and vasoactive drugs, alcohol, and caffeine were held for at least 12 h before vascular function measurements.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Central training and FMD methods</title><p>Endothelial function was determined in accordance with published guidelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). All sites received central training and underwent certification procedures to establish a uniform methodology. Each of the sites submitted to the core imaging laboratory sample images acquired from at least three volunteers for review to demonstrate the site&#x02019;s ability to acquire technically adequate images for interpretation before any research subject was enrolled at the site. All sites had ultrasound equipment capable of simultaneous B-mode and electrocardiographic monitoring, with an electrocardiographic trigger, DICOM file storage capacity, a Hokanson SC5 (or equivalent 6- &#x000d7; 83-cm) blood pressure cuff with a manual cuff inflator, and an automatic blood pressure monitor. Subjects were studied in a quiet, temperature-controlled, dimly lit room after resting supine for a minimum of 5 min. High-resolution B-mode ultrasonography of the brachial artery was performed using a 7.5-MHz linear array probe. The brachial artery was imaged longitudinally just proximal to the antecubital fossa with the transducer position adjusted to obtain optimal images of the near and far wall of the intima. The R wave on the electrocardiogram served as a trigger to acquire digitized image frames at end diastole. After acquiring a baseline image, a sphygmomanometric cuff placed on the upper portion of the arm was inflated to suprasystolic pressure (200 mmHg) for 5 min. When the cuff is released, reactive hyperemia causes flow to increase through the brachial artery subserving the forearm. The velocity time integral was assessed by pulse Doppler within 15 s of cuff release to assess the peak velocity of hyperemic blood flow. FMD of the brachial artery was determined with images acquired 1 min after cuff deflation. FMD at this time point is largely endothelium-dependent and mediated by nitric oxide, and it can be inhibited by administration of the nitric oxide synthase antagonist N<sup>G</sup>-monomethyl-<sc>l</sc>-arginine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Ten minutes after release of the cuff, the brachial artery was re-imaged to ensure a return to basal conditions. Then, to determine nitroglycerin-mediated endothelium-independent vasodilation (NMD), subjects received sublingually 0.4 mg of nitroglycerin. The brachial artery was imaged 3 min later. Nitroglycerin was not administered if the systolic blood pressure was &#x0003c;100 mmHg. All images were analyzed at a central core laboratory by a single reader masked to treatment assignment. In the core laboratory, the intraobserver (operator) variability is 0 &#x000b1; 0.15%. Arterial diameter during each experimental condition was measured using edge detection software (Brachial Analyzer for Research, version 5.8.9 SP-2; Medical Imaging Applications LLC, Coralville, IA).</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Primary and secondary outcomes</title><p>The primary outcome of this study was the change in FMD from baseline to 6-month follow-up in the group treated with salsalate compared with the group treated with placebo.

Accordingly, based on an anticipated improvement of 25% in flow-mediated endothelium-dependent vasodilation in the group treated with salsalate compared with the group treated with placebo at 6 months and an estimated standard deviation of the mean change from baseline of 3.0%, we estimated that a total of 72 completed participants would be necessary for this study.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s7"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s8"><title>Baseline characteristics</title><p>Baseline characteristics of TINSAL-T2D subjects participating in the TINSAL-FMD ancillary study were balanced between the salsalate and placebo groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).

In this study we evaluated salsalate administered over 6 months at a dose that is tolerated by the majority of patients and is under evaluation for therapeutic use in the treatment of T2D. Both HbA<sub>1c</sub> and fasting glucose were lowered in the group treated with salsalate compared with the group treated with placebo, demonstrating the positive effects of salsalate on glycemia. The anti-inflammatory effects of salsalate also were evident in the lower circulating total WBC and lymphocyte counts in the group treated with salsalate, even though there was no difference in the change in CRP between groups. Potentially adverse effects on lipids and renal function were seen. Salsalate treatment increased total and LDL cholesterol but did not affect HDL; it also increased urinary albumin, albeit without changing estimates of the glomerular filtration rate.</p><p>There are several potential explanations for our findings that neither support nor refute the findings that NF-&#x003ba;B expression and/or activity are increased in the endothelium of people who are resistant to insulin, with differential effects in patients with and without diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). First, salicylate levels achieved at the tolerable doses of salsalate used in this study may have minimal or no effect on endothelial function in people with established T2D. In a report by Pierce and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>), salsalate administered to overweight patients at higher doses (4.5 g/day) over 4 days increased the inhibition of NF-&#x003ba;B expression, reduced nuclear expression of NF-&#x003ba;B in endothelial cells, and improved endothelial function. However, these higher doses of salsalate are poorly tolerated and would not be feasible for extended administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). In addition, the positive effect of salsalate on endothelial function that was demonstrated following short-term exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>) may not be sustained.</p><p>Second, the participants in the TINSAL-FMD ancillary study had a higher disease index compared with the participants in the parent TINSAL-T2D study; this was manifest in the greater use of dual therapy and sulfonylureas at baseline to manage diabetes and statins and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers to manage lipids and hypertension, respectively. It is possible that targeting inflammation with salsalate has few additional beneficial effects on endothelial function in advanced disease or when added to lipid-lowering and antihypertensive therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Indeed, we recently found that salsalate did not change endothelial function, as assessed by peripheral arterial tonography, in patients with prediabetes, many of whom also were taking therapies to lower lipids and blood pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). Third, confounding effects of salsalate on lipids and renal function may mitigate any improvements in endothelial function derived from salsalate such that the net effect is neutral. The mechanisms of increased LDL cholesterol and urinary albumin remain unknown. It is interesting that increased LDL concentrations have been observed with several classes of anti-inflammatory agents, including inhibition of TNF-&#x003b1; and interleukin (IL)-6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). High circulating WBC counts occur in patients with obesity and the metabolic syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>) and predict incident T2D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>) and cardiovascular disease as well as poor outcomes in the latter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>), suggesting that reductions in the WBC count may benefit individuals with cardiometabolic risk. WBC counts are lowered by salsalate but, interestingly, not by statins. Salsalate lowered WBC counts in this study, even though the vast majority of study patients were taking statins. In contrast, salsalate had little effect on CRP levels in either the overall TINSAL-T2D trial or this FMD ancillary study, although CRP is lowered by statins. These findings are consistent with the notion that the anti-inflammatory effects of salsalate are independent from those of statins. Likewise, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are not known to lower WBC counts, thus further distinguishing these anti-inflammatory drug classes and potential mechanisms.</p><p>Diets rich in calories, animal fats, and sugars have been shown to induce a state of chronic subacute inflammation and promote dyslipidemia, fatty liver, insulin resistance, T2D, and cardiovascular disease. At the molecular level, activation of the transcription factor NF-&#x003ba;B leads to the production of multiple mediators of inflammation. Stimuli that can activate NF-&#x003ba;B in obesity can be separated into extracellular ligands, such as the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2;, and IL-6 or fatty acids binding to Toll-like receptors, and intracellular stimuli, such as endoplasmic reticulum or oxidative stress and ceramides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). These processes are associated with both T2D and increased atherosclerotic risk and thus could provide novel therapeutic targets to treat or prevent either or both processes. However, the overlap in inflammatory mechanisms driving diabetes and cardiovascular disease remains incompletely understood. The effect of NF-&#x003ba;B on the vasculature may occur through regulation of adipokines and cytokines that lead to vascular injury or by reducing insulin sensitivity within the endothelium, which normally signals the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase and Akt/protein kinase B pathway, leading to activation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase.</p><p>Multiple studies demonstrate that high-dose salicylates inhibit activity of NF-&#x003ba;B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>), which regulates transcription of numerous inflammatory mediators. Compared with aspirin, salsalate, a nonacetylated dimer of salicylate, is an equipotent inhibitor of NF-&#x003ba;B but a much weaker inhibitor of the cyclooxygenase enzymes; therefore it is not associated with an increased risk of bleeding and is clinically safer. While salicylates inhibit NF-&#x003ba;B signaling, they may have additional cellular and molecular mechanisms of action. These include inhibition of mitochondrial dehydrogenases; transcription factors other than NF-&#x003ba;B (e.g., cAMP-responsive element&#x02013;binding protein, NF of activated T cells, heat shock transcription factor-1); and cellular kinases (inhibitor of &#x003ba;B kinase-&#x003b2;, S6-kinase, p38 mitogen-activate protein kinase, ribosomal protein S6 kinase 2, Jun NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal kinase) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). Salicylate also may inhibit 11-&#x003b2;-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 in adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>) and activate AMP-activated protein kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). It is difficult to distinguish the relative in vivo contributions of these potential mechanisms.</p><p>Finally, it is difficult to determine whether salsalate should be further developed as a diabetes therapy given the mixed effects on metabolic markers of vascular health&#x02014;including glycemic improvement, increased adiponectin, and lowered WBC, triglyceride, and uric acid levels&#x02014;in the setting of increased LDL cholesterol and urinary albumin. Additional studies are underway to target inflammation using salsalate in patients with diverse diseases, including schizophrenia, anemia, myelodysplastic syndromes, spinal cord injury, polycystic ovarian syndrome, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Understanding the cardiovascular impact of medications that would be intended for chronic use is of high clinical importance, but the neutral effect on endothelium-dependent dilation is especially important given the many potential diseases that might improve with targeted inflammatory response.</p><p>In conclusion, in this study we targeted inflammation in patients with T2D using a clinically tolerable dose of salsalate over 6 months to evaluate the effect on atherosclerotic risk as assessed by a measure of endothelial function. We did not find a change, either improvement or worsening, in FMD of the brachial artery, a surrogate measure of nitric oxide bioactivity, despite lowering HbA<sub>1c</sub> and markers of inflammation. These observations suggest that either inflammation does not cause endothelial dysfunction in T2D, that salsalate does not adequately inhibit inflammation of the vasculature, or that confounding effects of salsalate mitigate favorable effects on endothelial function. Yet while there was no measurable net effect on endothelial function, anti-inflammatory interventions potentially have other favorable effects on cardiovascular outcomes by interfering with the atherosclerotic process elsewhere. At this time, however, the net effects of salsalate on vascular health, as assessed by FMD, seem to be neutral, and further study is warranted before widespread use.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><p>Clinical trial reg. no.
