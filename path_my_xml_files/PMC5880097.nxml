Optimising psychological wellbeing is a rehabilitation goal, but provision of psychological care is limited. We developed and piloted an Enhanced Psychological Care (EPC) intervention embedded within cardiac rehabilitation, aiming to test key areas of uncertainty to inform the design of a definitive randomised controlled trial (RCT) and economic evaluation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">An external pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT) randomised eight cardiac rehabilitation teams (clusters) to either usual care of cardiac rehabilitation provision (UC), or EPC in addition to UC. EPC comprised mental health care coordination and patient-led behavioural activation with nurse support. Adults eligible for cardiac rehabilitation following an acute coronary syndrome and identified with new-onset depressive symptoms during an initial nurse assessment were eligible. Measures were performed at baseline and 5- and 8-month follow-ups and compared between EPC and UC. Team and participant recruitment and retention rates, and participant outcomes (clinical events, depression, anxiety, health-related quality of life, patient experiences, and resource use) were assessed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Eight out of twenty teams were recruited and randomised<bold>.</bold> Of 614 patients screened, 55 were eligible and 29 took part (5%, 95% CI 3 to 7% of those screened), with 15 patient participants cluster randomised to EPC and 14 to UC. Nurse records revealed that 8/15 participants received the maximum number of EPC sessions offered; and 4/15 received no sessions. Seven out of fifteen EPC participants were referred to another NHS psychological service compared to none in UC. We followed up 27/29 participants at 5 months and 17/21 at 8 months. The mean difference (EPC minus UC) in depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory) at follow-up (adjusting for baseline score) was 1.7 (95% CI &#x02212;&#x02009;3.8 to 7.3; <italic>N</italic> = 26) at 5 months and 4.4 (95% CI &#x02212;&#x02009;1.4 to 10.2; <italic>N</italic> = 17) at 8 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par4">While valued by patients and nurses, organisational and workload constraints are significant barriers to EPC implementation.

Such depression is important as it is associated with worse health-related quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], greater use of unscheduled care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], increased health care costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and a doubling of risk of subsequent morbidity and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The detection and appropriate management of depression among people with CHD is a policy priority in the UK and in many other countries with well-developed health care systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par33">For most people in the UK who have experienced an ACS or have had coronary revascularisation, cardiac rehabilitation is offered by the National Health Service (NHS) as part of routine care to help people return to optimal functioning. This rehabilitation usually incorporates education, exercise and psychological support, although the exact form of the psychological support provided is not well defined in guidance documents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and remains open to interpretation by individual services. While psychological treatments, such as cognitive behavioural therapy, for example, are effective for depression in people with CHD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], very few rehabilitation services provide access specific psychological treatments part of cardiac rehabilitation. Furthermore, only a minority of rehabilitation services (18% in 2014) provide direct access to specialist psychological care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Thus, despite the availability of evidence-based interventions in primary and secondary care, the majority of people attending cardiac rehabilitation in the UK do not receive adequate treatment for depression.</p><p id="Par34">To improve access to evidence-based psychological treatment for depression among people attending cardiac rehabilitation, we developed and conducted a preliminary evaluation of a complex intervention (Enhanced Psychological Care or &#x02018;EPC&#x02019;) for delivery by cardiac rehabilitation nurses alongside routine cardiac rehabilitation. Our aim was to pilot the methods and procedures required to undertake a fully powered evaluation of the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of implementing EPC for patients with new-onset depressive symptoms using cardiac rehabilitation compared with treatment as usual [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. This paper reports on three specific objectives: to document the flow of patients through a pilot trial (i.e. study eligibility, recruitment and attrition rates); collect participant outcome data to support sample size calculations for a definitive trial; and to establish the optimal data collection methods required to support an economic evaluation. We also undertook qualitative interviews with patients and nurses recruited into the study to explore their views on the acceptability of EPC and of our study procedures. The methods and results of these interviews have been reported elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par35">The full methods employed in the CADENCE study are described in a protocol paper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par36">An external pilot cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], including the piloting of economic data collection, was undertaken. We sought to recruit and randomise eight teams (clusters) delivering a comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation programme to either the intervention (EPC) or control (usual care (UC)) arms in a 5:3 ratio. This randomisation ratio was used to ensure that sufficient nurses and patients were exposed to EPC to support the aims of the qualitative interview study.</p><p id="Par37">Randomisation was carried out by the trial statistician (FW) who was independent of the recruitment of rehabilitation teams and patient participants. The allocation sequence was determined using computer-generated random numbers. Cluster randomisation was balanced by team type (community, hospital or mixed community and hospital teams) and patient throughput at the initial cardiac rehabilitation assessment (&#x02018;low&#x02019; &#x02264;&#x02009;22 patients per month vs &#x02018;high&#x02019; &#x0003e;&#x02009;22 patients per month), the latter facilitating division into small and large teams. The cluster randomised design was essential to avoid contamination between trial arms (for example, it was deemed unrealistic that nurses trained in mental health care coordination would be expected to offer this management approach only to intervention group participants and not those in the control arm). To conceal the allocation sequence from cardiac teams, the cluster randomisation took place immediately after the last team was recruited.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Interventions tested</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Usual care (controls)</title><p id="Par38">Usual care was defined as cardiac rehabilitation, commencing at the point the patient attended a specialist cardiac rehabilitation nurse assessment clinic prior to starting a structured rehabilitation programme. The UK British Association of Cardiovascular Prevention and Rehabilitation (BACPR) publish core standards regarding the content of structured rehabilitation, which is commonly delivered in one or two sessions per week for approximately 8 weeks. Sessions last around 2 h and include structured exercise and education (e.g. managing cardiac risk factors) and psychological input (e.g. stress management and/or relaxation training). The 2012 BACPR standards [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] were in effect during this trial (new standards came into effect in 2017 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]). The 2012 standards advocated the provision of psychosocial care and routine monitoring of mood (anxiety and depression) upon referral and discharge. However, detailed guidance on how psychosocial care should be delivered is not provided. National audit data reports that psychological expertise within cardiac rehabilitation teams is uncommon (&#x0003c;&#x02009;15%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Informal discussions with mental health specialists and cardiac rehabilitation staff suggest that there is considerable variation in local cardiac team protocols across the UK, with specialist referrals to mental health services frequently resulting from clinical observation and intuition.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>EPC (treatment)</title><p id="Par39">A detailed description of the development of our EPC intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], and of the rationale and content supporting its design is reported elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Briefly, EPC was designed to be embedded within the existing cardiac rehabilitation care pathway and delivered by cardiac nurse specialists supported by an intervention manual. EPC consisted of mental health care coordination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], including an embedded participant-led behavioural activation (BA) programme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] designed to tackle depressive symptoms. Nurses were trained to apply best-practice clinical decision-making rules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], matching the intensity of treatment with participant preferences for mental health care. Nurses were also supplied with a manual to support intervention delivery.</p><p id="Par40">The nurse explained the evidence-based treatment options available to all potentially eligible patients. This included BA self-help materials supported by the nurse as part of the cardiac rehabilitation programme, and/or referrals to their general practitioner (GP), local mental health services, or referral to specific cardiac patient psychological support services where available. Nurses were trained to coordinate care while the participant attended cardiac rehabilitation by monitoring depressive symptoms, assessing risk to self or others and agreeing/reviewing any changes to the mental health care plan with participants, including onward referral to other services.</p><p id="Par41">All participants were also offered nurse-supported self-help using a participant BA handbook. The handbook consisted of a structured programme designed to support participants in re-engaging with sources of positive reinforcement from their environment and to develop future strategies for managing their depressive symptoms. A functional analytical approach was adopted, with the handbook designed to help participants develop an understanding of behaviours that interfere with meaningful, goal-oriented behaviours. By teaching the participant to self-monitor mood, individuals were shown how to identify patterns of behaviour associated with their depression. Participants were then encouraged to develop alternative behaviours which were goal-orientated, targeting routine, pleasurable and necessary activities and using diaries to plan these behaviours into daily schedules.</p><p id="Par42">Although our pilot intervention involved a participant-led, self-help BA handbook, nurses were trained to actively support participants. A 2-day training course was delivered by experienced mental health practitioners, during which nurses were trained in key techniques of mental health care coordination, managing safety and risks, and BA. Supported by an intervention manual, nurses were also provided with a session by session guide, detailing the types of coordination actives required as participants moved through their 6&#x02013;8-week cardiac rehabilitation programme (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1). This guide was flexible to accommodate participant preferences for care. Nurses delivering EPC to participants also received bi-weekly clinical supervision by an experienced mental health practitioner over the telephone.</p><p id="Par43">On completion of their cardiac rehabilitation programme, nurses were required to send structured details of the mental health care that they had delivered to the participant to the participant&#x02019;s GP. All participants, including those receiving BA and whose depressive symptoms do not respond, were given an opportunity to review their management options with the nurse. Here, treatment response was defined as achieving a minimally clinical important difference (MCID) for the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) equivalent to a 5-point reduction in score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. It was expected that some people who achieved this MCID remained above the PHQ-9 diagnostic threshold (&#x02265;&#x02009;10) for depression; as part of their care coordination, these individuals were referred for continuing mental health management upon discharge from cardiac rehabilitation services.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Settings and study population</title><p id="Par44">We aimed to recruit and randomise eight cardiac rehabilitation teams. We wrote to the lead nurse in each of the 20 operationally distinct teams in South West England, providing detailed information about the study and inviting participation. Each team expressing an interest received a briefing visit, where the trial design and methods were explained by a researcher, and the staff were given an opportunity to ask questions before being asked to provide written consent to participate. All teams agreeing to participate received training in study procedures. Nurses in teams allocated to the EPC intervention arm received EPC training before participant recruitment began.</p><sec id="Sec8"><title>Participant eligibility criteria</title><p id="Par45">Nurses were trained to apply a structured checklist to ascertain participant eligibility. All adult patients (aged 18 years or over) referred for cardiac rehabilitation based on local clinical referral protocols were screened for eligibility. The sample comprised individuals previously admitted with an acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina, non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (MI) or ST-elevation MI) and/or following a coronary revascularisation procedure (percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), CABG), with or without heart failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p id="Par46">Patients were routinely screened for depressive symptoms using the nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], with individuals scoring 10 or more deemed potentially eligible for inclusion. Patients were excluded if they reported active treatment for depression (psychological or drug therapy) within the previous 6 months. Individuals were also excluded where there was evidence of alcohol or drug dependency, active suicidal intention or having poorly controlled bipolar disorder or psychosis/psychotic symptoms based on a clinical review. Although no language exclusions were applied, we anticipated that the majority of patients would require sufficiently good English language skills to engage with the manual-based EPC intervention, with NHS translation services employed if needed.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Patient participant recruitment procedure</title><p id="Par47">Eligible participants were invited to take part by a nurse during their initial clinic appointment (prior to commencing a structured rehabilitation programme), and given a brief study sheet to take away and review. The nurse also gained permission to pass the individual&#x02019;s contact details on to the research team. A researcher then contacted the patient within 7 days to discuss participation and provide them with a detailed Participant Information Sheet. The researcher arranged a visit to obtain written consent and to undertake the baseline trial assessment before the participant commenced the structured rehabilitation programme. Participants were informed that trial participation was voluntary, and that they could withdraw from the study at any time without reason, and that withdrawing would not affect their ongoing clinical care in any way.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Sample size</title><p id="Par48">Using UK national audit data (2010&#x02013;2011), 55,452 patients (for MI, PCI, CABG) engaged in cardiac rehabilitation with one of 280 teams (an average of 200 patients per team per year). Assuming that 17% had depressive symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], this equated to 35 eligible patients per team each year. Establishing participant eligibility and consent rates were key goals of this pilot study as there was no applicable UK data employing a cluster RCT design. For planning purposes we assumed a participation rate of 50%, aiming to recruit 64 patients through the eight teams in 6 months; this target was subsequently amended to 47 participants on completion of a feasibility study (which preceded the pilot trial), which identified that unless the participant recruitment period was extended beyond 6 months, we would be unlikely to achieve our initial target (full details are described elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]). This sample size is sufficient to estimate a follow-up percentage as low as 50% with margin of error &#x000b1;&#x02009;15% based on the width of the 95% confidence interval (CI), and as high as 90% with a margin of error of &#x000b1;&#x02009;13% based on the lower bound of the 95% CI. We did not estimate the intra-cluster (intra-CR team) correlation coefficients (ICC) for key outcomes as the pilot sample was small and estimates would have been imprecise. Using national audit data available during the planning phases of this research (2010&#x02013;2011; 6272 patients; 119 cardiac rehabilitation teams), we estimated the ICC for depression measured using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] to be 0.047 (95% CI, 0.034 to 0.062).

A preliminary assessment of the cost of providing EPC within cardiac rehabilitation was undertaken. Service-use data were extracted by researchers from routine/administrative sources (e.g. cardiac nurse records, GP records) and participant self-report using the Service and Resource Use Questionnaire (SRUQ). The SRUQ was adapted from the Client Services Receipt Inventory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>], with input from our lay advisors.

Team size and throughput varied considerably, with teams comprised of between one and seven cardiac nurses working either part-time or full-time, and providing care for between 12 and 70 patients per month. Most of the teams offered centre-based programmes either in the community and/or at the hospital, clinic-based individual appointments and home-based programmes with one team offering only centre-based programmes. The majority of teams were in urban and rural settings, with only two teams serving inner-city patient populations. The three UC teams had no access to psychological support integrated within their cardiac rehabilitation programme, although one team reported having limited access to a clinical psychologist. Three of the EPC teams had little or no access to psychological support; the other two EPC teams, located in inner city areas, had established close links to the clinical psychology and community mental health services.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Characteristics of participating sites at baseline</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Team</th><th>Allocation</th><th>Team location (setting)</th><th>Cardiac team clinical staffing</th><th>Type of cardiac rehabilitation programme offered (including usual psychological care<sup>a</sup>)</th><th><italic>N</italic> patients assessed per month<sup>b</sup></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>A</td><td>UC</td><td>Hospital (rural)</td><td>7 nurses (2 full-time; 5 part-time)</td><td>Centre-based groups, Clinic-based individual appointments, Home-based programmes</td><td>40</td></tr><tr><td>B</td><td>UC</td><td>Community (rural)</td><td>7 nurses (1 full-time; 6 part-time)</td><td>Centre-based groups &#x02013; with some support from a clinical psychologist, Clinic-based individual appointments,&#x000a0;Home-based programmes</td><td>60</td></tr><tr><td>C</td><td>UC</td><td>Community (rural)</td><td>3 nurses (part-time),&#x000a0;1 team manager (part-time)</td><td>Centre-based groups</td><td>12&#x02013;16</td></tr><tr><td>D</td><td>EPC</td><td>Community (rural/urban)</td><td>2 nurses (1 full-time; 1 part-time)</td><td>Centre-based groups,&#x000a0;Clinic-based individual appointments,&#x000a0;Home-based programmes</td><td>26</td></tr><tr><td>E</td><td>EPC</td><td>Hospital (rural/urban)</td><td>2 nurses (part-time)</td><td>Centre-based groups,&#x000a0;Clinic-based individual appointments,&#x000a0;Home-based programmes</td><td>70</td></tr><tr><td>F</td><td>EPC</td><td>Mixed hospital + community (urban)</td><td>1 nurse (part-time)</td><td>Centre-based groups,&#x000a0;Clinic-based individual appointments,&#x000a0;Home-based programmes</td><td>32</td></tr><tr><td>G</td><td>EPC</td><td>Mixed hospital + community (inner-city)</td><td>4 nurses (part-time)</td><td>Centre-based groups &#x02013; limited psychological input via referral to community mental health workers,&#x000a0;Clinic-based individual appointments,&#x000a0;Home-based programmes</td><td>33</td></tr><tr><td>H</td><td>EPC</td><td>Mixed hospital + community (inner-city)</td><td>6 nurses (part-time)</td><td>Centre-based groups,&#x000a0;Clinic-based individual appointments &#x02013; part-time clinical psychologist linked to team,&#x000a0;Home-based programmes</td><td>50&#x02013;60</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><italic>EPC</italic> Enhanced Psychological Care, <italic>UC</italic> usual care</p><p><sup>a</sup>Unless stated there is no dedicated psychological support available (either within the team, or through an established referral pathway)</p><p><sup>b</sup>Data derived from the team profile questionnaire completed prior to randomisation.

For example, here the initial nurse training costs account for a significant proportion of the overall cost of providing EPC, and the relative contribution to the cost per patient will reduce as a larger number of patients receiving EPC over a longer period. The estimated time that nurses take to deliver EPC elements within rehabilitation accounts for a relatively small amount of the overall cost (&#x000a3;63 of the estimated &#x000a3;959 per participant).</p><p id="Par87">Participants self-reported service use in the time periods (baseline to 5 months, and 5 months to 8 months).

For the 17 participants with data from both sources, we calculated the level of agreement for the number of GPs or practice nurses visits, emergency department visits and inpatient hospital admissions (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S6). The lowest agreement was observed for the number of visits to GPs or practice nurses, with no participants recalling the same number of GP visits as recorded in GP notes, and only 3/17 (18%) of participants recalling the same number of practice nurse visits. In contrast, 11/17 (65%) participants recalled the same number of emergency department attendances as their GP records show, and 14/17 (82%) of participants recalled the same number of hospital inpatient stays. While the crude agreement was variable for all four types of health service use there seems to be no systematic tendency to either over-estimate or under-estimate service usage. For example, while crude agreement between sources was poor for GP visits, the mean number of GP visits was the same whether calculated from self-report or GP records data.</p><p id="Par90">Cardiac nurse notes only consistently recorded the use of hospital services and thus the level of agreement could only be estimated for the number of hospital admissions reported by participants and nurse records. The crude agreement was high (15/17; 88%) between participant reports and nurse records of inpatient stays for the 8-month follow-up period. The mean (SD) number of self-reported hospital admissions was 0.5 (0.9) compared with 0.3 (0.6) as recorded in nurse notes (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.55).

In addition, we undertook a case note review of cardiac nurse and GP notes. A review of these procedures suggested that a future trial might require capture of data from case note review of cardiology records for some domains. Collection of BDI-II data proved satisfactory with only minimal missing data. Although the number of patients completing the 8-month follow-up was small, we were able to estimate the distribution of BDI-II scores, and investigate several approaches to calculate treatment effects for depression status at follow-up. We were also able to show that an adequately powered definitive cluster RCT would be challenging. The National Audit of Cardiac Rehabilitation identified 266 cardiac rehabilitation teams in England in 2013&#x02013;2014 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Our sample size calculations estimated that a definitive RCT would be required to recruit 50 cardiac teams and 650 participants (recruiting for 18 months) to detect a clinically meaningful difference in depression severity (BDI-II) between EPC and UC arms.</p><p id="Par94">In undertaking our economic evaluation, relevant data were captured with a view to identifying costs across the whole system of care. Service-use data were collected from routine and administrative sources, as well as via participant self-report. We encountered challenges in identifying time spent by nurses in delivering EPC since this was distributed across all of the nurse interactions with the patient rather than in discrete, quantifiable periods of consultation time. Our study found some evidence to support the use of self-report service-use data, particularly regarding recall of emergency department attendance, hospital admission and GP attendance. Although intensive, requiring considerable researcher effort, our data capture processes appeared satisfactory.</p><p id="Par95">The findings from a nested qualitative study have been reported elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], the core findings of which are summarised here. Some patients who might have benefitted from EPC did not attend subsequent cardiac rehabilitation sessions. In addition, some eligible patients were not offered EPC because of nurse workload. Some patients chose not to take part in the trial, reporting that they did not identify themselves as experiencing &#x02018;low mood&#x02019;, or did not wish to receive more information relating to their cardiac event. EPC participants, however, viewed one-to-one dedicated nurse time addressing psychological issues as important in helping them achieve timely recovery from their depression. In addition, some patients identified and valued the holistic approach to care. Despite this, it was clear that explanation of BA as a key component of EPC was needed, and that approaches to delivering the intervention need to be tailored to the needs of the individual.</p><p id="Par96">Qualitative interviews with nurses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] revealed that they felt equipped to deliver the EPC intervention, and valued training in mental health care coordination and mental health risk assessment, particularly in respect of the use of the PHQ-9 instrument during their initial screening appointment. While participating nurses were generally supportive of the study, it was evident that accommodating EPC within the context of their existing workload proved extremely challenging and ultimately unsustainable; this has the potential to undermine the viability of any future trial.</p><sec id="Sec29"><title>Strengths and weaknesses</title><p id="Par97">This external pilot study benefitted from a multi-methods approach, adopted to address clear and pre-specified research aims. We successfully developed and delivered an intervention providing EPC to patients who were depressed following an acute cardiac event, and who were attending a cardiac rehabilitation programme. Nested qualitative data found the intervention to be broadly acceptable to patients, and was welcomed by patients as reflecting a holistic approach to their care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The intervention was developed by experts in the field and supported by the development of two manuals, targeting nurses and patients. Nurse-participants welcomed the opportunity of extending their clinical expertise, particularly in gaining confidence around the risk assessment of the psychological status of patients attending cardiac rehabilitation.</p><p id="Par98">We successfully recruited cardiac rehabilitation teams and depressed participants being managed by these teams to the pilot study, although we were unable to meet recruitment targets, largely because of nurse-participant workload limiting nurses&#x02019; ability to accommodate the intervention within routine care, combined with a lower than anticipated rate of eligible and consenting patients.</p><p id="Par99">In line with the original commissioning brief, our intention was to recruit patients who had evidence of new-onset depression occurring since the cardiac event, and as a result approximately a quarter of all patients identified with depressive symptoms during screening were excluded due to being actively treated for depression in the previous 6 months. While having an obvious impact on the sample size available for recruitment, it also possible that patients with pre-existing depression might also benefit from improved access to psychological care in cardiac rehabilitation settings, although this remains untested in our research.</p><p id="Par100">Selection bias is a known feature of cluster randomised trials where participants are recruited after clusters have been randomised and the recruiting clinician is not blind to the treatment allocation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]; to explore this, we compared the recruitment rates and participant characteristics at baseline between the trial arms. Recruitment rates were broadly comparable, although there was some imbalance in participant characteristics and outcomes at baseline between trial arms with EPC arm participants were younger, from more deprived areas, and with higher depression scores than UC participants. While these findings may have arisen by chance due to the small number of clusters and participants recruited into this pilot trial, the potential for selection bias remains an important design consideration for a future, definitive trial.</p><p id="Par101">Although we reported effect sizes and associated 95% CIs for between-group differences in participant-reported outcomes (including the BDI-II), as this was a pilot study we did not use analytic methods that allow for clustering as the number of clusters and participants per cluster were too small. Our results provided important new data to inform future sample size calculations; however, we do not report <italic>p</italic> values for the observed effects and the confidence intervals must be interpreted with caution due to the lack of adjustment for clustering in the data.</p><p id="Par102">We undertook follow-up of trial participants over a period of 8 months, and achieved good follow-up rates. Challenges of delayed recruitment, combined with funding constraints, meant that a small number of patients could only be followed up at our primary endpoint (5 months), rather than the full 8 months. Furthermore, we were unable to recruit patients from ethnic minority backgrounds, which potentially threatens the external validity of trial results, although the reasons why we were unable to do so were not entirely clear.</p><p id="Par103">Substantial challenges were encountered in embedding supported EPC within routine cardiac rehabilitation, even when&#x000a0;the intervention itself was largely patient-led, informed by principles of behaviour activation. Thus, while nurses and patients welcomed the focus on psychological aspects of care, workload challenges for cardiac rehabilitation nurses significantly limited the potential to effectively deliver this within the context of routine cardiac rehabilitation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Findings in context</title><p id="Par104">In 2012, Leung et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] reported the findings of a meta-analysis of 22 cohort studies investigating what timeframe around depression onset was associated with greater mortality and cardiac morbidity. Estimates of the prevalence of new-onset depression ranged from 5.5 to 27.9% and recurrent depression from 5.1 to 41.4%. The pooled analysis identified that both pre-ACS diagnosed depression and post-ACS diagnosed depression were potentially hazardous. Given this observation, excluding patients with pre-ACS depression from a future similar trial may be inappropriate.</p><p id="Par105">The recently reported COBRA trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>] identified the potential for effective psychological therapy targeting depression, such as we adopted here, to be delivered without the need for using costly and highly trained professionals. Given the key constraint of cardiac nurse workload identified in our study, embedding psychological practitioners within cardiac rehabilitation teams might better meet the mental health needs of such patients.</p><p id="Par106">While the CADENCE study was ongoing, in 2016 Blumenthal et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>] published a RCT in the US that found that providing cardiac rehabilitation enhanced by stress management training delivered by psychological practitioners was associated with significant reductions in stress and the rate of adverse clinical events when compared with standard cardiac rehabilitation alone. Thus, although not directly addressing depression, Blumenthal and colleagues&#x02019; study provides further support for the incorporation of targeted psychological support for psychologically vulnerable groups of patients in the context of cardiac rehabilitation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>Implications for future research</title><p id="Par107">While EPC is desirable, embedding our nurse-supported EPC intervention within routine cardiac rehabilitation practice is not realistic in the current UK setting. One alternative might be use dedicated psychological-wellbeing practitioners, trained in the delivery of low-intensity psychological therapies, to deliver the intervention working closely with, and preferably embedded within, routine cardiac rehabilitation services. This change in EPC intervention would require new feasibility testing prior to undertaking a full-powered trial.</p><p id="Par108">From a trial perspective, we successfully followed up patients at both 5 and 8 months. However, a future trial might consider a longer period of follow-up to allow sufficient time to accrue data on clinical events, although this would add considerably to the cost of a future trial. The BDI-II functioned effectively as an outcome for assessing the severity of depression, although consideration might be given to precisely which threshold might be implemented to secure a suitable group of patients for a future fully powered trial. Our data provide the basis for assessment of the size of a future fully powered study. It is likely that such a study would involve a cluster randomised design and include patients with pre-existing depression as well as those new-onset depression following a recent acute cardiac event. Given the observations reported here, it is likely that a future study would be considerably larger in scope; for example, potentially extending across a substantial proportion of cardiac rehabilitation teams currently operating in the UK.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec32"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par109">Cardiac rehabilitation nurses can be trained to deliver EPC. While valued by both patients and nurses, organisational and workload constraints are significant barriers to implementation. There remains a need to develop and test new models of psychological care within cardiac rehabilitation. This pilot study offers important data to inform the design and implementation of future trials of similar interventions to provide psychological care for patients with depression attending cardiac rehabilitation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional file</title><sec id="Sec33"><p>
