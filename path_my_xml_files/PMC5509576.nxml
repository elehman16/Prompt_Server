medio-lateral unstable sole on ankle muscle activation and functional ability. [Subjects
and Methods] Thirty university students without current or past ankle injuries were
assigned to either an experimental group or control group. The experimental group
participated in a balance exercise program 3 times a week over 4 weeks, which consisted of
one-leg stands and semi-squat exercises with medio-lateral unstable sole. The control
group continued with their regular life activities without participation in the program.
Electromyographic activities of peroneus longus and brevis muscles were recorded during
stair descending immediately before and after the exercise program. Functional balance was
tested with the Star Excursion Balance test immediately before and after the exercise
program. Paired t-tests were used to assess statistical significance. [Results] Activation
of peroneus longus and brevis and Star Excursion Balance Test scores in both groups did
not show a significant difference between pre- and post-exercise. [Conclusion] A future
study is suggested with increased level of medio-lateral perturbation during outcome
measurements and exercises with addition of supervision in the exercise training and home
program.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Balance exercise</kwd><kwd>Lateral ankle sprain</kwd><kwd>Medio-lateral unstable sole</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Ankle joints are weak and easily damaged due to changes in lifestyle, reduced walking as a
means for traveling, and complex movements in some activities<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Lateral ankle sprains are one of the common ankle joint
injuries<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. 10 to 50% of patients who has
experienced an ankle sprain before gets recurring sprain and experiences ongoing pain, which
can eventually lead to a chronic ankle sprain<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, about 25% of sports-related injuries involve ankle
joint problems. Rehabilitation of an ankle injury is crucial for non-athletes and athletes
to be able to resume various levels of activities<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>A previous research has proposed use of sandals for rehabilitation after ankle injuries and
before injuries as a prevention. Wearing Sandals with attached hemisphere-shaped soles are
found to increase muscle activity around the ankle joint and improve antero-posterior
stability during a variety of exercises<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.
In addition, Yang et al. reported that descending stairs with medio-lateral unstable sole
(MLUS; BTP company, Korea) in healthy subjects increased the activity of ankle evertors<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. The MLUS was modified to stimulate more
movement in the frontal plane (inversion and eversion). However, it is not clear whether
balance exercises with the MLUS helps prevent ankle sprains or could bring more stability to
the ankles. Use of MLUS in balance exercise is thought to improve the ability of the balance
of the foot and ankle muscle activity is expected to contribute to strengthening the ankle.
Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the changes in the activity of the
peroneus longus and brevis muscles and balance capabilities during 4-week balance exercise
with the MLUS.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Thirty healthy volunteers with no ankle sprain or lower extremity disorder in prior 6
months were selected. The experimental procedure was fully described to the subjects, and
was approved by the Silla University ethics committee. Subjects were randomly assigned to
either the subject exercise group (21 &#x000b1; 4.0 yrs, 166 &#x000b1; 8.8&#x02005;cm, 67 &#x000b1; 15.2&#x02005;kg) or the control
group (22 &#x000b1; 7.1 yrs, 170 &#x000b1; 6.2&#x02005;cm, 63 &#x000b1; 6.9&#x02005;kg), each containing 15 subjects. MLUS was made
in the form of sandals attached with Velcro to put under the subject&#x02019;s shoes. MLUS was
developed for the average men&#x02019;s shoe size (260&#x02005;mm) and the average female shoe size
(240&#x02005;mm). The sole was manufactured at the height of 2&#x02005;cm, breadth 3&#x02005;cm <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Muscle activity was recorded with a
multichannel electromyography Myotrace 400 (Noraxon Inc, Scottdale, AZ, USA) 25&#x02013;450&#x02005;Hz, by
specifying the notch filter to 60&#x02005;Hz and root-mean square (RMS) average interval to 300&#x02005;mm.
All data was calculated at maximal voluntary contraction percentage and measured activating
peroneus longus muscle (PL) and peroneus brevis muscle (PB) during ankle eversion<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The experimental group completed one-leg stands and semi-squats, 5 sets of 10 times over
one week at home. One leg stands were performed on the dominant leg with the sandals, and
with the eyes open and knee and hip of the non-dominant leg flexed to a comfortable
position. The semi-squat exercise was performed with the MLUS sandals about shoulder width
apart, and shoulders in 90-degree flexion. In the squat position, knees were flexed to 120
degrees and held flexed for thirty seconds, with a one-minute rest period after each of 5
sets<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. The control group maintained
daily life without any specific exercise requirements for four weeks. To investigate the
activity of the peroneus longus and brevis, subjects descended stairs immediately before and
after the exercise program with electrodes attached in their PL and PB. The participants
stood on a 27-cm-high platform with bare feet, while maintaining the spacing of both feet to
maintain balance. Subjects had to transfer their weight forward with the start of a verbal
signal and they touched the floor with right foot first and followed by the left leg.
Subjects needed to keep their balance on top of the platform. This was repeated three times.
To evaluate the dynamic stability of the ankle joint, the Star Excursion Balance Test (SEBT)
performed in bare feet. The same examiner proctored all of the tests. Immediately before and
after the exercise program, SEBT was performed with a one leg lunge on the center of a taped
floor while the opposite leg reaches as far as possible without loss of balance in line with
the tapes that points to 8 different directions: anterior, antero-medial, medial,
postero-medial, posterior, postero-lateral, lateral, and antero-lateral<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Activations of PL and PB during stair descending and
results of SEBT were analyzed with paired t-test. The significant level was set at 0.05 and
all statistical analyses were calculated by SPSS (ver. 20.0) for Windows.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p><xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Muscle activations and Star excursion balance test (SEBT) score</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="3" colspan="1"/><th colspan="3" align="center" rowspan="1">Control</th><th colspan="3" align="center" rowspan="1">Exercise</th></tr><tr><th colspan="3" rowspan="1"><hr/></th><th colspan="3" rowspan="1"><hr/></th></tr><tr><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pre</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Post</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">p</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pre</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Post</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">p</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">PL (%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8.7 &#x000b1; 24.1</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9.6 &#x000b1; 35.5</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.708</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">11.7 &#x000b1; 0.1</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">13.3 &#x000b1; 3.3</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.348</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">PB (%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10.1 &#x000b1; 24.6</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">11.0 &#x000b1; 6.4</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.201</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">12.8 &#x000b1; 41.2</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">15.1 &#x000b1; 5.4</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.518</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">SEBT 1 (cm)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">76.7 &#x000b1; 37.9</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">80.5 &#x000b1; 17.2</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.692</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">80.5 &#x000b1; 4.5</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">88.5 &#x000b1; 32.5</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.204</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">SEBT 2 (cm)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">74.1 &#x000b1; 40.2</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">75.8 &#x000b1; 15.8</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.871</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">66.4 &#x000b1; 50.9</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">83.0 &#x000b1; 30.7</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.182</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">SEBT 3 (cm)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">80.9 &#x000b1; 29.3</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">81.9 &#x000b1; 18.6</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.929</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">75.3 &#x000b1; 18.0</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">81.1 &#x000b1; 18.4</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.442</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>PL: peroneus longus; PB: peroneus brevis; SEBT 1: Anterior; SEBT 2: Posterolateral; SEBT 3: Posteromedial</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap> summarizes PL and PB muscles activation and SEBT scores. Activities of both PL

and after the exercises in the sandals with MLUS in the present study. In the previous
study, the hemisphere sandal increased activation of the PL (22.52 to 45.01%) and the PB
(27.45 to 63.03%) during a single-leg stance<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, Cha and Kim reported that anterior SEBT increased from
73.2 to 74.1&#x02005;cm in BAPS board exercise group (BEG) and from 76.5 to 77.5&#x02005;cm in the
Trampoline exercise group (TBG). Posterolateral and posteromedial SEBT also increased in BEG
and TBG<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Unlike previous studies, this
study included stair descending in addition to SEBT as outcome measurements 4-week of
balance exercise with MLUS. A future study will need to increase the level of perturbation
during outcome measurements that could further challenge the ankle joints of healthy
subjects in the medial-lateral direction. In addition, the balance exercise program with the
semi-squats and one-leg stands also require a higher level of perturbation to provide enough
challenges to healthy subjects. For a future study, including more dynamic movements such as
side stepping and side-jumping with MLUS could better stimulate PL and PB activities.</p><p>A limitation of this study is that the exercises were performed without supervision so that
the compliance and the exercise forms were not monitored. Moreover, the SEBT results may not
have shown a significant difference between before and after exercise program because
healthy subjects already have high scores. In a future study, it is suggested to include
supervision during the trainings of the exercises and specific instructions for the home
exercise program. The 4-weeks balance exercises with the MLUS showed no significant
difference between the results for the improvement of muscle activity and balance ability.
However, a future study is necessary to discover the effects of the MLUS through a long-term
training and systematic exercise program.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><person-group><name><surname>Magee</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name></person-group>: Orthopaedic physical assessment.
