Sneezing, rhinorrhoea, nasal itching and nasal congestion are among the clinical symptoms of AR. The mechanism leading to the development of symptoms associated with AR is complex, including activation and infiltration of inflammatory cells, oedema, increased and altered gland activity, nerve terminal activation, triggering of neurogenic inflammation and morphologically detectable remodelling processes in the mucous membrane<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>. Neurogenic inflammation has been known to play a role in the pathogenesis of AR<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>. Corticosteroids having anti-inflammatory effects are the essential, first-line therapy in AR patients<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>. Mometasone furoate (MF), which is a nasal spray, is an effective treatment for AR and has anti-inflammatory, anti-pruritic, anti-hyperproliferative actions<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>. In long-term use, MF appears to reduce the extent of inflammatory cell infiltration by attenuating the inflammatory process, particularly of eosinophils<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>. Activation of the central and peripheral nervous system plays a major role in the pathophysiology of itching and sneezing. Sensory nerves of the afferent trigeminal system including myelinated A&#x003b4;-fibres and thin, non-myelinated C-fibres of the nasal mucosa transmit signals that generate sensations, including itching and motor reflexes, such as sneezing<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>. Lee <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> reported that itching was not only associated with sensorial stimulation but also the perception level and they showed that strontium chloride (SC) increased the perception threshold. They suggested that strontium selectively blocked the activation of both nociceptors (A&#x003b4; and C fibre) that respond to chemical stimuli. Hahn<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> has reported that strontium salts are highly effective in reducing the sensory irritation caused by some substances and hypothesized that strontium salts directly affect the type C nerve.</p><p>We hypothesized that SC, which has a positive effect on neurogenic inflammation in AR, might be efficacious in AR treatment. In our preliminary study we found that administration of SC before and after the symptoms occur, was as effective as MF on sneezing (unpublished data). In the present study, the aim was to investigate the efficacy of SC on AR symptoms based on the duration of SC use before the symptoms begin.</p><sec id="sec1-2"><title>Material &#x00026; Methods</title><p>The study was carried out in department of Otolaryngology, Faculty of Medicine, Cumhuriyet University, Sivas, Turkey between August 2014 and September 2014; with 18, 16-18 wk old male Wistar albino rats with an average body weight of 200-220 g. The rats were housed in standard laboratory conditions (12 h light/dark cycles, 24&#x000b0;C&#x000b1;2&#x000b0;C, 35-60% humidity) and fed with standard pellet chow and water <italic>ad libitum</italic>. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review and Animal Ethics Use Committee of Cumhuriyet University School of Medicine, Sivas, Turkey, and followed the accepted guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals for research.</p><p>Wistar albino rats (n=18) were randomly divided into three groups: group 1 received 1&#x003bc;g MF; group 2 three per cent SC; and group 3 received five per cent SC (2 &#x003bc;l/site).</p><p><italic>Drug and chemicals</italic>: Histamine and SC were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA). These reagents were dissolved in saline. The following reagents were also purchased: sefiyol nasal spray (Delta Vital, &#x00130;stanbul, Turkey) and nasonex aqueous nasal spray (l8 g/140 dose, Schering- Plough, USA). The rats were given a nasal instillation of the drugs in volume of 2 &#x003bc;l into the bilateral cavities using a micropipette.</p><p><italic>Evaluation of the nasal symptoms in rats</italic>: This study was based on a mouse model of AR<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>. It has been shown that nasal administration of histamine dihydrochloride (HD) at a dose of 5 &#x003bc;mol (2 &#x003bc;l/site) significantly elicits nasal symptoms<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>. As this study was performed for the first time on rats, for rat modelling, Kusaka <italic>et al</italic>'s<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> mouse model was administered step by step. For acclimatization, animals were placed in an observation cage (30 &#x000d7; 28 &#x000d7; 20 cm) for 10 min before starting the experiment.</p><p>On the first day of the experiment, 2 &#x003bc;l of sefiyol nasal spray was administered via micropipette to each nasal passage of every rat, and nasal symptoms were counted and recorded. On the second day of the experiment, HD (2 &#x003bc;l, 5 &#x003bc;mol/site) was administered via micropipette to each nasal passage of each rat and, again, nasal symptoms were counted. Symptoms occurring on the first and second days of the experiment were compared. After approving the accuracy of mouse model of AR for rats<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, the test protocol was initiated.</p><p>In the present study, 1&#x003bc;g MF (2 &#x003bc;l/site) was applied to group 1, three per cent SC (2 &#x003bc;l/site) was applied to group 2 and five per cent SC (2 &#x003bc;l/site) was applied to group 3 with a micropipette to each nasal cavity for three weeks every morning at 0900 h. On days 7, 14 and 21, before the administration of HD (5 &#x003bc;mol, 2 &#x003bc;l, nasal instillation into bilateral cavities), the animals were placed back into the observation cage (1 animal per cage). The frequencies of nasal rubbing and sneezing were counted for 15 min. During the study, one rat each in groups 1 and 3 died on the 12<sup>th</sup> and 19<sup>th</sup> days, respectively.</p><p><italic>Statistical analysis</italic>: Data were analyzed using Statistical Package of Social Science (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for Windows version 22.0.

Clinically, allergy is characterized by symptoms that, by in large, are secondary to an altered nervous system. Sneezing and persistent itching of the nasal mucosa are distressing symptoms of AR. It has been shown that itchy sensations and sneezing reflexes can be associated with hyperinnervation of sensory neurons and/or increased expression of neuropeptides in nerve terminals<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>. Sensory nerve fibres in the nasal mucosa are afferent connections from the trigeminal nerve and these are classified into two categories, myelinated thick A&#x003b4;-fibres and non-myelinated thin C-fibres. In AR, some polymodal nociceptive type C-fibres convey itching and sneezing stimuli from the nasal mucosa<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>. Neuropeptides, such as substance P (SP) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), are expressed in trigeminal sensory fibres and have been shown to induce allergic symptoms<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>. In AR patients, nerve fibre density in the nasal epithelium, lamina propria (subepithelium) and glandular/vascular regions is also increased<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>. Therefore, allergy can be categorized as an immune-neuronal disorder<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>. The target of the current therapeutic approaches of AR treatment is the inhibition of inflammatory molecules and suppression of the immune reaction<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> through the use of anti-histamines, leukotriene antagonists and steroids. As no appropriate attention is given to the neuronal aspect of this immune-neuronal disorder, the neurological approach to AR treatment has not been investigated yet.</p><p>Histamine, prostaglandin D2, cysteine leukotriene D4, serotonin and bradykinin, which are allergy-associated mediators, may decrease the activity of certain potassium channels and lead to an increase in the resistance of the afferent nerve and a subsequent increase in electrical excitability<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>. Cysteine leukotriene D<sub>4</sub>-stimulating cysteine leukotriene 1 receptors in C-fibre neurons of the trigeminal ganglion does not overtly activate the nerve but increases its excitability such that the action potential discharge frequency in response to another activating stimulus is substantially enhanced<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>. The kinetics of the increase in afferent nerve excitability secondary to allergen activation of mast cells can be quite persistent and last for several hours after acute mast cell activation. Products from activated eosinophils might also contribute to the increases in afferent nerve excitability at sites of allergic inflammation<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>. Furthermore, if the allergic mediators have made the sensory nerve hyperexcitable, then subthreshold stimuli and even non-noxious routine stimuli might evoke these nociceptor-associated reflexes<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>. In a study conducted on a murine model of AR, Sawaki <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> showed that intranasal administration of recombinant Sema3A alleviated sneezing and nasal rubbing and decreased nasal mucosa innervation in the AR model mice.</p><p>In organs at the interface between our body and the environment, the sensory neuropeptide SP is one key mediator of an acute local stress response through neurogenic inflammation but may also alter cytokine balance and dendritic cell function<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>. In AR patients, the numbers of SP and CGRP-positive fibres invading the epithelial and subepithelial regions are increased<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>. Strontium can substitute calcium to trigger neurotransmitter release and it has been used as an experimental tool to study this process<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>. Studies on the squid giant synapse<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, the neuromuscular junction<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> and at central synapses<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> have shown that strontium triggers a &#x02018;desynchronized&#x02019; neurotransmitter release with a reduced peak and prolonged duration. Therefore, SC was suggested to be less effective than Ca2+ in triggering exocytotic transmitter release<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>. In a study where the authors claimed that itching was not only associated with sensorial stimulation but also the perception level; Lee <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> showed that SC increased the perception threshold.</p><p>The limitations of our study included the following: (<italic>i</italic>) the sample size was small, (<italic>ii</italic>) showing the effectiveness of the drug in different animal models, such as ovalbumin-induced AR rat model was necessary, (<italic>iii</italic>) standardized therapeutic doses were not known in the research model, and (<italic>iv</italic>) systemic or local adverse events were not determined.</p><p>In conclusion, our study showed that SC was as effective as MF on both sneezing and nasal rubbing in long-term use in the rat model of AR. The results also suggest that intranasal administration of SC may provide a novel approach to alleviate the allergic symptoms for AR.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold><italic>Conflicts of Interest:</italic></bold> None.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Dykewicz</surname><given-names>MS</given-names></name><name><surname>Hamilos</surname><given-names>DL</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Rhinitis and sinusitis</article-title><source>J Allergy Clin Immunol</source><year>2010</year><volume>125</volume><issue>2 Suppl 2</issue><fpage>S103</fpage><lpage>15</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">20176255</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Wei</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Kou</surname><given-names>W</given-names></name><name><surname>Sun</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Hu</surname><given-names>GH</given-names></name><name><surname>Hu</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Feng</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Association study between interleukin-12 receptor &#x000df;1/&#x000df;2 genes and allergic rhinitis in the Chinese Han population</article-title><source>Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol</source><year>2015</year><volume>272</volume><fpage>889</fpage><lpage>93</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">24997981</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Klimek</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Pfaar</surname><given-names>O</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Allergic rhinitis.
