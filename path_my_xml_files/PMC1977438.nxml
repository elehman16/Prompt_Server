The effect of tamoxifen on haemostasis, and thereby possible thromboembolic risk, was investigated in normal women enrolled in a placebo controlled trial of tamoxifen as a chemopreventative agent for breast cancer. There was an initial reduction in fibrinogen levels in all women on tamoxifen over the first year of follow-up and a marginal reduction in antithrombin III and Protein S in postmenopausal women at 6 months. There were no changes in cross linked fibrinogen degradation products or Protein C for pre or post-menopausal women. There was no increase in the incidence of thromboembolic events on tamoxifen. This study demonstrates that tamoxifen has only marginal effects on factors involved in haemostasis reported to affect the incidence of arterial or venous thromboembolic disease. The follow-up time is relatively short (maximum 36 months) and careful long term follow-up is necessary to detect clinically significant morbidity.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00062-0140.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="744" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00062-0141.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="745" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00062-0142.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="746" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00062-0143.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="747" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
