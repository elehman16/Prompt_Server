After Ethical Committee clearance and informed consent, 60 patients were randomized by permuted blocks into two groups &#x02013; Group T (awake endotracheal extubation group) and Group L (exchange extubation with LMA). American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grades I and II patients, between the age of 18 and 65 years undergoing elective non-oral surgery were included in the study. Patients with upper or lower respiratory infection, bronchial asthma, cardiac diseases, ASA III and above, obesity, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, and anticipated difficult extubation were excluded from the study.</p><p>All patients were orally premedicated with ranitidine 150 mg and metoclopramide 10 mg on the night prior to surgery and morning of surgery. Alprazolam 0.25 mg was given on night prior to surgery. On the day of the surgery, the patient was brought to the operation theatre, and an intravenous (IV) cannula was inserted. The following monitors were then connected: pulse oximeter, electrocardiogram, and noninvasive blood pressure (BP). Patients were preoxygenated for 3 min with 100% oxygen using a face mask. Patients were then given IV midazolam 0.01 mg/kg to a maximum of 2 mg, glycopyrrolate 0.01 mg/kg to a maximum of 0.2 mg, fentanyl 2 &#x003bc;g/kg, and propofol 1&#x02013;2 mg/kg. Three minutes after vecuronium 0.1 mg/kg was given IV patients were intubated with 7.5 or 8.5 size ETT in males and females, respectively. Anesthesia was maintained with 0.6&#x02013;1% isoflurane in nitrous oxide-oxygen mixture (2:1) with mechanical ventilation. Fentanyl 0.5 &#x003bc;g/kg was repeated every hourly or as and when required and vecuronium 0.02 mg/kg was repeated every 45 min. Tidal volume was set at 7 ml/kg of ideal weight, and the respiratory rate was adjusted to keep end-tidal carbon dioxide between 32 and 40 mmHg. Intraoperatively paracetemol 1 g was given in both groups IV if there were no contraindications.</p><p>In the endotracheal awake extubation group (Group T), at the end of the surgical procedure, isoflurane and nitrous oxide were discontinued. Neostigmine 0.05&#x02013;0.07 mg/kg and glycopyrrolate 0.01 mg/kg IV were used for reversing the effects of vecuronium. If the patients were spontaneously generating tidal volume of &#x0003e;4 ml/kg, EtCO<sub>2</sub>&#x0003c;45 mmHg and was responding to verbal commands, extubation was performed. Supplementary oxygen was then provided with Hudson mask at the rate of 6 L/min.</p><p>In the LMA group (Group L), at the end of the surgical procedure, nitrous oxide was discontinued, and a bolus of 0.3 mg/kg propofol was administered. After 1 min, the oropharynx was suctioned, and a deflated LMA was inserted over the ETT [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. The ETT was then removed. LMA was inflated and connected to breathing circuit. If we could not ventilate through the LMA, it was repositioned. If it was still unsuccessful, LMA insertion was abandoned, and mask ventilation was resumed. Following successful insertion of LMA, isoflurane was discontinued, 100% oxygen was administered at 6 L/min, neuromuscular blockade was reversed with neostigmine and glycopyrrolate and the patient was monitored. When the patient was able to spontaneously maintain tidal volume of &#x0003e;4 ml/kg, end tidal carbon dioxide &#x0003c;45 mmHg and was responding to verbal commands, extubation was performed.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Laryngeal mask airway inserted over endotracheal tube</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AER-10-212-g001"/></fig><p>In Group L, all the exchanges were performed by a single anesthetist, in order to determine if a learning curve was present.

The occurrence of straining, bucking, coughing, LMA repositioning, desaturation to &#x0003c;95%, chin lift, jaw thrust and need for bag and mask ventilation was noted. The occurrence of any one of the above incidents was considered as an instance of respiratory complication.</p><p>The heart rate (HR), systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and rate pressure product (RPP) were recorded at the following times baseline &#x02013; before induction, EOS, just after exchange (Ex), just after extubation (E0), 5 min after extubation (E5), 10 min after extubation (E10), and 15 min after extubation (E15).

Smooth extubation becomes more important when the patient has cardiovascular disease or has undergone neurosurgery, ENT surgery or eye surgery. Anesthetists when pressed upon for a smooth extubation, tend to go for a deep extubation of the ETT, which has the theoretical risk of losing the airway, before the patient is fully conscious and requires airway manipulations, albeit external. Nair and Bailey, Costa e Silva and Brimacombe and Glaisyer <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] had suggested that the use of the laryngeal mask after tracheal extubation may minimize the stress response while providing a patent airway during emergence from anesthesia. They inserted the laryngeal mask after extubation; however, there is a small theoretical risk of losing a patent airway, if it is not possible to insert the laryngeal mask after the tracheal tube has been removed. The LMA being situated in the hypopharynx eliminates tracheal stimulation at extubation, makes extubation smooth and comfortable for the patient. Asai <italic>et al</italic>. and Dob <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] improvised on this method by inserting the LMA behind the ETT and then removing the ETT, thereby avoiding the loss of airway.</p><p>Exchange extubation has been mentioned in the Difficult Airway Society guidelines for the management of tracheal extubation, where the authors have recommended it as an advanced technique requiring training and experience for extubation for &#x0201c;at risk&#x0201d; extubation.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] An extubation is said to be &#x0201c;at risk&#x0201d; by the authors if the ability to oxygenate is uncertain, the reintubation is potentially difficult, and the patient has cardiovascular, respiratory and neurological comorbidities.</p><p>The first question that comes to the mind of any anesthetist, on hearing about exchange extubation is whether it is feasible. Stix <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] had shown that he could successfully place a LMA in the first attempt in 95% of cases. We were able to place the LMA successfully on the first attempt in only 70% of cases (21/30). Stix <italic>et al</italic>. have got better results because of the following reasons:First, they went through a &#x0201c;learning&#x0201d; phase where they just inserted and removed the LMA in the presence of the ETT just after induction. After the end of the learning phase, they did the actual study. Our study did not have a learning phase, and we attempted it without previous experience. If we consider our 30 patients in the L Group by chronological order, in the first 15 patients we had a higher LMA repositioning rate (8/15), than in the next 15 (1/15). This gives an LMA first attempt successful insertion rate of 93.3% in the second set of 15 patients which is comparable to Stix's results. A learning phase would help decrease the LMA repositioning rate. Second, they performed the exchange 30 min before EOS, where the patient would have been deep and probably under the cover of muscle relaxants. In our study, we had done the exchange after the EOS, where the patient was in a lighter plane, without the maintenance dose of muscle relaxant as the anesthetist was preparing for an extubation. Therefore, it would have been more difficult to insert the LMA.</p><p>In Brouillette <italic>et al</italic>.'s study,[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] the incidence of cough was 94.87% for the ETT group and 17.94% for the LMA group. Their observations were in agreement with our study in which the incidence of a cough was 83.3% for the ETT group and 20% for the LMA group. Keeping the patient in a deeper plane of anesthesia for the exchange of ETT with LMA can be achieved by various techniques. Jain <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] had studied the exchange of ETT with both classic LMA (cLMA) and Ambu laryngeal mask while using a propofol infusion. The incidence of coughing and LMA repositioning in our study was almost similar for exchange extubation with a cLMA in Jain <italic>et al</italic>.'s study. They had used a propofol infusion to maintain anesthesia and continued the infusion during the exchange and until the patient became spontaneous. Sixty-six percentage nitrous in oxygen along with 10 mg/kg/h propofol infusion was used initially, followed by 5 mg/kg/h, even during the exchange and continued propofol until they could confirm smooth spontaneous respiration through the LMA. It is worthwhile to note that the Ambu laryngeal mask along with a propofol infusion easily outperforms the cLMA.</p><p>The mean percentage increase in HR (13%) and MAP (10%) in Jain <italic>et al</italic>.'s study after exchange extubation are lesser than in our study (19% increase in HR and 11.3% increase in MAP). 5 mg/kg propofol infusion run by Jain <italic>et al</italic>. throughout the surgery, during the exchange and until confirmation of spontaneous respiration is superior to our single bolus of 0.3 mg/kg of propofol given just before extubation. The difference between the two groups in terms of percentage change in HR and BP could be explained based on the sedative and hypotensive effect of a prolonged propofol infusion. The propofol effect would persist for a longer time because of context sensitive half time. In our study, after the exchange was performed, isoflurane was discontinued, while in Jain's study propofol was continued till the start of spontaneous respiration. Longer duration of administration of the primary anesthetic agent (propofol vs. isoflurane) must have produced the difference.</p><p>Another method to keep the patient in deeper plane could be using inhalational agents. When adopting this method, it will be prudent to choose an agent with rapid emergence. Differences in solubility of volatile anesthetic agents in blood has got important implications in awakening following GA. Takita <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] investigated the effective dose 95% in terms of minimum alveolar concentration of end-tidal sevoflurane concentration for the smooth exchange of an ETT for an LMA without coughing, movement or airway obstruction and found it to be 2.97%. Reduction in time spent in operation theater ultimately results in a quicker patient turnover. However, any time delay with exchange extubation can easily be overcome by shifting the patients to postoperative Intensive Care Unit and performing the extubation there.</p><p>The present study had demonstrated that hemodynamic response in terms of HR, BP and RPP were significantly lesser in exchange extubation group when compared to awake endotracheal extubation. Similar results were demonstrated by Ma <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and Ping <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] In Group L there was an increase in the hemodynamic parameters at the time of ETT removal and LMA insertion, from the values at the EOS [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">Table 5</xref>]. But even these values were significantly lower than the values documented at the time of awake extubation in Group T [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>]. So exchange extubation with LMA can be considered as a safe option for those patients in whom hemodynamic stress response of extubation is to be blunted.</p><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Comparison of hemodynamic variables on removal of endotracheal tube in both groups</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AER-10-212-g010"/></fig><p>There have been studies on postoperative sore throat after the exchange extubation. In the study by Brouillette <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] 8 out of 39 patients in the ETT group had a sore throat in the recovery room and 11 the day after, compared to 3 and 5 in the LMA group. More patients in ETT group complained of hoarseness (29 in the recovery room, 21 the day after) than in the LMA group (7 and 4, respectively). The difference was statistically significant. In the study by Jain <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] the incidence of a sore throat in both the cLMA exchange group and the Ambu laryngeal mask exchange group recorded 1 h after surgery was 16%.</p><p>Our study had shortcomings. There is an obvious bias in the study, as a single anesthetist did all the 30 exchanges. Even though this is a significant limitation, it has a silver lining. It was able to bring out the fact that, a phase of learning is required to have a higher success rate in the first attempt LMA positioning.</p><p>As the administration of muscle relaxants and depth of anesthesia was left to individual anesthetists doing the case, we could not ensure a uniform depth of anesthesia to all our patients. The anesthetists were free to maintain isoflurane between 0.6% and 1% and had given muscle relaxants and fentanyl as and when required. A bispectral index and train-of-four monitor would have been useful in ensuring an equal level of depth of anesthesia for all our patients. We did not study the incidence of a postoperative sore throat after the exchange.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Exchange extubation of ETT with LMA decreases respiratory complications and hemodynamic stress response when compared to traditional awake extubation.</p><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Declaration of patient consent</title><p>The authors certify that they have obtained all appropriate patient consent forms.
