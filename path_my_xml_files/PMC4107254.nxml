At greatest risk are patients who are immobile, with significant weakness of the limbs and a prior history of DVT [<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Depending on the methodology of the studies, the frequency of DVT is up to 80% of patients with ischemic stroke who did not receive prophylactic therapy [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].

Approximately 5% of early deaths following stroke are attributed to pulmonary embolism [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>There are pharmacological (unfractionated heparin &#x02013; UFH, low-molecular-weight heparins &#x02013; LMWH, oral anticoagulants, new oral anticoagulants, dextrans) and physical methods (graduated compression stockings (GCS), intermittent pneumatic compression devices (IPC)) which aim to reduce the risk of VTE [<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The strength of evidence for each varies. There is no &#x0201c;gold standard&#x0201d; method for VTE prevention that is recommended in all post-stroke patients.

The questionnaire comprised five questions. The answers were yes or no, and the only response that required a definite number was an estimate of the number of stroke patients admitted per year. Heads of the departments/wards were asked: whether they have a stroke unit in their hospital; approximately how many stroke patients are admitted to their center per year; what method(s) they use in their departments (multiple choice option: UFH, LMWH, oral anticoagulants, new oral anticoagulants, dextrans, hydration, early mobilization, GCS &#x02013; full length or below knee, IPC); and also whether they use those methods routinely or in selected patients (when hemorrhagic stroke was excluded; only those at substantial risk of VTE development; individual decision for each patient). We also asked whether respondents would be interested in joining a randomized trial evaluating any of the prophylactic methods (interested in joining a trial evaluating any method: yes or not; and response options: UFH, LMWH, oral anticoagulants, dextrans, GCS, IPC). Additionally, respondents were asked if it would be useful to publish detailed Polish guidelines of VTE prevention in stroke patients (response option: yes or no).</p><p>The questionnaire was first sent by e-mail.

Both American and European guidelines suggest the use of heparins (UFH and LMWH) in VTE prevention in stroke patients, but suggest their use mostly in those considered to be at high risk of VTE and low risk of bleeding &#x02013; interpretation of this recommendation may be problematic and controversial [<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].

There are no trials that have evaluated the effectiveness of this method in VTE prevention in stroke patients. Moreover, the ongoing AVERT trial (A Very Early Rehabilitation Trial for Stroke) will also not answer whether this method is effective in VTE prevention as it is trying to test its effect on functional outcomes but not VTE [<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>In the majority of the Polish centers (72.7% of centers) good hydration is a part of VTE prevention.

Kelly <italic>et al</italic>. established that a marker of dehydration was associated with more frequent DVT, but the study did not show that improving hydration reduces the incidence of VTE [<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The Cochrane systematic review of hemodilution did show a possible effect on DVT rate but this was indirect evidence [<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>The GCS were reported to be less frequently used by our respondents. Two large clinical trials aimed to determine whether GCS effectively reduce the risk of DVT in stroke patients. CLOTS 1 (Clots in Legs Or sTockings after Stroke) [<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of thigh-length GCS (<italic>n</italic> = 1256) vs. routine care (<italic>n</italic> = 1262). Proximal DVT was evaluated on compression duplex ultrasound examination at 7&#x02013;10 days and 25&#x02013;30 days after stroke. It was the primary end point and was found in 10.0% and 10.5% of patients, respectively, which resulted in a non-significant absolute reduction in risk of 0.5% (95% CI &#x02013; 1.9% to 2.9%). Moreover, stockings significantly increased the risk of skin breaks, ulcers, blisters, and skin necrosis (64 (5%) vs. 16 (1%); odds ratio 4.18, 95% CI: 2.40&#x02013;7.27). The CLOTS trial 2 compared the effectiveness of thigh-length stockings with that of below-knee stockings for preventing proximal DVT in 3114 immobile, hospitalized patients with stroke. The DVT occurred more often in patients who received thigh-length stockings (<italic>p</italic> = 0.008) [<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Despite the results of CLOTS 1 and CLOTS 2 trials, this method of prophylaxis is still used in approximately 20% of Polish centers (both full length and below knee stockings). The newest version of the Polish guidelines do not recommend the routine use of GCS in post-stroke patients (Grade 2) [<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN), American College of Physicians (ACP) and American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) guidelines recommend that GCS should not be used in stroke patients [<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Although GCS have been proven not to be effective in DVT prevention in stroke patients [<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], 30.7% of all the surveyed centers declared willingness to participate in the study if it was carried out. There were no statistical differences between large and small or stroke unit and no stroke unit centers. It is worth noting that before the publication of CLOTS 1 trial results, the use of compression stockings was a widely recommended method of VTE prophylaxis. There is also a &#x0201c;tradition&#x0201d; or a habit of their use based on their effectiveness in surgical patients [<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], which was probably extrapolated to patients with stroke. Nevertheless, in the United Kingdom publication of the results of the CLOTS trials had a dramatic impact on clinical practice [<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>Although there is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of pneumatic compression devices to prevent VTE in stroke patients [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], this method is still practiced in some Polish neurological wards and/or stroke units (6.8%). This method has never been commonly practiced by Polish neurologists. The results of the large randomized trial CLOTS 3, which compares the effectiveness of IPC vs. None in 2876 stroke patients, will be available in May 2013 [<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The IPC is recommended by both European and American guidelines (Grade 2c recommendation) [<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Polish guidelines do not mention this method of VTE prophylaxis [<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>As all the centers that claimed to mobilize early and use GCS or IPC were also using LMWH, and only one center claiming to use hydration did not use LMWH, this may suggest that centers that are most interested in VTE prophylaxis use a variety of physical and pharmacological methods.</p><p>All the respondents (100%) considered that it would be useful to publish guidelines for VTE prevention in post-stroke patients in Polish (this would facilitate access for people who do not know the English language). The existing guidelines [<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] do not address all the questions posed by Polish neurologists: they do not precisely describe the criteria of VTE prevention implementation, the time of onset and the duration of the use of those methods. The ESO guidelines for VTE prophylaxis, which are currently being developed, may answer these questions.</p><p>The fact that centers with a stroke unit less frequently used dextrans in VTE prophylaxis (no data for the effectiveness of this method), and the more frequent early mobilization may suggest that those centers are more familiar with current literature and guidelines of stroke care.</p><p>Due to the variation of methods used in VTE prophylaxis, it might be reasonable to publish detailed national guidelines for VTE prophylaxis in stroke patients. Such guidelines may help standardize the prophylaxis in stroke patients. They should of course be based on the results of systematic reviews and large clinical trials. We used evidence from two randomized trials to conduct this survey, suggesting that closed-ended formats yield more complete and valid demographic data than open-ended formats [<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and that appending second questionnaires to reminders maximizes response rates [<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Our response rate was acceptably high and our findings are generalizable to neurological/stroke centers across Poland.</p><p>The response rate was acceptable (80.7%), although not all centers responded to the questionnaire. We did not elicit information on the practice of combination prophylaxis with pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic approaches.</p><p>Respondents (mainly heads of departments) may not be aware of all local decisions, although their responses are probably representative of care standards delivered in their centers. The respondents may not be representative of all neurologists and their clinical practices. This limitation underscores the universal caveat of all surveys stating that practice does not always reflect actual practice.</p><p>Despite the limitations, the results of this survey represent the frequency of VTE prevention methods practiced by Polish neurologists and entirely justify the development of evidence-based guidelines or translation into Polish and adaptation of European ones.</p><p>In conclusion, our survey identified LMWH as the most common method of VTE prophylaxis for stroke patients practiced by Polish neurologists. The variation of methods used in VTE prophylaxis justifies the need for detailed guidelines for VTE prophylaxis in stroke patients.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="CIT0001"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Geerts</surname><given-names>WH</given-names></name><name><surname>Bergqvist</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Pineo</surname><given-names>GF</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>American College of Chest Physicians.
