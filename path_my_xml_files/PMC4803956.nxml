As a result many deaths occur in these two groups, so caring for these two groups is very important. Today, it is believed that the health of an infant is related to the health of their mother. Maintaining a healthy weight before pregnancy, and optimal weight gain during pregnancy by appropriate and sufficient nutrition, are two effective measures for the prevention of low birth weight.To provide successful health interventions, it is essential to design and implement effective health education programs. Successful education also depends on the proper use of theories and models in health education. The Health Belief Model is a model that illustrates the relationship between beliefs and health, and it is based on the hypothesis that preventive health behavior consists of personal beliefs. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of training on the Health Belief Model on dietary behaviors of a sample of pregnant Iranian women.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>This study was a randomized controlled clinical trial, involving 130 pregnant women who attended two health care centers of Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences. Data was collected by a structured questionnaire in three parts and seven sub-scales (including demographic characteristics, knowledge and dietary behaviors) based on the Health Belief Model.</p><p>Principles of education were based on the Health Belief Model and performed twice during two-hour sessions in the intervention group. Women in the control group received routine care and did not receive training on the above model. In order to evaluate the intervention, the previously mentioned questionnaire was administered one month after completion of the intervention, and filled by participants in both groups. Data were analyzed by SPSS software and reported with diagrams and tables.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>The mean score for each variable before the intervention, except for the performance guide variable, was not significantly different between the two groups (p&#x0003c;0.05).</p><p>A month after the intervention, the mean scores of the knowledge, perceived severity, perceived benefits in each group, were significantly different.</p><p>These results demonstrated that there were significant differences between the two groups in terms of mean scores of knowledge, perceived severity, perceived barriers, performance guide and individual performance, and the means of these variables in the intervention group were also higher than the control group. On the other hand, after the intervention, there was no statistically significant difference found in the mean scores of perceived benefits and perceived susceptibility between the two groups (two independent samples t-test, P &#x0003c;0/001).</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusion:</title><p>Educational interventions based on health promotion patterns can be effective in enhancing awareness, better understanding of risks, reducing barriers to healthy behavior and ultimately, improving women&#x02019;s health and nutritional performance during pregnancy.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>prenatal education</kwd><kwd>health belief model</kwd><kwd>nutrition</kwd><kwd>health</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-1"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Mothers and children are the most vulnerable members in any society, thus in the majority of countries, these two groups have higher mortality numbers.</p><p>A number of adverse pregnancy outcomes, including; intrauterine growth retardation, low birth weight, anemia, pre-eclampsia, preterm delivery and even fetal or infant death, are due to undernutrition or failure to receive all the necessary micronutrients (micronutrient deficiencies) during pregnancy (<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">Bhutta et al., 2013)</xref>.</p><p>Low birth weight, means a weight of less than 2,500 grams, and this produces an infant mortality rate factor in the region of 40-80%, with 98% of these mortalities occurring in developing countries (<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">Abu-Saad &#x00026; Fraser, 2010</xref>). Furthermore, some of the most important causes of maternal mortality, such as; pre-eclampsia, anemia and postpartum infections can be prevented by modifying the model of nutrition during pregnancy (<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">Girard &#x00026; Olude, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">Villar et al., 2003)</xref>.</p><p>In addition, excessive weight gain during pregnancy is related to an increased incidence of complications, such as; preeclampsia, cesarean delivery, instrumental delivery<sup>1</sup> and postpartum complications (<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">Asbee et al., 2009)</xref>. This problem has also been linked to childhood obesity, cardiovascular disease and Type 2 diabetes in adolescents (<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">Dodd et al., 2014)</xref>.</p><p>The World Health Organization (WHO) has introduced the obesity epidemic as one of the most significant threats to global health, particularly in women of childbearing age (<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">Guelinckx, Devlieger, Beckers, &#x00026; Vansant, 2008</xref>). Therefore, adequate weight gain via a balance between energy and protein intake, regular consumption of micronutrients or micronutrient rich foods is vital, since these decisions making processes both prior to becoming pregnant and during pregnancy play key roles in improving pregnancy outcomes (<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">Ramakrishnan, Grant, Goldenberg, Zongrone, &#x00026; Martorell, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies, particularly in low-income and middle-income countries, have shown that individual education and counseling during the first pregnancy visit helps mothers to improve their food consumption and the use of dietary supplements. This information should focus on the mothers&#x02019; needs and their fetus at three months of pregnancy and the need to maintain consistant weight gain in order to avoid long fasting or over-eating and its complications (<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">Girard &#x00026; Olude, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Poor weight gain, and more importantly, weight gain and obesity in mothers and infants during pregnancy results in subsequent complications and ongoing problems. Like many developing countries, there is a growing trend in these types of issues in Iran (<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">Motlagh et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">Tabatabaei, 2011</xref>).</p><p>The results of several Iranian studies have suggested that calorie and protein intake is similar in both non-pregnant and pregnant women. As a result pregnant women are not receiving sufficient minerals or vitamins and they require nutritional supplements during pregnancy despite having a normal BMI or weight gain in pregnant women. This condition is often associated with mistakes found in the women&#x02019;s nutritional habits and deficiencies in their nutritional knowledge, especially among middle and lower socio-economic groups (<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">Delvarian Zadeh, Ebrahimi, &#x00026; Haghighi, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">Eshghinia et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">Maddah, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">Mohammad Alizadeh Charandabi, Kamalifard, Ebrahimi mamaghani, Asghari, &#x00026; F., 2012</xref>). The Health Based Model (HBM) is one of the best known frameworks that refer to the key role of people&#x02019;s beliefs as a stimulus for behavior change implementation. Based on this model, when people understand the level of risk that an unhealthy behavior poses, and their susceptibility to the adverse consequences of their feelings, as well as understanding their behaviors, they become interested in methods to reduce their risks. By using learning methods to counteract and reduce existing barriers they are able to mitigate these adverse effects, moreover, they can change their attitudes and the range of positive behaviors will increase.</p><p>The model includes components of perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived benefits, perceived barriers, and a performance guide (<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">Gilmore, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">Martin, Haskard-Zolnierek, &#x00026; DiMatteo, 2010</xref>).</p><p>This study assessed the knowledge, beliefs, perceptions and behaviors of expectant mothers with respect to prenatal nutrition. The study aimed to determine the effectiveness of educational interventions based on the HBM to improve the dietary behaviors during pregnancy in a sample of expectant mothers living in Tehran, Iran.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-2"><title>2.

Discussion</title><p>This study included 130 pregnant women attending two public health centers in Tehran. The results demonstrated that pregnant women need nutritional prenatal care, and require sufficient and proper knowledge in this area, the second important area is to educate expectant mothers about the risks of complications caused by a failure to comply with correct nutritional recommendations and the severity of potential risks arising from a lack of good nutrition on both the mother&#x02019;s and their unborn child&#x02019;s health. Motivation is required to make behavior modifications to produce good nutritional performance, or to replace former bad habits with optimal nutritional behavior instead. The study results indicated that providing group consultations and training to pregnant women, based on known patterns of health promotion, is a better short-term and cost-effective method of increasing the target group&#x02019;s knowledge and inducing behavior modification than conventional methods.</p><p>Comparing the mean knowledge scores between the two groups, showed that there were significant differences in both groups at different stages of the study, therefore, we suggest that when giving information by maternal and neonatal health care providers, the needs of the target group must be taken into consideration. Furthermore, answering the women&#x02019;s questions directly also played a more effective role than conventional methods, such as pamphlets, booklets, or media education. This is because the purpose of education is not only to deliver information, but it also enables the audience to assess their own thoughts, beliefs, and behaviors, regarding the information and then to make their decision on the changes they will need to make. Accordingly, effective training should take into account the audience&#x02019;s needs; while on the other hand, the groups are influenced by the training, resulting in sharing in a bilateral teaching-learning process.</p><p>Evaluation of common beliefs is a useful strategy for health care providers in face-to-face situations. If the educator determines that the audience has incorrect beliefs, then the aim should be to be determining the reasons for the fallacy and to help the client to overcome the problem through the provision of correct information (<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">Glanz, Rimer, &#x00026; Viswanath, 2008</xref>). In Kazaemi et al.&#x02019;s study the face-to face educations based on the HBM to pregnant women evaluated as an effective way to a reduction of environmental tobacco smoke exposure compared with the women in the control group (<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">Kazemi et al., 2011)</xref>.</p><p>Promotion of nutritional knowledge in society through nutritional education would go a long way to reduce malnutrition and this could be considered a necessity for developing countries. Selecting a suitable model for health education is the first step toward planning effective health promotion programs (<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">Pallatino, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Malnutrition can arise from eating too few or too many calories and result in different adverse effects on pregnancy outcomes. As a result, nutrition is one of the most important factors discussed in various studies emphasizing the importance of health promotion interventions in this era.</p><p>In the present study, the majority of participants held a number of incorrect beliefs and insufficient information about the mother&#x02019;s energy needs. This misinformation can lead to excessive intake of calories and create obesity in pregnancy; while on the other hand, reducing the intake of necessary food groups, such as proteins and minerals that are found in fruits and vegetables can lead to malnutrition.</p><p><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">Guelinckx et al. (2008)</xref> reviewed seven experimental studies conducted on women from low-income areas and these showed that educational interventions in the form of group training on adjusting energy intake and including essential micronutrients in the daily diet of pregnant women were important and considerably reduced the incidence of overweight and obesity during pregnancy (6 studies). Furthermore, they found improved glycemic index, plasma glucose and insulin concentrations (4 studies), and perinatal outcomes, compared with the control group (2 studies) (<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">Guelinckx et al., 2008)</xref>.</p><p>Inspite of improvement in Knowledge, perceived benefits and severity, dietary behaviors did not significantly progressed among women in control group in the second investigation compared with the first time. This finding may explain the impact of the model based antenatal education to facilitate decreasing perceived barriers and improve the specific nutrition knowledge into the healthy practice acheivement. de Jersey et al. observed although pregnancy specific nutrition knowledge of a sample of Australian expectant mothers was good, knowledge regarding recommendations for healthy diet during pregnancy such as enough fruit and vegetable consumption was poor and less than one in ten women met important dietary recommendations. These researchers suggest that although knowledge played a key role for behaviour change, nutrition knowledge was independently associated with intake of fruit and vegetables by women and this knowledge inadequacy can not lead to ppropriate behaviour (<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">de Jersey, Nicholson, Callaway, &#x00026; Daniels, 2013</xref>).</p><p>However, the results indicated an increase in perceived benefits, rather than improvements in eating behavior modification in both groups after the intervention. As a result of improvement in the control group&#x02019;s performance, no statistically significant difference was found in the second stage response in the control group.</p><p>Mothers in the control group mostly knew the importance of healthy nutrition for having a healthy baby, in addition they were also aware that healthy families were related to healthy mothers.</p><p>The findings for the perceived barriers subscale for the control group remained in effect too.</p><p>These results imply an increase in the mothers&#x02019; perception of the benefits of healthy dietary pattern modifications over time, and the women are likely to be more sensitive to the health of their fetus and infant. The importance of correct nutrition notwithstanding, it may also contribute to the prevention of obstetric complications, such as; severe bleeding leading to anemia, impaired wound healing and delayed recovery after childbirth.</p><p>In this study, the women participating in the intervention group were able to dismantle perceived barriers to a greater extent than the control group, therefore, these findings indicate the effectiveness of the trainings was focused on correcting unhealthy beliefs and insufficient information.</p><p>For example, in the material given to the mothers in the intervention group, introduced food groups containing proteins were discussed, so if they did not have access to meat protein, inexpensive foods with high protein levels could be used to replace them. Moreover, if they had a milk intolerance or allergy to certain dairy products they could use other foods containing calcium, or if they could not eat fruit, they could introduce a variety of vegetables containing minerals and vitamins using simple and easy to apply explanations.</p><p><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">Safavi et al. (2006)</xref> studied 4,368 urban and rural women from 11 different regions of Iran, and they found that 42.7% of pregnant women in the second half of their pregnancy had iron deficiency anemia. This particular problem was greater in under resourced provinces and in the country&#x02019;s southern and rural areas, problems were also more prevalent and severe in multiparous women and in these rural areas than in urban regions (22.2 to 27.8% versus 17.1 to 21.6%) (<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">Safavi et al., 2006)</xref>.</p><p>One of the causes of anemia and iron deficiency in Iranian pregnant women may be inappropriate patterns of food intake that can lead to deficient levels and low absorption of iron. Furthermore, a significantly large proportion of pregnant women with iron deficiency anemia lived in low-income areas, and as a result of their lower per capita consumption of protein products, such as meat, eggs, and other essential micronutrients, such disorders were more prevalent in this group of women (<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">Safavi et al., 2006)</xref>.</p><p>Like other studies, this study had some limitations. As the present study was carried out on a small and not very economically advantaged population in urban area and we did not find any differences bwtween education level or occupation status and dietrary behaviors; while findings from two studies showed that higher maternal education level had been associated with greater health knowledge among women (<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">Perumal et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">Zhao, Kulane, Gao, &#x00026; Xu, 2009</xref>) Moreover, health information was mostly delivered to this group of women through health care providers or mass media programs, thus, the results cannot be generalized to higher educated women. Secondly, impact of the HBM based education was evaluated in a short period (one month) after completion of intervention and maintenance of behavior change needs longer follow up.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>5. Conclusion</title><p>The results of this study showed that improper dietary behavior habits need to be replaced with correct eating behaviors and the application of health promotion models such as the HBM can be combined with usual pregnancy care practices in health care centers. This effective form of health care delivery should be taken into consideration by maternal and neonatal health authorities.
