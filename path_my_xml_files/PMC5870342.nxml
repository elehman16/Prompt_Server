A high success rate with a low recurrence and complication rate has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The most important but rare complication is iatrogenic third degree atrioventricular (AV) block necessitating permanent pacemaker therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Therefore, the decision for catheter ablation of slow-pathway (CaSP) without prior ECG documentation of tachycardia should be made carefully.</p><p id="Par6">In patients with clinical on&#x02013;off tachycardia, in whom AVNRT can be induced during EPS, elimination or modulation of the SP is the first line therapy independent of pre-procedural electrocardiogram (ECG) documentation of the tachycardia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Furthermore, according to the current guidelines, empirical slow-pathway ablation can be considered in patients with clinical on&#x02013;off tachycardia, in whom AVNRT cannot be induced during EPS, as long as there is proof of dual AV-nodal conduction properties and a maximum of one single echo-beat during EPS as well as pre-procedural ECG documentation of the tachycardia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Several studies reported this empiric approach to be safe and feasible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">However, clinical ECG documentation of paroxysmal on&#x02013;off tachycardia is, despite all efforts, not infrequently unsuccessful. In these circumstances, the patients clinically suspected to have AVNRT are still referred to qualified centres for EPS without pre-procedural ECG documentation of the tachycardia. Based on current scientific evidence, it remains still unclear, if an empiric CaSP should be performed in patients without pre-procedural ECG documented tachycardia who have a dual AV-nodal conduction property and a maximum of one echo-beat.</p><p id="Par8">Guidelines from 1995 recommended catheter ablation of SP in patients with clinically suspected AVNRT where there is evidence of dual AV-nodal conduction properties and a maximum of one echo-beat during EPS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. However, the current guidelines do not make a clear recommendation of CaSP for patients without pre-procedural ECG documentation of the tachycardia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Before a catheter ablation of SP in these patients, the benefit of possible elimination of covert AVNRT should be weighed against the risk of unnecessary AV-block despite of actual absence of AVNRT.</p><p id="Par9">The aim of this study was to evaluate long-term results after CaSP in patients with non-ECG documented clinical on&#x02013;off tachycardia in the presence of dual AV-nodal conduction properties and up to a single echo-beat.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par10">We retrospectively included patients who underwent catheter ablation of slow-pathway (CaSP) for clinical on&#x02013;off tachycardia from the University Hospital D&#x000fc;sseldorf EPS registry from 2012 to 2015. In detail, the eligibility criteria are as follows; (1) patients with prior ECG documentation during tachycardia who had typical on&#x02013;off tachycardia, or (2) patients with typical on&#x02013;off palpitations with at least one successful termination using vagal manoeuvres (deep breathing/drinking cold water) but without prior ECG documentation who underwent at least two attempts at 24-h Holter monitoring.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Electrophysiological study</title><p id="Par11">All patients provided written informed consent prior to the EPS. All procedures were performed by two experienced operators with experience in more than 500 AVNRT ablations. The patients underwent mild sedation with midazolam (3&#x02013;5&#x000a0;mg) and continuous propofol (5&#x02013;10&#x000a0;mg/h). After placing three sheaths (6F, 8F, 8F) in the right or left femoral vein, three catheters (St. Jude Medical, Saint Paul, Minnesota, USA) were placed in the right ventricular apex (RV), at the His position and in the coronary sinus. Atrial and ventricular stimulation was performed with an external cardiac stimulator (UHS3000, Biotronik, Berlin, Germany). The intracardiac electrograms and electrocardiographic leads were displayed on a multichannel recording system (CardioLab, GE, USA) and recorded at a speed of 100&#x000a0;mm/s. Programmed stimulations from the RV and CS were conducted to induce AVNRT using one extrastimulus (S2), double extrastimuli (S3) and 3 extrastimuli (S4) with two different basic cycle lengths (CL) and atrial burst stimulation up to a minimum CL of 200&#x000a0;ms. If tachycardia was not inducible and no contraindications existed, metaproterenol (orciprenaline) was intravenously administered (0.25&#x000a0;mg, bolus) repeatedly until the heart rate increased by at least 20%, and programmed stimulations up to S4 with two different basic CL and atrial burst stimulation up to a minimum CL of 200&#x000a0;ms were conducted.</p><p id="Par12">A jump phenomenon indicating dual AV-nodal physiology was defined as a prolongation of the AH-interval by more than 50&#x000a0;ms after a 10&#x000a0;ms decrease of the coupling interval during programmed extrastimulation. For mapping and CaSP we used a non-irrigated 4&#x000a0;mm catheter (AluCath Blu/Black, Biotronik, Berlin, Germany). The optimal ablation site was identified by electrophysiological signals and anatomically via fluoroscopy as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Radiofrequency energy was delivered when a maximal atrioventricular amplitude ratio of 0.5 was confirmed. Radiofrequency energy was titrated from 20&#x000a0;W up to 35&#x000a0;W and applied for 60&#x000a0;s if a steady junctional rhythm was confirmed during application. After a minimum of 20&#x000a0;min observation period, the same induction procedures were repeated to assess the endpoint of CaSP. The endpoint of CaSP was defined as the elimination of the slow-pathway (SP elimination) or a significant change of the SP conduction property with a jump phenomenon and up to a maximum of one echo-beat (SP modification). The elimination of echo-beat or the shortening of fast-pathway effective refractory period (ERP) greater than 20&#x000a0;ms was defined as SP modification. This ERP threshold (&#x0003e;&#x02009;20&#x000a0;ms) was arbitrary defined based on the previous report of Lindsay et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par13">The patients were divided into two groups depending on the results of EPS. Patients with a dual AV-nodal conduction property and a maximum of one echo-beat but without pre-procedural ECG documentation of tachycardia, were assigned to the &#x0201c;pure empirical CaSP group&#x0201d; (Group-peCaSP). Patients with electrophysiologically inducible AVNRT as well as proof of two or more echo-beats with and without pre-procedural ECG documentation of tachycardia and patients with dual AV-nodal property and a maximum of one echo-beat with pre-procedural ECG documentation of tachycardia were assigned to the standard CaSP group (Group-stCaSP).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Follow-up</title><p id="Par14">Follow-up was conducted in our outpatient clinics, and by telephone communication with the patient as well as cooperation with the referring general practitioner involving with at least one 24-h Holter monitoring per year.

On the other hand, over 60% of the patients after pure empirical CaSP can live without any symptom recurrence. To the best of our knowledge, this is a first detailed cohort study assessing the validity of &#x0201c;pure empirical&#x0201d; catheter ablation of slow-pathway approach.</p><p id="Par32">The slow-pathway ablation is associated with low risk and high success rates. Therefore, CaSP has been recognized as a class I therapy in patients with diagnosed AVNRT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, in some cases with on&#x02013;off tachycardia, it is difficult to induce the tachycardia or to prove the presence of AVNRT during EPS. In fact, sustained AVNRT was only induced in 164 patients (49%) in our study, including induction under metaproterenol infusion.</p><p id="Par33">The current guideline supports empirical CaSP when AVNRT is not inducible but with tachycardia ECG documentation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par34">On the other hand, several authors described the empiric catheter ablation of SP without prior ECG documentation to be safe and feasible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. A current analysis of 32 out of 3003 patients by Wegner et al. showed that slow-pathway modulation in patients with only two echo-beats was safe and effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Lin et al. reported effectiveness of slow-pathway modulation even in the presence of one or two echo-beats without inducibility of AVNRT but documented tachycardia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Bogun et al. showed effectiveness of ablation in patients with documented tachycardia without inducibility but proof of dual AV nodal pathway or echo-beats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. These data, however, were obtained under the specified condition of ECG documented tachycardias.</p><p id="Par35">It still remains unclear if CaSP should be performed in patients with supraventricular tachycardia without pre-procedural ECG documentation and with dual AV-nodal conduction property with single echo-beats. In our study, pure empirical CaSP provided complete subjective symptom suppression in over 60% of patients with on&#x02013;off tachycardia without pre-procedural ECG documentation, despite all efforts to detect tachycardia with Holter monitoring. The patients in the peCaSP group had severe symptoms which significantly affected subjective quality-of-life and, therefore, were referred to our institute despite no previous ECG documentation. In this patient population with a strong preference for more effective treatment, only completing the EPS without ablation and continuing further ECG monitoring to document the tachycardia may be less than optimal. The present study provides a possible clue to improve their symptoms although our study is underpowered for safety assessment.</p><p id="Par36">Meanwhile our data demonstrated a significantly higher incidence of other atrial tachyarrhythmias after the pure empirical CaSP as well as a higher persistence of clinical symptoms. Considering the possible risk of AV block after CaSP, mere pure empirical CaSP may be also suboptimal to fully live up to patient&#x02019; needs.</p><sec id="Sec13"><title>Clinical implications</title><p id="Par37">With technological development, many portable ECG monitoring devices have emerged. Therefore, the effort to document an ECG during tachycardia should be taken as far as possible, to prevent unnecessary SPA and consequently unnecessary complications such as AV-block. The discrepancy between the incidence of recurrent symptoms (78/334 patients, 23%) and the documented AVNRT recurrence (4/334 patients, 1.2%) in the present study underscores the importance of these devices, which will be able to clarify the pathology.</p><p id="Par38">In all these circumstances, the patients with highly symptomatic tachycardias which cannot be documented even by current portable monitoring devices may be indicated for pure empirical CaSP. After pure empirical CaSP, careful monitoring should be conducted due to possible documentation of other atrial tachyarrhythmias.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Limitations</title><p id="Par39">There are some limitations in the present study. First, this is a single centre cohort study. Second, patients with other atrial tachyarrhythmia which was demonstrated during follow-up might have also had AVNRT at the time of CaSP. Due to the non-inducibility of AVNRT during EPS, this possibility could not be excluded. Third, metaproterenol, instead of isoproterenol was administered in the case of non-inducibility because of our institutional standard and no official approval for isoproterenol in Germany. Another group from Germany also utilized metaproterenol at the same dose for AVNRT induction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Additionally, also due to our institutional standard, intravenous sedation was adopted in our study, which may affect the inducibility of tachycardia. However, our strategy can be validated based on the recurrence rate of AVNRT in the standard SPA patients with ECG documentation (under 2%) and the complication rate as low as that of the reference data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Feldman et al. also reported previously that there were no differences in procedural outcomes under general anesthesia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. We could not exclude the placebo effect after pure empirical CaSP. In the present study, we had no major complications including permanent AV-block. However, our study is underpowered for the safety assessment due to the patient number. Finally, regarding the shortening of effective refractory period as an endpoint of CaSP, the autonomic tone variation cannot be excluded.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par40">Higher incidence of other AT and higher persistence of subjective symptoms are demonstrated after pure empirical slow-pathway ablation. However, pure empirical slow-pathway ablation improves clinical symptoms in 60% of patients with non-documented on&#x02013;off tachycardia. Careful monitoring after pure empirical slow-pathway ablation should be conducted due to possible documentation of other atrial arrhythmias.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>Concept/Design by HM, DS and CB, Data analysis/Interpretation by HM, SG and AF, Data Collection by HM, SG and CB, Drafting article by HM and SG, linguistical revision by TL, and critical revision by all authors.
