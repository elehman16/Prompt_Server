PermaNet 3.0 is a long-lasting combination net incorporating deltamethrin on the side panels and a mixture of deltamethrin and synergist piperonyl butoxide (PBO) on the top panel. PBO is an inhibitor of mixed function oxidases implicated in pyrethroid resistance.</p></sec><sec><title>Method</title><p>An experimental hut trial comparing PermaNet 3.0, PermaNet 2.0 and a conventional deltamethrin-treated net was conducted in NE Tanzania using standard WHOPES procedures. The PermaNet arms included unwashed nets and nets washed 20 times. PermaNet 2.0 is a long-lasting insecticidal net incorporating deltamethrin as a single active.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Against pyrethroid susceptible Anopheles gambiae the unwashed PermaNet 3.0 showed no difference to unwashed PermaNet 2.0 in terms of mortality (95% killed), but showed differences in blood-feeding rate (3% blood-fed with PermaNet 3.0 versus 10% with PermaNet 2.0). After 20 washes the two products showed no difference in feeding rate (10% with 3.0 and 9% with 2.0) but showed small differences in mortality (95% with 3.0 and 87% with 2.0). Against pyrethroid resistant Culex quinquefasciatus, mediated by elevated oxidase and kdr mechanisms, the unwashed PermaNet 3.0 killed 48% and PermaNet 2.0 killed 32% but after 20 washes there was no significant difference in mortality between the two products (32% killed by 3.0 and 30% by 2.0). For protecting against Culex PermaNet 3.0 showed no difference to PermaNet 2.0 when either unwashed or after 20 washes; both products were highly protective against biting. Laboratory tunnel bioassays confirmed the loss of biological activity of the PBO/deltamethrin-treated panel after washing.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Both PermaNet products were highly effective against susceptible Anopheles gambiae.

The chemical agents that make malaria vector control feasible are the pyrethroids. The best tools for delivering pyrethroids are long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLIN) and indoor residual spraying (IRS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Recent trends confirm that the scale up of these two tools is making inroads into the malaria burden in many African countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. This has stimulated new discussion about malaria elimination which a few years ago seemed inconceivable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. But coinciding with the increased coverage of LLIN and IRS is the development and spread of resistant mosquitoes that may ultimately undermine the effectiveness of the two tools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. For elimination to remain a realistic prospect, it is essential to preserve the pyrethroids for as long as possible because no other insecticide class can match the pyrethroids for effectiveness, safety, cost per unit dose, acceptability or suitability for LLIN and IRS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>Resistance management has a theoretical foundation in population genetics that goes back three decades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Simulation modeling has shown that the most promising way to delay the selection of resistance is to apply mixtures of unrelated insecticides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. The idea behind mixtures is that insects which develop resistance to one insecticide should be killed by the second insecticide provided they are not resistant to both and a proportion of each generation escapes exposure altogether. When resistance is present at low frequency - such as when it first evolves - double resistance will be rare and selection of each type of resistance should be delayed or prevented.</p><p>The same principle has been adopted in the strategy to preserve anti-malarial drug efficacy known as combination therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Adoption of combination therapy on the Thai-Burmese border has prevented or delayed the selection of drug resistance when in the preceding decade chloroquine, SP and mefloquine monotherapy were each rendered redundant by sequential evolution of resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. It is time a similar strategy was adopted for preserving insecticides for malaria vector control.</p><p>Alternative insecticides to pyrethroids have been tested on nets for effect against wild, pyrethroid resistant mosquito populations but only under limited experimental conditions in the field [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Most alternatives lack the excito-repellency of pyrethroids, a characteristic important for reducing biting rates or providing personal protection to users of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs). This limitation is the main reason for combining the alternative insecticide with a pyrethroid that is capable of adding repellency to the product. Combinations can be applied either as a mixture of the two insecticides or as a two-in-one (mosaic) format, in which the pyrethroid is restricted to the sides and the alternative insecticide to the top of the net [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. For the two-in-one net to work as a resistance management tactic mosquitoes should contact both the top and sides so that any pyrethroid resistant mosquito that survives contact with the pyrethroid stands a high chance of being killed by the alternative insecticide. There is indirect evidence that host-seeking mosquitoes of the <italic>An. gambiae </italic>complex do in fact contact the top [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] possibly in response to odour plumes or concentration gradients, and this gives the two-in-one concept a degree of credibility.</p><p>Rather than use a non-pyrethroid insecticide to overcome resistance, an equally valid approach is to deploy a chemical synergist on the fibres. Synergists overcome resistance by inhibiting the enzymes responsible for certain types of resistance. Resistance to pyrethroids in Anopheline mosquitoes appears to be caused by two primary mechanisms: a target site insensitivity mechanism known as <italic>kdr </italic>and a metabolic mechanism caused by mixed function oxidases (MFOs). MFOs are responsible for the pyrethroid resistance that evolved in <italic>Anopheles funestus </italic>and which led to the failure of IRS campaigns in South Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. It appears that MFOs may also act in consort with <italic>kdr </italic>to create a pyrethroid resistance, that is causing control failure of <italic>Anopheles gambiae </italic>M form in parts of West Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Both MFOs and <italic>kdr </italic>together are responsible for pyrethroid resistance in <italic>Culex quinquefasciatus </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. One type of synergist capable of inhibiting MFOs is piperonyl butoxide (PBO). PBO is commonly used in commercial aerosols for potentiating pyrethroid activity against flying or domestic insect pests [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>PBO has potential to combat the growing problem of pyrethroid resistance in <italic>An. gambiae </italic>and other vector species. PermaNet 3.0 is a long-lasting insecticidal net developed by Vestergaard Frandsen in which the PBO together with the pyrethroid deltamethin are incorporated into the polyethylene fibres on the roof panel of the net. The sides of PermaNet 3.0 are made of polyester and coated with a long-lasting formulation of deltamethrin similar to the pyrethroid-based LLIN, PermaNet 2.0 but with a strengthened lower part. By restricting PBO to the roof of the net the concept of PermaNet 3.0 is to have the insect make contact with the synergist on the roof, mediated by the odour plume, before making further contact with pyrethroid on the sides during exploration.</p><p>PermaNet 3.0 was submitted by Vestergaard Frandsen to the WHO Pesticide Evaluation Scheme (WHOPES) for formal evaluation. The current paper reports upon a WHOPES-sponsored experimental hut trial conducted against wild, free flying <italic>An. gambiae </italic>and <italic>Cx quinquefasciatus </italic>in Muheza, Tanzania, together with supporting laboratory data and chemical analysis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Long-lasting insecticidal nets</title><p>PermaNet 3.0 LN (Vestergaard Frandsen SA, Denmark) is a LLIN consisting of a top panel made of monofilament polyethylene (100 denier) fabric incorporating deltamethrin at 4 g/kg (approx. 180 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) and piperonyl butoxide at 25 g/kg (approx. 1.1 g/m<sup>2</sup>), plus side panels made of multifilament polyester (75 denier) fabric with a strengthened border treated with deltamethrin at 2.8 g/kg (approx. 118 mg/m<sup>2</sup>).</p><p>PermaNet 2.0 LN (Vestergaard Frandsen SA, Denmark) is a LLIN made of multifilament polyester (75-100 denier) fabric, factory treated with a wash-resistant formulation of deltamethrin at 1.8 g/kg (for 75 denier) (approx. 62 mg/m<sup>2</sup>).</p><p>The conventionally treated net (CTN) is a multifilament polyester (100 denier) fabric treated with deltamethrin (K-Othrine SC, Bayer) at 25 mg/m<sup>2</sup>; the net was treated by hand, on site, in an aqueous solution of the formulation.</p><p>The size of the PermaNet 2.0 and standard nets was 130 cm wide, 190 cm long, 150 cm high.

Nine 1 cm diameter holes were cut into the netting to allow passage of mosquitoes. In the bait chamber, a guinea pig was housed unconstrained in a wire meshed cage and in the other chamber 100 unfed female mosquitoes 3-5 days old were released at dusk and left overnight in the dark as per WHO guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].

The conventionally treated net (CTN) treatment serves as a positive control to judge PermaNet 3.0 performance against. The point of exhaustion is the point at which the CTN showed less than 80% mortality or 95% knock down in WHO cone bioassays conducted after each wash. The standardized WHO washing protocol requires the net to be stirred in 10 litres of soap solution (2 g/litre of 'Savon de Marseille') for 6 min, during a 10 min washing cycle at ambient temperature. Nets were rinsed and dried and left for one day between washes. Determination of the 'point of exhaustion' was carried out by exposing unfed <italic>An. gambiae </italic>Kisumu in 10 replicates of 5 mosquitoes per replicate at each wash interval on the five panels of each net. Exposure was for 3 min and mortality was scored 24 h later.</p></sec><sec><title>Study area and hut design</title><p>The six veranda trap huts were situated at Zeneti village, Muheza district, NE Tanzania (5&#x000b0;13'S and 38&#x000b0;39'E). They were constructed according to a design first described by Smith [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], but built on concrete plinths surrounded by water-filled moats to deter entry of scavenging ants. The brick walls were plastered with mud on the inside, the roofs made of corrugated iron, the wooden ceilings lined with Hessian sackcloth, with open eaves and veranda traps and window traps on each side of the hut. The veranda traps on two opposing sides were closed to capture any mosquitoes that exit via the eaves. The two verandas on the other two sides were left open so mosquitoes can enter the huts through the gaps under the eaves. Each night's collection inside the two screened veranda traps was multiplied by two and added to the room and window trap collections; the multiplication was to adjust for the unrecorded escapes through the two verandas which were left unscreened to allow routes for entry of wild mosquitoes via the gaps under the eaves. At the end of each rotation the north and south verandas were closed and east and west sides opened, or <italic>vice versa</italic>, to compensate for possible selective exiting in one compass direction.</p><p><italic>Anopheles gambiae </italic>s.s., <italic>An. funestus </italic>and <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus </italic>are the predominant mosquito species in the area.

Untreated polyester net</p><p>Each net was deliberately holed with six 4 cm &#x000d7; 4 cm holes to simulate a worn net. The trial took place between 7 July and 4 October 2008. The treatment arms were rotated 3 times through the huts according to a Latin Square design. A treatment was assigned at random to a particular hut for 3 nights' observation before being rotated to the next hut. Male volunteers slept on beds under the net which were tucked under the mattress. The six sleepers were rotated through the six huts on consecutive nights. Data were collected for 54 nights. Three nets were available per treatment arm and each net was tested on consecutive nights during the three-night rotation. At the end of each rotation the huts were cleaned and aired for one day and the treatments moved to the next hut.</p><p>White sheets were laid over the veranda and room floors to ease the collection of knocked-down mosquitoes. Each morning after dawn, mosquitoes were collected using aspirators from the floor, walls, exit traps and inside the nets, scored as dead or alive and as fed or unfed and identified to species using a binocular microscope. Live mosquitoes were held for 24 h with sugar solution in paper cups to determine delayed mortality.</p><p>The primary outcomes were:</p><p>&#x025aa; deterrence - reduction in hut entry relative to the control huts fitted with untreated nets</p><p>&#x025aa; treatment induced exiting - the proportion of mosquitoes found in exit traps relative to control huts</p><p>&#x025aa; blood-feeding inhibition - the proportional reduction in blood feeding relative to untreated nets</p><p>&#x025aa; mortality - the proportion of mosquitoes killed</p><p>The first and third of these outcomes are indicators of personal protection which can be estimated by the equation:</p><p>% personal protection = 100(B<sub>u </sub>- B<sub>t</sub>)/B<sub>u</sub></p><p>where B<sub>u = </sub>is the total number blood-fed in the huts with untreated nets, and B<sub>t </sub>is the total number blood-fed in the huts with treated nets.</p><p>The overall killing effect of the treatment was estimated by the equation:</p><p>Insecticidal effect (%) = 100(K<sub>t </sub>- K<sub>u</sub>)/T<sub>u</sub></p><p>where K<sub>t </sub>is the number killed in the huts with treated nets, K<sub>u </sub>is the number dying in the huts with untreated nets, and T<sub>u </sub>is the total collected from the huts with untreated nets.</p><p>The criteria for approval was that the PermaNet 3.0 LN washed 20 times or more should perform according to these outcomes equal to or better than a conventionally treated net washed till just before exhaustion.

This synergy was manifested in higher mortality, reduced passage through the holes and reduced feeding rates with netting treated with PBO-deltamethrin. The synergy in tunnels against pyrethroid resistant <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus </italic>was progressively lost over 10 washes and fully lost after 20 washes. Cone bioassays on resistant <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus </italic>confirmed the loss of synergy over 20 washes.</p><p>In the experimental hut trial both PermaNet 2.0 and PermaNet 3.0 induced high rates of mortality against pyrethroid susceptible <italic>An. gambiae </italic>at 0 and 20 washes and both rates exceeded that of the CTN washed to just before cut off point. On the basis of this result PermaNet 3.0, like PermaNet 2.0 before it, warrants interim approval by WHO as a LLIN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. It was encouraging that the <italic>An. gambiae </italic>blood feeding rate associated with the zero washed PermaNet 3.0 was lower than with the zero washed PermaNet 2.0. After 20 washes, however, the feeding rates between PermaNet 3.0 and PermaNet 2.0 no longer differed, indicating a loss of activity under field conditions.</p><p>It was initially encouraging that the mortality rate of pyrethroid resistant <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus </italic>in huts with zero washed PermaNet 3.0 was higher than that with zero washed PermaNet 2.0. This indicated the PBO in PermaNet 3.0 was exerting a partial synergism against <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic>. As per tunnel test results the synergism in the huts was fully lost after 20 washes. Blood feeding rates in <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus </italic>in the huts did not differ between PermaNet 2.0 and 3.0 either in unwashed or 20 washed nets. According to Khayrandish &#x00026; Wood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], WHO used synergists and nerve recordings to explore the resistance in <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus </italic>from this region, enhanced oxidases and a nerve insensitivity mechanism, probably <italic>kdr</italic>, are responsible for pyrethroid resistance.</p><p>The roof netting showed little change in chemical content (either in deltamethrin or in PBO) after twenty washes. Certainly any small change observed was not sufficient to explain the large difference in efficacy (mortality) between unwashed and 20 times washed PermaNet 3.0 in cones, tunnel tests or experimental huts. This indicates that deltamethrin, the PBO or both compounds are depleted from the surface of the fibre after 20 washes and fail to migrate sufficiently from the core to the surface to allow full regeneration. It would seem that PBO rather than deltamethrin is the compound that remains locked in the fibre. The evidence for this stems from the zero difference in mortality in the tunnel tests between the 20 times washed PermaNet 3.0 and the 20 times washed PermaNet 2.0 against resistant Cx. quinquefasciatus taken together with the higher mortality with 20 times washed PermaNet 3.0 against susceptible <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus </italic>(S): deltamethrin must still be present on the surface of both PermaNet 2.0 and 3.0 and causing some mortality of susceptible <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus </italic>but there seems little or no PBO left on the surface of PermaNet 3.0 netting to allow synergy in resistant <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic>.</p><p>It is possible insufficient time was given between washing and tunnel testing for regeneration of PBO to occur. However, the evidence from the hut trial indicates this is not the reason since over the six weeks in the huts the PermaNet 3.0 washed 20 times showed no difference in performance to the PermaNet 2.0 washed 20 times, but during this six week interval there was plenty of time for the PBO to migrate to the surface of fibres. The no difference in <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus </italic>mortality between PermaNet 3.0 washed 20 times and PermaNet 2.0 washed 20 times suggests a failure to regenerate.</p><p>It is possible that the higher mortality initially seen with PermaNet 3.0 relative to PermaNet 2.0 is due more to the higher loading dose of deltamethrin than to any contribution of PBO. An appropriate control to test this hypothesis - a 'PermaNet 3.0' loaded with the same dosage of deltamethrin but containing no PBO - was not available for testing. Such a control should always be considered in future testing of combination nets.</p><p>At present there is limited evidence that mosquitoes contact the roof of the net while seeking access to the host. This may not hold for all species, and more corroborative observations are required. Unless the majority of mosquitoes respond to host odour or convection plumes in this way, the 2-in-1 concept as a tactic for managing resistance management tactic is flawed. The higher mortality of <italic>Culex </italic>in huts with unwashed PermaNet 3.0 versus unwashed PermaNet 2.0 does, however, provide some support to the concept.</p><p>It is important to note that the laboratory tests and Phase II trials reported here refer to efficacy before and after standardized washing rather than to performance under long term household use. There is limited temporal dimension to this work because the interval between the start of washing and the completion of the trials was only three months. Because pyrethroids used on nets have low vapour pressure a pyrethroid LLIN that showed high efficacy after 20 Phase II washes might, quite reasonably, be expected to remain efficacious for at least three years of household use, as reported recently for PermaNet 2.0 and Olyset LLINs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. We have no information on how long the PBO component of PermaNet 3.0 would remain effective in the field as the synergist incorporated into netting may have different physical characteristics to pyrethroids. By contrast there is reasonable expectation on the basis of current knowledge that the pyrethroid in conventional LLIN would last for three years or more [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p><p>The negligible difference in mortality between PermaNet 3.0 and 2.0 against <italic>An. gambiae </italic>in huts either before or after washing would seem unlikely to provide additional control of <italic>An. gambiae </italic>populations; besides, mortality with PermaNet 2.0 was already very high. With pyrethroid resistant <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus </italic>almost half survived exposure to PermaNet 3.0 in the huts and this proportion increased to 64% after washing. As a combination net designed to control pyrethroid resistance mediated by mixed function oxidase mechanisms the capacity of PermaNet 3.0 to control pyrethroid multiple resistant mosquitoes or prevent selection of resistance appears limited.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>PT carried out the hut trials, supervised the laboratory tests, analysed the data and drafted the report.
