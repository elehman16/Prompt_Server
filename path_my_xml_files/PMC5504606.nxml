Severe infections like pneumonia and sepsis contribute to almost a quarter of these deaths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and are also a major cause of hospitalization in infants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Mortality due to severe infections in developing country settings is substantial despite antibiotic therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Effective interventions that can be added to standard therapy for severe infections are required to improve clinical outcomes and case fatality.</p><p id="Par37">In India, more than a quarter of the annual 1 million neonatal deaths can be ascribed to such severe infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Also in Nepal, sepsis is a leading cause of death in neonates, and the second most frequent reason for hospitalization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. While appropriate antibiotics are available in many hospitals in low and middle income countries, second-line antibiotics may be unavailable or are prohibitively expensive in peripheral health facilities. It is important to develop inexpensive, effective and accessible interventions that can be added to standard therapy for severe infections to improve treatment outcomes and reduce case fatality.</p><p id="Par38">In a recent randomized placebo-controlled trial conducted in 3 tertiary hospitals in New Delhi, we found that 10&#x000a0;mg of elemental zinc given daily to 7 to 120&#x000a0;days old infants treated with antibiotics for probable serious bacterial infection (PSBI) carried a 40% (95% CI 10 to 60%) efficacy against treatment failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The absolute risk reduction was 6.8% (95% CI 1.5 to 12.0%), indicating that 15 (95% CI 8 to 67) infants would need to be treated with zinc in addition to antibiotics to prevent one treatment failure. We saw an even larger efficacy against treatment failure (54%; CI 20 to 74%) when analysis was restricted to 1&#x000a0;week to 2&#x000a0;month old infants, among whom only 11 (95% CI 6 to 37) would need to receive adjunct zinc treatment to prevent one treatment failure. This study of 700 infants is, to our knowledge, the first report of the efficacy of zinc in the treatment of PSBI in infants. However, the study was not powered to estimate the effect of zinc on case fatality. Thus, although the point estimate for the efficacy against death was the same as that against treatment failure, (43%; CI &#x02212;23% to 73%), the study was not designed or powered to measure an effect on death and thereby not a strong driver for policy change.</p><p id="Par39">Our study question is whether adjunct treatment with zinc will reduce the risk of death in infants with clinical severe infection. It is based on the promising findings of the above-mentioned trial and on the knowledge that zinc is crucial for immune function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. It is our hope that our large, multicentre study powered to examine the effect of zinc on case fatality from clinical severe infection would contribute critical evidence towards revising treatment recommendations for low resource settings in South Asia and elsewhere.</p><p id="Par40">The aim of this double-blind randomized placebo controlled trial is to measure the efficacy of zinc administered orally as an adjunct to standard therapy to infants aged 3&#x000a0;days to 2&#x000a0;months hospitalized with clinical severe infection on reducing case fatality during hospitalization. We also propose to estimate the efficacy of zinc on reducing the extended case fatality risk, i.e. the risk of death until 12&#x000a0;weeks from the day of enrolment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design and aims</title><p id="Par41">Our hypothesis is that 10&#x000a0;mg of elemental zinc administered orally as an adjunct to standard therapy to infants aged 3&#x000a0;days up to 2&#x000a0;months (59&#x000a0;days) hospitalized with clinical severe infection identified using an adaptation of the WHO Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses (IMCI) criteria will bring about a relative case fatality risk reduction of at least 30%, both during hospitalization for the illness in question as well as for the period up to 12&#x000a0;weeks from the day of enrolment.</p><p id="Par42">Death being our primary outcome, the secondary outcome measures will be (i) failure of primary treatment, defined as a need to change antibiotics OR requirement for life support OR death, (ii) time to cessation of clinical signs, (iii) time to discharge, and (iv) death or severe illness at any time after discharge from hospital until 12&#x000a0;weeks from day of enrolment.

These are secondary level hospitals with similar standard of care, which will simplify standardization of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). Each of the seven hospitals has a large patient load, including of young infants with clinical severe infection. The overall implementation of the study will be coordinated by the Pediatric Biology Centre (PBC) at the Translational Health Science and Technology Institute (THSTI), in Faridabad, India; PBC will also directly oversee the work in the 4 Indian hospitals and will coordinate the immunobiological studies. The implementation of the study at the Nepal hospital sites will be coordinated by IOM. The Centre for International Health (CIH) at the University of Bergen and Innlandet Hospital Trust will work closely with THSTI, and IOM both in the overall coordination as well as in the immunobiological studies.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Flow diagram of the trial</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="40360_2017_162_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>

Infants 3&#x000a0;days to 2&#x000a0;months of age attending the out patients department (OPD) or emergency services of the hospitals will be screened by a study nurse/medical officer and will be eligible for enrolment if any one or more of these five signs are present: hypothermia (axillary temperature&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;35.5&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C), movement only when stimulated, stopped feeding well, severe chest indrawing and fever (axillary temperature&#x000a0;&#x02265;&#x000a0;38.0&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C). To avoid including neonates in whom birth asphyxia is the reason for his or her signs, a criterion for inclusion will be that the infant should have been well at some point from birth till the current illness episode.

Ethics clearance has been obtained from all the seven hospitals, THSTI Institutional Ethics Committee (IEC), Nepal Health and Research Council (NHRC), and Regional Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics (REK) in Norway. Parents/guardians of infants eligible for the trial will be asked for written informed consent or thumbprint from those who are illiterate (in the presence of an impartial witness), declaring their willingness to have their infant participate in the trial. The participant information sheet will be in the local language and will detail the focus of the study along with the associated risks and benefits for the infant. We will inform protocol changes in the clinical trial registry as well as the individual Ethics Committees. When necessary, we will also seek permission before changing the protocol and altering the inclusion and exclusion criteria.</p></sec><sec id="FPar4"><title>Consent for publication</title><p id="Par117">Not relevant.</p></sec><sec id="FPar5"><title>Competing interests</title><p id="Par118">The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec id="FPar6"><title>Publisher&#x02019;s note</title><p id="Par119">Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></sec></notes><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Oza</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Hogan</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Chu</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Perin</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhu</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Global, regional, and national causes of under-5 mortality in 2000&#x02013;15: an updated systematic analysis with implications for the sustainable development goals</article-title><source>Lancet</source><year>2016</year><volume>388</volume><fpage>3027</fpage><lpage>3035</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/S0140-6736(16)31593-8</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">27839855</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CR2"><label>2.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Levels and trends in child mortality 2015.
