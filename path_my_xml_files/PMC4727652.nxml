Venlafaxine (Sobhan Daru, Rasht, Iran) was administered 75 mg/day during the first week, then increased to 150 mg/day and continued until the end of the study in the third group. Investigators and patients were blind to the treatments by preprinted medication code labels. The patients received the doses for a 4-week period and returned for follow-up at days 2, 7, 14, and 35. During the study period, patients were allowed to take acetaminophen with a maximum dose of 4 g/day. The primary outcome was subjective pain as assessed by the Visual analogue Pain Intensity (VAS-PI), and rated daily by patients. Patients&#x02019; daily ratings were tabulated by a researcher for calculation of mean scores at the beginning of the trial and at 2, 7, 14, and 35 days during the trial. The pain VAS is a continuous scale comprised of a horizontal or vertical line, usually 10 centimeters (100 mm) in length, anchored by 2 verbal descriptors, one for each symptom extreme.</p><p>Secondary outcomes consisted of quality of life assessments and a percentage of patients achieving at least 50% reduction in pain intensity. The interference of pain with sleep and mood and patients normal work (including both work outside the home and housework) was assessed by Brief Pain Inventory (short form)<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> in the first and last visit. The Brief Pain Inventory is an 11-point Likert scale (0: no interference; 10: completely interferes). At the beginning of the trial, general and neurological examination was performed in all patients and also during each visit, vital signs, weight, and ECG were assessed, and a complete physical examination was performed and drug adverse events were evaluated. Glycated hemoglobin and lipid profile was measured at first visit, and complete blood count and differentiation, liver function test, urea, creatine, and sodium were carried out before treatment and after 35 days to detect any hematological or hepatic or biochemical complications. Fasting blood sugar (FBS) and blood sugar 2 hpp (2 hour postprandial) were measured on the first and last visit. If the result of pretreatment hepatic tests was twice the normal range, the patient was excluded from the study, and when an increase in liver function test occurred at the end of the study the medication was discontinued.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Patient&#x02019;s demographic and clinical information were recorded in a predesigned checklist. We estimated a total sample size of 255 patients accounting for 10% drop out assuming a reduction of 50% of VAS between the groups considering 5% level of significance and 80% power. The data were analyzed with the Statistical Package for Social Sciences software version 19 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Demographic variables and efficacy parameters of 3 groups were compared. Descriptive statistics were used to report variables of each medication group and also for total participants. Post hoc one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used for comparison between the groups. Comparison for pain score on VAS across time in all the 3 groups was carried out using repeated measures ANOVA. Paired sample t-test was used for comparing mean scores of sleep, mood, and work interference across time in each group. Results were reported as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation (SD), and statistical significance was recognized at <italic>p</italic>-values &#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Patient distribution</title><p>Two hundred and fifty-seven of 422 patients with diabetic neuropathy admitted to the diabetic clinic were randomized.
