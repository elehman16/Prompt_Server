The international normalised ratio (INR) is widely used to provide a reliable standardised measure of anticoagulant control <xref rid="pone.0098323-International1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Anticoagulation also poses an iatrogenic risk to health from haemorrhage and it is important to maintain a level of anticoagulation that minimises the combined thromboembolic and haemorrhagic risks.</p><p>Interest in optimising the level of anticoagulant control has led to research studies of the association between anticoagulant control and clinical outcome <xref rid="pone.0098323-Acar1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0098323-Oake1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Characterising anticoagulant control is fundamental to such studies and depends on several factors:</p><list list-type="alpha-upper"><list-item><p>Definition of <underline>target INR range</underline>: In a clinical population, it is not feasible to analyse anticoagulant control as a continuously varying quantity (i.e. INR) over time. Therefore, researchers have tended to derive aggregate measures of anticoagulant control, such as the proportion of follow-up time during which a patient's INR was within a specified target range. This percentage depends critically on the target range adopted.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The method used to <underline>measure anticoagulant control</underline>: Azar et al. <xref rid="pone.0098323-Azar1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> described several alternatives that have been used by researchers to translate INR readings at discrete time points into a measure of anticoagulant control.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The method of describing the <underline>profile of anticoagulant control over time</underline>: many studies have described anticoagulant control by deriving some measure of the extent to which a patient's INR was within a specified target range during follow-up. However, the consequences of being outside the target range may differ depending on (a) the proportion of time during which a patient's INR was too high or too low during follow-up and (b) the extent to which the INR diverged from the target range. Two patients with the same proportion of follow-up time within the target range could have very different profiles of time out of control, e.g. one mainly high, the other mainly low, potentially with different clinical consequences; similarly, two patients with the same proportion of follow-up within the target range could have INR levels which diverged from the target range to a greater or less extent when outside the target range.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The <underline>method of analysis</underline>: Anticoagulant control can be characterised across all available follow-up, or as a &#x02018;time varying&#x02019; measure (multiple measures of anticoagulant control determined for different periods of follow-up, e.g. 6 monthly or annually).</p></list-item></list><p>Any attempt to characterise anticoagulation control involves a compromise. Measurements of anticoagulation using INR are subject to inter-individual biological variation in the plasma levels of coagulation factors (for a given INR) and to imprecision in INR measurement in the laboratory. INR can also vary within individual patients over time due to fluctuations in dietary vitamin K, drug interactions or poor compliance.</p><p>The aim of this paper is to illustrate how decisions about factors A-D can have important implications for the characterisation of anticoagulant control and, hence, for studies that aim to measure anticoagulant control or investigate associations between anticoagulant control and outcome. We also report a new categorical &#x02018;profile&#x02019; measure of anticoagulant control to characterise the predominant nature of the deviation when a patient is not well controlled.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>Data from an existing randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing two second generation mechanical bileaflet heart valves, St Jude Medical and Carbomedics, were used to illustrate the consequences of different decisions about factors A, B and C. Details of the methods of this study, and 5 and 10 year follow-up with respect to mortality and valve-related events (the key outcomes in the RCT), have been reported previously <xref rid="pone.0098323-Bryan1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098323-Lim1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. No difference in outcome between valves was observed <xref rid="pone.0098323-Bryan1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098323-Lim1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> and the analyses reported in this paper treat patients from both arms of the trial as a single cohort. The trial was approved by a UK National Health Service Research Ethics Committee. Anonymised data were analysed for this paper.</p><p>The cohort was divided into two groups; (a) participants who had an aortic valve replacement only (AVR) and (b) participants who had a mitral valve replacement with or without an aortic valve replacement (MVR).</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Description of follow-up methods</title><p>Follow-up information was obtained by an annual questionnaire to survivors (by telephone), requesting participants to provide the last 10 INR readings for the year of follow-up (from their anticoagulant history booklet filled out by the physician), and details of any thromboembolic or bleeding events requiring hospitalisation. Participants who did not send back their questionnaires were sent a reminder and were then telephoned. Clinical events were clarified by contacting the participant's family physician or hospital cardiologist when there was uncertainty about the details of the event.</p><p>When INR readings were unstable or out-of-range, it is likely that more frequent measurements were taken until the INR was back in-range. There may also have been periods when anticoagulation might have been suspended or reversed for a surgical procedure or serious bleeding. Even in such cases the last 10 INR readings available from the patient diary were used, to avoid restricting the variability of anticoagulation control when patients' ongoing management or other circumstances may have caused the INR to become unstable.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Factor A: Definitions of target INR ranges</title><p>The RCT on which analyses in this paper are based was carried out between 1992 and 2004. During this time, three target INR ranges were being recommended in guidelines and are likely to have directed anticoagulation for trial participants:</p><list list-type="roman-upper"><list-item><p>2.0 to 4.0 <xref rid="pone.0098323-Butchart1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>;</p></list-item><list-item><p>2.5 to 3.5 <xref rid="pone.0098323-1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>;</p></list-item><list-item><p>2.5 to 3.0 for the AVR group and 3.0 to 3.5 for the MVR group <xref rid="pone.0098323-Hirsh1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p></list-item></list><p>Since the trial concluded, more recent recommendations have been made <xref rid="pone.0098323-Leiria1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> and usual practice has tended to use lower INR ranges, largely based on observational evidence that lower INR values are safe. We have nevertheless carried out the analyses with the above INR ranges because they are contemporary for the period of the trial and allow us to illustrate the consequences of adopting different ranges.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Factor B: Measures of anticoagulant control</title><p>We investigated two ways of measuring anticoagulant control, namely the proportion of follow-up INR <underline>readings</underline>
<xref rid="pone.0098323-Butchart1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> and the proportion of follow-up <underline>time</underline>, when the INR was within the specified target range, too low or too high. When calculating the proportion of follow-up time, the INR level was interpolated on a daily basis from the dates on which INR readings were available <xref rid="pone.0098323-Azar1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Other measures exist <xref rid="pone.0098323-Azar1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> but were not considered here.</p><p>The first method expresses the proportion of INR readings within the defined target range as a proportion of all INR readings during follow-up, providing &#x02265;10 INR readings are available. This measure is abbreviated here to &#x02018;percentage of readings&#x02019; in control, too low or too high (PoR<sub>in control</sub>, PoR<sub>too low</sub>. PoR<sub>too high</sub>). It has been reported to give the lowest estimates of anticoagulant control <xref rid="pone.0098323-Azar1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. The method takes no direct account of time under observation, unless INR readings are assumed to be available at constant intervals for all patients under observation for the entire duration of follow-up.</p><p>The second method is based on interpolating anticoagulant control on a day-to-day basis, assuming that the INR level changes linearly between readings. Anticoagulant control is expressed as a &#x02018;percentage of time&#x02019; (PoT<sub>in control</sub>, PoT<sub>too low</sub>. PoT<sub>too high</sub>). If gaps in time between readings are longer than 56 days, these periods of time do not contribute to PoT<sub>in control</sub> for individual patients. (There were gaps of this kind during follow-up for our dataset because the last ten sequential INR readings provided by patients often did not cover a full year; <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0098323.s001">Figure S1</xref></bold>.)</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Factor C: Describing the profile of anticoagulant control over time</title><p>As well as calculating the PoT<sub>in control</sub> for different target INR ranges, we divided the <italic>time out of control</italic> into the PoT when the INR was too low (PoT<sub>too low</sub>) and too high (PoT<sub>too high</sub>). PoT<sub>in control</sub>, PoT<sub>too high</sub> and PoT<sub>too low</sub> are correlated because they must sum to the total eligible follow-up time.</p><p>In order to describe the <bold><italic>profile</italic></bold> of anticoagulant control for individual patients, we created four mutually exclusive categories based on PoT<sub>in control</sub>, PoT<sub>too high</sub> and PoT<sub>too low</sub>:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Good: PoT<sub>in control</sub>&#x02265;67%</p></list-item><list-item><p>Fair: (PoT<sub>in control</sub>&#x0003c;33%) AND (PoT<sub>too low</sub>&#x02265;33%) AND (PoT<sub>too high</sub>&#x02265;33%)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Too high: (PoT<sub>too high</sub>&#x02265;33%) AND (PoT<sub>too low</sub>&#x0003c;33%)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Too low: (PoT<sub>too low</sub>&#x02265;33%) AND (PoT<sub>too high</sub>&#x0003c;33%)</p></list-item></list><p>Fair control describes INR outside the target range most of the time but approximately centred on the target range, with roughly equal PoT<sub>too low</sub> and PoT<sub>too high</sub>. &#x02018;Too high&#x02019; and &#x02018;too low&#x02019; represent INR predominantly high or low, respectively, when out of range.</p><p>We also divided the distribution of observations of PoT<sub>in control</sub> in two ways, to create two ordinal measures of anticoagulant control, each with four levels:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>four groups with equal numbers of observations (i.e. quartiles of the distribution);</p></list-item><list-item><p>four groups of equal width defined according to the PoT<sub>in control</sub> (i.e. 0&#x02013;24%, 25&#x02013;49%, 50&#x02013;74%, 75&#x02013;100%).</p></list-item></list><p>We created ordinal variables for the PoT<sub>too high</sub> and PoT<sub>too low</sub> in the same way. Like the profile measure, these ordinal measures of PoT<sub>in control</sub>, PoT<sub>too high</sub> and PoT<sub>too low</sub> collectively characterise the predominant deviation in an individual when the INR is not in control but require three variables to be inspected rather than one. (Strictly, only two of the three variables need to be examined because the third can be derived from the other two.)</p><p>We calculated all measures of anticoagulant control both for the entire duration of follow-up for a participant and annually for full or part-years of follow-up. The means/medians of the distributions for overall and annual measures will be similar if anticoagulant control does not change systematically over time. However, the distribution of the overall measure will inevitably be less dispersed because outlying annual observations will be smoothed when combined over all years of follow-up.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Cumulative frequency distributions of PoR<sub>in control</sub> and PoT<sub>in control</sub> were generated and summarised graphically for different target INR ranges. Discrepancies between overall measures of PoR<sub>in control</sub> and PoT<sub>in control</sub> were illustrated by Bland-Altman limits of agreement plots <xref rid="pone.0098323-Bland1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Changes in categorisation of anticoagulant control over successive years were summarised as cross tabulations. Our aim was purely descriptive and we did not use statistical hypothesis tests except when examining the relationships between differences and averages in Bland-Altman plots. All analyses were carried out using STATA v12.1 (Stata Corporation, Texas).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Study population</title><p>Details of the study population have been described elsewhere <xref rid="pone.0098323-Bryan1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098323-Lim1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Participants (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;485) were recruited from 1992 to 1996; 69 who provided &#x0003c;10 INR readings are excluded from the analyses. INR data for the remaining 416 were available at latest up to 31 December 2004 when data collection stopped. The total observation time for these 416 participants was 3,499 patient years.</p><p>Patients with insufficient INR data were more likely to have died during follow-up (57/69, 82.6%; 32/42 in the AVR group and 25/27 in the MVR group) than patients with adequate INR data (108/416, 26.0%; 49/247 in the AVR group and 59/169 in the MVR group). Similar percentages of patients in AVR and MVR groups had insufficient INR data for analysis (AVR, 42/289, 14.5%; MVR, 27/196, 13.8%). Only 16 of 108 deaths during follow-up were valve related.</p><p>Of 416 participants who had &#x02265;10 INR readings during follow-up, there were 247 in the AVR group and 169 in the MVR group. A total of 27,383 unique, valid INR readings were documented in these patients; 110 did not have dates and were excluded. A total of 23,946 INR readings (87.8% of 27,273) occurred within 56 days after the preceding measurement. The median gap between measurements was 21 days (inter-quartile range 13 to 30 days; see <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0098323.s001">Figure S1</xref></bold>) with a distribution that reflected scheduling of measurements at weekly intervals; the distribution did not differ by AVR/MVR group (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0098323.s001">Figure S1</xref>, b&#x00026;c</bold>). The other 3,327 INR readings which occurred more than 56 days after the preceding measurement caused gaps in the INR record; these gaps arose mainly (65% of 3,327) because of periods of time between sequences of 10 readings recorded for different years of follow-up.</p><p>The median duration of follow-up was 9.0 years and the median number of INR readings per participant was 77 (range 10 to 110). The cumulative frequency distributions of all INR readings were very similar for the AVR and MVR groups; medians, 75th and 99th centiles were 3.0/3.5/5.6 and 3.1/3.6/5.8 respectively (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0098323.s002">Figure S2</xref></bold>).</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>A.

Calculating aggregated measures of anticoagulant control over long durations of follow-up will inevitably obscure any association between anticoagulant control and outcome over short periods of time.

It is important to acknowledge that the INR range to be analysed in a study should depend on the purpose of the analysis. If the purpose is to audit the competence of anticoagulation clinics (an administrative requirement), a narrower range centred on the prescribed target INR for a particular indication is appropriate. If the purpose is to relate INR control to outcome measurements after valve replacement, such as thromboembolism, valve thrombosis, major bleeding and survival, choosing a wider INR range may be more useful.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>Our dataset was relatively small but still included &#x0003e;27,000 individual INR readings and almost 3,500 person years of follow-up. Collection of the data in the context of a RCT is an important strength of the dataset. Participants in the trial had only one of two types of prosthesis. Although the type of heart valve may interact with the association between anticoagulant control and clinical outcome <xref rid="pone.0098323-Cannegieter1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, this does not limit the applicability of our observations about <italic>measuring</italic> anticoagulant control. The distribution of INR readings in this study was very similar to that of Cannegieter and colleagues <xref rid="pone.0098323-Cannegieter1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> and slightly less dispersed than that of Butchart and colleagues <xref rid="pone.0098323-Butchart1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> In so much as self-monitoring regimens for anticoagulant control achieve better control <xref rid="pone.0098323-Koertke1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0098323-Kortke1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, PoT<sub>in control</sub> with self-monitoring might be expected to be less variable over time than observed with our data. However, since INR readings still vary over time with self-monitoring, these regimens would not change our findings with respect to different target ranges and different methods of measuring anticoagulant control.</p><p>The INR ranges that we considered relate to guidelines that were contemporary with the data collection. Current guidelines tend to recommend target INRs, e.g. 2.5 for AVR and 3.0 for MVR, rather than target ranges, in order to avoid the extremes of the ranges being considered equally acceptable by anticoagulation clinics. However, any analysis of the adequacy of anticoagulation control over time (as opposed to the INR target in an anticoagulation clinic) still needs to set a range within which control is considered satisfactory. To this extent, our findings are as applicable now as they were during follow-up to the trial.</p><p>There were some gaps in the INR record for participants. Most of these arose because of the way the data were collected and do not affect the representativeness of the dataset. A small proportion of INR readings (about 4%) were &#x0003e;56 days after the preceding reading and within the sequence of the &#x0201c;last 10 measurements&#x0201d; collected at the annual follow-up. The distribution of time between readings beyond 56 days formed a smooth tail and we have no reason to suspect that omitting these periods of time could have introduced bias.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Proportion of time versus proportion of readings within the target range</title><p>Azar and colleagues, citing Duxbury, pointed out that PoR<sub>in control</sub> may be biased if the number of readings per patient varies and is correlated with anticoagulant control <xref rid="pone.0098323-Morgan1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. They compared different methods for quantifying anticoagulant control, highlighting that it is PoT<sub>in control</sub> rather than PoR<sub>in control</sub> that is important. We completely concur with this view and recommend that interpolating the INR level between readings should always be used in future.</p><p>Azar and colleagues, based on a single target range (2.8 to 4.8) found that PoR<sub>in control</sub> was consistently, and considerably, less than PoT<sub>in control</sub> (63% and 77% overall, respectively). In contrast, we found that medians for PoR and PoT<sub>in control</sub> were similar and that neither was consistently larger. The difference between medians was greatest (PoR<sub>in control</sub> being smaller) for the widest target range investigated (2.0 to 4.0) and we suspect that the direction of the difference depends on the target INR range used. We believe that, as the PoT<sub>in control</sub> decreases, the difference becomes smaller and reverses (PoR<sub>in control</sub> being larger) for very &#x02018;strict&#x02019; target INR ranges; this view is supported by positive gradients for regression lines (not shown) fitted to the scatter plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0098323-g002">

Because observations are classified into mutually exclusive categories, each category can be modelled relative to &#x02018;good&#x02019; control, in principle allowing the balance between thromboembolic and bleeding risks to be investigated directly.
