Neutralization of the type I IFN gene signature by sifalimumab resulted in coordinated suppression of T cell-related proteins such as soluble IL-2RA, TNF receptor 2 (TNFR2) and IL-18.

DM, PM and IBM are three of the most common inflammatory myopathies [<xref rid="ket413-B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Type I IFNs have been shown to be part of the immunopathogenesis of IIMs [<xref rid="ket413-B2" ref-type="bibr">2&#x02013;7</xref>]. Recently a phase 1b trial of an investigational anti-IFN-&#x003b1; monoclonal antibody, sifalimumab, was completed in adult DM or PM patients (NCT00533091). Gene expression experiments from this study demonstrated suppression of a type I IFN gene signature in both blood and muscle tissue by sifalimumab, along with a positive correlative trend between IFN target neutralization and clinical improvement in myositis patients [<xref rid="ket413-B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Beyond activated type I IFN signalling, IIMs are also characterized by chronic infiltration of activated T cells and, to a lesser extent, B cells in muscle tissue of patients. A perivascular distribution of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and B cells is typical for DM, while PM shows direct attack by activated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells against muscle fibres [<xref rid="ket413-B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Proinflammatory cytokines released from inflammatory cells facilitate the migration of those cells from circulation through cellular adhesion molecules on the endothelial cells in an autoamplificatory mechanism [<xref rid="ket413-B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Type I IFN plays a central role in the dysregulated cytokine and chemokine network involved in myositis pathophysiology. Multiple type I IFN-induced proteins are markedly overexpressed in serum and muscle fibres of DM patients [<xref rid="ket413-B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="ket413-B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="ket413-B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], and the recruitment of Th1 cells through IFN-&#x003b3;-induced protein 10 (IP10) and CXCR3 interaction has been shown to play an important role in DM skin lesions [<xref rid="ket413-B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>In this study we evaluated &#x0003e;100 proteins in the serum of 48 adult DM or PM patients and assessed their correlation with type I IFN signature score and clinical assessments at baseline. Then the downstream effects of sifalimumab on serum protein levels were investigated in association with type I IFN signature neutralization rates. Muscle biopsies from selected patients with high suppression of serum markers were stained for T cell infiltration using an anti-CD3 antibody. Finally, correlative trends between protein level changes and favourable manual muscle test 8 (MMT-8) alterations were examined following administration of sifalimumab.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Study design, subjects, laboratory and clinical measurements</title><p>MI-CP151 was a phase 1b randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of sifalimumab in adult patients with DM or PM (NCT00533091). The detailed trial design, randomization scheme and inclusion and exclusion criteria have been published previously [<xref rid="ket413-B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Briefly, 39 patients received sifalimumab for 6 months with every other week dosing, while 12 patients received placebo for 3 months then switched to sifalimumab for 3 months with seven doses beginning at day 98. All patients were pre-screened for type I IFN gene signature score, which was calculated using 13 type I IFN-inducible genes and reported as a median-fold change relative to a pool of normal control samples. Patients were identified as having an elevated type I IFN gene signature (IFN-hi) if their baseline signature score in blood specimens was &#x02265;2 or their gene signature in muscle specimens was &#x02265;5. IFN target modulation after administration of sifalimumab for IFN-hi patients was defined as the median suppression of the 13 type I IFN-inducible transcripts [<xref rid="ket413-B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>MMT-8 was assessed on a 0&#x02013;10 or expanded 0&#x02013;5 scale to evaluate muscle strength in eight designated muscles, including proximal, distal and axial muscles. The MMT-8 change in response to placebo or sifalimumab was an exploratory endpoint, and reliability testing was not performed on the evaluators. Serum levels of ANAs, anti-ribonucleoprotein (RNP), anti-SSA, anti-Jo-1 and anti-Mi-2 antibodies were assayed using standard methods by Quintiles Laboratories (Durham, NC, USA). The study was approved by the institutional review board at each site and informed patient consent was obtained.</p></sec><sec><title>Serum proteomics profiling and muscle biopsy immunostaining</title><p>Sera from 25 healthy controls (HCs), 27 DM patients and 21 PM patients prior to administration of either placebo or sifalimumab were collected for the characterization of the serological proteome in myositis patients. To compare the effects of placebo and sifalimumab on peripheral protein markers, we procured patient sera on day 98 after drug administration, before placebo-administered patients were switched to sifalimumab dosing. Selected frozen muscle biopsy samples were used for T cell immunostaining with anti-human CD3 antibody.</p><sec><title>Serum proteomics profiling</title><p>All serum samples were kept frozen at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C before shipment to Rules Based Medicine (RBM, Austin, TX, USA) for a multiplexed immunoassay based on Luminex xMAP technology. Measured proteins were chosen based on the literature as well as an RBM Human MAP panel of markers including chemokines, cytokines, hormones, growth factors and antigens. Samples were processed and analysed at RBM according to standard operating procedure. Each of the measured 128 proteins has an established lowest limit of quantitation (LLOQ) and a normal range based on data from &#x0223c;200 HC samples provided by RBM.</p></sec><sec><title>Muscle biopsy immunostaining</title><p>Selected muscle cryosections (5 &#x003bc;m) were mounted on charged slides, fixed in cold acetone for 10 min and allowed to desiccate overnight. Before staining, endogenous peroxidases were quenched using a peroxidase blocking reagent (Dako North America, Carpinteria, CA, USA), followed by two rinses in 1&#x000d7; Tris-buffered saline (TBS; pH 7.2). A protein blocking solution consisting of 1.5% normal goat serum, 0.5% casein and 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS was added to each slide for 30 min. This was followed by incubation with the rabbit anti-human CD3 antibody (Dako North America) at 0.5 &#x003bc;g/ml for 60 min. The slides were washed with 1&#x000d7; TBS and incubated with a peroxidase-labelled polymer conjugated to goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin antibody (Envision+; Dako North America) for 30 min, then washed with 1&#x000d7; TBS. Detection was performed using 3,3&#x02032;-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB; Vector ImmPACT, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) as the chromogen. Slides were washed in dH<sub>2</sub>O, counterstained with Mayer&#x02019;s haematoxylin, dehydrated and mounted with DPX histology mounting medium (Fluka, Sigma-Aldrich).</p></sec><sec><title>Data analysis</title><p>Demographic and clinical features of different groups were compared using Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>-test for continuous variables or Fisher&#x02019;s exact test for discrete variables. Negative analytes were defined as proteins with serum levels below the LLOQ in &#x0003e;70% of all samples, and their distributions in different subject groups were compared by the Fisher&#x02019;s exact test of the number of patients with protein levels higher or lower than its LLOQ. These negative analytes were excluded from further analysis to provide robust assessment of the proteome. Serum levels of positive analytes were log<sub>2</sub>-transformed for statistical comparison. The global proteomics pattern of all the patients and HCs was examined by principal components analysis (PCA). An analysis of variance (ANOVA) model and Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>-test were used to compare serum protein levels among HCs and different groups of myositis patients. Multiple comparison problems were controlled by Benjamin&#x02013;Hochberg (BH) adjustment [<xref rid="ket413-B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Post-treatment changes were assessed by paired <italic>t</italic>-test followed by BH adjustment. The percentage change for each analyte of interest was scaled and then subjected to unsupervised hierarchical clustering. For markers of interest, correlation with the type I IFN gene signature score and clinical and laboratory disease activity measurements were calculated by Spearman&#x02019;s correlation tests and <italic>P</italic>-values were assessed via the asymptotic <italic>t</italic> approximation followed by BH adjustment.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Dysregulated proteins in myositis patients</title><p>Serum specimens were available at baseline and day 98 after treatment for 27 DM and 21 PM patients.

No significant difference was found for the distributions of the 28 negative analytes among HCs and IFN-lo and IFN-hi patients. PCA of 100 positive analytes shows that HCs are clearly separated from myositis patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ket413-F1">Fig. 1</xref>), similar to what is observed in PCA space when using IFN-inducible genes measured in the blood of SLE subjects or normal HCs [<xref rid="ket413-B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Interestingly, 11 IFN-lo patients seemed to group together next to the HCs, while IFN-hi patients deviated more from the HCs. In contrast, DM and PM patients were mixed with each other without a clear partitioning pattern.

Pairwise comparisons demonstrated that 23 proteins had significantly higher concentrations in IFN-hi (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) but not IFN-lo patients compared with HCs, suggesting a unique proteomic feature of IFN-hi myositis patients. Twenty cytokines were up-regulated in our DM or PM patient cohort, many of which have been reported to be overexpressed in muscle tissue sections of IIMs, such as IL-18, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), and B-cell activating factor (BAFF) [<xref rid="ket413-B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="ket413-B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].

When separating patients into two groups using the median value of serum ANGPT2 levels, a significant difference was observed for MMT-8 scores between these groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ket413-F2">Fig. 2</xref>B).

All eight proteins and ANGPT2 were positively correlated with blood IFN signature score, four of which also correlated with muscle IFN score (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ket413-T2">Table 2</xref>). Type I IFN status, disease activity and serum levels of these proteins seem to be interrelated in myositis patients. It is possible that the combination of IFN signature score and serum protein level may be associated with clinical disease measures better than either marker alone. Thus we investigated whether those patients with elevated type I IFN status and higher serum levels of identified proteins had different MMT-8 scores from other patients. Three groups of patients were defined for each protein based on its normal range. One group of patients had both elevated blood IFN signatures and protein levels higher than the upper limit of the normal range for each individual protein. The second group showed either high IFN signatures or high protein levels, but not both. The third group had neither high IFN signatures nor high protein levels. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ket413-F2">Fig. 2</xref>D shows that IFN-hi patients with higher IL-2RA levels had significantly lower MMT-8 scores and thus worse clinical symptoms than patients with neither elevated IFN signatures nor higher levels of the protein marker. The MMT-8 scores for those patients with either higher IL-2RA or IFN scores were in between the previous two groups of patients. The same was true for TNFR2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ket413-F2">Fig. 2</xref>F). Both proteins were significantly higher in IFN-hi patients than IFN-lo patients and HCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ket413-F2">Fig. 2</xref>C and E). These results suggest the association of MMT-8 score with a combination of type I IFN signature and IL-2RA or TNFR2 levels in myositis patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Effects of an anti-IFN-&#x003b1; mAb on serum protein levels of DM or PM patients</title><p>Post-treatment changes for all 47 dysregulated serum proteins in myositis patients were assessed by paired <italic>t</italic>-test. Eleven proteins demonstrated reduced serum levels by sifalimumab, while no protein showed a significant change in placebo-administered patients. Five of these proteins are inducible by type I IFN, including IL-2RA, MCP-1, MCP-2, BAFF and ferritin. A previous report demonstrated a trend of correlation among MMT-8 improvement, blood and muscle type I IFN target neutralization in patients with &#x0003e;20% target neutralization at day 98 [<xref rid="ket413-B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ket413-F3">Fig. 3</xref>, high protein suppression was observed mostly in sifalimumab-administered patients with &#x0003e;20% IFN target neutralization in blood or muscle, but less so in those with a low IFN signature score or &#x0003c;20% IFN target neutralization in blood. Nevertheless, a few IFN-hi patients with &#x0003e;20% target neutralization displayed an increase in those five IFN-inducible proteins. The discordance between mRNA and protein level regulation may reflect the complex post-transcriptional regulation, protein secretion, receptor shedding and negative feedback processes involved in serum proteome regulation.

A &#x0003e; 15% improvement in MMT-8 score is considered a viable clinical endpoint for efficacy in DM and PM.

IL-2RA change at day 98 after sifalimumab administration was significantly different between these two groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ket413-F5">Fig. 5</xref>A). On the other hand, MMT-8 improvement was higher in sifalimumab-administered patients with greater IL-2RA reduction than those with lesser IL-2RA reduction at the threshold from 0 to 40% in 5% increments. A significant difference in MMT-8 change was observed at the thresholds of 5%, 30% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ket413-F5">Fig. 5</xref>B) and 35% reduction of IL-2RA at day 98.

Our results suggest a distinct proteome profile of IFN-hi patients compared with IFN-lo patients and HCs, while the global proteomics pattern seems to be more similar between DM and PM patients. Multiple proteins are elevated in IFN-hi patients only, but not IFN-lo patients compared with HCs. Overexpressed proteins in myositis patients are involved in various biological processes, including regulation of T cell proliferation and activation. The soluble form of IL-2RA is predominantly released by proteolytic cleavage from the activated T cell surface, mainly the Th1 subset of CD4<sup>+</sup> lymphocytes [<xref rid="ket413-B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. TNFR2 plays an important co-stimulatory role for T cells, and the shedding of TNFR2 has been shown to be increased in patients with immunological disorders [<xref rid="ket413-B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. IL-18 is a Th1 cytokine that induces proliferation and differentiation of naive T cells. Previous reports have demonstrated overexpression of three T cell-associated proteins in the serum of IIM patients [<xref rid="ket413-B15" ref-type="bibr">15&#x02013;18</xref>, <xref rid="ket413-B30" ref-type="bibr">30&#x02013;32</xref>]. BAFF, MCP-1 and MCP-2 are also involved in T cell regulation and chemotaxis, among other functions. Elevated BAFF expression in muscle tissue has been shown to be associated with an increased number of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in DM [<xref rid="ket413-B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Immunomodulatory functions of type I IFN include the control of Th1/Th2 function and the regulation of CD8<sup>+</sup> cytotoxic T cell activity and memory. IFN-&#x003b1; has been shown to induce IL-12 receptor and IL-2RA gene expression in human T cells, thus promoting a Th1-type immune response [<xref rid="ket413-B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="ket413-B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Increased serum soluble IL-2RA levels have also been reported following IFN-&#x003b1; therapy in patients with chronic hepatitis C [<xref rid="ket413-B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Our results demonstrated that sifalimumab, but not placebo, administration reduced IL-2RA, TNFR2, IL-18, BAFF, MCP-1 and MCP-2 levels in adult DM or PM patients, which suggests a suppressive effect of type I IFN neutralization on T cell activation and/or chemoattraction that may reduce T cell infiltration in the muscle of myositis patients. CD3 staining results confirmed the suppression of muscle-infiltrating T cells in two selected patients with the highest down-regulation of T cell-associated proteins after administration of sifalimumab. Furthermore, IL-2RA levels correlate with disease activity at baseline and the post-treatment down-regulation correlates with favourable MMT-8 alteration in sifalimumab-administered patients. It is possible that IL-2RA and type I IFN gene signature changes from baseline may serve as a responsive and/or predictive marker of changes in disease activity for IFN-targeted therapy in DM or PM patients. The predictive value of IL-2RA and/or type I IFN gene signatures needs to be confirmed in a larger future study with sufficient statistical power as well as reliability testing in the evaluation of MMT-8 or other clinical measures of response. Serum samples should also be tested prior to day 98 to enable identification of earlier association between biomarker levels and clinical measures of response.</p><p>A previous gene expression study has demonstrated multiple biological pathways that were significantly suppressed following administration of sifalimumab in muscle specimens from DM or PM patients [<xref rid="ket413-B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The top 10 most enriched pathways include the IL-2 signalling pathway, integrin signalling pathway and four T cell-associated pathways such as iCOS-iCOSL signalling in T helper cells and CTLA4 signalling in cytotoxic T lymphocytes. In addition to T cell-associated effects, sifalimumab suppressed expression of transcripts involved in B cell development, phagocytosis in macrophages and monocytes in muscle specimen of myositis patients. The neutralization of a leucocyte index, MHC class I and immunoglobulin signature was significantly correlated with target neutralization of the IFN gene signature [<xref rid="ket413-B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. These effects of sifalimumab in disease tissue may also be related to cytokine changes we have observed in this study. Most cytokines are pleiotropic and affect many different immune cells and inflammatory pathways. MCP-1 and MCP-2 recruit T cells, dendritic cells, monocytes and various other immune cells to the sites of inflammation. MCP-1 was significantly up-regulated in DM and PM muscle [<xref rid="ket413-B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], and its main receptor, CCR2, has been detected in macrophages and T cells of DM and PM patients [<xref rid="ket413-B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. BAFF acts as a potent B cell activator, and its expression was increased along with an increased number of CD19<sup>+</sup> B cells and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in the muscle tissue of DM patients [<xref rid="ket413-B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Thus suppression of MCP-1, MCP-2 and BAFF by sifalimumab may be partially responsible for neutralization of the leucocyte index, immunoglobulin signature and other pathways following neutralization of the type I IFN pathway in myositis patients.</p><p>The Tie2 receptor antagonist, ANGPT2, is a key mediator of endothelial cell activation. High serum ANGPT2 levels have been associated with greater severity and higher activity of SLE and SSc [<xref rid="ket413-B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="ket413-B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. To our knowledge there has not been any report showing the relevance of ANGPT2 in myositis patients. Von Willebrand factor (VWF) is secreted by endothelial cells, and increased levels in the circulation is presumed to be a marker for endothelial perturbation [<xref rid="ket413-B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. VCAM-1 is a cell adhesion molecule that is expressed on blood vessels only after the endothelial cells are stimulated by cytokines. All three proteins can bind to integrins expressed in various types of leucocytes, resulting in adhesion and transmigration of inflammatory cells into multiple organs [<xref rid="ket413-B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="ket413-B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Our results demonstrated elevated serum VWF and VCAM-1 levels in myositis patients, which is consistent with previous reports [<xref rid="ket413-B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="ket413-B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Moreover, we discovered the association of elevated serum ANGPT2 levels with myositis disease activity for the first time. Sifalimumab administration reduced expression of all three endothelium-related proteins, suggesting endothelial cell suppression by type I IFN neutralization through which lymphocyte infiltration may be affected.</p><p>Our results demonstrate a robust overexpression of multiple serum proteins in DM and PM patients, especially those with an elevated type I IFN gene signature at baseline. Sifalimumab but not placebo administration resulted in coordinated suppression of multiple cytokines, adhesion molecules and soluble receptors associated with immune cell activation and movement. In particular, IL-2RA down-regulation correlated with favourable MMT-8 alteration in sifalimumab-administered patients. Together with T cell staining and gene expression profile findings in muscle tissue, our results suggest suppression of activated T cell infiltration into the muscle of myositis patients following inhibition of type I IFN signalling. The link between IL-2RA suppression and favourable MMT-8 alteration suggests the potential of IL-2RA changes from baseline as a responsive and/or predictive marker of changes in disease activity for IFN-targeted therapies in DM and PM patients. Further studies will be needed to test this hypothesis as well as to more extensively investigate the impact of IFN blockade on immune cell infiltration in the muscle of IIM patients.</p><p><boxed-text id="ket413-BOX1" position="float"><caption><title>Rheumatology key messages</title></caption><p>
