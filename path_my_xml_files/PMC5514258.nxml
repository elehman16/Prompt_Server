The World Health Organization classifies 24 subtypes of salivary gland cancers (SGCs), with mucoepidermoid carcinoma, adenoid cystic carcinoma, and adenocarcinoma being the most common histologic subtypes.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref></p><p>The management of SGCs remains a challenge because of their heterogeneous nature, diverse biological behaviors, and low prevalence. In patients without evidence of distant hematogenous metastases, surgery remains the definitive treatment of choice in those with salivary gland malignancies. Outcomes after surgery in early-stage disease are excellent. A retrospective series of patients treated from 1997 to 2002 for parotid gland carcinomas demonstrated 5-year disease-free survival of 86%, with inferior disease-free survival with advanced disease stage according to the 2002 American Joint Committee on Cancer classification.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref></p><p>Risk factors for disease recurrence were examined in a retrospective cohort of 565 patients treated for malignant salivary gland tumors in the Netherlands.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> The risk of local recurrence was increased in patients with T3 and T4 tumors,&#x000a0;incomplete resection, and bone invasion. Regional recurrence was predicted by facial nerve weakness and positive margins on neck dissection, and the risk of distant metastasis was higher among patients with a T3-4, N2-N3 disease, and/or perineural invasion (PNI).</p><p>There is no randomized prospective data in the literature supporting the use of postoperative radiation therapy (RT) in this patient population. The largest study completed regarding adjuvant RT for SGCs investigated 2170 patients from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry. They found that postoperative adjuvant RT is associated with improved overall&#x000a0;survival for high-risk disease (defined as poorly differentiated, undifferentiated, and/or locally advanced T3/4 or N+).<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> Another SEER database study, however, investigated 1241 cases of parotid acinic cell carcinoma and found that adjuvant RT did not provide a tangible overall survival benefit in this population.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> Although SEER offers many potential benefits, there are limited data regarding radiation dose and treatment details such as fraction number, target, and pathological information, which may account for conflicting results seen in SGCs. The National Cancer Database (NCDB) is a database that offers more robust information regarding pathological and treatment information for patients and thus can allow for more detailed studies of underlying patient characteristics important for prognosis.</p><p>Most data regarding adjuvant radiation for SGCs are limited to retrospective series that describe improved local control rates compared with surgical resection alone.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Registry data and single-institution series have consistently demonstrated improving survival among patients with this disease over time, attributed partly to improved surgical techniques and staging techniques from imaging, but largely resulting from the widespread adoption of postoperative RT.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Despite the absence of compelling supporting prospective data, postoperative RT is considered a standard of care for patients with high-risk features after resection. This study uses one of the largest national SGC databases to investigate whether postoperative RT is associated with an overall survival benefit.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>Data source</title><p>The NCDB is supported by the Commission on Cancer and contains deidentified demographic and clinical patient data on approximately 70% of the cancers diagnosed in the United States annually.

Facility type was separated into academic and nonacademic centers (combination of community cancer programs, comprehensive community cancer programs, and other programs). Insurance status was divided into private and government (Medicare and Medicaid) insurance.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><title>Inclusion and exclusion criteria</title><p>We excluded patients with metastatic disease, in situ disease only, those who did not undergo surgical resection, and those who had unknown overall staging. Clinical staging was used to exclude metastatic patients (coded as cM0 in the NCDB). Furthermore, pathologic stage was required because patients with pathologic metastases would not have been surgical candidates. Patients that received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and/or RT were excluded. Among the patients receiving RT, we excluded those receiving palliative doses (&#x0003c;50 Gy), restricting the doses analyzed from 50 to 70 Gy. We excluded any patients undergoing RT &#x0003e;90 days after resection. We focused our analysis on the most frequently represented histologies only, which included adenocarcinoma, mucoepidermoid carcinoma, adenoid cystic carcinoma, acinar cell carcinoma, epithelial-myoepithelial carcinoma, and carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma. After these exclusions, displayed in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>, there were 8243 patients with surgically managed localized salivary cancer of major histologic subtype.<fig id="fig1"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials flow diagram.

To our knowledge, this analysis is the largest study reported to date that compares survival outcomes evaluating the role of adjuvant RT in salivary gland cancers based on adverse prognostic features. A recent study investigated 2210 SGC patients from the NCDB and found that postoperative chemoradiation therapy did not confer a survival benefit over RT alone.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> Our study uses the NCDB to ask more fundamental clinical questions, specifically whether adjuvant RT improves overall survival irrespective of chemotherapy, and to identify the specific subset of patients who stand to benefit from it. Our data suggest that only high-risk patients had a statistically significant improvement in overall survival when they received postoperative RT. For the high-risk group, the HR was 0.76 when patients received RT after surgical resection of their primary malignancy compared with patients who did not receive postoperative adjuvant RT. The intermediate-risk group had a HR of 1.01. In the low-risk group, the HR was 0.85, but this was not statistically significant.</p><p>Here, we define our high-risk group based on generally accepted standards used in other head and neck cancers, which includes positive surgical margin and ECE. Individual randomized studies established that these consensus markers of high-risk disease included a variety of risk factors, although positive margin and ECE emerged as the most important indicators.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Our intermediate-risk group is an amalgam of the lesser but still important risk factors from those trials, including LVSI and pT3-pT4 staging as well as higher-risk features of SGCs in general, including adenoid cystic histology. There is, however, a gray area when it comes to grouping these malignancies, and we acknowledge that factors such as number of positive nodes may affect the perception of high risk or intermediate risk in some clinicians' view. Patients within the intermediate-risk group with more advanced features, such as pT4, pN+, LVSI, high or undifferentiated grade, and adenoid cystic histology, more frequently received RT (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;2</xref>). This may confound the survival data for the intermediate group. Furthermore, it&#x000a0;is&#x000a0;possible for patients to present with multiple intermediate-risk factors that may increase their overall disease risk. These patients may have been more likely to receive adjuvant radiation, further confounding the survival data for the intermediate-risk group. Conversely, patients in our study who were considered low risk simply based on the absence of these features may have been in a higher risk group in reality given the presence of features, such as PNI or close margins, that are not captured in the NCDB. Finally, RT is used for local control, which is not captured in this study. Despite the lack of overall survival benefit for lower risk groups, low- and intermediate-risk patients may potentially benefit from RT because of improved local disease control.</p><p>The NCDB confers several benefits over other population databases, including a larger sample size, broader inclusion of ages, detailed pathologic assessment, and the availability of in-depth RT details including dose and fractionation. The NCDB has several limitations, however. Although it provides extensive information regarding patient demographics, extent of disease, treatment regimens, and long-term overall survival, there is no central review of the data. All centers participating in the NCDB are Commission on Cancer&#x02013;designated centers, which lends credibility to its overall fidelity. The database also does not include local recurrence data; therefore, we are unable to assess local control after treatment. Furthermore, PNI was not reported on the NCDB, which may have allowed for a clearer investigation to the importance of PNI in terms of prognosis. In our study, we adjusted for all known significant variables; however, it is possible that imbalances exist in unknown or uncaptured variables that may alternatively explain the improved survival associated with postoperative RT in the high- and intermediate-risk groups. Finally, the NCDB does not capture data regarding treatment toxicity, which makes it difficult to assess the true cost-benefit ratio of adding RT to patients' treatment regimens.</p><p>Our study demonstrates an overall survival benefit in SGC patients undergoing adjuvant radiation with high-risk adverse features. In the low- and intermediate-risk groups, although a survival benefit was not seen, a benefit in terms of locoregional control could not be assessed. In particular, the intermediate-risk group warrants further study to better understand how various risk factors interact with each other to determine which patients benefit the most from adjuvant radiation. Regarding adjuvant chemoradiation in this setting, the benefit of concurrent cisplatin along with RT is being prospectively studied with Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 1008. As results from this trial are awaited, this study provides further rationale for the consideration of adjuvant RT in patients with SGC and adverse features.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list
