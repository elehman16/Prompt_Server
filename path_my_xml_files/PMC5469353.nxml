The application of robotic rehabilitation to the treatment of other neurological injuries is less developed, despite indications that strategies successful for restoration of motor capability following stroke may benefit individuals with incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI) as well. Although recent studies suggest that robot-aided rehabilitation might be beneficial after incomplete SCI, it is still unclear what type of robot-aided intervention contributes to motor recovery.</p></sec><sec id="ST2"><title>Methods</title><p>We developed a novel assist-as-needed (AAN) robotic controller to adjust challenge and robotic assistance continuously during rehabilitation therapy delivered via an upper extremity exoskeleton, the MAHI Exo-II, to train independent elbow and wrist joint movements. We further enrolled seventeen patients with incomplete spinal cord injury (AIS C and D levels) in a parallel-group balanced controlled trial to test the efficacy of the AAN controller, compared to a subject-triggered (ST) controller that does not adjust assistance or challenge levels continuously during therapy. The conducted study is a stage two, development-of-concept pilot study.</p></sec><sec id="ST3"><title>Results</title><p>We validated the AAN controller in its capability of modulating assistance and challenge during therapy via analysis of longitudinal robotic metrics. For the selected primary outcome measure, the pre&#x02013;post difference in ARAT score, no statistically significant change was measured in either group of subjects. Ancillary analysis of secondary outcome measures obtained via robotic testing indicates gradual improvement in movement quality during the therapy program in both groups, with the AAN controller affording greater increases in movement quality over the ST controller.</p></sec><sec id="ST4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The present study demonstrates feasibility of subject-adaptive robotic therapy after incomplete spinal cord injury, but does not demonstrate gains in arm function occurring as a result of the robot-assisted rehabilitation program, nor differential gains obtained as a result of the developed AAN controller. Further research is warranted to better quantify the recovery potential provided by AAN control strategies for robotic rehabilitation of the upper limb following incomplete SCI.</p><p><bold><uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</uri> registration number</bold>: NCT02803255.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>robot-aided rehabilitation</kwd><kwd>assist-as-needed therapy</kwd><kwd>motor learning</kwd><kwd>incomplete spinal cord injury</kwd><kwd>adaptive control</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="9"/><table-count count="5"/><equation-count count="7"/><ref-count count="45"/><page-count count="18"/><word-count count="13445"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction" id="S1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p>The annual incidence of spinal cord injury (SCI), not including those who die at the scene of injury, is approximately 40 cases per million in the United States or approximately 12,000 new cases each year (National Spinal Cord Injury Statistical Center, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). SCI primarily affects young adults, with an average age at injury of 41&#x02009;years and average lifetime costs exceeding a million dollars per subject in the U.S. Neurologically induced deficits in motor function are common following complete and incomplete tetraplegia and result from partial or complete paralysis of muscles. Complete paralysis results in the inability to activate muscles below the level of injury. Partial paralysis occurs from disruption to some but not all neural pathways innervating muscles. 40.8% of survivors are subject to incomplete tetraplegia, followed by 21.6% of survivors categorized as complete paraplegia, 21.4% categorized as incomplete paraplegia and 15.8% as complete tetraplegia. As a result of the injury, two-thirds of SCI survivors are left with some functional deficit to the upper extremity, which contributes to reduced independence in activities of daily living. Improvements in arm and hand function may increase independence in self-care, increase engagement in social activities, decrease caregiver burden, and improve quality of life.</p><p>It has recently been suggested that repetitive movement exercise can support recovery after SCI by enhancing some form of plasticity intrinsic in the central nervous system (Raineteau and Schwab, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Cai et al., <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Lynskey et al., <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Onifer et al., <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Given the association between treatment intensity and potential for motor recovery, robotic technologies have been used to automate repetitive movement exercise after incomplete spinal cord injury lesions. Most of the existing research efforts in SCI rehabilitation have addressed gait training (Hornby et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Shin et al., <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), whereas robotic training of upper extremity function after SCI is much less developed, with only a few case studies presented so far (Yozbatiran et al., <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Cortes et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Such case studies demonstrated feasibility of robotic training after incomplete SCI, but could not demonstrate statistically significant gains in motor function achieved via the intervention. This is in contrast to the field of robot-assisted stroke rehabilitation, where large-scale trials have shown that robotic intervention can safely and effectively induce recovery in upper extremity motor function after stroke (Lo et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Klamroth-Marganska et al., <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).</p><p>Robots are capable of automating movement therapy according to a wide variety of programmable control modes. Numerous investigators applied dynamic systems and control theory to formulate robot controllers suitable for poststroke rehabilitation (Marchal Crespo and Reinkensmeyer, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Different controller implementations have been proposed, each focusing on a specific aspect of robotic therapy, such as assisting movements only if they are not properly timed (Krebs et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>), modulating error by perturbing movements during therapy (Patton et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>), guiding joints along predetermined, time-independent trajectories (Banala et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>), and combining real-time subject force estimation with adaptation of feedforward (Wolbrecht et al., <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>) or feedback and feedforward force assistance (Pehlivan et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Although some details differ with each implementation, the rationale behind development of a specific control mode for rehabilitation therapy is mostly inspired by prior human subject studies (Lewis and Byblow, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Hogan et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>), suggesting that intensive therapy delivered by robotic interaction modes aimed at maximizing the active participation of the subject would be a catalyst for the process of neural plasticity underlying motor recovery after stroke (Mehrholz et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).</p><p>As robot-aided recovery after incomplete SCI is at a relatively less mature stage than that of stroke, such reference human subject studies are not yet present. Despite studies on animal models suggesting that rehabilitation should leverage plasticity through stimuli similar to those tested for stroke rehabilitation (Cai et al., <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; van den Brand et al., <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), optimal treatment regimes for robot-aided rehabilitation are far from having been identified. Especially in rehabilitation after incomplete SCI, a field still much in its infancy, early-stage trials should be aimed at giving inputs for further refinement of robot-assisted therapeutic protocols.</p><p>Such inputs can be provided by parallel-group controlled trials (PGCT). In a PGCT, the specific effect of a treatment modality is assessed by measuring a variable (outcome measure) in a group undergoing treatment, and comparing the outcome measure with the one obtained in a parallel group, where an alternative treatment is delivered. If a clinical study intends to evaluate the specific effects of a novel controller, it should compare the effects of this controller not to the absence of rehabilitation, but instead to a different, <italic>standard of care</italic> form of rehabilitation. Through this methodology, it would be possible to isolate the differential effects of the investigated treatment and control for a wide variety of other factors that might have an effect on recovery. In fields where there is an established standard of care, this is usually done by comparing the results achievable through a new treatment with literature data. However, application of this approach is made difficult by the fact that there are no robust reference data for robot-assisted upper extremity training after SCI. In general, testing the efficacy of rehabilitation paradigms is complicated by the large variability of subject populations, both in terms of baseline motor function and in terms of pre vs. post improvement of motor function. High variability of baseline and improvement variables leads to demand for multicenter studies, especially in SCI rehabilitation, where low prevalence provides challenges even in large cities.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1"><sup>1</sup></xref>
Instead, large-scale clinical studies such as multicenter studies are not appropriate for early stage trials where it is desired to test a particular aspect of a therapeutic protocol (e.g., the robot control mode), whose validity can be tested for later inclusion in larger phase II or phase III randomized controlled trials, following the framework for staging motor intervention studies proposed in Dobkin (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). From the consideration above, it is indeed not a surprise that most of the large-scale clinical investigations of rehabilitation robotics could only test the feasibility of robotic rehabilitation and could not go more in depth assessing the differential effects of a specific control mode (Lo, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we evaluate the effect of two different interactive schemes implemented on the MAHI Exo-II robotic upper limb exoskeleton (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), on therapy outcomes in a population of subjects with incomplete spinal cord injury. We hypothesized that a subject-adaptive controller, capable of continuously adapting the levels of assistance and challenge provided during movement-based rehabilitation therapy, enabled achievement of higher gains in arm function after chronic incomplete spinal cord injury, compared to a non-adaptive, subject-triggered position controller. This study serves the dual purpose of assessing the potential of subject-adaptive interaction control schemes for robot-aided therapy after incomplete spinal cord injury and of guiding the development of more sophisticated interaction controllers for upper extremity rehabilitation therapy.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Subject using the MAHI Exo-II robotic upper limb exoskeleton.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fnbot-11-00026-g001"/></fig></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S2"><label>2</label><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S2-1"><label>2.1</label><title>Study Design</title><p>The study followed a PGCT design, where subjects were assigned to two different robotic interventions, namely, the assist-as-needed (AAN) and the subject-triggered (ST) controller, detailed in the following sections. The null hypothesis tested in this study was that the change in motor function for subjects exposed to the AAN paradigm would be the same as the one obtained through the ST paradigm.</p><p>Participants with cervical motor incomplete SCI were assigned to either the AAN group or to the ST group. Inclusion criteria were age (comprised between 18 and 75&#x02009;years), diagnosis of chronic incomplete SCI affecting upper extremity function (American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) Impairment Scale (AIS) C-D levels, with the injury occurring at least 6&#x02009;months prior to enrollment), while exclusion criteria were prior participation in robotic rehabilitation studies for the upper arm, any planned alteration in medication for muscle tone for the duration of the study, arthritis, excessive shoulder pain, joint contracture or excessive muscle tone (Modified Ashworth Scale &#x0003e;3). Although the inclusion and exclusion criteria did not target specific locations of injury, the requirement &#x0201c;incomplete SCI affecting upper extremity function&#x0201d; resulted in admitted

After the first four subjects were assigned to the ST group, the group assignment method provided balanced groups in terms of the two prognostic variables (ARAT and age), (&#x00394;<italic><sub>ARAT</sub></italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.8 points, &#x003c3;<italic><sub>ARAT</sub></italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;17.24 points, &#x00394;<italic><sub>age</sub></italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.6&#x02009;years, &#x003c3;<italic><sub>age</sub></italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;7.2&#x02009;years), or better than 76% of the entire set of possible random assignments to both groups, as demonstrated by a <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis based on the systematic assessment of all possible permutations of enrolled subjects.</p></sec><sec id="S2-3"><label>2.3</label><title>Protocol</title><p>Each subject participated in a total of fifteen visits. The first two visits involved screening for inclusion and exclusion criteria and a baseline assessment on primary and secondary outcome measures, in addition to the ASIA upper extremity scale to verify the diagnosis. Within one week after the last baseline visit, subjects started a program of robotic training, in ten 90-min long sessions, spread over a period of three to four weeks (the number of visits per week ranged between 1 and 3, depending on subject availability and scheduling constraints for baseline and follow-up visits). After the last training session, three posttreatment clinical assessment sessions (one week, two weeks, and two months after treatment) were completed with the therapist. The progression of subjects through the study is presented in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Flow diagram describing progression of subjects through the study.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fnbot-11-00026-g002"/></fig><p>Group assignment was implemented after the first screening session based on the result of the pre-therapy ARAT test. Subject assignment was undisclosed to the occupational therapist performing the evaluations (KN), who did not participate in any of the therapy sessions, enabling complete blinding of the study.</p><p>At the beginning of each robotic training session, subjects underwent an evaluation session, then robotic training, which took the form of <italic>p</italic> repetitions of single-DOF movements, with <italic>p</italic> adapted to result in sessions of the prescribed duration (90&#x02009;min total). In evaluation sessions, the subjects&#x02019; range of motion (ROM) was calculated by asking the subjects to move a given joint in both directions to the maximum level that they considered comfortable, and recording the maximum and minimum values angles using the MAHI Exo-II encoders. During evaluation sessions, the MAHI Exo-II was unpowered, opposing minimal resistance to motion due to its backdrivable design. Evaluation sessions were based on point-to-point movements from a center target (placed at the middle point between the two extremes calculated before) to the periphery targets defined in the ROM procedure. Although the MAHI Exo-II allows training of complex movements combining both elbow and wrist joints, we chose to train subjects in uni-dimensional tasks based on recent literature demonstrating that training complex movements does not lead to a greater improvement in motor function in stroke patients (Milot et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).</p><p>During training sessions, subjects similarly underwent repeated point-to-point movements per DOF. The number of repetitions was initially specified as the final value in the previous session, and then increased based on the availability of time. Training sessions lasted 90&#x02009;min, with setup taking approximately 5&#x02009;min per subject.</p><p>For patients in the AAN controller group, both assistance and timing parameters estimated from the previous sessions were retained as an initial guess in the subject-adaptive therapy mode, whereas for patients in the ST controller group, the therapist manually set the challenge parameters (force threshold, <italic>F<sub>th</sub></italic>, and time allowed for a movement, <italic>T<sub>ST</sub></italic>) on a session-by-session basis, based on the subject&#x02019;s qualitative assessment of fatigue over the course of the session and the 90-min duration constraint.</p></sec><sec id="S2-4"><label>2.4</label><title>Exoskeleton and Control Modes</title><p>During therapy, subjects interacted with the MAHI Exo-II, a four degree-of-freedom (DOF) exoskeleton used for isolated rehabilitation of the elbow (flexion/extension) and the wrist (pronation/supination&#x02014;PS, radial-ulnar deviation&#x02014;RUD, flexion/extension&#x02014;FE). Details on the mechanical design of the robot are included in prior work (Pehlivan et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). The robot, shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, is a unilateral upper extremity exoskeleton supported by a moving aluminum frame that allows an easy adjustment to fit the arm of subjects sitting on a chair. The exoskeleton has four degrees of freedom actuated by DC motors and cable transmissions and is connected to the subjects&#x02019; arm via thermoplastic cuffs that connect to the subject upper arm, and forearm, with both contacts secured by velcro straps. The wrist component of the exoskeleton terminates with a handle, which is grasped by the subject (or is strapped to the subject&#x02019;s hand in case of individuals with limited grasping capabilities), which allows the device to track and assist the wrist rotation angles after solving the forward kinematics of the Revolute Prismatic Spherical wrist component (RiceWrist) (Gupta et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Erwin et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Motion of the upper arm is prevented by soft contacts via velcro straps; however, the subject torso was not constrained to maximize subject comfort in the intensive therapy program. Similarly, we found that by using soft constraints and velcro straps, subjects could operate comfortably the robot without requiring highly accurate alignment of the robotic degrees of freedom to the subject joints. The time required for fitting a new subject in the robot never exceeded 15&#x02009;min, with setup for subsequent visits being considerably shorter. The MAHI Exo-II was programmed via two different control modes, the assist-as-needed (AAN) controller, and the subject-triggered (ST) controller, described in detail in the following sections.</p><sec id="S2-4-1"><label>2.4.1</label><title>Assist-As-Needed Controller</title><p>For the AAN controller (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), we adapted the controller proposed in the study by Pehlivan et al.

At the beginning of the movement, a nominal desired trajectory based on a physiological joint movement profile, and allocated time <italic>T<sub>end</sub></italic> is defined. During the movement, a conditional trajectory recalculation (CTR) is implemented, so that when the position of the subject is ahead of the nominal desired trajectory, a new desired trajectory is computed as a piecewise polynomial function. For each recalculation, the parameter <italic>T<sub>end</sub></italic> is reduced for the current movement by 1%, and the updated value of <italic>T<sub>end</sub></italic> is kept for the next task. In an attempt to differentiate between intentional subject involvement and unintentional elastic return due to muscle stretching, the CTR is here enabled only if the subject is able to be ahead of the nominal desired trajectory in both center-to-periphery and following periphery-to-center directions for a percentage (10%) of the last movement when CTR was disabled. This helps guarantee active subject input because the elastic return of stretched muscles typically only aids movement from periphery-to-center. If the CTR is not activated for a given task, the algorithm will increase <italic>T<sub>end</sub></italic> by 0.2&#x02009;s until the subject is able to stay ahead of the desired trajectory. During the CTR &#x0201c;off&#x0201d; phase, a ghost cursor following the nominal desired trajectory is displayed to the subject in the GUI to motivate the subject to be ahead of the nominal trajectory (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>A). Since a lead-type error is not possible when the trajectory recalculation mode is switched on, the RBF amplitude estimates are mostly non-decreasing (in absolute value) in this condition, resulting in an overestimate of the feedforward assistance.

The test has a variety of nineteen tasks divided into grasp, pinch grip, and gross arm movement portions. The subject&#x02019;s motions are graded on a scale of zero to three, with three being a normal motion and zero being an incomplete motion (Lyle, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">1981</xref>). As secondary outcome measures, the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) was used to classify the subject&#x02019;s spasticity by extending a joint over 1&#x02009;s. The increase in muscle tone is then rated on a scale from zero (no increase in tone) to four (the affected part or parts are rigid) (Bohannon and Smith, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">1987</xref>). A third outcome measure was the Grip Pinch Strength assessment, which measures the subject&#x02019;s pinch and grip strengths using dynamometers, measured in units of force (Kalsi-Ryan et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). The fourth metric is the Graded Redefined Assessment of Strength, Sensibility and Prehension Test (GRASSP), which measures a subject&#x02019;s strength, sensation, and prehension in tasks relating to activities of daily life. The test measures a subject&#x02019;s level of sensation impairment, with zero being no sensation and 4 being the ability to detect 0.4&#x02009;g of force. The strength measurement is done subjectively by the physical therapist with zero being flaccid and five being a full range with maximal resistance. The prehension portion involves a rating of the ability to grab and maneuver a series of objects on a scale of zero to five with five being the maximal score. The subject is then graded on a scale from zero to four for the ability to grasp a cylindrical object, a lateral key pinch, and a tip to tip pinch (Kalsi-Ryan et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S2-5-5"><label>2.5.3</label><title>Robotic Measures</title><p>Movement kinematics measured during the robotic training and assessment sessions were sampled at 100&#x02009;Hz for the ST exoskeleton and at 200&#x02009;Hz for the AAN exoskeleton. Motion data were then processed to extract relevant parameters describing assisted or unperturbed human movements. The raw robotic data were first filtered using a Savitzky&#x02013;Golay filter with a window length of 21 for the ST exoskeleton and 41 for the AAN exoskeleton. The filter featured different window lengths for the two devices to result in roughly equivalent finite impulse responses in the frequency domain. The data were then passed to a segmentation algorithm to divide the continuous time data into point-to-point segments for data analysis. The segmentation algorithm identified the instants of movement start and movement end by analyzing the regions of subject movement between desired target indicator switches. The algorithm defined <italic>t</italic><sub>0</sub> as the time when the desired target indicator changed to initiate subject motion and <italic>t<sub>tar</sub></italic> as the time when the software acknowledged the subject&#x02019;s reaching of the desired target. The time of movement start, <italic>t<sub>in</sub></italic>, was defined as the instant at which the velocity profile exceeded 5% of the peak value for the first time within the target region defined from <italic>t</italic><sub>0</sub> to <italic>t<sub>tar</sub></italic>. The suprathreshold velocity regions were then analyzed to determine their magnitudes, directions in relation to the desired target, and proximity to the previous and subsequent suprathreshold regions. Analysis of suprathreshold regions after <italic>t<sub>tar</sub></italic> allowed for the inclusion of regions in the movement toward the desired target after the software registers a target reach (i.e., the subject&#x02019;s correcting for an overshoot of the target). Finally, the movement end, <italic>t<sub>fin</sub></italic>, was defined as the last time the velocity exceeded 5% of the peak value for the last suprathreshold region corresponding to a movement toward the current desired target. After velocity profile segmentation, metrics of interest were calculated for the cropped time series comprised between <italic>t<sub>in</sub></italic> and <italic>t<sub>fin</sub></italic>, to quantify the quality of movement. The metrics used in this study are the mean arrest period ratio (MAPR), spectral arc length (SAL), and normalized speed.</p><p>The mean arrest period ratio (MAPR) measures the total amount of time <italic>T<sub>hs</sub></italic> where the measured velocity is above a predetermined percentage of the peak velocity (Beppu et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">1984</xref>). For this analysis, we used the same threshold used for the definition of movement start (5%) as threshold for the calculation of MAPR.

To test whether there is a significant change over time, a linear regression was performed on the value of the change per session averaged across all subjects within the group. A 95% confidence interval was generated for the value of the slope.</p></sec><sec id="S2-6-7"><label>2.6.2</label><title>Clinical Measures</title><p>The clinical measures were recorded at the baseline and follow-up sessions (post-treatment, 2-week, and 2-month assessments). There were three cases where the subject did not attend the time-sensitive follow-up sessions (2&#x02009;weeks post for R11 and 2&#x02009;weeks and 2&#x02009;months post for R09) which resulted in an additional 12 incomplete sessions. Thus, all clinical metrics are missing for those assessments. R15 also missed the clinical evaluation in his post-treatment assessment. Furthermore, in 12 of the therapy sessions, the number of repetitions of the therapy portion had to be reduced due to the subject&#x02019;s late arrival to the session.</p><p>The pre&#x02013;post analysis was performed by comparing the clinical metrics measured during the post-treatment sessions with the value recorded at baseline. The pre-post change in each of the clinical metrics was calculated by subtracting the baseline value from each of the three follow-up values for each subject. Therefore, a value greater than zero would signify an increase in the metric with respect to the baseline, while a negative value would represent a decrease. The changes in the metrics for the pre&#x02013;post analysis were then tested for statistical significance (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) via a mixed-design analysis of variance (ANOVA) with treatment group as the between-subjects variable and the DOF, session, and metric variables as the within-subject variables. The Greenhouse-Geisser correction was used when the sphericity assumption was violated. In the event of a significant interaction, the interaction was decomposed using simple main effects. As the analysis technique does not allow missing data, subjects with missing data had to be removed from the analysis. As such, subjects R11 and R15 were only missing data for one of the three follow-up sessions. The missing data for these two subjects were replaced with the subject mean of the other two follow-up sessions for each missing clinical metric. R09 was removed from the analysis, having missed two follow-up sessions. Therefore, the total number of subjects included in the clinical metrics pre&#x02013;post analysis was 6 and 7 for the AAN and ST groups, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="S2-6-8"><label>2.6.3</label><title>Robotic Measures</title><p>We analyzed movement data acquired during free movements with the robot in the evaluation sessions preceding each therapy session to determine if therapy had an effect on the quality of movements produced by participants. A mixed-design ANOVA was used to analyze the robotic measures collected during the therapy program. Data were grouped by the between-subjects factor (group, with two levels, AAN and ST), and by the within-subject factor (session, with ten levels). The Greenhouse-Geisser correction was used when the sphericity assumption was violated, and significant interactions were decomposed using simple main effects. Due to subject inability to complete the movement or absence from a session, we do not have data for every subject, DOF, and session combination. A complete session is defined as a subject being able to complete an evaluation for a given DOF in a given session. For this study, an average of 87% of sessions were complete. The within-subject completion rate ranged from a maximum of 100% for five different subjects to a minimum of 55% for one subject. Additionally, the within DOF completion rate ranged from a maximum of 97% for the elbow to a minimum of 81% for wrist FE and wrist RUD. The major causes for an incomplete session were the subject being unable to complete an evaluation session of a given DOF due to their level of impairment (10% of all sessions) or a robot hardware failure (1.5% of all sessions). There were eight instances where a subject who began the study unable to complete an evaluation for a particular DOF gained the ability to complete an evaluation before the end of the therapy sessions. Given the multitude of measurements for each subject, we deemed inappropriate to discard data acquired from a given subject due to a few missing data points. Therefore, we established to exclude from the analysis a given subject if data were missing for at least three sessions for that specific subject. Otherwise, we replaced the subject&#x02019;s missing data with the subject mean. This resulted in the replacement of 16 missing data points (out of a total of 140). The resulting total number of subjects is as follows, represented as (AAN, ST): (7,7) for elbow, (6,6) for wrist PS, (6,5) for wrist FE, and (6,5) for wrist RUD. Because of the rules established for excluding subjects, two subjects were excluded from the analysis for wrist PS, and three subjects were excluded for wrist FE and RUD.</p><p>We finally conducted an exploratory analysis to determine whether the effect of the training program in the two groups was captured by a linear increase over session of the robotic outcome measures. For this analysis, a change in metric is defined for each therapy session <italic>i</italic> as the difference between the outcome measure obtained in session <italic>i</italic> and the metric obtained in the first training session for which the subject has data. As such, the baseline is taken as the first time the subject is able to perform the motion, and the change is calculated relative to this baseline throughout the duration of the therapy sessions. This approach appears suitable to describe within-subject changes in outcome measures, as it avoids confounds associated with data replacement with the mean as done for the mixed-design ANOVA; however, this approach creates unbalanced groups in both the between-subject and within-subject factors. To test significance of the effect of the within-subject repeated measure (i.e., session), a linear regression was conducted on the change in robotic metric averaged across all subjects within a group. This was accomplished by two separate regression analyses, one for the AAN group, and one for the ST group.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="S3"><label>3</label><title>Results</title><p>We show characteristics of our controller behavior as recorded during a parallel-group balanced controlled trial with subjects with incomplete SCI and compare performance differences across our two treatment groups.

As such, different metrics were used to test how the two controllers modulated assistance, challenge, and therapy intensity.

The study compared the effects of AAN treatment with those provided by an alternative intervention, subject-triggered (ST) control, matched in terms of total therapy time. We present for the first time validation of the AAN robotic controller in subjects with iSCI and demonstrate feasibility and consistency of controller performance over a 10-session period with this clinical population. As far as the clinical results are concerned, difficulties in the recruitment of the identified population (patients with iSCI affecting upper extremity function available to participate in a 3-month long rehabilitation program) prevented achievement of the sample size that had been identified to detect a significant effect in the clinical primary outcome measure (i.e., pre&#x02013;post ARAT score being greater in the AAN group relative to the control group). As a result, the null hypothesis of this clinical study could not be rejected. At the same time, kinematic data measured during evaluation sessions during the therapy program provide support for the hypothesis that improvement in quality of movement was achieved in both groups, with the AAN group showing larger improvements in smoothness metrics, compared to the control ST group. While the differential effect of the therapy program on robotic measurements was demonstrated quantitatively only in one of the four joints treated (wrist RUD), an exploratory analysis showed that the slope of the linear change in outcome measure over sessions was consistently greater in the AAN group than in the ST group. The following section will discuss in more detail the results obtained in this study.</p><sec id="S4-10"><label>4.1</label><title>Validation of the AAN and ST Controller</title><sec id="S4-10-11"><label>4.1.1</label><title>Task Assistance and Challenge</title><p>The AAN controller can modulate both task assistance and challenge continuously during robot-assisted therapy. Task assistance and challenge were quantified for the AAN controller by the feedback control gain <italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic> and allocated time <italic>T</italic>, whose change over time relative to session 1 are represented in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>. While the change in gains &#x00394;<italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic> for the elbow DOF are relatively constant over the course of sessions, the other three DOFs show a decrease in value, with wrist PS having the largest decrease over time. The decrease in gain values with respect to the baseline signifies the reduced assistance from the controller over time. Thus, the negative trend of controller gains over sessions implies that the subjects were more capable of completing the movements as the study progressed. Conversely, the average changes in allotted time &#x00394;<italic>T</italic><sup>(</sup><italic><sup>k</sup></italic><sup>)</sup> show the largest decrease for the elbow. Wrist FE also exhibited a slight decrease over time, whereas wrist PS and wrist RUD remain relatively stable. When comparing controller gains and the allotted time, we see that for some DOFs it is the amount of assistance (via a reduction in feedback gain) that varies, while for other DOFs the controller performance variations are dominated by reductions in allotted time. Reductions in the gain metric and in the allotted time over the course of the study both demonstrate an increase in the subject&#x02019;s ability to perform the movement and show the responsiveness of the AAN controller to this performance improvement, with a resulting increase in task complexity, thereby keeping &#x0201c;challenge&#x0201d; at constant levels (Zimmerli et al., <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>).</p><p>Regression analysis of either controller gain or allocated time show statistically significant effect of session in all DOFs. For the wrist FE DOF, the effect is significant for both control gain, and allocated time metrics. For the elbow, the gain slope included zero in the confidence interval, and for PS and wrist RUD, the allotted time slope confidence interval included zero. Since both allocated time and gain combine to modulate the task difficulty, and at least one of the two parameters is significantly altered by session for all DOFs, this analysis supports the role of the AAN in modulating task assistance and challenge in response to growing patient input.</p><p>These findings are well aligned with our prior demonstrations of the assist-as-needed controller where healthy subjects were asked to modulate their compliance with the controller action and their movement speed to illustrate the behavior of gain and allotted time modulation algorithms (Pehlivan et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). In the current study, a similar behavior is observed in this neurologically impaired population.</p></sec><sec id="S4-10-12"><label>4.1.2</label><title>Therapy Intensity</title><p>From Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, there is an observable increase in the number of repetitions from training session T1 to T10 for both the AAN and ST groups. For the ST group, the therapist is encouraging faster movements and shorter pauses between movements, resulting in an increase in intensity throughout the therapy protocol. Similarly, the AAN controller is modulating the assistance (via feedback gain) and the allotted time, resulting in more movements completed in each session. Both controllers successfully facilitate the increase of therapy intensity via increased repetitions. There is some variability between sessions as several factors combine to affect the number of repetitions able to be completed. Additionally, subjects were undergoing multiple trainings per week, so they might be fatigued or stiff on any given day, which would diminish the number of reps they could complete on a given day. It is worth noting that data included in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> represents the change in number of repetitions with respect to the baseline, thus a positive value represents an increase in the number of repetitions completed in a session relative to the first session. Even with the variability between sessions, all values are positive, which represents an increase in repetitions compared to their baseline behavior. This finding suggests that via the training program, both through the ST and AAN controllers, the subjects are prompted to complete more repetitions per session.</p><p>In addition to the number of movement repetitions, another parameter that is associated with the intensity of the therapy program is the force threshold <italic>F<sub>th</sub></italic> that the subject is required to produce for each repetition, in the ST control group. Also this metric was shown to be increasing over the therapy program for subjects in the ST group, further confirming that therapy intensity was gradually increased on a session-by-session basis in the ST group.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S4-11"><label>4.2</label><title>Clinical Measures</title><p>Clinical assessments were conducted prior to the start of the therapy protocol, then at the conclusion of the therapy sessions. Retention was assessed by conducting these assessments again at 2&#x02009;weeks and 2&#x02009;months post-treatment. The impact of the robotic rehabilitation intervention can be evaluated by comparing changes in these metrics from pre- to post-treatment, and also by analyzing the retention at follow-up assessments.</p><p>No significant effect of session was extracted in the analysis of the effect of session in the primary outcome measure, i.e., the ARAT score, nor of the interaction between session and group. From analysis of the ARAT clinical metric at each session, it can be seen that the ST group shows an increase of roughly one point in ARAT score with respect to the baseline at the post-therapy time point, which is sustained in the subsequent follow-ups. Alternatively, the ARAT score in the AAN group initially decreases, while later increasing to an average change in ARAT score of 4.33 points at the 2-month mark, a gain that is greater than that of the ST group. Due to the subjective nature of the clinical assessments, minimally clinically important differences (MCID) are introduced to define a clinically significant increase in a metric. MCIDs attempt to account for variability from test&#x02013;retest and inter-rater reliability effects. In stroke, the MCID for ARAT is 5.7 points (van der Lee et al., <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>), while it is not established for iSCI. Thus, the observed increase in the AAN group is likely to not be clinically significant.</p><p>The GRASSP Strength and GRASSP Sens metrics were the only two metrics showing a statistically significant effect of session at (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.031 and <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.002, respectively); however, no significant interaction between group and session was measured. The significant increase in the GRASSP Strength metric was expected, as repetitive use over time of muscles should increase their strength. The increase in the GRASSP Sens metric, however, was unanticipated, as we are not focusing any of the training efforts on increasing the subject&#x02019;s touch perception as a part of the robotic therapy. A possible explanation would be that the forced repetitions caused the subject to engage their arms more than they were used to, which resulted in more familiarity with the arm and thus a heightened sense of perception. As the GRASSP Sens metric was not considered as a primary outcome measure, further research is necessary to draw any conclusions from this finding.</p><p>Changes in MAS relative to baseline are relatively small; neither group showed any meaningful change at the follow-up sessions with respect to the baseline. The AAN group had a decrease in MAS score of 0.11, 0.13, and 0.08 for the post-treatment, 2-week, and 2- month follow-up, respectively, whereas the ST group demonstrated an increase of 0.16, 0.27, and 0.13. The MCID for MAS has not been established yet. However, given that the MAS scale ranges from 0 to 4 and given that in a comparable study in stroke the minimal detectable change was 1 point (Shaw et al., <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>), these small differences in the pre&#x02013;post analysis do not indicate a meaningful change in the metric over time.</p><p>Finally, we observe that both groups increase their grip and pinch score relative to baseline, and that the increased score is sustained in subsequent follow-up visits. The ST group begins at 25.3&#x02009;N and is relatively constant until the 2-month follow-up, where it decreases to a relative measurement of 17.3&#x02009;N. The AAN group is relatively stable with an improvement of 17.8&#x02009;N from the post-treatment to the 2-week follow-up and then increases to 32.2&#x02009;N at the 2-month follow-up.</p></sec><sec id="S4-12"><label>4.3</label><title>Robotic Measures</title><p>A richer insight into the impact of robotic controllers on movement quality is provided by the longitudinal analysis of movement quality data along the therapy program, as provided by the robotic metrics SAL, MAPR, and normalized speed. Both groups exhibit an increase in the robotic metrics over the course of the therapy program, as visible from Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>, although the significance of the factor session in the robotic metric ANOVA varies within a given joint depending on the specific metric considered. A significant interaction between group and session was measured only for wrist RUD movements. From the longitudinal analysis of robotic evaluation data, it can be observed that the AAN group showed significant improvement in all DOFs, while the ST group showed statistically significant improvement in only wrist PS and wrist FE (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>).</p><p>Analysis of repeated measurements obtained during the therapy program illustrate fluctuations in the observed movement smoothness, which illustrate how subjects can perform differently depending on fatigue or other factors from one day to the next. These fluctuations could also be occurring in the baseline and follow-up analysis, making pre&#x02013;post comparisons insensitive to trends that can only be observed through the longitudinal analysis. By comparing all of the therapy sessions, we have many more data points which allow for a general trend to be observed with diminished influence of day-to-day variations in performance. These observations are really only feasible if using assessments that can be gathered as part of the therapy protocol, such as via the evaluation trials that we incorporated into this study design, and computed with readily available data. It is impractical to conduct clinical assessments such as ARAT at every training session due to the time constraints of typical therapy sessions. This observation supports the value of robotic measures of movement coordination as a practical tool useful for evaluation of recovery of motor function during robot-aided therapy.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S5"><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p>This paper presents the results of a parallel-group controlled trial (PGCT) to test the efficacy of a novel AAN controller in robotic rehabilitation after incomplete spinal cord injury. With its design features (presence of an active control condition, blindness of the evaluator to treatment assignment, and execution of a power analysis for the primary study outcomes), this study falls within the category of stage 2, <italic>development-of-concept</italic> pilot studies, despite the relatively small sample size emerging as a result of the power analysis (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;20). As such, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time this type of study has been conducted in the field of robot-assisted therapy for upper extremity rehabilitation in incomplete spinal cord injury.</p><p>We present details on the methods of our study, including thorough descriptions of the controller modes and treatment regimens implemented on the MAHI Exo-II upper limb exoskeleton robot. We have introduced methodological features in the study design which are of interest to the rehabilitation robotics community. In particular, the presented scheme of sequential group assignment with covariates minimization guarantees the desired level of balance of covariates in the two groups, a feature that cannot be reliably achieved with unrestricted randomization in studies with low (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;50) sample sizes (Schulz and Grimes, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>).</p><p>The results presented in this paper highlight its two major contributions. First, we presented data to validate the operation of our assist-as-needed (AAN) robotic controller to adjust controller gains and allotted times for movement completion to modulate the challenge and assistance provided to the subject in an automated fashion. The automated nature of assistance modulation via gain adjustment and challenge modulation via changing of the allotted time for movement completion were comparable to the progression of challenge achieved manually with the subject-triggered (ST) controller. With the ST control approach, the therapist adjusted challenge of treatment delivery by manually controlling the force threshold for initiating movement via a GUI, and challenge via coaching and encouragement to elicit faster movements. The results demonstrate for the first time in an impaired population the modulation of AAN controller action in response to subject performance throughout a therapy regimen.</p><p>Our second contribution involves the analysis of the differential effects of a novel controller for robot-aided rehabilitation therapy on patients affected by iSCI. This analysis has been conducted using both clinical metrics (collected at baseline, posttreatment, and at two follow-up sessions) and robotic metrics (collected longitudinally during the therapy program). Only weak gains were observed in the clinical outcome measures, with no support for either controller showing a clinically nor statistically significant increase in clinical metrics. While some improvements (such as with the GRASSP metric) were statistically significant, the observed gains failed to translate into clinically meaningful findings. Despite this weak result, longitudinal analysis of robotic measures shed light on the session-by-session changes in subject performance in terms of the movement quality metrics derived from robot kinematic data. The AAN group consistently showed improvement in performance across all DOFs and all robotic measures of movement quality, while the ST group showed smaller gains confined to only a subset of the metrics and DOFs. Based on these findings, further research is warranted to evaluate the potential of AAN control strategies for robotic rehabilitation of the upper limb following incomplete SCI. Given the continually improving performance of the AAN group in our study, therapy protocols incorporating a greater number of therapy sessions may achieve minimally clinically significant differences in clinical outcomes that we were unable to demonstrate in this study.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Availability of Data and Supporting Material</title><p>Data will be made available upon request to scientist interested in secondary analyses.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>This study was reviewed and approved by the institutional review boards (IRB) of Rice University and our clinical collaborators&#x02019; institutions (Rice University IRB 654451, UT Health/TIRR Memorial Hermann IRB HSC-GEN-13-0315), with written informed consent from all subjects.
