peel-like appearance and is observed mainly on women's thighs and buttocks after
puberty.<sup><xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> So far, this
apparently multifactorial disorder is believed to be caused by the following factors:
anatomical changes; microcirculation failure; reduced production of the vasodilator
hormone adiponectin by the subcutaneous cell tissue; genetic polymorphism; changes in
dermal connective tissue; and inflammatory processes.<sup><xref rid="r02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup><sup>-</sup><sup><xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> The method most widely used to classify cellulite is that proposed by
N&#x000fc;rnberger and M&#x000fc;ller, which was based on 4 grades defined according to clinical
presentation: zero: no changes; <bold>I:</bold> visible changes at skin clamping or
muscle contraction; <bold>II:</bold> visible changes when there is no manipulation; and
<bold>III:</bold> visible changes associated with nodulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figures 1</xref> e <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">2</xref>).<sup><xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup></p><fig id="f01" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>FIGURE 1</label><caption><p>Cellulite grade II</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="abd-89-05-0712-g01"/></fig><fig id="f02" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>FIGURE 2</label><caption><p>Cellulite grade III</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="abd-89-05-0712-g02"/></fig><p>The methods used to evaluate the severity of cellulite include: anthropometric
measurements, macro photography, bioelectrical impedance, thermogram, Doppler flowmetry,
high-resolution twodimensional ultrasound (US), nuclear magnetic resonance imaging, and
skin biopsy followed by histological examination.<sup><xref rid="r02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup><sup>-</sup><sup><xref rid="r07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Given the esthetic repercussion of this
condition and the fact that its etiopathogeny has been partly understood already, many
treatments have been proposed, such as: balanced diet regular physical activity;
massage; topical products with vegetable ingredients, such as caffeine, and topical
retinoids; endermologie; radiofrequency (RF); focused US; laser; infrared light emitting
diode (LED); and extracorporeal pulse activation therapy (EPAT), also known as acoustic
wave therapy (AWT).<sup><xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup><sup>-</sup><sup><xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> However, none of these treatments provides fully satisfactory and
lasting results that could be proved in studies with good methodology.<sup><xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> The technique of manual lymphatic
drainage (MLD), developed by the Danish biologists Emil and Estrid Vodder in 1936, is
one of the main pillars of the treatment of lymphedema, because its movements help
lymphatic circulation.<sup><xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Its purpose
is draining fluids accumulated between interstitial spaces, particularly in dermis,
collaborating thus for tissue fluid balance by means of pressure differentials that will
promote the displacement of lymph and interstitial fluid towards the bloodstream.
Superficial and gentle maneuvers are performed throughout the path of lymphatic vessels
to eliminate lymph fluids and reduce edema.<sup><xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup></p><p>Considering that MLD is a technique aimed at stimulating the lymphatic system, reducing
fluid excess, and eliminating metabolic waste, and that cellulite seems to be related to
metabolic changes and fluid accumulation in dermal connective tissue leading to the
worsening of anatomical characteristics, MLD may be beneficial in the control of this
condition.<sup><xref rid="r09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> This study aimed to
investigate the efficacy and safety of MLD in improving the appearance of the skin with
cellulite and the influence of this technique on quality of life.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><p>This is an open, prospective, intervention study including 20 women with cellulite on
the upper third of thigh and buttocks who came from the general cosmetology outpatient
clinic of an academic institution. Before participating in the study, all of them signed
an informed consent form (ICF). Inclusion criteria were healthy women aged from 20 to 40
years who presented with cellulite grade II or III on the buttocks, according to the
classification by N&#x000fc;rnberger and M&#x000fc;ller. <sup><xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> After clinical evaluation, MLD sessions were carried out once a week
for 14 weeks. In these sessions, movements of physical stimulation and massage on lower
limbs and buttocks were performed according to the techniques proposed by Vodder and
Leduc.<sup><xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup></p><p>Parameters of efficacy were the following: subjective assessment (patient's and
investigator's opinion regarding improvement in clinical signs of cellulite as measured
by a 3-point scale: 1 = worsening; 2 = no change; 3 = improvement); blind evaluation by
three independent physical therapists about whether there was a change in cellulite
grade after treatment, using digitally captured photographs (OMNI,USA); weight; height;
Body Mass Index (BMI) (Kg/m<sup>2</sup>); bioelectrical impedance (BIA 101 Quantum, RJL
Systems, Detroit, MI, USA); measure of skin elasticity or cutometry (Cutometer MPA580&#x02122;,
Courage &#x00026; Khazaka, Cologne, Germany); high-resolution US (DermaScan-C(tm), Cortex
Technology, Denmark) for measuring dermal thickness and echogenicity and the interface
line between dermis and hypodermis (this skin layer was not evaluated due to method
limitations); and application of a generic questionnaire on quality of life in
dermatology named Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI).</p><p>Statistical analysis was performed using Mann Whitney, Fisher's exact and likelihood
ratio tests (since the chi-square test did not show to be adequate because it is an
asymptotic test), as well as box-plot charts and the Wilcoxon test. The agreement
between patients' and examiners' opinion and between examiners' opinion between each
other were evaluated using the kappa coefficient and its respective confidence interval,
with a confidence level of 95% (95%CI). This agreement was analyzed using the
classification proposed by Landis and Koch.<sup><xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup></p><p>Data on biometry, physical examination, dermatoscopy, and cutometry obtained before and
after MLD sessions were described as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation and compared by the
paired t-test. The level of significance was set at 5%, i.e., results were considered
statistically significant if the p-value was below 5% (p&#x0003c;0.05).</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Fifteen women aged between 22 and 38 years, with a mean age of 30 years and a standard
deviation of 4 years, completed the treatment. Five women dropped out from the study
because they had difficulty in attending the weekly massage sessions, and other two
women dropped it out because they expected faster results.</p><p>Analysis was performed per protocol, because the cases that were excluded earlier
underwent few massage sessions (from 1 to 3 sessions), which would not provide any
improvement, a fact that occurred even in patients who finished the treatment.</p><p>All the variables assessed before the beginning of MLD sessions were compared between
women who completed the study (Study Group) and those who were excluded earlier (Dropout
Group) to investigate whether some variable might differ between the two groups.</p><p>It was observed that women who dropped out from the study earlier did not differ from
those who completed it in terms of age, use of contraceptives, alcohol use, and practice
of physical activity (p&#x0003e;0.05). However, there was a higher percentage of women who
controlled the diet among those who dropped out from the study (60%) compared to those
who completed it (7%), with a significant difference (p=0.032).</p><p>With regard to the 15 women who completed the study, sociodemographic data were the
following: mean age of 29 years old, with a standard deviation of nearly four years,
ranging from 22 to 33 years of age. A total of 53.3% (8/15) women used contraceptives;
47% (7/15) performed physical activities; as per alcohol use, the most frequent answer
was "sometimes", reported by 73.3% (11/15) of women, followed by "never", reported by
20% (3/15), and "often", reported by only 6.7% (1/15). Most participants, i.e., 93.3%
(14/15) did not control their diet.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="f03">Figure 3</xref> show that median, first and third
quartiles for DLQI scores were 4, 3 and 5 points before treatment and changed to 3, 0
and 5 points, respectively, at the end of the treatment. Therefore, median DLQI scores
at the beginning of the study were significantly higher than those from the end of the
study, i.e., the treatment provided significant improvement in quality of life (p=0.018,
Wilcoxon test) in terms of the psychological domain.</p><fig id="f03" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>FIGURE 3</label><caption><p>Boxplot of DLQI scores before and after treatmentt</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="abd-89-05-0712-g03"/></fig><p>According to <xref ref-type="table" rid="t01">table 1</xref>, it can be observed that
none of the patients reported worsening of cellulite, while 53% (8/15) reported

patients, and the most frequent result was "no change", accounting for 53.3% (8/15) and

evidence that any treatment provides satisfactory and lasting clinical results. In
general, clinical studies evaluating treatments for cellulite are not randomized nor
controlled, and the evaluation of efficacy is subjective, based on patients' opinion and
on the comparison of photographs, which are not always taken in a standardized
manner.<sup><xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup></p><p>Considering the multifactorial etiopathogeny of cellulite and the scarcity of studies
with good methodology, the results of this study allow to suggest that the management of
this skin condition requires a combination of treatments.<sup><xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup><sup>.</sup><sup><xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup><sup>-</sup><sup><xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup></p><p>Since the etiopathogeny of cellulite involves several factors, particularly those of
anatomical nature, isolated techniques are not able to act on all the changes promoted
by cellulite.<sup><xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup></p><p>The most recommended therapeutic modalities in recent literature include balanced diet
associated with physical activity and the use of devices with combined technologies such
as RF, US, and laser.<sup><xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup><sup>-</sup><sup><xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> RF is one of the most
mentioned methods, but a recent review concluded that its results are modest and found
mostly in non-randomized and non-controlled studies that assessed efficacy by subjective
methods, which makes it difficult to draw conclusions about its benefit.<sup><xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> A single-center, randomized,
non-controlled study analyzed 20 women treated twice a week during six weeks with the
TriActive<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (Syneron, USA)device on one thigh and with
VelaSmooth<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (Cynosure, USA) on the other. The treatment with the TriActive
system, which combines massage and 810nm diode laser, led to a clinical improvement
comparable to that provided by the VelaSmooth system, which combines infrared light, RF,
and mechanical massage. Patients were assessed using pre- and posttreatment photographs
and biometric measurements. Although both methods provided some improvement, results
were not significant.<sup><xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup></p><p>Most studies found in the literature reviewed evaluate the efficacy of combined
techniques. One of these studies, conducted with 21 women aged between 24 and 39 years,
associated MLD with cavitational US, multipolar radiofrequency, endermologie, and LED.
After eight treatment sessions, there was, on average, a reduction of 1.62 kg in weight
and of 2.85 cm in abdominal circumference. However, most efficacy parameters were
assessed subjectively.<sup><xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup></p><p>Although the majority of studies emphasize that only a combination of treatments may
control cellulite, since its complete resolution does not seem possible, there is a need
of studies with isolated modalities to evaluate the actual contribution of each modality
when combined with other modalities. Since MLD is a very popular, low-cost method that
received satisfactory reports from women who used it, this study was proposed to
evaluate the use of this technique in a protocolized manner.</p><p>Patients' adherence is crucial in the treatment of cellulite, which is usually long and
not always provides results compatible with patient's expectations. Other factors, such
as inadequate diet, lack of weight control, smoking, type of clothing, use of hormonal
contraceptives, excessive exposure to the sun, etc., may negatively influence treatment
outcomes.<sup><xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> We believe that this study showed low adherence, because
5/20 women, or 25%, did not complete the treatment. Patients who dropped out from the
study earlier differed from those who completed it only in terms of diet control. We
believe that this finding may be explained by the fact that dropout patients did not
rely on the benefits of the treatment, which is well known and requires several sessions
at short time interval. The participants of the present research did not receive any
guidance on diet control, because the aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of
MLD when performed in isolation; if this guidance was provided, diet could be a
confounding factor. It is known that controlled diet resulting in healthy weight loss
improves cellulite appearance due to the reduction in adipose tissue.<sup><xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> In the present study, we decided not to
recommend any food restriction, with the purpose of assessing the effect of MLD alone,
because no study was found in the reviewed literature analyzing this widely used
technique in isolation. Further studies should be designed to assess treatment
combinations. Since the mass media has been announcing the "miraculous" effects of high
cost devices, which many women cannot afford, therapeutic approaches with simpler
techniques such as MLD have become less attractive.</p><p>Another important aspect that have been reported in the current scientific literature
with increasing frequency is the investigation of the impact of dermatological diseases
on patients' quality of life, which may be related not only to disease severity but also
to discomfort, stigmatization, and social interference.<sup><xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr"> 25</xref>,<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> A recent
double-blind, randomized, controlled study, conducted at the same institution as this
study, investigated the efficacy of the use of compression stockings reflecting
long-wave infrared radiation in the control of cellulite. A positive impact was observed
on women's quality of life, although there was no significant improvement in the
appearance of cellulite.<sup><xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup></p><p>The present study found an improvement in the quality of life of women with cellulite,
resulting from the significant reduction in mean DLQI scores (p = 0.018, Wilcoxon) when
comparing pre- and posttreatment scores, although all the other efficacy parameters
evaluated showed discrete or null results.</p><p>Studies assessing the isolated role of MLD on cellulite control are scarce in the
literature reviewed. In general, massage is associated with other resources, whether
topical products or laser, RF and focused US devices.<sup><xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> A previous study evaluated the effects
of MLD on the lower limbs in only three patients who underwent 20 60-minute MLD sessions
three times a week, using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI scans showed that this
technique promoted the removal of excessive interstitial fluid and improved the general
appearance of the skin.<sup><xref rid="r09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup></p><p>The effects of mechanical massage, MLD, and manipulation techniques were investigated in
60 women with cellulite divided into three groups of 20. Women in group 1 underwent 15
sessions of mechanical massage; those in group 2 underwent 20 sessions of manipulation
techniques; and those in group 3 underwent 20 MLD sessions. In addition to massage, the
participants wore compression stockings during the intervals between sessions. The
authors found that mechanical massage showed better results for suprailiac measures,
while MLD promoted better results for thigh circumference. The analysis of the results
was limited by the variable number of sessions and by the use of compression
stockings.<sup><xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup></p><p>Another study observed a reduction of 1.62 cm in thigh diameter among 50 women after
they applied a lotion containing garlic extract at a concentration of 0.0015%.<sup><xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup></p><p>The present study observed that only 33% of patients showed improvement in the grade of
cellulite and a significant reduction in waist circumference, which was estimated at 0.3
&#x000b1; 0.8 cm.</p><p>Surprisingly, none of the reviewed studies assessed bioelectrical impedance values, such
as BMI and BF%. In the present study, it was found that both variables did not show
significant reduction (p&#x0003e;0.05) in mean values after treatment, confirming that MLD
did not change either weight or body composition, which could favor the improvement of
cellulite, as balanced diet and regular physical activity do.</p><p>Human skin has elastic and plastic features, due to dermal constituents and their
organizational structure. Given its viscoelastic behavior, skin tends not to return
immediately to its initial status when undergoing a temporary deformation in its
structure caused by external forces. Life style (excessive exposure to sun, smoking,
consumption of alcohol or illicit drugs, bad eating habits, and poor quality of sleep),
as well as the use of cosmetic products and medications that could interfere with cell
renovation and loss of transepidermal water, may also change skin mechanical properties.
<sup><xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> In this study, skin elastic
and viscoelastic properties were measured before and after treatment using a suction
device (cutometer). The only significant result (p&#x0003c;0.05) was the reduction in mean R7
measures for the buttocks, which indicated worsening of elasticity. We believe that MLD
was not responsible for this finding but rather changes in life style or excessive
exposure to sun during treatment, despite instructions provided to patients.</p><p>High-resolution US did not reveal any significant difference (p&#x0003e;0.05) in any of the
measurements obtained, which indicates that the treatment did not promote any change in
dermis or in dermal-hypodermal interface.</p><p>Because of the characteristics inherent to the therapeutic modality selected for this
study, the limitations that could have influenced results are the following: sample
size, low adherence, lack of control and randomization, number and duration of MLD
sessions. Further studies involving a higher number of subjects, longer periods of
treatment, and some sort of control may find other significant results. However, it is
not possible to expect considerable changes in the clinical appearance of cellulite with
the use of MLD alone, given its complex and incompletely understood nature. The
contribution of this study is showing that this massage technique is safe but not
effective as an isolated approach for cellulite management.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>MLD was ineffective when performed in isolation, although it promoted a
