However, outbreaks of respiratory infection in Hutterite colonies occur regularly, as viruses are introduced from exposure to people outside the community. As the colonies are not very large, it is possible to obtain detailed demographic, health, and immunization information from all members.<xref rid="b8" ref-type="ref">

</xref> The implementation of a cluster randomized trial aimed at reducing influenza in the Canadian Hutterite community allowed us to prospectively collect data on other respiratory viruses. In this report, we sought to determine age&#x02010;specific incidence of laboratory&#x02010;confirmed respiratory virus infection occurring in the Hutterite community and to document the temporal relationship of virus&#x02010;specific attack rates.</p></sec><sec id="ss2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="ss3"><title>Study participants</title><p>Participants were 3273 community members of 46 Hutterite colonies from Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba who were enrolled in a cluster randomized trial (September 22 to December 23, 2008).<xref rid="b8" ref-type="ref">

</xref> By randomizing children in the Hutterite colonies to either trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine or hepatitis A vaccine, as a control, the trial was designed to determine the indirect effectiveness of influenza vaccine on unimmunized residents. The present data are based on the first year of the trial where children in colonies allocated to influenza vaccine received the vaccine recommended for the 2008&#x02013;2009 influenza season (A/Brisbane/59/2007 [H1N1]&#x02013;like virus, A/Brisbane/10/2007 [H3N2]&#x02013;like virus, B/Florida/4/2006&#x02010;like virus; Vaxigrip, Sanofi Pasteur, Lyon, France). There were no exclusion criteria for participant. All gave informed consent to participate in the study.</p></sec><sec id="ss4"><title>Follow&#x02010;up</title><p>As previously described, participants were assessed for signs and symptoms of respiratory illness over the follow&#x02010;up period, defined by the start date (&#x0003e;1 laboratory&#x02010;confirmed influenza case in two consecutive weeks from sentinel sites) and stop date (no laboratory&#x02010;confirmed influenza cases for two consecutive weeks in the sentinel sites).<xref rid="b8" ref-type="ref">
<sup>8</sup>
</xref> This period extended from December 28, 2008, until June 23, 2009. Research nurses assessed all study participants twice weekly using a standardized checklist of self&#x02010;reported symptoms or signs from study participants or parents. One representative from each household (e.g., the mother) was designated to complete the checklist for all family members and provide this when the research nurse made a site visit. The nurse would review the checklist. If anyone reported new symptoms, the nurse interviewed the study participant to confirm their symptoms and date of onset. A nasopharyngeal specimen was obtained if two or more of the following symptoms were present: fever (&#x02265;38&#x000b0;C), cough, nasal congestion, sore throat, headache, sinus problems, muscle aches, fatigue, ear ache or infection, or chills. Research nurses would also contact the household representative if the self&#x02010;reported checklists were incomplete, to follow&#x02010;up on missing data. We purchased identical thermometers for all study participants and provided instruction on thermometer use.</p><p>Influenza was detected using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&#x02019;s Human Influenza Virus Real&#x02010;time RT&#x02010;PCR Detection and Characterization Panel, which targets the matrix gene for influenza A and non&#x02010;structural gene for influenza B. Respiratory viruses were detected using a RT&#x02010;PCR method (xTAG RVP assay; Luminex, TX, USA). This assay detects coronavirus 229E, NL63, OC43, parainfluenza virus type 1, 2, 3, 4, entero/rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus A and B, human metapneumovirus, and adenovirus.</p><p>All 3273 participants were kept in the analyses for non&#x02010;influenza viruses. However, to reduce the potential for biased estimates, 1945 participants who either individually received influenza vaccine or were in study colonies assigned to the intervention arm (influenza vaccine) were excluded from the analysis for seasonal influenza virus infection, leaving 1328 participants for the analysis. To calculate incidence, we counted only the first viral infection for a specific virus, as the numerators (age&#x02010;specific), while the denominators were age&#x02010;specific person&#x02010;days, which included the entire period of surveillance for participants who were not infected with the specific virus along with the person&#x02010;days up to the point of infection for those who were infected. If a participant was swabbed more than once within 14 days, and if the same virus was detected on &#x02265;1 occasion in this time frame, then only the first episode detected was used in the analysis. To quantify the temporal relationship between the respiratory viruses, we defined an epidemic midpoint as the date when 50% of the cumulative cases of virus detected were reached over the period of surveillance.<xref rid="b9" ref-type="ref">

</xref> This was calculated for both influenza and non&#x02010;influenza viruses. We calculated incidence using events per 1000 person&#x02010;days and estimated differences in rates assuming a Poisson distribution.<xref rid="b10" ref-type="ref">

</xref> Our data suggest that entero/rhinovirus may be more common in the elderly than previously recognized, because entero/rhinovirus had the highest age&#x02010;specific incidence among participants with age &#x02265;50. The relatively high incidence of entero/rhinovirus and coronavirus compared to RSV in this age group is in keeping with a previous report that included an elderly population<xref rid="b2" ref-type="ref">

</xref> In contrast, parainfluenza was less common in our study than influenza, entero/rhinovirus, coronaviruses, and RSV. The highest incidence was, however, in children aged 0&#x02013;4.</p><p>From a clinical perspective, the high degree of co&#x02010;circulation of other respiratory viruses along with influenza as shown in <xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref> raises the question of the degree to which signs and symptoms of respiratory infection are falsely attributed to influenza, which has implications for the empiric use of anti&#x02010;virals.</p><p>A consistent finding across all respiratory viruses was that the highest incidence was in children aged 0&#x02013;4&#x02003;years or from 5 to 8&#x02003;years. The incidence generally decreases in teenaged participants and in young adults and then either reaches a plateau or increases slightly with advanced age. This could be explained by the higher incidence of viral respiratory infection in age &#x0003c;5 compared to older individuals, but also by the lower detection rate of respiratory virus in the elderly due to reduced viral shedding in older age groups.<xref rid="b13" ref-type="ref">

</xref> Influenza B infection, unlike influenza A, was not observed among adults &#x0003e;30. The most likely explanation is due to the relative conservation of influenza B immunity in older individuals, as previously reported.<xref rid="b14" ref-type="ref">

</xref> The incidence of entero/rhinovirus and coronavirus infection in older individuals was relatively higher than that of other viruses, consistent with previous studies.<xref rid="b16" ref-type="ref">

</xref> Our study has several limitations. First, the respiratory virus test is performed only within symptomatic participants during the influenza season, and the respiratory virus shedding in asymptomatic control is not evaluated. Second, because the study is performed during the 2008&#x02013;2009 influenza season, it potentially underestimates the annual incidence of respiratory viruses other than influenza which may have different season or which may cause biannual epidemic. Third, it is performed in Hutterite colonies that do not represent the general population of Canada. Another limitation is that there were three colonies dropped out of the study after randomization. However, as the characteristics of these colonies do not differ from those of the 46 colonies that participated the study, we consider this did not affect the results.</p><p>In conclusion, there were multiple co&#x02010;circulating viruses over the influenza season. Age&#x02010;specific incidence of respiratory viruses was highest in young children but with unexpected high incidence of entero/rhinovirus in this group.</p></sec><sec id="ss7"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors have no conflicts of interest.
