Due to the necessity for proper management of these injuries, understanding pathophysiology, mechanisms, and also recent diagnostic and therapeutic modalities is certainly critical. Pathophysiologically, TBIs can be classified as the primary with direct damaging the cerebrovascular tissues leading to direct neuronal injuries or the secondary to cerebral responses to other baseline pathological conditions such as cerebral edema, infections, hemorrhages, cerebral hypoxia, or increased intracranial pressure.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Eventually, both types of injuries may result in ischemic or hemorrhagic cerebral events or neuronal death. Along with pathophysiological changes following brain injury, some changes have been also identified in molecular basis.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Both primary and secondary mechanisms of injuries commonly generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) that mediate oxidative stress leading to neural dysfunction and even neuronal death.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] In this regard, the excessive expression and production of ROS following exhaustion of the endogenous antioxidant system can induce cellular and vascular peroxidation, DNA cleavage, and inhibition of the mitochondrial electron transport chain in background of brain injuries.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] In other words, because balanced production of ROS is essential for brain enzymes&#x02019; activities and cell signaling, the imbalance between oxidants and antioxidants and thus excessive production of ROS may be disrupted following injuries. Thus, defense mechanisms based on controlling ROS production and creating balance between oxidants and antioxidants are the main aim for controlling the cellular consequences resulting from brain trauma injuries.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] The critical role of selenium in creating this balance has been exclusively focused. It has been revealed that selenium dependent to glutathione (GSH) has a central antioxidant role that prevents cellular damages caused by ROS excessive production.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] In fact, GSH activity can modulate body selenium level by balancing ROS that is necessary for preventing development of neural defects following brain injuries. Based on these evidences, it is now suggested that intake of selenium supplements may bolster preventive mechanisms against cellular injuries caused by misbalancing between oxidants and antioxidants.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Accordingly, the present study was carried out to examine this hypothesis that administration of selenium can prevent the development of injuries by brain trauma and thus can modulate patients&#x02019; functional recovery and also improve posttraumatic outcome.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>aterials and</sc> M<sc>ethods</sc></title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study population</title><p>After obtaining approval from the Ethics Committee of Iran University of Medical Sciences (IR. IUMS.rec. 1394.9311692002) and also getting written informed consent in accordance with national legislation (from the alert patients or from the patient's legal representative for unconscious condition), this randomized double-blinded controlled trial was performed with IRCT registration number of IRCT2015090223865N1. The study population included the patients aged higher than 18 years that were hospitalized following brain trauma with Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score 12 or less and with at least one pupil reaction to light. The exclusion criteria were GCS of 3, no bilateral pupil reaction to light, chance of live being of &#x0003c;24 h, the presence of hypotension (systolic blood pressure &#x0003c;90 mmHg) for more than 10 min, spinal cord injury, pregnancy, single epidural hematoma, or history of renal dysfunction.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Intervention protocol</title><p>The participants were randomly (through simple randomization, according to the first right digit of national code that could be even or odd) assigned into two groups as the case group (that received selenium [Selenase, Biosyn co., Germany] 500 &#x000b5;g intravenously at 100 ml normal saline for 30 min and then 500 &#x000b5;g at 100 ml normal saline during 24 h continuously for 14 days in addition to standard care) and the control group (that benefited only from standard care). The standard treatment in both groups consisted of respiratory support, prevention of seizure, fluid and electrolyte balancing, and prevention of stress ulcers and deep vein thrombosis. If there was evidence of cerebral edema in computed tomography (CT) scan, proper treatment (head elevation, osmotic therapy, diuretic therapy, hyperventilation, analgesics, sedatives, and cerebrospinal fluid drainage) was considered. Both infused solutions had similar color and volume (100 ml) and were marked with code A or B.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Study measurements and endpoints</title><p>For all participants, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) III score was determined on the 1<sup>st</sup> and 15<sup>th</sup> days. Since the beginning of the study to 15 days, the level of consciousness was daily determined based on FOUR score, and functional status of the organs was also determined on Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score. The patients were also assessed regarding selenium side effects including nausea, vomiting, nail changes, hair loss, the smell of garlic, and facial flushing. The primary endpoint was to assess patients&#x02019; functional recovery in 60 &#x000b1; 10 days after TBI based on extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS-E) scale. In this scaling system, the recovery was leveled as E1 (death), E2 (vegetative status), E3 and E4 (severe disability), E5 and E6 (moderate disability), and E7 and E8 (good recovery). Appropriate recovery was defined as GOS-E &#x02265;7 in patients with moderate injuries (GCS of 9&#x02013;12), GOS-E &#x02265;5 in patients with moderate to severe injuries (GCS of 6&#x02013;8), and GOS-E &#x02265;3 in patients with severe injuries (GCS of 4 or 5). The second endpoint was to determine and compare the change in APACHE III score on the 15<sup>th</sup> day compared to the 1<sup>st</sup> day, the daily changes in FOUR score and SOFA score within 15 days of first interventions, side effects of selenium, length of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) stay, and length of hospital stay between the two groups.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>For statistical analysis, results were presented as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation for quantitative variables and were summarized by absolute frequencies and percentages for categorical variables.

The most frequent cause of brain trauma in selenium and control groups included traffic accident (71.9% vs. 71.4%), followed by falling (21.1% vs. 17.9%), dispute (3.5% vs. 5.4%), and other causes (3.5% vs. 5.4%) without between-group difference (<italic>P</italic> = 0.90).

In other words, along with standard supportive protocols and treatment approaches in these patients, using intravenous selenium on admission may lead to lower mortality and morbidity. In the present study, administration of 500 &#x000b5;g selenium per day for 14 days in addition to standard treatment could not change patients&#x02019; outcome including functional recovery, mean time for mechanical ventilation, level of consciousness, and also living status and length of hospital and ICU stay. As previously pointed, TBI as a main reason for mortality and disability in the world has been identified as a progressive disorder with primary defects such as intracranial hemorrhage, contusion, or diffuse cerebral defects after trauma led to secondary injuries. The basis of metabolic disturbances includes the production of free oxygen radicals, stimulatory amino acids (aspartate and glutamate), inflammatory cytokines (interleukins 1 and 6 [IL 1 and 6] and tumor necrosis factor-alpha), and finally brain edema and tissue damages.</p><p>Despite employing different treatment protocols for improving outcome of traumatic injuries, most clinical trials with the purpose of inhibiting secondary factors such as lipid peroxidation (steroids and tirilazad), free radicals (superoxide dismutase), calcium channel blocking (nimodipine), glutamate (selfotel), apoptosis (cyclosporine A), and edema (substance <italic>P</italic> antagonists) had limited success.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] The present study is the first human clinical trial that assessed the therapeutic effect of selenium. Previous studies were carried out as animal studies that could show significant effects of selenium as brain tissue support. In a recent study by Naziroglu <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] it was shown that selenium as a thiol redox system antioxidant can protect brain tissue against inflammation and stress oxidative. They could show that the effect of selenium can be induced by affecting apoptosis, oxidative stress, and Ca (2+) influx through TRPV1 channel activations in brain tissue, particularly in the hippocampus. In another study by Senol <italic>et al</italic>., the lipid peroxidation and IL-1 &#x003b2; values were decreased by selenium treatments, whereas plasma levels of IL-4, brain cortex GSH, total antioxidant status, and Vitamin C and E values were increased by administrating selenium.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Yeo and Kang also indicated that selenite potentially inhibited H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced apoptosis of neural progenitor cells in TBI.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] This <italic>in vivo</italic> protective function could be associated with inhibition of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced ROS generation, cytochrome c release, and caspase-3 and -9 activation.</p><p>Considering significant effects of selenium use on critical ill conditions and its positive effects on diseases outcome, the lack of association between selenium use and outcome of TBIs might be related to using low dosages of selenium and considering short follow-up time. Thus, to ensure the beneficial effects of drug, further studies with administrating different selenium dosages and with longer follow-up times are essential.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion"
