However, few school-based SDT intervention studies have been conducted, and no research exists with children of low socio-economic status (SES). Therefore, SDT-derived needs-supportive teaching techniques informed the design and analyses of the Healthy Choices Programme (HCP). The aim was to determine if the HCP could enhance moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and well-being among children of low SES through increasing autonomy-support, needs satisfaction and intrinsic motivation.</p></sec><sec><title>Method</title><p id="Par2">A mixed factorial two (group)&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;two (time) wait-list controlled trial was conducted and reported using the TREND guidelines.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Background</title><p id="Par19">Well-being is a key indicator of health and refers to an individual&#x02019;s optimal psychological functioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Globally, approximately 80% of school youth do not meet the World Health Organization&#x02019;s (WHO) moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) guidelines for health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], with similar figures (i.e. 82%) reported among Irish children of low socio-economic status (SES) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The adverse health effects of physical inactivity are well established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], and given studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] show that childhood physical activity behaviours track into adulthood, these low figures are of public health concern. Hence, evidence-based physical activity interventions are needed and specifically with children of low socio-economic status (SES) who are at even increased risk of reduced health and well-being compared to the general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par20">Theory-based physical activity interventions can highlight the psychological and social processes that underlie children&#x02019;s health and behaviour change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. While many school-based physical activity interventions have adopted a theory in their design, few studies have included theoretical constructs related to psychological needs and motivation in their analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. As such, there remains limited information on the psychosocial mechanisms responsible for improving children&#x02019;s physical activity levels and well-being [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. To advance physical activity and well-being promotion it has been proposed that psychosocial variables be included in all aspects of the design and analyses of interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par21">To explore behaviour change processes, researchers have applied constructs from self-determination theory (SDT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Collectively, sub-theories within SDT specify that the satisfaction of humans&#x02019; psychological needs for competence (i.e. a sense of effectiveness within environment), autonomy (i.e. volitional behaviour) and relatedness (i.e. belongingness) are essential for optimal motivation, health behaviour and well-being. In support of SDT hypotheses, children&#x02019;s physical activity has consistently been predicted by autonomous motivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], and in some cases, well-being has been predicted by physical activity contexts that satisfy children&#x02019;s psychological needs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. However, SDT has received limited application in school-based intervention studies.</p><p id="Par22">The aim of SDT-informed interventions is to engender needs-supportive social conditions wherein enhancement of physical activity and well-being is realised indirectly through needs-support and satisfaction, and autonomous motivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] (see SDT model for health interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]). One validated SDT-informed intervention technique is needs-supportive teaching techniques utilised by intervention deliverers (e.g. school teachers) who can be trained to offer participants physical activity choices (i.e. autonomy support), provide positive instructional feedback (i.e. competence support) and develop a supportive relationship (i.e. relatedness support) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In five school-based intervention studies, participants have been receptive to such techniques by reporting enhanced perceptions of needs-support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. However, all but one [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] of those studies was with pre-adolescent children (6&#x02013;12&#x000a0;years), and none were from areas of low SES&#x02013;&#x02013;a group at risk for reduced well-being [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Furthermore, existing studies have either excluded the well-being [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] or needs satisfaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] components of SDT in their model. Considering the evidence collectively, it is unclear if needs-supportive techniques can exert an influence on each variable on SDT&#x02019;s causal chain (i.e. autonomy-support, needs satisfaction, motivational regulation) and whether facilitation of those processes predict improved physical activity and well-being among children of low SES.</p><p id="Par23">In response to the outlined limitations, a 10-week intervention called the Healthy Choices Programme (HCP) was developed for 8&#x02013;9-year-old children of low SES. The programme&#x02019;s content, delivery and analyses were consistent with SDT hypotheses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The intervention sought to enhance children&#x02019;s physical activity and well-being through providing needs-supportive teacher training to the delivering sport student volunteers and classroom teachers. The aim was to determine the effect of the HCP through modelling a process that linked autonomy-support, needs satisfaction and intrinsic motivation with physical activity and well-being.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study hypotheses</title><p id="Par24">The first hypothesis was that the HCP would increase the intervention group&#x02019;s perceptions of autonomy-support from their teachers in comparison to a control group (hypothesis 1 (H1)). The second (H2) and third (H3) hypotheses were that intervention group&#x02019;s needs satisfaction and intrinsic motivation would increase through the mediation of autonomy support. Lastly, hypotheses four (H4) and five (H5) were that the intervention would, respectively, indirectly enhance MVPA and well-being, through the autonomy support, needs satisfaction and intrinsic motivation sequential pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Design, Inclusion Criteria, Recruitment Setting and Procedure</title><p id="Par25">The reporting of the HCP adhered to the Transparent Reporting of Evaluations with Non-Randomised Designs (TREND) statement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and was registered on Research Registry (trial number 2852). Following approval from Ulster University&#x02019;s Research Ethics Committee, two schools from Northern Ireland (NI) were identified for a 2 (groups)&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;&#x000a0;2 (time-points) wait-list controlled trial. This entailed purposively selecting the intervention and control groups and staggering the delivery of the HCP across two school semesters whilst collecting data at the same time ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). To reduce the potential for contamination, the control school Principal delayed announcement of the HCP until the following school semester, and both schools were unaware of their school&#x02019;s data being compared during the intervention.</p><p id="Par26">An inclusion criterion was based on the Multiple Deprivation Measure in Northern Ireland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. This index has seven domains of socio-economic deprivation including income, services and crime. Having identified schools of low SES on the measure, two schools with likewise demographics (i.e. mixed gender, urban, size) were approached for recruitment. Both school Principals agreed and invited all Primary five pupils to participate. Participant assent and parental consent were gained prior to conducting the research.</p><p id="Par27">A group of trained researchers conducted baseline (week 0) and post-intervention (week 11) measurements (discussed below) with the pupils under quiet classroom conditions. The classroom teacher was present at all times.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Intervention</title><p id="Par28">The HCP was delivered for 2&#x000a0;h and 15&#x000a0;min each week during school curriculum time for a 10-week period (i.e. 22.5&#x000a0;h of instruction in total). The intervention was in addition to general physical education classes and included (i) weekly hour-long practical sessions delivered by a trained sport student volunteer in tandem with, and&#x000a0;under the supervision of classroom teacher and (ii) a &#x02018;Daily Mile&#x02019; that involved the classroom teacher leading a 15-min walk every school day. SDT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] informed several aspects of the programme described below.</p><p id="Par29">The weekly sessions consisted of a series of active discussions and physical tasks that contained messages around the health benefits of physical activity. The student volunteers received a teaching resource detailing language and techniques consistent with needs-supportive tenets in SDT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], e.g. &#x02018;acknowledge the activities were challenging and congratulate the children for trying their best&#x02019;. Likewise, the classroom teachers also received a teaching resource including the above language and walking activities that would facilitate autonomy-choice for the children. For example, the &#x02018;mirror image&#x02019; activity entailed walking partners completing the Daily Mile in tandem with a choice to mirror each other&#x02019;s movements.</p><p id="Par30">Student volunteers completed a two-day SDT training programme. The training was focused on facilitating the student volunteers&#x02019; understanding of a needs-supportive instructional style [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Their training included a discussion regarding the students&#x02019; experiences of Duda&#x02019;s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] empowering vs disempowering climate and a video evaluation of an authoritative-command vs autonomy-supportive teaching style using a rater proforma (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The students were then presented with vignettes in which children were in need of competence or autonomy-support and were required to produce needs-supportive techniques to enhance engagement. Finally, the students completed a peer-teaching quality assessment of a Healthy Choices Programme session and were assessed in line with an adapted version of Reeve et al.&#x02019;s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] teacher observation sheet (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).

To link an autonomy-supportive teaching style with relevant teaching practices in the Northern Ireland Key Stage Two Curriculum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], &#x02018;active learning&#x02019; techniques were used. Active learning entails creating a learner-centred environment, in which the children are encouraged to participate in the direction of a lesson through questions, activity choice and feedback [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].

As such, our findings are consistent with the trans-contextual model of motivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], suggesting that autonomy-support from teachers can transfer its effects to general physical activity motivations.</p><p id="Par52">In comparison to the control group, the intervention group increased their total and MVPA during school days from baseline to post-intervention (i.e. 4.49&#x000a0;min improvement). Whilst regular MVPA is essential for children&#x02019;s health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], many school teachers indicate time as a barrier for behaviour change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. This study highlighted that integrating basic, time-efficient, and physical activities into the school day can have a meaningful impact on children&#x02019;s behaviour change, suggesting that educators consider completing curriculum-based activities with physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Moreover, the psychosocial processes reported for these effects can inform future health promotion efforts. Consistent with SDT, the MVPA variance was explained through partial mediation of autonomy-support, needs satisfaction and intrinsic motivation (H4). Support for H4 provides evidence congruent with a meta-analysis of 46 studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], suggesting that pre-adolescent children&#x02019;s physical activity can be enhanced and is most strongly regulated through autonomous intrinsic motivational states rather than extrinsic motives. However, there was a degree of variance unexplained by SDT constructs in model 1. The lack of full mediation through SDT mediators is unsurprising given that the Integrated Behaviour Change Model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], among other dual-process models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], denotes unconscious psychological processes beyond intentional motivations that provide schema for children&#x02019;s physical activity (e.g. affective responses, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] for a review). Future research may consider testing SDT alongside assumptions within or alongside validated dual-process models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] to improve the prediction and enhancement of physical activity behaviours in children.</p><p id="Par53">The HCP did not exert a significant direct effect on well-being, supporting conclusions in a recent systematic review of school-based physical activity interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] and randomised controlled trial designed to increase well-being [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. However, the HCP had an indirect effect on well-being through autonomy-support and needs satisfaction, confirming H5. This finding, coupled with the results of a school-based screen-time intervention incorporating SDT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], supports the conceptualisation of well-being from a eudemonic perspective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], in which well-being is realised through the social environment providing support for one&#x02019;s psychological needs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>].</p><p id="Par54">Furthermore, the indirect effect of the intervention on well-being through autonomy-support and needs satisfaction reinforces previous research that documented a positive correlation between needs satisfaction during physical activity and well-being [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], indicating that needs satisfaction at a domain level (i.e. physical activity) may transfer its effects to well-being at a global day-to-day level. In addition, while previous research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] has reported a direct unidimensional relationship between physical activity and well-being, the indirect effects found in the present study suggest a more nuanced association [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The psychosocial explanation that physical activity contexts provide an opportunity for social belongingness (i.e. relatedness), environmental mastery (i.e. competence) and volition (i.e. autonomy) was evidenced to facilitate well-being among children of low SES. When aiming to enhance well-being through physical activity, researchers and practitioners may consider modifying the social climate through offering psychological needs-support rather than just the behaviour alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec14"><title>Generalisability and Limitations</title><p id="Par55">The design of this study was specific to children in the school setting. Therefore, adaptation and use of needs-supportive techniques for other populations (e.g. adults) and contexts (e.g. online) may refer to a recent review on needs-supportive physical activity communication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. While the authors followed available methodological guidance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] by maintaining communication with the delivering teachers and student volunteers, including revisiting the aims of the SDT principles applied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>], there was a lack of empirical fidelity data upon which to conclude on the efficacy of the study fidelity. We refer the reader to a recent theoretical fidelity evaluation study of a likewise SDT programme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] for addressing such issues in future work. Moreover, it was not possible to conduct a follow-up to test whether the effects reported maintained longitudinally a recognised limitation of the waiting list design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. While all efforts were ensured to reduce the potential for contamination, the design of this study would have been improved through a clustered randomised control trial design comprising additional participants.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par56">A key strength of the current study was the design, application and analyses of SDT-informed needs-supportive teaching techniques. This study demonstrated that the HCP enhanced MVPA partially through increasing the children&#x02019;s perceptions of autonomy-support, needs satisfaction and intrinsic motivation. Well-being was also indirectly enhanced through improvements in autonomy-support and needs satisfaction. The indirect effects of the HCP highlighted motivational and needs-supportive mechanisms underpinning children&#x02019;s MVPA participation and well-being. As such, the practical implications of this study can guide researchers and practitioners towards modifying the social environment in which physical activity is experienced through utilising needs-supportive teaching principles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. To build on the findings from this research, further work may consider conducting a clustered RCT incorporating the recommended methodologies to explore if such changes can be maintained longitudinally. Such work could examine the influence of needs-support provided to the children by their teachers, student volunteers and parents, who all contributed to the intervention. Overall, the HCP is a theory-driven study that can advance health promotion in the school setting.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional file</title><sec id="Sec16"><p>
