Affecting both children and adults, AD is characterized by red, inflamed, eczematous lesions and pruritus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], with up to 90&#x000a0;% of patients presenting with mild-to-moderate disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In infants and young children, the face, neck, and extensor skin areas are frequently involved, while older children and adults often present with flexural fold involvement of the extremities (i.e., antecubital and popliteal fossae) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In addition to disease involvement in sensitive skin areas, patients with AD have higher skin sensitivity (e.g., stinging, burning, itching, pain) to cosmetics and environmental factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Psoriasis can occur at any stage of an individual&#x02019;s life, and is often characterized by red plaques of thickened skin covered in silver or white scales that may affect any area of the body, with the knees, elbows, lower back, and scalp being the most common sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. While plaque psoriasis (also known as psoriasis vulgaris) is the most common type of psoriasis (approximately 90&#x000a0;% of all cases), other site-specific variants also exist, such as inverse psoriasis, which is often smooth, red, and shiny in appearance, affecting sensitive skin fold areas (e.g., groin, gluteal cleft, axillae, and genitals) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>Although chronic inflammatory skin diseases such as AD and psoriasis can be effectively treated with topical treatments, a number of safety concerns warrant special consideration. In psoriasis, cutaneous irritation may develop following treatment with topical retinoids and vitamin D analogs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Topical corticosteroids (TCSs) and topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCIs) are effective treatment options for AD, but use of TCS on thin-skinned areas such as the face, intertriginous areas, and genitals are limited by potential adverse effects. TCIs are associated with application-site reactions (e.g., burning or stinging sensations), particularly in sensitive skin areas, and contain a boxed warning citing cases of malignancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Additionally, the American Academy of Dermatology and the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma &#x00026; Immunology has issued guidelines recommending that the application of TCSs on the face, eyelids, genitalia, and intertriginous areas be avoided or administered with caution to avoid increased risk of systemic absorption and subsequent systemic adverse effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>Therefore, effective and well-tolerated topical treatment alternatives that can be safely applied to the face and other thin and sensitive skin areas are needed for inflammatory skin diseases such as AD and psoriasis. Crisaborole topical ointment, 2&#x000a0;% (formerly AN2728; Anacor Pharmaceuticals, Palo Alto, CA, USA), is a nonsteroidal, anti-inflammatory, phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor being investigated for the treatment of AD and psoriasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In preclinical studies, topical administration of crisaborole in an in vivo mouse model demonstrated anti-inflammatory activity without dermal irritation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>Phase II and III clinical studies evaluating crisaborole topical ointment have been conducted in patients with mild-to-moderate AD, providing evidence supporting the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of this novel topical treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Additionally, phase II clinical studies have demonstrated preliminary evidence supporting safety, efficacy, and tolerability in patients with mild-to-moderate psoriasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].

In addition, topical medications offer the ability to locally target skin inflammation with a lower risk of systemic adverse events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p>Effective topical therapies are available for the treatment of AD and psoriasis, but the treatment of these conditions in sensitive skin areas, such as the face, neck, genitals, and flexural folds of the extremities, can be challenging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Application of TCS to these thin skin sites is often avoided due to the increased risk of systemic absorption and subsequent development of systemic side effects [e.g., hypothalamic&#x02013;pituitary&#x02013;adrenal axis suppression] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. TCSs should also be used with caution in pediatric patients who have a greater BSA-to-weight ratio, which increases the degree of TCS absorption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Although TCIs do not carry the same risks as TCSs with sensitive skin areas, their use is often associated with application-site reactions (stinging/burning/itching), with 8.5&#x02013;10.4&#x000a0;% of Elidel&#x02122;-treated (Novartis Pharmaceuticals&#x000a0;Corporation, Whippany, NJ, USA) patients and 43&#x02013;58&#x000a0;% of Protopic&#x02122;-treated (Astellas Pharma US, Inc., Deerfield, IL, USA) patients experiencing application-site burning in vehicle-controlled phase III studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. For psoriasis, topical vitamin D analogs and retinoids are associated with cutaneous irritation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Furthermore, currently available topical medications for the treatment of psoriasis subtypes, such as inverse and genital psoriasis, should be used with care to minimize the risk of cutaneous irritation and toxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Patient concern for these potential adverse effects of topical therapies for both AD and psoriasis may reduce treatment adherence or compliance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. There is a need for new alternative topical treatment options that can be applied safely with minimal tolerability issues, particularly in sensitive skin areas.</p><p>Current evidence from clinical studies has demonstrated that crisaborole topical ointment, 2&#x000a0;%, may be an efficacious and safe treatment for mild-to-moderate AD and psoriasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Phase I and II studies in patients with psoriasis demonstrated that crisaborole ointment was well tolerated for 12&#x000a0;days or 4&#x000a0;weeks of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In addition, phase II studies in patients with AD demonstrated that crisaborole treatment for 28&#x000a0;days, without application-site restrictions for sensitive skin areas, was well tolerated by the majority of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The results of this phase I study in healthy volunteers indicate that crisaborole ointment has a promising safety and tolerability profile when applied to thin and sensitive skin areas, further supporting its use as a potential topical treatment option in inflammatory skin diseases such as AD and psoriasis. Future studies are needed to allow for direct comparison of drug efficacy and tolerability of crisaborole to TCS and TCI.</p><p>The current study is associated with limitations that should be considered. First, the study was conducted at a single center in Australia in a small racially homogenous (all White) sample of healthy adult subjects whose skin sensitivity may not be representative of pediatric subjects, subjects with chronic inflammatory skin disease, or subjects of different races/ethnicities. Second, the study did not examine all possible anatomic areas that may be affected by AD or psoriasis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Findings from this study demonstrate that crisaborole ointment was well tolerated when applied to thin and sensitive skin areas in healthy volunteers and may represent a desirable topical treatment option for patients with AD or psoriasis. Future clinical studies are needed to confirm these findings in both AD and psoriasis patient populations.
