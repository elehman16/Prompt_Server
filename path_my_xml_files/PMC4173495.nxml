The patients were randomly allocated in two equal groups by a closed envelope technique into Group A and Group B.</p><p>After keeping patients NPO for 6 h, in odd ratio preloading was done with ringer lactate solution 15 ml/kg of body weight. Subarachnoid block was performed with 23 G Quincke's needle in the L3-L4 interspace in the lateral position and the study drug was injected. Group A received 2 ml of pentazocine (30 mg/ml) and Group B received 2 ml of 0.5% bupivacaine heavy solution intrathecally. Patients were immediately placed in the supine position. Intra operatively, no sedation or analgesia was given to any of the patients.</p><p>Onset of sensory analgesia was monitored from the time of intrathecal injection to the level of sensory block achieved around T10 level. Duration of analgesia was assessed from the time of sensory level achieved to the time of regression of two dermatomes or the time to start of alternative modes of analgesia. Total duration of post-operative analgesia was determined by assessing pain half hourly up to 6 h and then hourly for 12 h. Degree of motor blockade was assessed using bromage scale. Duration of motor blockade was assessed from the time of grade 4 power to grade 1 power.</p><p>Heart rate (HR) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were recorded at pre-induction, at 1, 3, 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 min after subarachnoid block. A decrease in the MAP to more than 30% of the pre-block value was treated initially with a bolus of 250-500 ml of IV fluids followed by intravenous ephedrine in the dose of 3-6 mg, on failure to respond with intravenous fluids.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Distributions of patients in both groups were similar with respect to demographics, duration of surgery, and operative procedures.

It also provides adequate post-operative pain relief. Intrathecal pentazocine exhibits all effects of the subarachnoid administration of local anesthetic including motor, sensory and sympathetic blockade.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>In the present study, the upper level of sensory blockade varied around T11 in the group A, whereas it was T8 in group B. A higher sensory block in local anesthetic group could be attributed to the lesser rostral spread of pentazocine in CSF because of their higher lipid solubility.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] There was no significant difference statistically between the two groups in terms of duration of surgical anesthesia. The duration of analgesia produced by intrathecal pentazocine exceeded considerably as compared to the duration of analgesia obtained by intrathecal bupivacaine.</p><p>Another interesting observation was that though two dermatomal regression of sensory block was more rapid the time required for the first rescue analgesia was significantly prolonged in pentazocine group as compared to bupivacaine group. This could be because of the prolonged duration of action of subarachnoid opioids as compared to local anesthetics deposited intrathecally.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Significantly low MAP in Group B at 1, 3 and 5 min, probably was because local anesthetic caused more intense sympathetic blockade. At the same time, no significant difference between groups in the MAP at 10 and 15 min could be because the hypotension in group B was corrected with IV fluids or vasopressors. The significantly reduced MAP in group evident again at 30, 45 and 60 min could again be explained because of persisting local anesthetic induced hypotension. By 90-120 min, the insignificant difference in the MAP in both groups could be because, the vasodilation caused by the sympathetic blockade had started to wean off and intravascular volume had been expanded by intraoperative IV fluids. The hemodynamic stability following intrathecal pentazocine could be advantageous in high risk patients with coronary artery disease, hypovolemia and also in old age with the added advantage of prolonged post-operative analgesia.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Because of adequate surgical anesthesia, intraoperative hemodynamic stability and prolonged post-operative analgesia, we recommend the use of intrathecal pentazocine as a sole anesthetic agent for lower limb surgeries.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Hamber</surname><given-names>EA</given-names></name><name><surname>Viscomi</surname><given-names>CM</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Intrathecal lipophilic opioids as adjuncts to surgical spinal anesthesia</article-title><source>Reg Anesth Pain Med</source><year>1999</year><volume>24</volume><fpage>255</fpage><lpage>63</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">10338179</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Shekhar</surname><given-names>Tiwari C</given-names></name><name><surname>Agnihotri</surname><given-names>VM</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Intrathecal pentazocine as sole anaesthetic agent</article-title><source>Indian J Anaesth</source><year>1997</year><volume>40</volume><fpage>30</fpage><lpage>6</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Cheun</surname><given-names>JK</given-names></name><name><surname>Cho</surname><given-names>ST</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Spinal anesthesia with pentazocine for total abdominal hysterectomy</article-title><source>J Anesth</source><year>1988</year><volume>2</volume><fpage>98</fpage><lpage>100</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15235841</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Swaraj</surname></name><name><surname>Saxena</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Sabzposh</surname><given-names>SW</given-names></name><name><surname>Shakoor</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Effect on intrathecal pentazocine on postoperative pain relief</article-title><source>J Indian Med Assoc</source><year>1988</year><volume>86</volume><fpage>93</fpage><lpage>6</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">3171206</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Chawla</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Arora</surname><given-names>MK</given-names></name><name><surname>Saksena</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Gode</surname><given-names>GR</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Efficacy and dose-response of intrathecal pentazocine for post-operative pain relief</article-title><source>Indian J Med Res</source><year>1989</year><volume>90</volume><fpage>220</fpage><lpage>3</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">2767747</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref6"><label>6</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Seewal</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Shende</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Kashyap</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Mohan</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Effects of addition of fentanyl (10, 20, 30 and 40 mcg) intrathecally to 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine on periopoerative analgesia and subarachnoid characteristics in lower</article-title><source>Am Soc Anesthesiol 2002196:A885</source></element-citation></ref></ref-list></back></article>
