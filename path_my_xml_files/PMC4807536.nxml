Deep relaxation and beneficial effects on e.g. stress, sleep difficulties, anxiety and depression have been documented in earlier research. Despite that treatments for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) are effective; it is till the least successfully treated anxiety disorder, indicating that treatment protocols can be enhanced. The use of Flotation-REST as a treatment of GAD has not been researched. The aim of the present study was to conduct an initial evaluation of the effects in a self-diagnosed GAD sample.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This study was a randomized, parallel group, non-blinded trial with 1:1 allocation ratio to waiting list control group (<italic>n&#x02009;=</italic>&#x02009;25) or to a twelve session treatment with flotation-REST (<italic>n&#x02009;=</italic>&#x02009;25). Inclusion criteria&#x02019;s were: 18&#x02013;65 years and GAD (as defined by self-report measures). The primary outcome was GAD-symptomatology, and secondary outcomes were depression, sleep difficulties, emotion regulation difficulties and mindfulness. Assessments were made at three time points (baseline, four weeks in treatment, post-treatment), and at six-month follow-up. The main data analyses were conducted with a two-way MANOVA and additional t-tests. Forty-six participants (treatment, <italic>n&#x02009;=</italic>&#x02009;24; control, <italic>n&#x02009;=</italic>&#x02009;22) were included in the analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A significant <italic>Time x Group</italic> interaction effect for GAD-symptomatology [<italic>F</italic><sub>(2,88)</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.93, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001, <italic>&#x003b7;</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub><sup><italic>2</italic></sup>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.062] was found.

Regarding clinical significant change, 37&#x000a0;% in the treatment group reached full remission at post-treatment. Significant beneficial effects were also found for sleep difficulties, difficulties in emotional regulation, and depression, while the treatment had ambiguous or non-existent effects on pathological worry and mindfulness. All improved outcome variables at post-treatment, except for depression, were maintained at 6-months follow. No negative effects were found.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The findings suggest that the method has potential as a complementary treatment alongside existing treatment for GAD.

GAD is a relatively common disorder, with a lifetime prevalence rating of 5.7&#x000a0;%, and a 12-month prevalence of 3.1&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. It has been associated with considerable suffering and functional impairment, as well as high costs for society [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In addition, GAD is associated with high risk of comorbidity, in which depression is the most common secondary diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Several risk factors for developing GAD have been proposed, such as traumas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], innate emotional responsiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], dysfunctional interpersonal processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], as well as insecure attachment style [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>Although pharmacological treatment has been shown to be effective for treating GAD [(e. g.) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]], psychotherapies are usually preferred over medication by patients and clinicians alike [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Several psychotherapeutic interventions for GAD have been developed and most of them are based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Many of the contemporary CBT conceptualizations of GAD propose that the core problem in the disorder is worry, which serves as an avoidance strategy of internal experiences, while others emphasize difficulties in emotion regulation as the central problem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In addition, low levels of trait mindfulness have been proposed to play an important role in the psychopathology of GAD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. This is supported by clinical studies where mindfulness training has proven to be a robust intervention to reduce anxiety symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] as well as by being applied successfully as a primary treatment for GAD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>Although CBT is to be considered an effective method for treating GAD, it is not as effective as for other types of anxiety disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. It has also been pointed out that the majority of treated GAD patients only reach partial remission, which further highlights that many of those which respond to treatment still have residual symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Taken together this suggest that treatment protocols might be improved, by for example adding some form of complementary treatment. In addition, it could be valuable to evaluate alternative forms of treatment for GAD, since some patients prefer complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) to conventional interventions or use it alongside first-line treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>The present study evaluates a CAM therapy, namely flotation-REST (Restricted Environmental Stimulation Technique) as an intervention for a self-diagnosed GAD-sample. Flotation-REST has to date not been studied primarily as an intervention for GAD, but the method has in earlier research been shown to reduce stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], anxiety [(e. g.) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]] and depression [(e. g.) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]], as well as to alleviate many of the symptoms associated with GAD, such as sleep difficulties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], fatigue [(e. g.) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], and muscle tension pains [(e. g.) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]]. During flotation-REST a person is lying horizontally, face up, inside a quiet and dark tank, filled with salt (magnesium sulphate) saturated water held at 35&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C (95&#x000a0;F). The water has high buoyancy, which makes it possible to float comfortably on the back inside of the tank. It has been suggested that the method achieves its beneficial effects through deep relaxation that is induced by sensory isolation, and effects of treatment are manifested without much effort or specific instructions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Contemporary research on flotation-REST has established a treatment protocol consisting of 12 sessions (&#x000e1; 45&#x000a0;min) twice a week, which has been suggested to be sufficient to reach the desired therapeutic effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Flotation-REST has also been used successfully as a treatment for chronic pain conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], burn-out syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], as well as a preventive health-care intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. There are also pilot studies showing promising results when flotation-REST is combined with psychotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Taken together earlier research indicate that flotation-REST might have potential as an complementary or alternative intervention for GAD, but due to the focus and methodological shortcomings in earlier studies further research need to establish the effectiveness of flotation-REST as treatment for GAD. As a first step to clarify this the present study aims to conduct an initial evaluation to gather information which could guide further research in the field, and answer the question if it could be fruitful to study flotation-REST as a treatment for GAD. The main aim of the study was to evaluate a 12 session treatment program of flotation-REST on suggested core problems (pathological worry; emotional regulation difficulties; and low mindfulness), the most common secondary diagnosis (depression), as well as the symptomatology (e. g. fatigue, sleep-difficulties, muscle tension) associated with GAD. The primary outcome in this study was the general level of GAD-symptomatology, and the secondary outcomes were depression, sleep difficulties, emotion regulation difficulties and mindfulness. In addition, deviation from normal state during the flotation session was measured to assess level of subjective relaxation during the flotation sessions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Method</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participants</title><p>Fifty-nine participants were recruited to the study. Recruitment was made through outpatient psychiatric care, as well as by advertisement in a local paper, stating that sufferers of prolonged anxiety problems, and with an age of 18&#x02013;65 years, were welcomed to register their interest to participate in a study on relaxation in flotation tank. All recruitment was made from October 2013 to April 2014. Interested individuals who by telephone contact seemed fitting to participate (<italic>n&#x02009;=</italic>&#x02009;59), were screened with the Generalized Anxiety Questionnaire 4th edition (GAD-Q-IV) and the Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ) using a cut-off score found to successfully detect generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) in both clinical and non-clinical samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. From the recruited sample (<italic>n&#x02009;=</italic>&#x02009;59), in total fifty met the inclusion criteria&#x02019;s and were randomized to either treatment condition (<italic>n&#x02009;=</italic>&#x02009;25) or waiting-list control condition (<italic>n&#x02009;=</italic>&#x02009;25). The randomization was conducted by the researchers, who asked the participants to take a slip of paper from a jar. The jar contained 50 paper slips numbered from 1 to 50, where odd numbers indicated an allocation to treatment condition and even numbers allocation to waiting list control condition. Allocation was performed after the baseline assessments were made. One participant in the treatment condition and three participants in the waiting list condition did not complete the study due to unknown reasons. In addition, five participants in the treatment condition did not complete the six-month follow-up assessments.

The items consist of statements such as <italic>&#x0201c;I could see images clearly&#x0201d;</italic>, <italic>&#x0201c;It felt like I was about to fall asleep&#x0201d;</italic> and <italic>&#x0201c;I felt a deep peace within me&#x0201d;</italic>, which were graded on VAS-scales ranging from 0 to 100 on how well they corresponded to the experience during the flotation-REST session. The EDN yields a total score by averaging the scoring from the 29 items. In earlier studies on flotation-REST [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] in which the EDN has been used, Cronbachs&#x02019;s alpha has been measured to 0.91&#x02013;0.97, suggesting good reliability. A score of 30 on EDN at the first flotation session, and a score of 40 at the subsequent flotation sessions, is viewed as an indication of typical treatment response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], and can be compared to resting on a bed in a dark quiet room which in general gives score of 15 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Background information</title><p>Background information was assessed using a self-constructed questionnaire which contained questions regarding age, gender, as well as questions related to the exclusion criteria&#x02019;s.

The tanks were filled with water saturated with Epsom salt (magnesium sulphate) approximately 0.3&#x000a0;m in depth. The water temperature was maintained at a temperature of 35&#x000b0; Celsius. The tanks were insulated to keep out sound and light, and earplugs were used to further minimize sensory input. The tanks were situated in quiet rooms that are locked from the inside, but can be opened from the outside by the floating laboratory staff. Shower and toilet could be accessed in the floating rooms. The participants were instructed to shower before and after the floating session. Ventilation and light could be controlled by the participants from inside the tanks. The participants were instructed to keep the lights out in the tank if possible. Also an alarm button could be pushed from inside the tank to alert the staff in the laboratory if needed. This button was not used by any of the participants.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Flotation-REST intervention</title><p>The intervention for the treatment group consisted of 12 sessions (&#x000e1; 45&#x000a0;min) of flotation-REST extending over seven weeks with two sessions a week. One week was treatment free (fourth week). The main reason for having a treatment free week was so that female participants could plan the timing of their flotation treatments from the incidence of each menstrual cycle. The participants had the opportunity to sit down and relax for a while before and after the flotation-sessions, and the staff in the laboratory kept conversation with the participants to a minimum.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Procedure</title><p>Participants signed a written informed consent upon accepting participation in the study to the effect that they had received sufficient information about the study, that they were guaranteed confidentiality, could terminate their participation without giving any specific reason, and that the data collected could be scientifically analyzed and published as long as the confidentiality of the participants were guaranteed. Before signing the informed consent, the floating laboratory at Karlstad University was shown and information about the floating intervention given. Participants were also informed that they could continue with ongoing therapeutic treatments during participation in the study.</p><p>Participants then completed the self-report measures used in the study (see Measures) except for the EDN scale. After checking that the participants met the inclusion and no exclusion criteria for the study, participants were randomized to either treatment or waiting list control condition. Participants in the waiting list control group were informed that they were entitled to a shortened treatment program (four floating sessions) after they completed the post-treatment assessments, and two additional visits to the laboratory were booked four and seven weeks later for further assessments. For the participants in the treatment group the two initial floating sessions were booked for the coming week. During the floating sessions, staffs were present in the laboratory and could be alerted with an alarm button inside the floating tank. The EDN scale was administered for the treatment group after their first floating session, followed by four weeks in treatment and post-treatment assessments (after a flotation session). Four weeks in- and post-treatment the self-report measures, except background data and EDN, were filled out again by all the participants. For the treatment group this was done in adjunction to a floating session (before), and for the waiting list control group this was done at the booked visits to the laboratory. Six months after completed treatment follow-up data, consisting of all the self-report measures at post-treatment except for EDN, was collected by mail correspondence with the participants in the treatment group.

The primary outcome was the participants&#x02019; level of GAD-symptomatology (GAD-Q-4), and the secondary outcomes were pathological worry (PSWQ), difficulties in emotional regulation (DERS), Mindfulness (MAAS), sleep difficulties (PSQI), and depression (MADRS-S). In addition, independent sample t-tests were performed comparing the groups scoring on the dependent variables at post-treatment. For the treatment group a one-way ANOVA was conducted for the scoring on EDN for the three time periods (Baseline, Mid, Post-treatment). Paired sample <italic>t</italic>-test was also carried out comparing participants scoring on the dependent variables at post-treatment with 6-months follow-up scoring. This was only assessed for the treatment group to assess any lasting effects of the treatment. Chi-Square goodness of fit tests was conducted, comparing the groups in regard to received psychotherapy and the use of anxiolytic, antidepressant, as well as sleep medication at baseline and post-treatment. In addition, the criteria for &#x0201c;clinical significant improvement&#x0201d; as defined by Jacobson, Follette and Revenstor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>] were used to determine the precision of the treatment effects. This implies that treated individuals must, in addition to showing a statistically reliable change, fall within the range of a normal group, at post-treatment assessment, as indicated by for an example established cut-off values for a specific self-report measure. Clinical significant change was assessed for PSWQ, GAD-Q-IV, MADRS-S and PSQI.

The sample used was screened with self-report measures extensively used to detect GAD in both clinical and non-clinical populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The main findings were that flotation-REST significantly reduced both the general GAD-symptomatology, as well as several symptoms associated with the disorder, such as difficulties in emotional regulation, sleep difficulties and depression, while having ambiguous or non-existent effect on level of pathological worry and mindfulness. In addition, all improved outcome variables at post-treatment, except for depression, were maintained at 6-month follow-up assessments.</p><p>Considering that GAD has been considered a treatment resistant disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] it is interesting that flotation-REST significantly improved GAD-symptomatology (<italic>&#x003b7;</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub><sup><italic>2</italic></sup>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.062), in which 37&#x000a0;% in the treatment group reached full remission at post-treatment (waiting list control: 14&#x000a0;%). Results also showed that some factors known to play an important part in maintaining GAD (pathological worry and low mindfulness) were not affected by the treatment. A possible interpretation of these results might be that treatment mainly affects physiological factors in the GAD-symptomatology, such as restlessness, fatigue and muscle tensions, thus explaining the reduction of the general GAD-symptomatology, while the core characteristic of GAD, the pathological worry, is left marginally affected. This interpretation is also supported by earlier research on flotation-REST which has shown that the most robust effects from flotation-REST are relaxation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and reduction of muscle tension pains [(e. g.) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]]. Taken together this implies that additional treatment is needed to reach full remission of GAD-symptomatology by floating.</p><p>However, there was a convincing beneficial effect of flotation treatment on difficulties in emotional regulation (<italic>&#x003b7;</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub><sup><italic>2</italic></sup>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.16), indicating that the awareness of emotions increased, and that the treatment enabled individuals with GAD to better understand and regulate their emotional responses. This is an important finding considering earlier laboratory studies, reporting that individuals who met the criteria for GAD by self-reports measures had higher levels of intensity of emotional experience than control individuals, and in addition exhibited marked difficulties in their capacity to identify, describe, and accept emotional experience [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Emotion regulation training has been proposed to be a potentially valuable addition to existing treatment protocols for GAD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>], in the light of this, flotation-REST might be an asset in the treatment of GAD, targeting this aspect of difficulties associated with the disorder.</p><p>The results also indicated that the flotation treatment had a strong beneficial effect (<italic>&#x003b7;</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub><sup><italic>2</italic></sup>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.16) on sleep difficulties, in which 43&#x000a0;% of the participants in the treatment condition were <italic>&#x0201c;good sleepers&#x0201d;</italic> at post-treatment (waiting list control: 27&#x000a0;%). Co-existence of sleep difficulties and anxiety has been extensively reported in previous studies [(e. g.) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]], and approximately half of individuals diagnosed with GAD report having difficulties with sleeping [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. This underlines the importance of this finding, and suggests that individuals with GAD might benefit from flotation-REST treatment by improving their sleep.</p><p>The improvement of sleep could also have contributed to other beneficial effects, such as the lowering of depression, which was the strongest effect from treatment (<italic>&#x003b7;</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub><sup><italic>2</italic></sup>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.34), and where 42&#x000a0;% of the participants in the treatment group reached full remission at post-treatment (waiting list control: 9&#x000a0;%), especially when considering earlier studies which have suggested that sleep difficulties could trigger depression and other forms of psychiatric diseases (e. g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]). The reduction of depression is also in line with earlier research on flotation-REST which has repeatedly demonstrated this effect for various populations suffering from stress related disorders [(e. g.) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]]. The observed improvements of depression at post-treatment were not maintained at 6-months follow-up, which might indicate that additional booster session is necessary to make this effect of treatment persist over time.</p><p>Regarding treatments effect on mindfulness, the groups did not significantly differ at post-treatment, despite that results indicated a considerable significant <italic>Time x Group</italic> interaction (<italic>&#x003b7;</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub><sup><italic>2</italic></sup>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.17). The treatment group significantly increased their level of mindfulness when comparing baseline to post-treatment scoring, but since the groups differed significantly on this variable at baseline it is hard to draw any firm conclusion about the treatments effectiveness on this dimension.</p><p>The several positive effects of treatment observed in the present study suggest that individuals with GAD, in line with what has been confirmed in other flotation-REST studies on various patient-groups [(e. g.) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]], experienced the treatment as beneficial. Possible the deep relaxation that is induced during the flotation sessions could be a contributing factor to these positive effects from treatment. This is supported by the scoring on the EDN-scale, which has been used extensively in earlier flotation-REST studies [(e. g.) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]] as an indirect measure of experienced relaxation during the flotation sessions. The significant increase over time for the treatment group on this variable, indicated a normal treatment response of flotation-REST [(e. g.) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]].</p><p>This study is not without limitations. Even though the sample was identified with self-report measures that has been extensively used to identify GAD in both clinical and non-clinical populations, more research with clinical populations is needed to confirm that the findings is generalizable to GAD patients. The cut-off score used for the PSWQ could also be regarded as relatively low compared to some studies [(e. g.) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]], which further underlines the importance to conduct studies with clinical populations to be able to draw any firm conclusions regarding the effectiveness of flotation-REST as a treatment of GAD. There was also a small but significant difference when comparing the groups scoring of mindfulness at baseline, although the level is to be considered low for both groups when considering normative data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. This group difference is still somewhat problematic, especially since mindfulness is associated with depression and pathological worry [(e. g.) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]]. On the other hand, the scoring on the other assessments at baseline showed substantial psychological suffering for both groups, including the dimensions of pathological worry and depression, indicating that the difference on the mindfulness dimension at baseline did not have a significant impact on the other dependent variables. Furthermore, a sizeable proportion of the the participants received uncontrolled medication and/or psychotherapy. In addition, the CBT interventions received could possible differ in quality, both in regard of the competence of the therapist, and in regard of potential differences in what CBT techniques that were emphasized during these treatments. Although it can not be ruled out that the groups differed in regard to how other forms of received treatment impacted the dependent variables, the effects from these confounding variables should have been addressed by the applied randomization to the sample. That randomization worked out efficiently is also indicated by the chi-square test at baseline and post-treatment, which showed that the groups did not significantly differ in regard to received psychotherapeutic and psychopharmacological treatments. In addition, although no statistical difference was found in regard to received psychopharmacological treatment, the use of medications was somewhat higher for the control group at baseline.</p><p>Despite these limitations, the present study provides some initial data which could guide further research in the field. Considering these results, as well as that no negative side effects has been associated with the method either in present or other studies, further research should try to establish that the current findings is applicable to patients with GAD, by conducting randomized clinical trials with active control condition, and by further enhance the study design by for an example blinding the study personnel. It could also be of interest to study flotation-REST combined with a psychotherapeutic intervention, which in earlier pilot-studies [(e. g.) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] has been reported to be a combination which makes the treatment process more effective. Furthermore, flotation-REST should be explored as a complementary intervention of other types of mood and anxiety disorders, especially those in which emotional regulation difficulties, sleep difficulties and depression are central issues.</p></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The present study is the first to evaluate flotation-REST primarily as an intervention for GAD.</p><p>The findings suggest that flotation-REST has potential as a complementary treatment modality alongside existing treatment protocols for GAD, and that more studies exploring this novel approach could be a fruitful endeavor for advancing existing treatments of GAD. Considering the results, further research should focus on how the treatment could best be implemented as an intervention for improving sleep, mood and emotion regulation difficulties in individuals with GAD.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.
