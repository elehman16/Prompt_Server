The 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic illustrates that pandemics may arise rapidly with an unexpected viral source. It is therefore essential to continue diligent preparations to deal with potential pandemic strain viruses, including H5N1.</p><p>Pandemic modeling data suggest that the peak disease incidence could occur in the United Kingdom and United States 50&#x02013;85 days after the first national case is identified, assuming no intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>]. In the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, the first cases were reported in mid-April 2009, and the World Health Organization announced Pandemic Alert Phase 6 on 11 June 2009. A vaccine based on a matching pandemic strain is unlikely to be produced quickly enough to immunize the required number of people to protect communities. An alternative strategy is to vaccinate before the pandemic occurs or when it is in its very early stages with a prepandemic formulation containing antigens that are not strain matched to the actual pandemic virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>]. Prepandemic vaccines must induce a high and long-lasting cross-reactive immune response so that the immune system is primed to mount a rapid response to infection and/or to vaccination with the strain-matched pandemic vaccine. In addition, it is important that prepandemic and pandemic vaccines should be antigen sparing, because production of enough vaccine to meet global needs will rely on the availability of sufficient quantities of the prepandemic and pandemic virus antigen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>].</p><p>Populations naive to the H5 hemagglutinin (HA) antigen may respond poorly to vaccination, and it has been shown elsewhere that up to 90 &#x003bc;g of HA antigen is needed to produce a satisfactory immune response with conventional H5N1 vaccines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>]. The use of adjuvants has been highlighted as an important strategy to gain antigen-sparing and improved immune responses in the development of pandemic and prepandemic vaccines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>]. An H5N1 vaccine containing as little as 3.75 &#x003bc;g of HA, adjuvanted with AS03<sub>A</sub> (a tocopherol oil-in-water emulsion based adjuvant system), is licensed to be used in Europe in the event of an imminent H5N1 pandemic. Immunogenicity against vaccine homologous strains and cross-reactivity have been demonstrated in other studies, together with an acceptable reactogenicity and safety profile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>]. Initial development of the AS03<sub>A</sub>-adjuvanted vaccine was based on the A/Vietnam/1194/2004 clade 1 strain, though the latest vaccines have used antigen from more recent H5N1 drift variants, such as A/Indonesia/5/2005 (clade 2.1) and A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 (clade 2.2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>].</p><p>Besides antigen-sparing and cross-reactive properties, prepandemic vaccines should provide flexibility in vaccination schedules to offer more public health response options. To date, most studies of prepandemic vaccines have used a 2-dose schedule with a 21&#x02013;28-day interval. Other studies have demonstrated the immunogenicity of longer intervals using homologous and heteroclade antigen vaccine formulations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>]. However, modeling data suggest that rapid deployment of a vaccine is an effective strategy to gain early control of a pandemic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>]. Therefore the ability to accelerate vaccination schedules is advantageous. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate immunogenicity of an AS03<sub>A</sub>-adjuvanted vaccine using the A/Indonesia/5/2005 strain, administered in accelerated 2-dose immunization schedules using intervals between doses of 14, 7, and 0 days along with the usual interval of 21 days as the reference.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><sec><title>Study Objectives</title><p>The primary objectives of the study were to demonstrate that the accelerated immunization schedules elicit an immune response against the vaccine homologous strain (A/Indonesia/5/2005) 14 days after the last vaccine dose of a 2-dose schedule that meets or exceeds the following criteria: (1) US Food and Drug Administration Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) criterion for seroconversion rate (SCR) and (2) a protocol-defined, potentially clinically meaningful criterion for seroprotection rate (SPR) (attainment rate for reciprocal hemagglutination inhibition [HI] titers &#x02265;40).</p><p>Secondary objectives were to (1) demonstrate that the immune response against the A/Indonesia/5/2005 strain meets the CBER criterion for SCR, the protocol-defined criterion for SPR 21 days after the last vaccine dose, and European Committee for Human Medicinal Products (CHMP) criteria at 14 and 21 days after the last vaccine dose; (2) describe the immune response against the drift-variant strains, A/Vietnam/1194/2004 and A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005, at 7, 14, and 21 days after the last vaccine dose; (3) describe the kinetics of the immune response between the first and last vaccinations and up to 6 months after the first vaccine dose; and (4) describe the safety and reactogenicity of the vaccination schedules.</p></sec><sec><title>Study Design and Vaccine</title><p>This was a phase II, open-label, randomized, parallel-group, 6-month study conducted in 3 centers in Canada between June and December 2008 (NCT00695669). Healthy male and nonpregnant female participants aged 18&#x02013;64 years were included in the study. Exclusion criteria are shown in the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/jir328/DC1">supplementary material</ext-link>. The study was conducted in accordance with the current version of the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice guidelines. The protocol was approved by the independent ethics committee or institutional review board of each study center and written informed consent was obtained from each participant.</p><p>The random allocation list was generated by GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals. Investigators enrolled participants. Participants were randomized 1:1:1:1 and assigned to 1 of 4 study groups, according to an Internet-based randomization blocking scheme. The randomization algorithm used a minimization procedure accounting for center and age (18&#x02013;40 or 41&#x02013;64 years). There were 4 study groups, which received 2 vaccine doses: (1) 21 days apart on days 0 and 21 (group 0/21); (2) 14 days apart on days 0 and 14 (group 0/14); (3) 7 days apart on days 0 and 7 (group 0/7); (4) 2 doses on day 0 (group 0/0). All participants attended study visits at days 0, 21, 42, and 182. Additionally, visits were scheduled at 7, 14, and 21 days after the last vaccine dose. Telephone contact was made with all participants on day 51.</p><p>The H5N1-inactivated split-virion recombinant vaccine (GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals) contained 15 &#x003bc;g/mL HA of the A/Indonesia/5/2005 PR8-IBCDC-RG2 strain obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. When mixed 1:1 with AS03<sub>A</sub>, an oil-in-water emulsion-based adjuvant system containing 11.86 mg DL-&#x003b1;-tocopherol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>], each vaccine dose (0.5 mL) provided 3.75 &#x003bc;g of HA. The vaccine was administered into the deltoid region, the first dose into the nondominant arm and the last into the dominant arm.</p></sec><sec><title>Study End Points and Procedures</title><p>Blood samples were taken from all participants at each study visit, and the following parameters were derived from HI titers: (1) geometric mean titer (GMT), (2) SCR, (3) protocol-defined SPR, and (4) geometric mean fold rise (GMFR). The SCR was defined as the percentage of participants with either (1) a prevaccination titer &#x0003c;1:10 and a postvaccination titer &#x02265;1:40 or (2) a prevaccination titer &#x02265;1:10 and a minimum 4-fold increase in postvaccination titer. The SPR was defined as the percentage of participants who attained reciprocal HI titers of &#x02265;40. The GMFR was defined as the geometric mean of the within-subject ratios of the postvaccination-prevaccination reciprocal HI titer.</p><p>Participants recorded solicited local and general adverse events (AEs) in diary cards on the day of vaccination and for 6 days afterward. They recorded unsolicited symptoms until the following visit. Investigators asked about AEs and serious AEs (SAEs) at each study visit and at the telephone contact on day 51. In addition, abnormal laboratory findings were recorded as AEs or SAEs if they met the definition. Definitions of SAEs and local and general solicited AEs are provided in the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/jir328/DC1">supplementary material</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistics</title><p>A cutoff value for HI titers was defined as 1:10. Seronegative participants was defined as those having an antibody titer below the cutoff value; seropositive participants, those having a titer greater than or equal to the cutoff value. Antibody titers below the assay cutoff value were given an arbitrary value of 5 (half the cutoff value) for the GMT calculation. A point estimate and the associated 2-sided exact 98.75% confidence interval (CI) were calculated for the coprimary end points of SCR and protocol-defined SPR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>]. A 2-sided exact 95% CI was used for the secondary objective evaluation, calculated by the same method. The exact 98.75% or 95% CI for a proportion within a group was calculated with ProcStatXact software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>].</p><p>The immune response was evaluated according to CBER, protocol-defined, and CHMP criteria. The criteria to meet the coprimary and secondary end points are described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>. For the coprimary end points, the lower limit of the 98.75% CI for SCR had to be &#x0003e;40% (CBER criterion), and the lower limit of the 98.75% CI for SPR had to be &#x0003e;50% (protocol-defined criterion). The primary immunogenicity analysis was based on the according-to-protocol (ATP) cohort, which included all participants who met eligibility criteria, complied with the protocol, received 2 vaccine doses at the correct interval for their assigned treatment regimen, and had a complete data set for the coprimary end points. The safety analysis was based on the total vaccinated cohort (TVC), which included all vaccinated participants for whom safety data were available.</p><table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Criteria for the Evaluation of Primary and Secondary End Points</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td colspan="2" align="center" rowspan="1">Lower limit of CI,<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tblfn2">a</xref> %<hr/></td><td colspan="3" align="center" rowspan="1">CHMP, point estimates<hr/></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">End points</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CBER (SCR)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Protocol defined (SPR)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">SCR, %</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">SPR, %</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">GMFR</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="6" rowspan="1">Coprimary end points</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;&#x02003;&#x02003;&#x02003;14 days after last dose for A/Indonesia/5/2005</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0003e;40</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0003e;50</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02014;</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02014;</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02014;</td></tr><tr><td colspan="6" rowspan="1">Secondary end points</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;&#x02003;&#x02003;&#x02003;21 days after last dose for A/Indonesia/5/2005</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0003e;40</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0003e;50</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0003e;40</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0003e;70</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0003e;2.5</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;&#x02003;&#x02003;&#x02003;14 and 21 days after last dose for A/Vietnam/1194/2004 and A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0003e;40</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0003e;50</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0003e;40</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0003e;70</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0003e;2.5</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p><bold>NOTE.</bold>&#x02003;The seroconversion rate (SCR) was defined as the percentage of participants with either a prevaccination titer &#x0003c;1:10 and a postvaccination titer &#x02265;1:40 or a prevaccination titer &#x02265;1:10 and a minimum 4-fold increase in postvaccination titer.

The study met its primary end point, with the vaccine eliciting an immune response against the vaccine homologous strain with all schedules at 14 days after the last vaccine dose that exceeded the CBER criterion for SCR and a protocol-defined criterion for SPR that was considered potentially clinically meaningful.</p><p>Mathematical modeling studies have suggested that a stockpiled vaccine not strain matched to the pandemic virus may nevertheless have a considerable impact on containing the pandemic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>], because protection could develop not only against the vaccine homologous strain but also against drifted strains. Another model has predicted that vaccinating a certain number of people with 1 dose is more effective at mitigating a pandemic than providing maximal protection with 2 vaccine doses to half that number [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>]. Some schedule flexibility may help to ease the inevitable logistic pressures associated with delivering a pandemic or prepandemic vaccination program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>]. In particular, vaccination with only 1 dose will simplify programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>]. The H1N1 pandemic has shown that a pandemic can indeed arise very rapidly from an unexpected source. Timely actions are needed to contain a pandemic, and vaccination strategies that prioritize rapid mass immunization are crucial from a public health perspective.</p><p>Licensing authority criteria are based on threshold levels of immune response that are likely to offer protection against infection to individuals. However, it could be important that health authorities also consider vaccination strategies that may offer less than maximal protection to individuals but provide greater benefits to the population as a whole because they help contain the pandemic. It was in this context that we developed the protocol-defined criterion specifying that the lower limit of the CI for SPR had to be &#x0003e;50%. Although there is no known correlate of protection for H5N1, we assumed that potentially useful clinical protection would be achieved if the lower limit of the SPR exceeded 50%. This assumption was based on modeling results predicting that a vaccine that achieved 30% efficacy against viral susceptibility and 50% efficacy against infectiousness may be a useful part of a pandemic containment strategy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>]. Thus, attaining a titer potentially able to modify susceptibility or transmission in 50% of participants within 2 weeks of completing immunization seemed a reasonable goal.</p><p>The reference schedule with a 21-day interval between the first and last vaccine doses produced the highest immune response against the vaccine homologous strain, followed by the schedule with a 14-day interval. The response was less for the schedules with shorter intervals (7-day interval and same-day administration), but these schedules nevertheless produced an adequate immune response based on CBER SCR, protocol-defined SPR, and CHMP (SCR, SPR, and GMFR) criteria 14 days after the last dose. Values with the 21- and 14-day schedules tended to be higher in younger participants (18&#x02013;40 years) than in older participants (41&#x02013;64 years), but there were no relevant differences between the immune responses of younger versus older adults. The vaccine has also been evaluated in the elderly (&#x02265;61 years) and can be given at the same dose and schedule as in younger adults (3.75-&#x003bc;g doses given 21 days apart) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>]. Recent studies suggest a negative impact of prior seasonal influenza vaccination on seroresponses to H5N1 vaccines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>]. However, we did not evaluate any potential effect of seasonal vaccination in this study.</p><p>Antibodies persisted above baseline levels 6 months after vaccine administration; although levels had declined compared with earlier in the study, CBER and CHMP criteria for SCR were met with the 21-day, 14-day, and same-day schedules. Nevertheless, the study was not powered to detect differences between the different schedules in terms of the magnitude of response at 6 months.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that the AS03<sub>A</sub>-adjuvanted H5N1 vaccine produces a cross-reactive immune response to drift variant strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>]. The immune response against the drift variant strains, A/Vietnam/1194/2004 and A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005, was robust, particularly against the A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 strain, which is genetically more closely related to the vaccine homologous strain. As with the vaccine homologous strain, the response was higher with the 21- and 14-day intervals. Nevertheless, some level of response was observed with all schedules, with CBER, protocol-defined, and CHMP criteria being met in several cases.</p><p>The observed peak immune response occurred consistently at 14 days after the last vaccine dose with the 21- and 14-day schedules, regardless of strain or age. However, no clear peak was observed with the 7-day and same-day schedules, although the trend was for the peak response to occur at 21 days after the second vaccine dose. This suggests that reducing the interval between vaccinations not only induces lower immune responses but also generates a slower increase in the response.</p><p>As mentioned elsewhere, a mathematical model has predicted that vaccinating a certain number of people with 1 dose provides more effective pandemic mitigation than vaccinating half that number with 2 doses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>]. In our study, GMTs against the vaccine homologous strain in the 21-day interval group were 40.2 at 21 days after a single vaccine dose, compared with 640.0 at 14 days after the second dose. Similarly, in the 14-day interval group, GMTs were 26.8 at 14 days after a single dose, compared with 345.0 at 14 days after the second dose. The same pattern was seen in the 7-day interval group: 7.6 at 7 days after a single dose compared with 77.7 at 14 days after the second dose. Thus, a relatively low immune response was observed after a single dose, and therefore the effect on pandemic mitigation after only 1 dose of H5N1 vaccine is uncertain.</p><p>The safety profile of the vaccine was acceptable and there appeared to be no impact of administration schedule on its reactogenicity profile. Reactogenicity was no more severe when the vaccine was administered twice on the same day compared with the other schedules.</p><p>In conclusion, the present study shows that the vaccine given in an accelerated schedule elicits a potent immune response against the vaccine homologous strain, offers a rapid immune response evident after only 1 double dose, and elicits a cross-reactive response against drift variant strains. This profile may provide flexibility for health authorities to consider more temporally compressed dosing schedules with an antigen-sparing vaccine in the event of an emergency H5N1 outbreak. The data presented suggest that such shortened regimens could be implemented.</p></sec><sec><title>Supplementary data</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/jir328/DC1">Supplementary data</ext-link> are available at <italic>The Journal of Infectious Diseases</italic> online.</p></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p>Study funding was provided by the Public Health Agency of Canada.
