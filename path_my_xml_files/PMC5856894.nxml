In clinical trials, asenapine was generally safe and well tolerated in pediatric patients with bipolar I disorder and schizophrenia. Serious adverse effects were generally related to worsening of the underlying psychiatric disorder. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) in both indications were sedation and somnolence. Like some other second-generation antipsychotic agents, weight gain and changes in some metabolic parameters were noted; oral effects (e.g., oral hypoesthesia, dysgeusia, paresthesia) related to sublingual administration did not typically result in treatment discontinuation and were generally transient.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par3">Psychiatric disorders that are commonly treated with pharmacotherapy in adulthood often have onset in childhood or adolescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Similar to treatment recommendations for adult patients with schizophrenia or bipolar mania, practice parameters addressing the early onset of these disorders recommend the use of antipsychotic agents as a first-line treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The relative scarcity of safety and efficacy information for antipsychotic use in juveniles means that prescribers may have to rely on data from studies in adults to treat their young patients; this lack of information is concerning since antipsychotics may have effects that are developmentally dependent and differ from what is observed in adult patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par4">Data indicate that 14&#x02013;28% of adult patients with bipolar disorder experience onset of the illness before the age of 13&#x000a0;years, and 36&#x02013;38% experience onset between the ages of 13 and 18&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Early onset of bipolar disorder, which is generally associated with a delay in first treatment and a more pernicious course of illness than later onset illness, is characterized by greater comorbidity with other psychiatric disorders and substance abuse, more mood episodes, more days depressed, shorter periods of euthymia, and higher lifetime risk of suicide attempt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par5">The onset of schizophrenia before the age of 13&#x000a0;years appears to be rare, with a prevalence of approximately 1 in 40,000 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Rates of illness increase during adolescence, with the peak age of onset for schizophrenia cited as ranging from 15 to 30&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. It has been reported that up to 20% of individuals with schizophrenia become ill before the age of 18&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], and early onset is associated with poor long-term prognosis, social deficits, and high suicidality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">Asenapine is a novel second-generation antipsychotic that is administered twice daily (BID) as a sublingual tablet. As the only second-generation antipsychotic with this unique formulation, asenapine is available as 2.5-, 5-, and 10-mg black-cherry-flavored tablets that dissolve within seconds when placed under the tongue. Rapidly absorbed through the oral mucosa, in adult patients asenapine reaches peak plasma concentration in 30&#x02013;90&#x000a0;min following a single 5-mg dose, and steady state is reached within 3 days of BID administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Absolute bioavailability is markedly decreased if asenapine is swallowed, so it should not be ingested; exposure can also be reduced by food or drink, so eating and drinking should be avoided for at least 10&#x000a0;min after administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of asenapine monotherapy in adult patients was based on efficacy demonstrated in two 6-week, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled studies in schizophrenia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and two 3-week, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled studies in manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Maintenance efficacy was demonstrated in a 26-week relapse prevention study in schizophrenia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and a 26-week relapse prevention study in bipolar I disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]; these studies served as the basis for subsequent indications for maintenance treatment in each disease state in adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Additional short-term and longer-term studies support the safety and efficacy of asenapine in adult patients with schizophrenia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and bipolar I disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Asenapine is also approved for the treatment of adults in the European Union (moderate to severe manic episodes associated with bipolar disorder), in Canada (as monotherapy or in combination with lithium or divalproex for manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder), in Japan (schizophrenia), and in Australia (schizophrenia, and as monotherapy or in combination with lithium or sodium valproate for acute mania associated with bipolar I disorder and prevention of relapse of manic or mixed episodes in bipolar I disorder).</p><p id="Par8">Clinicians who treat pediatric and adolescent patients with psychiatric disorders should be aware that asenapine is approved in the US as monotherapy for the acute treatment of manic and mixed episodes of bipolar I disorder in children and adolescents aged 10&#x02013;17&#x000a0;years. Although asenapine has been studied in pediatric patients with schizophrenia, it did not separate from placebo on the primary efficacy parameter in a double-blind randomized trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and is not approved for this indication. Asenapine is not approved for pediatric use in bipolar I disorder or schizophrenia in any other major market. A recent literature search using the terms asenapine, pediatric, adolescent, childhood, bipolar I disorder, and schizophrenia yielded scant results. Consequently, we reviewed and collated the available information on the neuropharmacology, pharmacokinetics, clinical trials, and clinical use of asenapine in pediatric patients to assist clinicians who treat young patients with these disorders.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Overview of Asenapine</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Neuropharmacology</title><p id="Par9">Although the mechanism of action for asenapine in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder is unknown, it is suggested to be the result of combined antagonist activity at dopamine (D<sub>2</sub>) and serotonin (5-HT<sub>2A</sub>) receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The receptor profile of asenapine is complex, and beyond the common features of D<sub>2</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor affinity, it is different than other second-generation antipsychotics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Asenapine displays high antagonist activity for other dopamine (D<sub>1</sub>, D<sub>3</sub>, and D<sub>4</sub>), serotonin (5-HT<sub>1A</sub>, 5-HT<sub>1B</sub>, 5-HT<sub>2B</sub>, 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>, 5-HT<sub>5</sub>, 5-HT<sub>6</sub>, and 5-HT<sub>7</sub>), adrenergic (&#x003b1;<sub>1</sub> and &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>), and histamine (H<sub>1</sub>) receptors and moderate antagonistic affinity for the H<sub>2</sub> receptor; it has no appreciable affinity for muscarinic receptors. This receptor binding profile may theoretically predict a low propensity for causing anticholinergic effects through low affinity at muscarinic receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Conversely, antagonism at the histamine H<sub>1</sub> and &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptors may cause sedation and H<sub>1</sub> receptor blockade may be related to weight gain; antagonism of &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptors may also be associated with cardiovascular effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Pharmacokinetic Parameters</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Pediatric Pharmacokinetic Studies</title><p id="Par10">Two phase I studies investigated the pharmacokinetic profile of asenapine in pediatric patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]; a summary of findings is presented in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>.

</p><p id="Par11">In the first study, 40 adolescent patients (12&#x02013;17&#x000a0;years of age) with a history of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or any condition for which chronic use of antipsychotic medication was warranted received 10&#x000a0;days of double-blind asenapine (1, 3, 5, or 10&#x000a0;mg BID) or matching placebo. Results indicated that asenapine exposure (maximum concentration [<italic>C</italic>
<sub>max</sub>] and area under the concentration&#x02013;time curve, 0&#x02013;12&#x000a0;h [AUC<sub>0&#x02013;12</sub>]) tended to increase with increasing doses from 1&#x000a0;mg BID up to and including 5&#x000a0;mg BID, although the increase was slightly less than dose proportional [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Lower asenapine exposure was observed in the 10-mg BID dose group than in the 5-mg BID dose group. Although the exact reason for this is unclear, it is possible that patients in this group swallowed a greater portion of the administered dose. Namely, asenapine undergoes significant first-pass metabolism when given orally; first-pass metabolism is minimized when asenapine is administered sublingually and higher plasma asenapine concentrations are achieved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. For asenapine metabolites such as desmethylasenapine, exposure (AUC) following either route of administration is expected to be similar. As such, the finding that lower <italic>C</italic>
<sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>0&#x02013;12</sub> values for asenapine, but not for desmethylasenapine, were observed in the 10-mg dose group may support the oral ingestion hypothesis. Rapid absorption and an initial rapid decline in plasma concentrations was followed by a slower elimination phase; time to maximum asenapine plasma concentration was ~1&#x000a0;h (range 0.7&#x02013;1.3&#x000a0;h) and steady state was attained in ~8 days (data on file, Allergan). Multiple sublingual doses of asenapine were safe and well tolerated in adolescent subjects with a disorder that warranted the use of antipsychotic medication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p id="Par12">To further investigate the pharmacokinetics of asenapine 10&#x000a0;mg BID in subjects aged 12&#x02013;17&#x000a0;years and to evaluate asenapine pharmacokinetics in younger subjects (10&#x02013;11&#x000a0;years of age), a second study was conducted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Thirty pediatric patients (10&#x02013;17&#x000a0;years of age) with a documented history of psychiatric disorder, including bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, autism, and conduct disorder, participated in this 7-, 8-, or 12-day open-label, sequential group, rising multiple-dose study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Multiple sublingual doses of asenapine 2.5&#x000a0;mg BID, 5&#x000a0;mg BID, or escalating doses up to 10&#x000a0;mg BID were administered to the 10- to 11-year-old subjects; after receiving 5&#x000a0;mg BID on day 1, multiple sublingual doses of asenapine 10&#x000a0;mg BID were administered to the 12- to 17-year-old subjects. Results indicated that asenapine was rapidly absorbed (time to maximum concentration [<italic>T</italic>
<sub>max</sub>] ~1&#x000a0;h) and had an apparent terminal half-life of ~20&#x000a0;h. At the 10-mg BID dose, exposure to asenapine was similar across the age groups from 10&#x02013;17 years, but maximum asenapine concentrations were ~30% higher in 10- to 11-year-old subjects compared with the older age group. Asenapine was generally safe and well tolerated in pediatric subjects. Of note, eight events of dystonia were reported in seven subjects (five events in the 10- to 11-year age group receiving 5&#x000a0;mg BID; three events in the 12- to 17-year age group receiving 10&#x000a0;mg BID). As such, a low initial dose (2.5&#x000a0;mg BID) followed by a short up-titration schedule became the recommended dosing schedule to circumvent initial sensitivity to asenapine treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par13">Of note in adult subjects, a dosage increase from 5 to 10&#x000a0;mg BID results in less than linear increases in the extent of exposure and <italic>C</italic>
<sub>max</sub> (1.7 times) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Overall, data from the two designated pediatric studies showed that the pharmacokinetic profile of asenapine in pediatric patients is similar to that in adult patients in other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].

It is particularly important to note that, in adults, the absolute bioavailability of asenapine decreases markedly (to &#x0003c;2%) if it is swallowed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]; bioavailability can also be reduced by ~12&#x02013;20% with the intake of water within 2&#x02013;5&#x000a0;min after administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Additionally, a high-fat meal immediately before sublingual administration in healthy adults reduced asenapine exposure by 20%; and, when food was given 4&#x000a0;h after asenapine was administered, AUC was reduced by 13% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. These effects are likely due to increased clearance of asenapine related to increased hepatic blood flow following food intake and are expected to be similar in pediatric patients. As such, adult and pediatric patients should avoid drinking and eating for 10&#x000a0;min after asenapine is administered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par15">Although asenapine has multiple metabolites, none are active or considered clinically relevant, with asenapine activity predominantly due to the parent drug [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The primary metabolic pathways for asenapine are direct glucuronidation by uridine 5&#x02032;-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase 1A4 (UGT1A4) and oxidative metabolism by cytochrome P450 (CYP450) isoenzymes (predominantly CYP1A2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].

Asenapine does not cause induction of CYP1A2 or CYP3A4. The dose of paroxetine (CYP2D6 substrate and inhibitor) should be reduced by half when it is coadministered with asenapine. When coadministered with a strong CYP1A2 inhibitor (e.g., fluvoxamine), asenapine exposure may be increased, and a dosage reduction may be necessary based on clinical response. However, no asenapine dosage adjustments are required if asenapine is concomitantly administered with imipramine (CYP1A2/2C19/3A4 inhibitor), cimetidine (CYP3A4/2D6/1A2 inhibitor), valproate, lithium, or a CYP34A inducer (e.g., carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampin) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].

For example, in subgroup analyses from the acute asenapine bipolar study in pediatric patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], the efficacy of asenapine versus placebo (YMRS total score change from baseline to day 21) was not significantly different between patients with and without ADHD, which was the most common comorbid Axis I disorder in the study (54.6% of patients), and between patients with and without concomitant stimulant use. Additionally, efficacy did not differ significantly with respect to patient gender or for patients with bipolar disorder onset before or after the age of 11&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. No noticeable between-group differences in TEAEs were reported.</p><p id="Par41">In post hoc analyses conducted on data from the acute bipolar study, patient body weight and BMI did not strongly influence the efficacy of asenapine; as such, adjusting for body weight or BMI is unlikely to be an effective dosing strategy in adolescent patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Additional analyses showed that although asenapine-treated patients had significantly greater increases in body weight and BMI compared with placebo-treated patients, weight increases were only slightly greater in asenapine-treated patients with baseline BMI percentiles above the median (1.4&#x02013;2.2&#x000a0;kg) than in patients with BMI percentiles below the median (1.4&#x02013;1.7&#x000a0;kg) across the dose range.

Asenapine has also been found to be generally effective in pediatric patients with bipolar disorder regardless of the number of previous manic episodes; small sample sizes in these analyses precluded definitive conclusions about differences by dose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Finally, asenapine appeared to be generally effective in subsets of patients with manic episodes as well as in patients with mixed episodes as shown by significantly greater improvements in YMRS total score for asenapine-treated patients compared with placebo-treated patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Dosing and Administration</title><p id="Par42">For bipolar mania monotherapy in pediatric patients aged 10&#x02013;17&#x000a0;years, the recommended dose is 2.5&#x02013;10&#x000a0;mg BID, which may be adjusted based on individual response and tolerability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. As discussed previously, since initial sensitivity to asenapine and the occurrence of dystonia in some pediatric patients has been noted, a short up-titration period is recommended when treatment is initiated.

</p><p id="Par44">Although swallowing an asenapine tablet is difficult to do because it immediately dissolves under the tongue, absolute bioavailability is markedly decreased if asenapine is swallowed, so it should not be ingested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Asenapine exposure can also be reduced by food or drink, so eating and drinking should be avoided for at least 10&#x000a0;min after administration. Additionally, consumption of a high-fat meal immediately prior to sublingual administration of asenapine has been shown to reduce drug exposure by 20%. Although there is no need to adjust the recommended adult dosage when asenapine is used in pediatric patients, young patients may be more sensitive to dystonia when asenapine is initiated, so a short up-titration is recommended in this population.</p><p id="Par45">Asenapine was generally safe and well tolerated in clinical trials of young patients with bipolar I disorder and schizophrenia. Serious adverse effects were generally related to worsening of the underlying psychiatric disorder, including bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, suicidal ideation, aggression, and agitation. Suicidal ideation was noted in acute and long-term asenapine studies, although most events occurred in patients with a history of suicidal ideation and no deaths from suicide were reported in any asenapine study. Given this vulnerable patient population, the high risk for relapse, and the high suicide attempt rate in young patients with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], close monitoring for worsening of the psychiatric condition and prompt response to signs of suicidality is imperative.</p><p id="Par46">Somnolence and sedation are commonly reported with asenapine. Although antipsychotic-related sedating effects may diminish over time in many patients, sedation can become a persistent issue that affects quality of life for a substantial proportion of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Since persistent somnolence and sedation may impair academic and social functioning, clinicians should be aware that these effects may be treatment-limiting in some young patients. Oral effects (hypoesthesia and dysgeusia), which are unique to asenapine and related to sublingual administration, do not typically result in treatment discontinuation and appear to be transient. Additionally, the risk of antipsychotic-related EPS in young patients requires special attention from clinicians when any antipsychotic agent is prescribed. As expected, the incidence of EPS was greater in asenapine- than in placebo-treated patients in pediatric clinical trials, although EPS-related effects were generally considered mild to moderate and resulted in few treatment discontinuations.</p><p id="Par47">Finally, elevations in weight and BMI are commonly seen in young patients treated with a second-generation antipsychotic, although metabolic effects may vary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Weight gain in asenapine-treated patients was accompanied by some metabolic changes, indicating that baseline values for lipid levels, BMI, and glucose levels should be established and regularly monitored during treatment. Counseling in healthy eating and lifestyle should accompany metabolic monitoring to encourage patient involvement in their treatment and overall health.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par48">Asenapine is a unique sublingual second-generation antipsychotic that is approved in the US for use in patients with bipolar mania who are 10&#x02013;17&#x000a0;years of age. In the acute bipolar I disorder trial, improvement in mania was seen for three BID doses of asenapine (2.5, 5, 10&#x000a0;mg) versus placebo. Although results of the acute schizophrenia trial were not robust enough to establish efficacy for asenapine in schizophrenia, valuable information was added to the drug&#x02019;s safety profile in pediatric patients. Asenapine was generally well tolerated in acute and longer-term treatment of bipolar I disorder and schizophrenia; safety findings were generally consistent across indications, with potentially clinically significant changes in some metabolic parameters and a high incidence of sedation noted. As with any antipsychotic administered to pediatric patients, the use of asenapine should be closely monitored for adequate treatment response and antipsychotic-induced adverse effects.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Writing assistance and editorial support for this manuscript were provided by Carol Brown, MS, at Prescott Medical Communications Group (Chicago, IL, USA), with support from Allergan (Jersey City, NJ, USA) in accordance with Good Publication Practice (GPP3) guidelines (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ismpp.org/gpp3">http://www.ismpp.org/gpp3</ext-link>).
