The primary goal of the VADT was to compare the effects of intensive and standard glucose control on cardiovascular events (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Final median glycated hemoglobin levels were 8.4% in the STD group and 6.9% in the INT group. Secondary outcomes included microvascular complications, such as retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy. Nephropathy is a major microvascular complication of diabetes that is characterized by persistent albuminuria, a rise in arterial blood pressure, and a decline in glomerular filtration rate leading to chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal failure. The main VADT showed that intensive glucose control had minimal effects on the incidence of renal failure, but there was a significant reduction (<italic>P</italic> = 0.01) in any worsening of the urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) in the INT group (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). This article will further explore the relationship of risk factors and treatment on renal outcomes and help generate hypotheses for future testing.</p><sec id="s5"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><p>The design of the VADT has been reported elsewhere (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). We assigned 1,791 veterans at 20 VA medical centers who had a suboptimal response to therapy for type 2 diabetes to receive either intensive or standard glucose control. Patients with serum creatinine &#x0003e;1.6 mg/dL were excluded. The median follow-up was 5.6 years. The primary outcome was the time from random assignment to the first occurrence of a major cardiovascular event. Strict control of blood pressure and dyslipidemia, daily aspirin, diet, and education were uniform in both arms. Protocol and consent forms were approved by the institutional review board at each of the 20 participating sites. All patients provided written informed consent. An independent data- and safety-monitoring committee, whose members were aware of study-group assignments, monitored safety and efficacy.</p><sec id="s6"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>As outcomes, renal disease progression was measured in two ways. First, patients&#x02019; baseline ACR measures were categorized and compared with the last two available on-study ACR measures. Categories were as follows: 0&#x02013;29 mg/g, no albuminuria; 30&#x02013;300 mg/g, microalbuminuria; and &#x0003e;300 mg/g, macroalbuminuria. The progression of albuminuria was defined as an increase of albuminuria for at least two successive yearly visits without reversion to an improved level. Of 1,791 patients, 864 had no albuminuria and 448 had microalbuminuria with at least two follow-up measures after baseline, for a total of 1,312 subjects eligible for analysis.</p><p>Second, renal disease progression was measured by the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Patients&#x02019; annual measures of serum creatinine, age, and race were used to calculate eGFR according to the Cockcroft-Gault equation (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Patients were categorized according to their eGFR level into one of five categories of renal function, as follows: GFR &#x02265;90 mL/min per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup> = CKD stage 1; 60&#x02013;89 mL/min per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup> = CKD stage 2; 30&#x02013;59 mL/min per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup> = CKD stage 3; 15&#x02013;29 mL/min per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup> = CKD stage 4; and &#x0003c;15 mL/min per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup> = CKD stage 5. Patients&#x02019; baseline measures were compared with their last two recorded eGFRs, and if both were worse than their baseline eGFR, that patient was considered to have the outcome of persistent worsening of eGFR or progression of CKD. Of 1,791 patients in the study, 141 were missing baseline measures of eGFR, leaving 1,650 subjects eligible for analysis.</p><p>For both measures of renal disease progression, a multiple logistic regression model was used to determine baseline predictors of on-study renal disease progression. We took the natural log of baseline ACR + 0.1 and baseline triglycerides + 0.1 to minimize the influence of extremely large values on the model parameter estimates. The model selection procedure was as follows: after univariate analyses were performed on each outcome of interest using logistic regression, each predictor (independent) variable with treatment interactions were tested separately in logistic regression. To be more inclusive, the predictor variables and the treatment interactions with a <italic>P</italic> value &#x02264; 0.2 were selected as candidates in the multiple logistic regression models, and backward elimination was performed with a cutoff <italic>P</italic> value of &#x0003c; 0.07. No interaction effect was allowed to enter the model without the corresponding main effects. All models were estimated in SAS version 9.2 PROC LOGISTIC. Treatment was forced to remain in the model in the backward elimination procedure.

Again, each variable is interpreted, controlling for all other variables in the model. Higher SBP was associated with a statistically significant increased risk of 8% in worsening of eGFR per 10-mmHg increase in SBP (OR 1.08 [95% CI 1.01&#x02013;1.17]). A history of photocoagulation also was associated with an increased risk of worsening eGFR (1.69 [1.15&#x02013;2.47]). Increasing natural log of baseline triglycerides marginally increased the risk of worsening eGFR (1.22 [0.99&#x02013;1.50]).

Although intensive glycemic control in the VADT did not show any significant differences in retinopathy, major nephropathy (defined as doubling of serum creatinine or need for renal replacement therapy), or neuropathy compared with the STD group, it seemed to significantly reduce any worsening of albumin excretion (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Kidney dysfunction is common in older patients with type 2 diabetes and coronary artery disease (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), microalbuminuria is an early finding in diabetic nephropathy, and the presence of albuminuria predicts increased risk of coronary artery disease and peripheral vascular disease (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Therefore, we thought it would be useful to see if any factors predicted the development of nephropathy in patients with diabetes and to see which patients might benefit most from intensification of therapy. Several baseline characteristics were associated with worsening of ACR or eGFR in the VADT. However, significant interactions in reduction of albuminuria with intensive glycemic treatment were only seen in those with baseline eye disease, higher BMI, and lower DBP; significant interactions in reduction of eGFR with intensive glycemic treatment were only seen in those with higher baseline ACRs.</p><p>Several other studies have addressed the question of the impact of good glycemic control on renal disease in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. In the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial involving 1,441 individuals with type 1 diabetes, those in the INT group had markedly reduced incidence and progression of albuminuria and a delayed protective benefit on glomerular filtration (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Several smaller glycemic intervention studies in type 1 diabetes preceded the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), generally confirming the albuminuria benefit of glycemic control. There also are several earlier studies in people with type 2 diabetes showing an albuminuria benefit of better glycemic control (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Recent cardiovascular trials, including the Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: Preterax and Diamicron Modified Release Controlled Evaluation (ADVANCE) and the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD), also have reported an albuminuria benefit of glycemic control (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>).</p><p>The epidemiologic link between the presence of retinopathy and nephropathy has long been known (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). This was also seen in baseline analyses in the VADT, where increasing baseline severity of retinopathy was significantly correlated with lower eGFR and higher levels of albuminuria (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Our finding that intensive glycemic therapy was associated with the greatest effect in those with markers of advanced eye disease (photocoagulation and cataract surgery) supports the general idea that the intervention was most effective in those with advanced and generalized microvascular disease. However, this relationship did not occur with the eGFR end point. History of photocoagulation was a risk for worsening eGFR, but there was no interaction with intensive glycemic treatment.</p><p>The beneficial effect of intensive glycemic treatment increased with increasing BMI, becoming significant at &#x02265;34 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. There has been growing appreciation that obesity, per se, independent of diabetes, increases the risk for the initiation and progression of kidney disease and that weight loss can reduce proteinuria (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Griffin et al. (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) have provided an excellent review of the various theories of the pathogenesis of obesity-related kidney injury, the details of which are beyond the scope of our discussion. In brief, they have postulated that the link between obesity and kidney injury is consistent with a &#x0201c;multi-hit&#x0201d; model, with reduced nephron number at birth being the initial hit and enhanced glomerular blood pressure transmission to the reduced number of nephrons being the second hit. Thus, obesity seems to put people at greater risk for nephropathy, and the interaction between intensive glycemic treatment and BMI is again consistent with the idea that people at greatest risk might be those that benefit the most from an intervention.</p><p>Our finding of an interaction between intensive glycemic treatment and baseline DBP is intriguing, especially in light of one of the findings from the ADVANCE Blood Pressure Trial suggesting such an interaction. We report that intensive glycemic treatment was associated with albuminuria benefit only in those with lower diastolic pressure. A part of the ADVANCE trial evaluating blood pressure reduction indicated that lower blood pressure among patients undergoing intensive glucose control probably explains some of the 10% reduction in primary combined outcome of major macrovascular and microvascular events, mainly as a consequence of a 21% relative reduction in nephropathy (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p><p>The UK Prospective Diabetes Study demonstrated that each 10-mmHg decrease in SBP was associated with average reductions in rates of diabetes-related mortality (15%), myocardial infarction (11%), and the microvascular complications of retinopathy or nephropathy (13%). The ACCORD Blood Pressure trial tested the effect of SBP &#x0003c;120 mmHg (intensive blood pressure therapy group) versus &#x0003c;140 mmHg (standard blood pressure therapy group) on major cardiovascular events among high-risk individuals with type 2 diabetes. Compared with the standard-therapy group, the group with SBP &#x0003c;120 mmHg had significantly higher rates of elevations in serum creatinine and significantly lower eGFR (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). However, the micro- and macroalbuminuria at the final visit was significantly lower in the intensive-therapy group, and there was no between-group difference in the frequency of end-stage renal disease or the need for dialysis. The significance of these findings on cardiovascular and renal outcomes is uncertain from the ACCORD study (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). We also confirmed that higher SBP was associated with worsening eGFR, but intensive glycemic control did not prevent worsening of renal function in these patients.</p><p>The finding that intensive glycemic control retarded the decline in eGFR only in those with substantial proteinuria has, to the best of our knowledge, not been previously observed. The reason for this is not clear, but it is in concert with the idea that treatment of any kind may have the greatest impact in those at highest risk. After adjusting for other factors, we did not find that the presence of previous cardiovascular events was associated with worsening of renal function at baseline or with intensive glycemic control.</p><p>In the UK Prospective Diabetes Study, patients with type 2 diabetes had elevated triglycerides, which were an independent risk factor for microalbuminuria. Elevated LDL cholesterol and triglycerides were an independent risk factor for macroalbuminuria. The level of triglycerides rises as diabetic nephropathy progresses to overt proteinuria (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Our results suggest that higher HDL cholesterol at baseline was associated with less worsening of GFR only in univariate analyses. Higher triglyceride concentration was associated with increased worsening of eGFR, which continued despite intensification of glycemic control.</p><p>On the basis of our observations in this carefully followed cohort of older patients with diabetes, it seems that intensification of glycemic control was associated with the most benefit in reducing the progression of nephropathy in a subset of patients with worse baseline disease, especially those with microvascular eye disease, greater body weight, lower diastolic blood pressure, and higher levels of albuminuria. We were not able to show the benefit in attenuating progression of renal disease in patients with higher SBP, higher triglycerides, and previous cardiovascular events. Although this retrospective analysis generates interesting hypotheses, they cannot be used as treatment recommendations and need additional testing. Extrapolation of our findings to younger nonobese patients with diabetes and women must be done with caution.</p></sec>
