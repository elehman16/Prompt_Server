Loss of arm function affects 69% of people who have a stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Only 12% of people with arm weakness at the onset of stroke make a full recovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Improving arm function has been identified as a research priority by stroke survivors, carers and health professionals who report that current rehabilitation pays insufficient attention to arm recovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par36">Robot-assisted training enables a greater number of repetitive tasks to be practised in a consistent and controllable manner. Repetitive task training is known to drive Hebbian plasticity, where wiring of pathways that are coincidently active is strengthened [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. A dose of greater than 20&#x000a0;h of repetitive task training improves upper limb motor recovery following a stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and, therefore, robot-assisted training has the potential to improve arm motor recovery after stroke. We anticipate that Hebbian neuroplasticity, which is learning dependent, will operate regardless of the post-stroke phase.</p><p id="Par37">A Cochrane systematic review of electromechanical and robot-assisted arm training after stroke reported outcomes from a total of 1160 patients who participated in 34 randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Improvements in arm function (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.35, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.18&#x02013;0.51) and activities of daily living (SMD 0.37, 95% CI, 0.11&#x02013;0.64) were found in patients who received this treatment, but studies were often of low quality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In the UK there is currently insufficient evidence to justify the use of this technology in routine clinical practice.</p><p id="Par38">In addition, studies which suggest that robot-assisted training may improve upper limb function after stroke should be treated with caution as participants who were randomised to receive robot-assisted training may have also received an increased intensity of rehabilitation sessions (e.g. frequency or duration) compared to participants in the control groups. Greater intensity of upper limb rehabilitation sessions has been shown to improve upper limb functional outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], and a meta-analysis of robot-assisted training RCTs reported that if control group therapy sessions were delivered at the same frequency and duration, there was no additional functional improvement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Studies are required which provide further direct evidence of the effectiveness of robot-assisted training without the confounding effect of therapy dose.</p><p id="Par39">The aim of the Robot Assisted Training for the Upper Limb after Stroke (RATULS) trial is to evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of robot-assisted training compared to an upper limb therapy programme of the same frequency and duration, and usual post-stroke care.</p><p id="Par40">The null hypothesis is that there is no difference in upper limb function at 3&#x000a0;months between study participants who receive robot-assisted training and those who receive an enhanced upper limb therapy programme and those who receive usual post-stroke care. The RATULS trial will be making comparisons of the effectiveness of rehabilitation on upper limb function between all three pairs of trial arms.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study aim and objectives</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Aim</title><p id="Par41">To determine whether robot-assisted training with the InMotion robotic gym system (InMotion commercial version) improves upper limb function post stroke.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Objectives</title><p id="Par42">

<italic>Rationale for robot-assisted training:</italic>
<break/>Increased intensity of rehabilitation is known to improve functional outcomes and moderate-quality evidence shows repetitive task training (when dose &#x0003e;20&#x000a0;h) increases arm function post stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Robot-assisted training enables repetitive tasks to be undertaken in a highly consistent and controllable manner. A Cochrane systematic review of electromechanical and robot-assisted arm training after stroke reported outcomes from a total of 1160 patients who participated in 34 trials. Improvements in arm function (SMD 0.35, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.18&#x02013;0.51) and activities of daily living (SMD 0.37, 95% CI 0.11&#x02013;0.64) were found in patients who received this treatment, but studies were often of low quality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]<break/>

What (procedures)?: <italic>&#x02018;describe each of the procedures, activities and/or processes used in the intervention, including any enabling support activities&#x02019;</italic>
</td><td>The robot-assisted training programme is divided into three consecutive blocks in order to integrate training with all three robot modules. Training sessions on all robot modules consist of high repetitions (aiming for &#x0003e;700 per session) of point-to-point movements.<break/>Block 1: block one lasts for 2&#x000a0;weeks and employs alternate training sessions with the shoulder-elbow module and the wrist module (three sessions on each robot module). The robot modules rhythmically move the participant&#x02019;s upper limb to reach sequentially presented targets.<break/>Block 2: block 2 lasts for 6&#x000a0;weeks and employs alternate therapy sessions with the shoulder-and-elbow and the wrist modules (9 sessions on each robot module). The robot modules allow the participant to attempt to move towards sequentially presented targets unassisted but will assist if the participant needs help to reach the target.<break/>Block 3: block 3 lasts for 4&#x000a0;weeks and employs alternative therapy sessions with the hand module integrated on the shoulder-elbow module, and the wrist module (6 sessions on each module). As in block 2, the robot modules allow the participant to attempt to move towards the targets unassisted but will assist if the participant needs help to reach the target. For the therapy sessions with the hand module integrated on the shoulder-elbow module, targets are presented sequentially. For the therapy sessions with the wrist module, the targets are presented randomly.<break/>Evaluations of robotic kinematics (i.e. related to the movement pattern) and kinetics (i.e. related to the causes of movement) are incorporated into every third training session on each robot module. These evaluations monitor participant performance and are used to give feedback and encouragement</td><td>At the initial therapy session a brief assessment of the participant&#x02019;s upper limb is performed and up to 4 upper limb rehabilitation goals of importance to the participant are agreed. The activities to practise to achieve these goals are subsequently determined. Activities are divided into two types: whole-task or a part-task. Whole-task activity practice consists of practising all of the components of the task in sequence. Part-task activity practice consists of practising a specific part of a task. Part-task practice is appropriate if a participant has difficulty with a specific part of a task as it will enable them to focus on this particular aspect while working towards completing the task as a whole. The order to practise the activities and the time spent on each activity is at the discretion of the therapist and participant according to the participant&#x02019;s rehabilitation priorities. Where appropriate, participants undertake a brief warm up consisting of gentle stretching of the upper limb, prior to practising the chosen activities.<break/>At the second and subsequent therapy sessions, following a brief warm up (if necessary), practice of the selected activities continues, with the order to practise and time to spend on each activity being at local discretion. At therapy sessions 12 (end of week 4) and 24 (end of week 8), progress towards goals is reviewed. If the participant has achieved a goal, a new goal is set and a new activity to practise selected. If the participant finds a goal or activity too challenging or they are experiencing other problems, an alternative is chosen.<break/>At the final therapy session (36, end of week 12), practice of activities continues but part of the session is dedicated to &#x02018;summing up&#x02019; with feedback to the participant about progress over the programme and advice about maintaining upper limb function in the longer term</td></tr><tr><td>5.

Logistic regression will be used to compare the primary outcome (success) between the three randomisation groups at 3 and 6&#x000a0;months, adjusting for any imbalance in key covariates. The use of multilevel logistic models will be explored. It may be possible to fit three-level models (hubs, spokes and participants), but since there are only four centres with a hub, and a small number of stroke services accessing an InMotion robotic gym system at each hub, it may be necessary to fit a two-level model (stroke services and participants).</p></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Secondary analyses</title><p id="Par93">The secondary outcomes will be compared between the three groups at 3 and 6&#x000a0;months using multilevel linear regression adjusting for baseline values and key covariates.</p><p id="Par94">We will consider any difference in attrition rates, and any nonrandomness of the attrition, when comparing outcomes between the three groups. The pattern of missing observations because of loss to follow-up will be examined to determine both the extent of missingness, and whether it is missing at random or is informative. If data are missing to a sufficient extent, the use of appropriate multiple imputation techniques will be considered. Although mortality is possible within the 6-month follow-up period, it is thought to be sufficiently uncommon that methods for joint modelling of survival and longitudinal data will not be necessary.</p><p id="Par95">Further descriptive analyses will explore the relationship between the severity of baseline upper limb function and time since stroke upon the effectiveness of the intervention. There is not sufficient power to perform any formal subgroup analyses. The time pattern of upper limb recovery will be explored by extending the earlier multilevel models to include a further within-patient level (ARAT scores collected at baseline, 3 and 6&#x000a0;months). However, this will depend on the relationship being approximately linear.</p></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>Sample size</title><p id="Par96">The sample size is 720 participants (240 participants per group). Responses from 216 participants in each randomisation group will provide 80% power (significance level of 1.67% because of multiple comparisons) to detect a 15% difference in &#x02018;successful outcome&#x02019; between each of the three pairs of treatments (robot-assisted training, enhanced upper limb therapy, usual care). We have allowed for 10% attrition and inflated the sample size to 720 participants.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec32"><title>Economic analysis</title><p id="Par97">The economic analysis will include a detailed micro-costing analysis, economic evaluation and a longer-term economic model. This will be based upon both a &#x02018;within trial&#x02019; analysis and a modelling exercise to explore costs and effects over the longer term. Analyses will be carried out from the perspective of the NHS and personal and social services, but we will also take a societal perspective by including costs borne by the participants and their informal carers. All relevant costs associated with providing the interventions will be measured, this will include the cost of using the InMotion robotic gym system, costed on a per patient basis. All costs will be derived using routine data sources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] and study-specific estimates. Where appropriate, discounting will be applied to costs and outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Costs in the follow-up period will also be taken into account; this includes secondary care resource, e.g. inpatient stays and outpatient visits; primary care resource use, e.g. general practice, therapy visits and prescription costs. These data will be collected using a health service utilisation questionnaire (adaption of the Client Services Receipt Inventory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]) administered at baseline and 6&#x000a0;months post randomisation. Patient costs will also be collected via a time-and-travel questionnaire based upon one successfully used in a number of previous NIHR HTA-funded trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. This will include questions relating to travel time, time away from employment (if appropriate) and time spent providing care. The within-trial analysis will also compare changes in health-related quality of life, based on responses to the EQ-5D-5L at baseline, 3 and 6&#x000a0;months post randomisation and scored using population tariffs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. These data will be combined with study participants&#x02019; mortality to estimate quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). This measure provides a profile of quality of life over time. The results of the analyses will be presented as point estimates of mean incremental costs and QALYs. Techniques, such as bootstrapping, will be used alongside deterministic sensitivity analyses to address uncertainty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. In addition, a within trial cost-utility analysis will be performed where both costs and QALY data will be combined into an incremental cost per QALY. The cost-utility analysis will include deterministic and stochastic sensitivity analysis, presented as point estimates and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves (CEACs).</p><p id="Par98">An economic model will also be developed to assess the cost and health consequences measured in terms of QALYs of stroke recovery beyond the 6-month timeframe of the trial. The data from the trial will be the main source of data for this model but further data with which to model outcomes beyond a 6-month follow-up will be systematically derived from the academic literature and other existing data sources following guidance for best practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. These data will include information on factors, such as the incidence of hospitalisation and the need for residential/nursing home care, beyond the trial follow-up period. Sensitivity analysis will be applied to the model using probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity analyses to address parameter and other forms of uncertainty. The data on both costs and QALYs for both trial- and model-based analyses will be reported separately.</p></sec><sec id="Sec33"><title>Parallel process evaluation</title><p id="Par99">Alongside the RCT, a two-stage process evaluation is being conducted to understand both (1) participants&#x02018; and health service professionals&#x02019; experiences of robot-assisted training; enhanced upper limb therapy and usual care and (2) factors affecting the implementation of the trial within and across study sites. The process evaluation will capture data concerning feasibility and accumulating experience of the therapies being provided. In stage 1 data collection is by semi-structured interview using a pre-developed and piloted interview schedule. Data collection in stage 2 is primarily by interview; however, analysis also draws upon trial data including baseline, therapy and outcome (3 and 6&#x000a0;month) assessments. Interviews are primarily being conducted face to face; however, due to the geographical spread of the study sites, some follow-up interviews are being conducted by telephone for efficiency (these are particularly appropriate for health service professionals). Data collection and analysis relating to study of implementation factors will be informed by Normalization Process Theory (NPT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec34"><title>Participant study group</title><p id="Par100">In stage 1 a subset of approximately 25&#x02013;30 study participants will be recruited across study sites, to achieve a maximum variation sample, ensuring representation of participants differing in terms of key factors such as randomisation group, clinical severity and time from stroke. Participants in the robot-assisted training and enhanced upper limb therapy programme groups are interviewed on two occasions: (1) soon after therapy commences and (2) towards the end of the 12-week therapy period, to determine how perceptions of acceptability of therapy may change over time.</p><p id="Par101">In stage 2 approximately 25 participants will be recruited, again with the aim of achieving maximum variation in the sample. Participants in the treatment groups are interviewed twice. However, in this stage, time points are (1) towards the end of their 12-week therapy and (2) around their 6-month follow-up assessments, to provide insight into their experience of trial participation, and the impact of the therapy they received, post treatment. The baseline, therapy and outcome assessment data are reviewed descriptively, for the participants who have been interviewed as part of stage 2. This will allow comparison of trial participants&#x02019; assessment data with their subjective experiences of participating in the trial, to inform later interpretation of the results of the trial.</p><p id="Par102">Participants to be invited for interview are identified from the study database (containing data held by unique study number only) by the researcher conducting the interviews.

Interviews take place in stage 1 and stage 2 of the process evaluation. The aim is to interview a range of health service professionals, e.g. senior therapists, therapy assistants, study administrators, principal investigators and NIHR LCRN staff to gain insight into different aspects of the trial including implementation of the robot-assisted training, enhanced upper limb therapy and usual care practices, and implementation of the trial itself, including the recruitment and follow-up processes.</p><p id="Par105">Staff to be invited for interview are identified by the local study centre coordinator and/or local study investigators.
