Publication of new evidence derived from additional studies of clopidogrel and a high screen failure rate due to prevalent aspirin usage prompted an updated trial design.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>The original trial protocol published in 2009 has undergone two major amendments, which were implemented in 2011. Firstly, the primary outcome &#x02018;early thrombosis&#x02019; at 3&#x000a0;months following AVF creation was broadened to a more clinically relevant outcome of &#x02018;AVF access failure&#x02019;; a composite of thrombosis, AVF abandonment and cannulation failure at 12&#x000a0;months. Secondly, participants unable to cease using aspirin were allowed to be enrolled and randomised to omega-3 PUFAs or placebo. The revised primary aim of the FAVOURED study is to test the hypothesis that omega-3 PUFAs will reduce rates of AVF access failure within 12&#x000a0;months following AVF surgery. The secondary aims are to examine the effect of omega-3 PUFAs and aspirin on the individual components of the primary end-point, to examine the safety of study interventions and assess central venous catheter requirement as a result of access failure.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This multicentre international clinical trial was amended to address the clinically relevant question of whether the usability of de novo AVF at 12&#x000a0;months can be improved by the early use of omega-3 PUFAs and to a lesser extent aspirin. This study protocol amendment was made in response to a large trial demonstrating that clopidogrel is effective in safely preventing primary AVF thrombosis, but ineffective at increasing functional patency. Secondly, including patients taking aspirin will enrol a more representative cohort of haemodialysis patients, who are significantly older with a higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease and diabetes which may increase event rates and the power of the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Australia &#x00026; New Zealand Clinical Trial Register (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?id=82388">ACTRN12607000569404</ext-link>)</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Vascular access</kwd><kwd>AVF outcome</kwd><kwd>Fish oil</kwd><kwd>Aspirin</kwd><kwd>Chronic kidney disease</kwd><kwd>Haemodialysis</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Increases in the incidence and prevalence of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) associated with aging of the population and diabetes mellitus pose challenges to health providers and patients. Haemodialysis remains the most common treatment for ESKD worldwide and requires a functioning permanent vascular access for optimal patient outcomes. Vascular access dysfunction is associated with significant morbidity and mortality and presents a major economic burden for health care providers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. A native arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is the preferred type of vascular access due to lower rates of thrombosis, infection, interventions to maintain patency and overall mortality when compared with synthetic arteriovenous grafts (AVG) or central venous catheters (CVC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, native AVF take longer to establish and have a higher risk of failure to mature. Primary failure rates of AVF range between 20 and 60&#x000a0;% and usually occur as a result of early thrombosis or failure of maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Strategies to improve early access survival by reducing thrombosis include short-term anti-platelet therapy and the pre-operative identification of unsuitable anatomy by ultrasound.</p><p>Although several small randomised controlled trials (RCT) have assessed the effect of short-term post-operative use of antiplatelet agents such as aspirin, sulphinpyrazone, and ticlopidine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] on early AVF thrombosis, these trials had many limitations including inadequate power, variable drug dosing and variable timing of drug administration. Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) derived from fish and fish oils not only inhibit platelet aggregation but are anti-inflammatory, anti-proliferative and promote vasodilatation by reducing the availability of arachidonic acid, leukotriene and cytokine production as well as increasing prostaglandin-I<sub>3</sub> production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The original aim of the FAVOURED trial was therefore to examine the potential effects of aspirin and omega-3 PUFAs in preventing early thrombosis in newly created AVF using a large, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled factorial trial design. Details of the rationale and original study design of FAVOURED were published in 2009 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>Since commencement of the FAVOURED study, an unexpectedly high screen failure rate due to prevalent aspirin usage together with the publication of new data from a large RCT assessing clopidogrel in AVF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] prompted a review of trial design. While the clopidogel RCT demonstrated a significant reduction of &#x02018;early thrombosis&#x02019; by post-operative use of clopidogrel, this did not translate into an increased proportion of usable AVF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. As such the FAVOURED Trial Management Committee (TMC) decided that it was appropriate to amend the primary outcome to a more clinically relevant outcome &#x02013; AVF Access Failure, defined as a composite of any or all of thrombosis, AVF abandonment and cannulation failure. In addition, the TMC revised the protocol and included additional endpoints to broaden the clinical applicability and generalizability of the FAVOURED trial, whilst also addressing the unexpectedly high screen failure due to aspirin use. This updated publication describes the details and rationales of the study protocol amendments and outcome assessments which were made and implemented in June 2011.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><p>Ethics approval for the Omega-3 fatty acids <bold>(F</bold>ish Oils<bold>)</bold> and <bold>A</bold>spirin in <bold>V</bold>ascular access <bold>OU</bold>tcomes in <bold>RE</bold>nal <bold>D</bold>isease (FAVOURED) trial was obtained from local Human Research Ethics Committees in all participating centres prior to study initiation and participant enrolment.

Following the review of protocol and in order to address slow recruitment and improve generalizability, the trial began recruiting patients from sites in Malaysia and the United Kingdom. Patients that met all inclusion and no exclusion criteria and were planned to receive a de novo AVF were eligible for randomisation. Participant consent forms were approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee at each participating site prior to the beginning of the trial. Participants were not randomised until a signed consent form was filed at site.</p><p>The original protocol was a 2x2 factorial-design trial, where participants were randomised to one of four treatment groups formed by aspirin or matching placebo and omega-3 PUFAs or matching placebo. Patients who were not taking aspirin or who were able to cease taking aspirin were consented and randomised to one of the 4 groups. The study protocol was amended in June 2011 to include suitable patients who were on aspirin at the time of screening and were unable to cease. In this expanded study protocol, participants were allowed to continue with open-label aspirin and were randomised to omega-3 PUFAs or matched placebo only (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The rationale behind this study amendment will be described further in the discussion. Randomisation was achieved using a minimisation method to balance treatments over two stratification factors: study site and AVF location (upper versus lower arm).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Amended study protocol</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12882_2015_89_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p>With the exception of open label aspirin, the two anti-platelet agents were studied using matching placebo in order to maintain a double-blind trial. Effectiveness of blinding was assessed by asking participants and investigators at the completion of treatment what they believed the participant had received.</p><p>Participants were randomised as close as possible to the time of the scheduled procedure and not more than 7&#x000a0;days before the planned procedure. The study medication was commenced on the day prior to the scheduled surgery. If the procedure was rescheduled, and the patient had already started trial medication, it was immediately withheld and then recommenced the day before the rescheduled surgery.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Outcome measures</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Primary outcome measures</title><p>The amended primary outcome measure is AVF Access Failure at 12&#x000a0;months after AVF creation.

The 12- month post-surgery event rate for AVF access failure estimated to be at least 30&#x000a0;% in the control group. It is expected that the reduction in AVF access failure due to omega-3 fatty acids will be 30&#x000a0;% (an absolute reduction in risk of 9&#x000a0;%). To detect a 30&#x000a0;% relative risk reduction with 80&#x000a0;% power and a significance level of 5&#x000a0;%, 734 participants will be required (367 per group). To allow for a 5&#x000a0;% drop-in from control to omega-3 fatty acids and a 5&#x000a0;% drop-out from omega-3 fatty acids to placebo, the total number of participants was increased to 906 (453 per group). Allowing for a 5&#x000a0;% loss to follow-up, a total of 954 participants need to be recruited. The revised enrolment target and sample size with the anticipated 30% event rate and the effect of higher event rates on sample size is shown in Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. The assumed 30&#x000a0;% event rate for AVF access failure is conservative when compared to the 60&#x000a0;% event rate reported by the US clopidogrel Trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and other recently published studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. However, the vascular access practices and AVF outcomes in the USA differ from those in Australasia. Moreover, the report to the FAVOURED Data and Safety Monitoring Board in December 2011 showed a 38&#x000a0;% blinded pooled event rate among the first 184 participants, indicating that a vascular access failure rate of 30&#x000a0;% is a reasonable assumption.<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>The enrolment target with increasing event rates</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Event rate</th><th colspan="2">Sample size</th></tr><tr><th/><th>Not adjusted</th><th>Adjusted</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>30&#x000a0;%</td><td>734</td><td>954</td></tr><tr><td>40&#x000a0;%</td><td>488</td><td>634</td></tr><tr><td>50&#x000a0;%</td><td>340</td><td>442</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p>While the study is not adequately powered to detect a clinically important difference between the combination of aspirin and omega-3 fatty acids and either treatment alone, it will provide preliminary outcome and adverse event data.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Analysis</title><p>Analysis of the primary composite outcome will be on an intent-to-treat basis. That is, all randomised participants who had an AVF surgery attempted will be analysed in the group to which they were allocated. The primary analysis of AVF access failure will compare omega-3 fatty acids (combined arms A, B and E) to control (combined arms C, D and F) using logistic regression with the intervention group as a predictor variable. The logistic model will be adjusted for differences in aspirin use (no aspirin, randomised to aspirin, open-label aspirin). Additional efficacy analyses will compare AVF access failure rates in the active aspirin (arms A and C) and aspirin placebo (arms B and D) groups from the original design and the omega-3 fatty acid (arm E) and omega-3 placebo (arm f) from the new design. These and other comparisons of binary outcomes will be performed using logistic regression with the intervention group as a predictor variable in the models. The log-rank test will be used to compare groups on time-to-event outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Screening log data</title><p>Recruitment for the FAVOURED trial started on the 21<sup>st</sup> of August 2008. As shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, a total of 4242 patients were screened. Of the 2334 patients that were screened prior to the study protocol amendment in June 2011, 1842 were excluded, mainly due to the use of anticoagulants or anti-platelet agents including use of aspirin or fish oil (39&#x000a0;%, exclusion criteria 2 [26&#x000a0;%] and 4 [13&#x000a0;%]). Of the 492 patients deemed suitable, 184 (37&#x000a0;%) were enrolled. The two main reasons the remaining 308 patients were not enrolled were patient disinterest (37&#x000a0;%) and unknown reasons (28&#x000a0;%). After introduction of the updated study protocol in June 2011 with the inclusion of open-label aspirin use for those taking aspirin and unable to cease, almost half of patients screened (909 out of 1908 participants) were deemed suitable and of these 384 were enrolled in the trial. Only 10&#x000a0;% of the patients screened after the protocol amendments (197 out of 999) were excluded due to use of anti-platelet or thrombolytic agents including aspirin and fish oil.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Screening log data</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12882_2015_89_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec16" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This international, multicenter, randomised controlled trial was originally designed to determine whether the use of omega-3 fatty acids and/or aspirin will effectively improve postsurgical outcomes for patients with de novo AVF. Vascular access failure occurs frequently and poses a considerable health risk for patients receiving haemodialysis. Effective therapies to prevent primary AVF failure would therefore not only improve patient outcomes but also reduce economic costs of the increased hospitalisations arising from inadequate or artificial vascular access, rescue interventions and prolonged treatments of infective complications. Omega-3 PUFAs and aspirin, used in the FAVOURED study are widely available and inexpensive. It is expected that omega-3 PUFAs may have additive benefits to aspirin by improving vascular endothelial function and smooth muscle relaxation, which could potentially enhance AVF maturation and increase functional patency.</p><sec id="Sec17"><title>Justification for change in primary outcome</title><p>The original protocol for the FAVOURED trial was designed before the pivotal study examining the effect of clopidogrel in AVF was published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. This large randomised controlled trial demonstrated for the first time that 6&#x000a0;weeks of clopidogrel compared to placebo was associated with a reduction in early AVF thrombosis (12.2&#x000a0;% compared to 19.5&#x000a0;%, relative risk: 0.63; 95&#x000a0;% confidence interval 0.46 &#x02013; 0.97, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.018) but without concurrent improvement in the usability of newly created AVF for dialysis at 6&#x000a0;months (61.8&#x000a0;% [clopidogrel] and 59.5&#x000a0;% [placebo], respectively, relative risk 1.05; confidence interval 0.94 &#x02013; 1.17, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.4). This important finding suggests that preventing thrombosis (and loss of patency), whilst a pre&#x02010;requisite for usability, is not by itself a valid surrogate for maturation (usability) of the fistula. In other words, early thrombosis may not be a good clinical marker for AVF usability. The FAVOURED Trial Management Committee therefore decided that this original primary outcome (early thrombosis) should be amended to a more clinically relevant outcome &#x02013; AVF Access Failure, defined as a composite of early thrombosis, AVF abandonment and cannulation failure at 12&#x000a0;months. Each occurrence of the components of AVF Access Failure can result in multiple adverse clinical consequences such as hospitalisation, diagnostic tests, surgical or radiological interventions, insertion of central venous catheters, inadequate dialysis and even death. By increasing the follow up duration from 3&#x000a0;months to 12&#x000a0;months, the revised study will inform clinicians and policy makers about the longer term effects of omega-3 PUFAs and aspirin. Thus, the revised primary outcome is a clinically valid hard endpoint associated with increased patient morbidity and mortality as well as health care costs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Justification for the inclusion of patients taking aspirin</title><p>The decision to update and implement a revised study protocol in order to allow the inclusion of patients taking aspirin was based on two important observations. Firstly, the recruitment rate in June 2010 was only about one ninth of the expected rate. Analysis of screening logs revealed a high rate of screening failure with 1,180 (73&#x000a0;%) out of 1,619 screened patients excluded. The most common reason for exclusion from the trial was current use of aspirin in 37&#x000a0;% of patients. Despite repeated attempts over a 12&#x000a0;month period to educate the participating centres on the lack of evidence about benefits of aspirin for secondary prevention in this population, recruitment rates did not improve. As shown by Ethier et al. 41&#x000a0;% of haemodialysis patients in Australia and New Zealand take aspirin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. These data strongly support our findings that aspirin usage was a major barrier to recruitment and allowing inclusion of patients on aspirin would significantly improve the recruitment rate. Secondly, interim analysis of baseline characteristics of the recruited participants revealed an unrepresentative selection of healthy participants with a mean age of 55&#x000a0;years and an ischaemic heart disease rate of only 4&#x000a0;%. Haemodialysis patients who are taking aspirin are significantly older and have a higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease and diabetes than those who are not taking aspirin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Thus, high aspirin usage precluded entry to many patients, often those at the highest risk of AVF access failure, thereby potentially diluting the trial&#x02019;s ability to detect a true benefit of omega-3 PUFAs and aspirin. Not surprisingly, a blinded analysis of primary patency failure rate at 12&#x000a0;weeks in June 2010 was much lower than expected (5&#x000a0;% versus 25&#x000a0;%) which was attributed to the relatively young and healthy population as outlined above. Hence, with inclusion of patients on aspirin, the study sample is more likely to represent the current dialysis population and therefore increase the external validity of the study. Furthermore, the updated study inclusion criteria, allowing participation of patients already receiving aspirin, is anticipated to increase event rates and hence the power of the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Clinical implication of the study</title><p>If this trial reveals a positive effect of either or both agents, the routine use of these can be recommended in clinical practice and lead to improvement in AVF survival by reducing the rate of early thrombosis, shortening time to dialysis access use, and decreasing the need for additional surgery. This has significant patient benefits by reducing morbidity and mortality and will lead to a decrease in health costs associated with repeat hospitalisations, rescue interventions and artificial access creation. If the trial demonstrates no benefit of these agents, this may suggest that platelet aggregation is not the major mechanism for early thrombosis and AVF maturation, or that inhibition of platelet aggregation merely salvages otherwise unsuitable AVFs as suggested by the US clopidogrel trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Further research could then focus, for example, on better selection or modification of the vasculature used to create the anastomosis. Even if the intervention proves not to be beneficial substantial additional clinical data about the natural history of AVFs, use of CVCs and long term outcomes of AVF surgery will inform clinical practice.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>AV: Trial Management Committee member and PhD student; drafted the manuscript.
