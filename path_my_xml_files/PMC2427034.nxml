The prevalence of infection by <italic>H. pylori </italic>varies greatly among countries, with over a 70% infection rate in many developing countries compared to 20% to 50% in most industrialized nations. <italic>H. pylori </italic>infection can lead to gastritis, duodenal and gastric ulcer, gastric carcinoma, and gastric lymphoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Gastric cancer risks can be reduced by up to 60% by eradication of <italic>H. pylori </italic>infection through primary prevention, thus affecting approximately 800,000 gastric cancer patients worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Currently, a seven-day, triple-drug regimen has been recommended as one of the first-line therapies for <italic>H. pylori </italic>management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. This treatment includes omeprazole (a proton-pump inhibitor), clarithromycin (CLR), and amoxicillin. However, this therapy is being investigated because of increased eradication failures due to the prevalence of CLR-resistant (CLR<sup>r</sup>) <italic>H. pylori </italic>infections. Many studies have shown that between 0&#x02013;50% of <italic>H. pylori </italic>isolates were CLR<sup>r</sup>, which leads to a need for long term assessment of the efficacy of CLR in the triple-drug regimen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. It is well known that the abuse of macrolide antibiotics including CLR might lead to CLR resistant forms of <italic>H. pylori</italic>. Whether an optimal therapy containing CLR for <italic>H. pylori </italic>eradication would contribute to the prevalence of CLR<sup>r </sup><italic>H. pylori </italic>infection was not well investigated among the Chinese population.</p><p>From 1995 to 2003, a randomized, double blind and placebo-controlled intervention trial was conducted in a high-risk population for gastric cancer in Linqu County, Shandong Province of China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. One of the three treatments of <italic>H. pylori </italic>infection in this study was a dual-drug therapy with omeprazole and amoxicillin (OA), since the triple-drug regimen was not available in 1995. This study focused on subjects who were <italic>H. pylori </italic>seropositive at baseline. In 2000, a triple therapy consisting of OA and CLR (OAC) was applied to subjects who were <italic>H. pylori </italic>seronegative at baseline and subsequently found to be <sup>13</sup>C-urea breath test (<sup>13</sup>C-UBT)-positive, according to instruction of the Ethic Committee of the Beijing Institute for Cancer Research and the U.S. National Cancer Institute (NCI).</p><p>In <italic>H. pylori </italic>infection, resistance to CLR is mostly due to the presence of A2143G and A2142G/C point mutations of the <italic>23S rRNA </italic>gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. We recently reported that the A2143G mutation was a late event in the development of CLR resistance of <italic>H. pylori 26695 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The global average mutation frequency for the A2143G and A2142G mutations causing CLR resistance of <italic>H. pylori </italic>were 69.8% and 11.7%, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Herein, we report the prevalence of the A2143G and A2142G mutations of the <italic>H. pylori</italic>-specific <italic>23S rRNA </italic>gene among these subjects treated with regimens with or without CLR after eradication of <italic>H. pylori </italic>infection.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Genomic DNA was extracted from 770 of pre-fixed fasting gastric juice samples as described in the Method section. To determine both the presence of <italic>H. pylori </italic>infection and prevalence of CLR<sup>r</sup>, a <italic>H. pylori</italic>-specific <italic>23S rRNA </italic>PCR assay was developed. <italic>H. pylori </italic>infection was detected in 59.5% of analyzed subjects by the PCR assay as compared to 68.1% and 71.0% by <sup>13</sup>C-UBT and ELISA, respectively (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).

Moreover, the sequence change AAGGG &#x02192; CTTCA (2222&#x02013;2226) in the OAC group was 12.3 times of the placebo group (4.9% vs. 0.4%, p = 0.0497; OR 13.28, 95% CI 0.91&#x02013;379); the AACC &#x02192; GAAG (2081&#x02013;2084) in the OAC group was 11.2 times of the OA group (14.6.7% vs. 1.3%, p = 0.018; OR 8.38, 95% CI 1.25&#x02013;68.84) and 7.7 times of the placebo group (14.6% vs. 1.9%, p = 0.002; OR 5.51, 95% CI 1.18&#x02013;25.12) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Among Chinese subjects enrolled in the long term population-based trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], we found that the proportion of the primary CLR<sup>r </sup>related A2143G mutation among <italic>23S rRNA</italic>-positive subjects in the placebo group was 13.8% (36/260), which was similar to the average reported CLR-resistant prevalence of 10.5% (35/334) within China: 5.2% (5/96) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], 9.8% (4/41) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], 13.5% (12/89) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], and 14.8% (16/108) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. That the CLR<sup>r </sup>infection rate in the OA group was slightly lower than that in the placebo group (p = 0.274) indicated that the OA treatment for eradication of <italic>H. pylori </italic>might reduce the prevalence of primary CLR<sup>r </sup>among the treated subjects. Heep <italic>et al</italic>. reported that secondary resistance to CLR was up to 50% in a study of 554 <italic>H. pylori </italic>isolates after failure of therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. It is well recognized that eradication therapy with CLR led to the prevalence of CLR<sup>r </sup><italic>H. pylori </italic>infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In the present study, we observed a 31.7% A2143G mutation rate among <italic>H. pylori </italic>infected subjects three years after treatment with CLR, which is significantly higher than that among subjects without CLR treatment in the OA and placebo groups (OR = 4.09 and 2.89, respectively). An optimal way to validate the exact effect of CLR use on the formation of the secondary CLR resistance was to compare the prevalence of the A2143G mutation among subjects before and after administration of CLR. Because of the lack of gastric juice samples before eradication therapy, the original mutation status of <italic>23S rRNA </italic>in samples was not available, thus such comparison could not be carried out in the present study. This is a limitation of our study. The strength of this study was that all of the subjects in the OAC group had the same CLR treatment history in 2000, and those in the OA and placebo group did not. Therefore, the prevalence of CLR<sup>r </sup><italic>H. pylori </italic>infection among subjects with and without CLR use in the local area was reliably obtained. These results were useful for evaluation of the exact effect of administration of CLR for eradication of <italic>H. pylori </italic>on the prevalence of the A2143G mutation among Chinese subjects.</p><p>Unlike indirect assays such as ELISA and <sup>13</sup>C-UBT, PCR assays are direct assays to detect <italic>H. pylori </italic>infection. Thus, these assays should result in higher specificity than the indirect assays. <italic>H. pylori </italic>colonizes on the apical surface of stomach's epithelial cells and sheds into gastric juice with the regular renewal of gastric mucosa. Several PCR assays based on <italic>H. pylori </italic>DNA from gastric juice/biopsy sample were reported for detection of <italic>H. pylori </italic>infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The possible <italic>H. pylori</italic>-specific target genes included <italic>ureA</italic>, <italic>ureB</italic>, <italic>ureC</italic>, <italic>ureD</italic>, <italic>16S rRNA</italic>, and <italic>23S rRNA</italic>. Point mutations of <italic>23S rRNA </italic>were closely related to formation of CLR resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Because the PCR product of <italic>23S rRNA </italic>described in this study could be used as a biomarker to detect <italic>H. pylori </italic>infection and CLR resistance simultaneously, this assay has advantages over other PCR-based methodologies. However, the specificity and sensitivity of the <italic>23S rRNA </italic>PCR assay was not evaluated extensively. No single test is accepted as the standard for diagnosis of <italic>H. pylori </italic>infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In the present study, the status of <italic>H. pylori </italic>infection was detected by the <italic>23S rRNA </italic>PCR assay, <sup>13</sup>C-UBT, and ELISA for each subject, which provided an opportunity to assess the specificity and sensitivity of these assays. As expected, the highest specificity was observed for the <italic>23S rRNA </italic>PCR assay when both CUBT and ELISA assays were negative for <italic>H. pylori </italic>infection. The Youden's index of the <italic>23S rRNA </italic>PCR assay was similar to that of the ELISA assay but lower than that of <sup>13</sup>C-UBT (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>).</p><p>Generally, PCR-based assays used to detect <italic>H. pylori </italic>infection are considered the most sensitive. However, the sensitivity of the <italic>23S rRNA </italic>PCR assay was lower than <sup>13</sup>C-UBT and ELISA in the present study (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). Because the genomic DNA could not be extracted from gastric juice samples immediately after collection and that the shedded gastric epithelial cells easily self-decompose, the quality and amount of DNA extracted is variable between samples. In this study, fixative was added to gastric juice samples at the local clinics to prevent degeneration of DNA, and then the samples were stored at -20&#x000b0;C. These samples were shipped to the laboratory using dry ice and stored at -80&#x000b0;C. Although the fixative was removed with repeated washings before DNA extraction, it is possible that the quality of the DNA was adversely affected. The fixation process could be omitted if gastric juice samples can be stored at -80&#x000b0;C immediately after collection. However, it would be optimal if the DNA were isolated from fresh samples immediately after collection.</p><p>CLR<sup>r </sup>results mainly from point mutations in the peptidyltransferase loop region of <italic>23S rRNA </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The most frequent mutations are A2143G and A2142G [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Other mutations such as A2142C, A2115G, G2141A, and T2717C might also be associated with CLR<sup>r</sup>. Recent reports demonstrated that the A2143G point mutation of <italic>23S rRNA </italic>were detected in average of 90% (44 of 49) CLR<sup>r </sup><italic>H. pylori </italic>isolates from Chinese subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In the present study, the A2143G mutation was detectable in 65 of 458 <italic>23S rRNA </italic>PCR products by the <italic>BsaI</italic>-restriction PCR-RFLP assay (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). No A2142G mutation was detected in these samples. These results suggest that the A2143G may be a very useful CLR<sup>r </sup>indicator for selection of optimal therapy against <italic>H. pylori </italic>infection in China.</p><p>In 41 of the 65 A2143G-positive cases (63.1%), both the <italic>BsaI</italic>-sensitive and -insensitive <italic>23S rRNA </italic>PCR products was observed. Because the PCR products of the A2143G-positive control (CLR<sup>r</sup>-1) were digested by <italic>BsaI </italic>enzyme completely in each experiment, partial restriction could be excluded. Thus, multi-strain <italic>H. pylori </italic>infection likely happened among these cases. Sequencing results of 12 representative samples supported the deduction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Isolation of the sensitive and resistant strains from cultures might provide a direct evidence to show the mixed colonization. Because the experimental conditions at the local clinics in Linqu County was not adequate to support primary <italic>H. pylori </italic>culture, isolation of <italic>H. pylori </italic>from biopsies of stomach was not carried out in the clinical trial. The high <italic>H. pylori </italic>infection rate in the local area might contribute to the high co-infection rate of the CLR sensitive and resistant <italic>H. pylori </italic>strains.</p><p>In addition, two new <italic>MboII</italic>-RFLP patterns were discovered in 17 subjects in the present study. Sequencing showed that 6 of the 17 cases had a sequence change of AAGGG &#x02192; CTTCA (2222&#x02013;2226) and that the remaining 11 cases had a sequence change of AACC &#x02192; GAAG (2081&#x02013;2084). The A2143G mutation was detected only in 3 of the 15 GAAG-positive cases (20%). Both the AAGGG &#x02192; CTTCA (2222&#x02013;2226) and AACC &#x02192; GAAG (2081&#x02013;2084) alterations are located around the conserved domain V of <italic>23S rRNA </italic>(2126&#x02013;2712, equal to <italic>Escherichia coli </italic>numbering 2042 to 2628), a region closely related to resistance formation of macrolide antibiotics including CLR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. It was reported that the point mutation A2224G might not contribute to the CLR resistance among Japanese [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. In the present study, we observed that the presence of the AAGGG &#x02192; CTTCA (2222&#x02013;2226) and AACC &#x02192; GAAG (2081&#x02013;2084) sequence alterations in OAC group were significantly higher than those in the OA and placebo groups (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). The A2143G mutation was detected only in 2 of the 11 AACC &#x02192; GAAG (2081&#x02013;2084) cases (18.2%). Whether these alterations contribute to CLR resistance should be investigated further.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The primary prevalence of the CLR<sup>r</sup>-related A2143G mutation within the <italic>23S rRNA </italic>gene as determined by a novel PCR-RFLP assay is approximately 10~14% among Chinese subjects without CLR use history.

Fasting gastric juice samples were taken by a side-tube connected to vacuum device within the gastroendoscope at the end of the intervention trial in 2003. All subjects with more than 5 mL of gastric juice were eligible for the present study. Seven hundred and seventy of gastric juice samples were collected during the endoscope examination.
