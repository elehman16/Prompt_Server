current stimulation (tDCS) applied to the cerebral cortex motor area on the upper
extremity functions of hemiplegic patients. [Subjects and Methods] Twenty four Patients
with hemiplegia resulting from a stroke were divided into two groups: a tDCS group that
received tDCS and physical therapy and a control group that received only physical
therapy. A functional evaluation of the two groups was performed, and an
electrophysiological evaluation was conducted before and after the experiment. Statistical
analyses were performed to verify differences before and after the experiment. All
statistical significance levels were set at 0.05. [Results] The results showed that
functional evaluation scores for the elbow joint and hand increased after the treatment in
both the experimental group and the control group, and the increases were statistically
significantly different. [Conclusion] tDCS was effective in improving the upper extremity
motor function of stroke patients. Additional research is warranted on the usefulness of
tDCS in the rehabilitation of stroke patients in the clinical field.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>TDCS</kwd><kwd>Upper extremity and hand motor function</kwd><kwd>Stroke patients</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Improvement in the standard of living and changes in diet have led to an increase in the
prevalence of hypertension, arteriosclerosis, and diabetes mellitus. Moreover, the incidence
rate of stroke and the risk for these diseases have increased. Cerebrovascular diseases are
the second-highest cause of death, followed by cancer, in Korea<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Among the cerebrovascular diseases, stroke is one of the
most common causes of disability in adults. The prognosis of stroke after the age of
65&#x02005;years is usually poor, and more than 80% of patients experience neurological damage<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. The rate of disability that affects
activities of daily living after a stroke, compared to other chronic diseases, is very high.
Long-term rehabilitation is necessary because of the loss of function in the upper and lower
extremities, speech impairment, and cognitive disorders that accompany a stroke<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>With regard to the recovery of neurological motor functions after a stroke, patients show
80% and 95% recovery of the upper and lower extremity function within 3 months,
respectively<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Despite intensive,
long-term treatment, most stroke patients fail to show complete recovery of the function of
their upper limbs<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Among the upper extremity functions, hand function is usually the
most severely impaired<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Various
treatments, including drugs and exercise, are available to enhance motor functions after a
stroke. Other methods include neurological physical therapy focusing on neurodevelopment
therapy and proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation, occupational therapy, ischemic nerve
block, functional electrical stimulation, constraint-induced movement therapy<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>,
and robot-assisted therapy for upper limb rehabilitation<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. These treatment methods may speed up the recovery of patients&#x02019;
upper limb functions but require long-term efforts, and continuous treatment may be
difficult for various reasons. Recent research suggests that transcranial direct current
stimulation (tDCS) of the brain can improve physical functions in stroke patients<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Therefore, we investigated the effects of tDCS on the recovery of upper limb functions in
stroke patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The study included 24 patients with stroke diagnosed by a specialist at C hospital located
in D Metropolitan City who were receiving rehabilitation treatment for functional recovery.
In all the participants, hemiplegic patients were composed of at least 6 months after the
onset. Participants with a history of stroke, with a personal or family history of epileptic
seizure, who underwent implantation of an artificial cardiac pacemaker, or who showed severe
upper extremity contracture and deformity were excluded, because participation of such
patients was difficult. Patients with hemiplegia who were diagnosed with a stroke were
randomly assigned to either an experimental or a control group. Data were collected from
patients who agreed to participate after they fully understood the research procedures. All
procedures were approved by the Institutional Review Board committee of C National
University Hospital in the Korea.</p><p>Fugl-Meyer assessment (FMA) was performed before the experiment for all the patients to
determine the function of their upper limbs<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. The experimental group received tDCS and physical therapy, whereas
the control group received only physical therapy. After 4 weeks, the FMA was performed
again, and the intervention was performed 5 times per week for 4 weeks.</p><p>Kolmogorov-Smirnov single-sample test was performed to examine the general characteristics
of the participants and the normality of each item. An analysis of covariance was conducted
to identify differences between the 2 groups. The data were analyzed with SPSS 18.0 SPSS
Inc, Chicago, IL, USA) for Windows, and the significance was set at p &#x0003c; 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>With regard to shoulder function, the mean &#x000b1; standard deviation (SD) FMA scores were 22.44

combination with physical therapy for patients with a stroke and who experienced hemiplegia
for &#x02265;6 months. This study focused on the effects of tDCS on upper extremity functions.</p><p>The changes in the FMA scores for the shoulder joint, elbow joint, and hand functions were
greater in the group that received tDCS than in the group that received only physical
therapy. The FMA is considered the best tool for the assessment of a patient&#x02019;s motor
functions. Park and Choi<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that
FMA was more effective than other methods for the assessment of the recovery of upper
extremity motor functions. In addition, a correlation between the effects of tDCS on upper
extremity functions and FMA scores was verified, and FMA was found to be a valid method for
the evaluation of upper limb functions. Hummel et al.<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup> and Harvey et al.<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup> applied tDCS for chronic stroke patients and observed that the
extent of improvement in the motor function performance, including FMA scores, was greater
in the tDCS group than in the non-tDCS group.</p><p>Hummel et al.<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that tDCS
applied for chronic stroke patients reduced the reaction time of the paretic hand and
improved the pinch force. In the present study, the shoulder joint, elbow joint, and hand
function scores in the experimental group increased significantly, and these findings
support the findings of Hummel et al<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>A limitation of the present study was the small study population. Therefore, the results
cannot be generalized to all female patients with stroke. Studies in a larger number of
participants would generate results that are more meaningful. The validity of the study
would also be improved by clarifying the criteria for the selection of participants.</p><p>The intervention that included tDCS improved upper limb motor function. However, previous
studies did not clarify these changes. Therefore, additional research needs to focus on
elucidation of the association between changes in the motor areas in the cerebral cortex and
improvement in muscle performance of the upper limbs.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Statistics Korea. Annual report
