Patients were divided into two groups with TBG &#x0003e;30&#x000b0; and TBG &#x0003c;30&#x000b0;. BIS readings; systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate were recorded in supine position. Patients were then shifted to desired TBG position either (&#x0003e;30&#x000b0;) or (&#x0003c;30&#x000b0;) as per group allotment.

Incidence of awareness is approximately 0.1-0.2% during general non high risk surgery.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Traditionally, depth of anesthesia had long been monitored clinically by assessing autonomic parameters (Evan's score) or patient response to surgical stimulus such as systolic blood pressure (SBP), heart rate, sweating and tear.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Aspect electroencephalogram (EEG) monitor or the bispectral index (BIS) is used to assess central nervous system (CNS) depression during GA with the help of changing amplitude and frequency of cortical surface EEG. It is a statistical system to analyze EEG and compute an index ranging from 0 to 100 to quantify level of CNS depression where 0 is an isoelectric EEG and 100 is fully awake state.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Laparoscopic surgery is a minimally invasive technique[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and laparoscopic assisted vaginal hysterectomy (LAVH) is a surgical alternative to the classical transvaginal and transabdominal approaches.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Although LAVH has also been associated with benefits such as better postoperative pain control and shorter length of hospital stay,[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] its impact on perioperative metabolic and hormonal responses has received little attention. Prolonged dorsolithotomy[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] position coupled with exaggerated Trendelenburg (TBG) tilt related complications[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] are also not very uncommon. Change of position during GA is often demanded for better surgical exposure. In LAVH, patients must be placed in a maximum TBG position to facilitate the fall of bowels away from the pelvic organs. This position change has been associated with changes in important physiological parameters like hemodynamics, which is a consequence of metabolic and hormonal responses, raised intra cranial pressure (ICP), and decreased functional residual capacity.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>Kaki and Almarakbi[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] detected the influence of patient positioning on BIS readings; they reported that changes in BIS values consequent to the changes in position of head. However, the change of BIS value and its correlation with intra-operative awareness is not known. Hence, this study was designed to observe the effect of TBG positioning on BIS monitoring in patient undergoing LAVH under GA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>After getting approval from Institutional Ethics Committee, written informed consent was obtained from 40 adult female patients of American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical Status I or II, aged 35-60 years scheduled to undergo LAVH under GA of expected OT duration over 120 min.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Exclusion criteria</title><p>Patient refusal, ASA Status III or more, any known allergy or contraindication to propofol and atracurium, any kind of neurological deficit, head injury or suggestive past history, hepatic, renal or cardiopulmonary abnormality, alcoholism, diabetes, gastro esophageal reflux disease were excluded. Patients with hypertension, glaucoma, and retinal detachment were also excluded from study. Pelvic malignancy, tubo-ovarian abscess, endometriosis or postinflammatory disorders, documented pelvic adhesion, uterus size &#x0003e;16-week pregnancy or maximum uterine width &#x0003e;12 cm or weight &#x0003e;800 g (as assessed by transvaginal ultrasonography) were excluded from the study.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>In preoperative assessment, patients were enquired about h/o previous exposure to anesthesia and prolonged drug treatment. General, systemic examinations and assessment of the airway were performed. Preoperative fasting of minimum 6 h was ensured. All patients received premedication of diazepam 5 mg orally the night before surgery as per preanesthetic checkup direction to allay anxiety, apprehension and for sound sleep. The patients also received ranitidine 150 mg orally in the previous night and in the morning of operation with sips of water.</p><p>After intravenous (IV) cannulation (18G) infusion of ringer's lactate was initiated. On arrival in the operation theatre monitors were attached to note the baseline parameters including noninvasive blood pressure, heart rate, SpO<sub>2</sub> and temperature. Skin was cleaned with alcohol and disposable BIS sensor electrodes were applied to the patient's forehead. The sensor consisted of four connected parts: Part 1 was applied at the center of the forehead approximately 5 cm above the nasal bridge, Part 4 was applied directly above the eyebrow, Part 2 was applied between Part 1 and 4, and Part 3 attached at the temple area between the corner of the eye and the hairline. The sensor was attached with the BIS monitor.</p><p>After preoxygenation with 100% oxygen for 5 min, fentanyl (2 &#x003bc;g/kg) and glycopyrrolate (0.01 mg/kg) were given intravenously administered 3 min before induction of anesthesia. All the patients were induced with 1% IV propofol (2 mg/kg). Atracurium (0.5 mg/kg) was used to facilitate laryngoscopy and intubation. Following intubation and inflating the cuff of endotracheal tube, controlled ventilation was maintained with 33% oxygen in 67% nitrous oxide and 1% isoflurane using Boyle's apparatus. Laryngoscopy, intubation and cuff inflation were completed within 15 s in all cases. Muscle relaxation was maintained with intermittent IV atracurium (0.2 mg/kg) as required. Intra-operative analgesia was maintained with incremental dose of fentanyl citrate. Intra-operatively pulse rate, respiratory rate, arterial oxygen saturation, electrocardiogram, capnography, SBP and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), were monitored continuously. Nitroglycerine infusion was administered with help of syringe pump to maintain SBP &#x0003c;130 mmHg, DBP &#x0003c;90 mmHg particularly after pneumoperitoneum and exaggerated TBG position. Ventilation was controlled manually and adjusted to maintain the end tidal CO<sub>2</sub> pressure (EtCO<sub>2</sub>) between 35 and 45 mmHg. All the patients received tramadol 2 mg/kg IV 20 min before the end of surgery.</p><p>Each patient was put at dorsolithotomy position after creation of pneumoperitoneum at supine position. Intraperitoneal preset pressure was kept below 15 mmHg to avoid cardiovascular compromise during CO<sub>2</sub> insufflation. After pneumoperitoneum and dorsolithotomy position TBG inclination (either &#x0003e;30&#x000b0; or &#x0003c;30&#x000b0;) was made randomly using a computer-generated random number table and to facilitate the fall of bowels away from the pelvic organs and proper exposure of uterus and surrounding structure.</p><p>At the completion of surgery, residual neuro-muscular blockade was antagonized at train-of-four ratio &#x0003e;0.7 with neostigmine 0.05 mg/kg and glycopyrrolate 0.01 mg/kg intravenously and patients were extubated in awake condition. After recovery, patients were extubated and shifted to postanesthesia care unit (PACU). Postoperative analgesia was provided with diclofenac suppository 100 mg per rectally. Before discharge from the surgical PACU, all patients were assessed regarding intra-operative recall. Patients were again enquired about any recall after 24 h in the postoperative period.</p><p>At the beginning of the operative procedure, when patients were in the supine position, monitoring was initiated and baseline hemodynamic parameters were recorded. After induction, intubation, and pneumoperitoneum, Hemodynamic parameters and BIS values were recorded. Intra-operative monitoring was performed every 30 min up to 120 min. Finally, before removal of 10 mm port in supine position the values were recorded. Entire laparoscopic dissection (lateral attachments of the uterus, the round ligaments, the infundibulopelvic ligaments and fallopian tubes are desiccated with bipolar forceps) and vault closure by intra-corporeal suturing were completed within 150 min. The table positioning and measurement of angulations was made with help of trigonometric table and done by a resident doctor completely unaware of the hemodynamic parameters and BIS value. Apart from these monitoring, other parameters such as urine output, end tidal carbon dioxide was also noted down throughout the period of the anesthesia. All the patients were closely observed continuously throughout the operative procedure for any untoward events like bradycardia and hypotension. Appearance of any of these adverse situations, were managed promptly with adequate and appropriate measures.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Assuming average BIS level just before the pneumoperitoneum as 50 (as under GA it ranges between 40 and 60), we decided to detect a difference of 10% (i.e., 5), at the <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 level, with a probability of detecting a difference this large, if it exists, of 80% (1-&#x003b2; = 0.80).
