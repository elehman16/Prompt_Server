to broadly review the use of ablative lasers (Er:YAG and CO2) in the treatment of
melasma, presenting the level of evidence of studies published to date. A total of 75
patients were enrolled in four case series studies (n=39), one controlled clinical
trial (n=6) and one randomized controlled clinical trial (n=30). Studies on the
Er:YAG laser showed better results with the use of short square-shaped pulses, which
determined low rates of post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation and long-lasting
maintenance of results. Likewise, studies on the CO2 laser proved the benefits of
short pulse duration along with low-density energy. Post-treatment maintenance with
the use of antipigmenting creams was necessary and effective to sustain long-term
results. Ablative lasers may represent another useful and effective tool against
melasma. Postinflammatory hyperpigmentation and difficulty in sustaining long-term
results still represent the main limitations to a broader use of ablative lasers.
Based on actual evidence, the use of this technology should be restricted to patients
with recalcitrant disease. Further studies will help establish optimal laser
parameters and treatment regimens.</p></abstract><trans-abstract xml:lang="pt"><p>O melasma representa desordem pigmentar de dif&#x000ed;cil tratamento. O presente estudo tem

disruption of the skin pigmentary system. It affects mainly Asian and Latin women most
frequently aged 30 to 55 years. Lesions are often light brown to blackish macules of
irregular but sharp borders. They mainly affect areas chronically exposed to sun light
like the cheeks, forehead, temples, upper lip and chin. Many factors have been linked to
the appearance and worsening of melasma, although pregnancy, use of contraceptive pills
and exposure to UV radiation are frequently reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r01">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r02">2</xref></sup>
</p><p>Despite the fact that melasma is one of the most common reasons for women to seek
dermatological care, only a small number of drugs and procedures to treat this disorder
has been launched in the market in the last decade. Conventional treatments usually fail
to induce long-term remission, as is commonly seen with the use of first-line therapies
such as Kligman's formula.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r03">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r04">4</xref></sup> This fact has prompted the search for innovative treatments to manage the
disease. It is the case of non-ablative fractioned lasers, which have been established
to treat melasma after initial positive results by Rokhs &#x00026; Fitzpatrick (2005). These
results were later reproduced by others.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r05">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r08">8</xref></sup>
</p><p>Ablative lasers have also been sporadically used by many professionals to treat melasma,
although there is a lack of scientific data supporting this indication. The exact
mechanism of action of both ablative and non-ablative lasers is also unknown, although
many have been hypothesized.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r09">9</xref></sup>
</p><p>Therefore, the objective of this study is to present a review of available data from the
medical literature about the use of resurfacing ablative fractioned lasers (CO2 and
Er:YAG) to treat melasma. We also attempt to define the actual level of evidence for
their use. </p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><p>A broad search for original studies was made on Pubmed, Scielo, LILACS (Latin America
and Caribbean) and DOAJ (Directory of Open Access Journals) databases. The search was
done by crossing the primary key-words "melasma" and "chloasma" with the secondary terms
"Carbon Dioxide Laser" and "Erbium Doped Yttrium Aluminum Garnet Laser", as specified by
Medical Subject Headings (MesH). Once retrieved, all the studies were evaluated by one
of the authors for selection of only primary clinical studies (case report/series, case
control studies and clinical trials) developed with human subjects about the treatment
of melasma. Studies were then discussed and classified according to their level of
evidence as proposed by the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref></sup>
</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>After an individual review of all the studies retrieved, only six studies met the
selection criteria and were included for discussion. A total of 75 patients were
enrolled in the studies and were distributed among four case/series studies (CS,
<italic>n</italic>=39), one controlled clinical trial (CCT, <italic>n</italic>=6) and
one randomized controlled clinical trial (RCCT,<italic> n</italic>=30).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref></sup> Three , studies analyzed the CO2 laser, two analyzed the Er:YAG laser, and the
other investigated the Q-switched alexandrite (QSAL) laser, although one of them
involved the use of CO2 laser.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref></sup> The study by Nouri et al. (1999) was also compiled as a case series study given
both its small sample and small area treated, which did not allow for statistical
analysis or generalizability of results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref></sup>
</p><p>Nouri et al. (1999) first published a pilot study about the use of CO2 laser to treat
melasma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref></sup> Eight patients with Fitzpatrick skin prototype (FSP) IV to VI with dermal
melasma were pretreated with Kligman's formula from day 1 to 14. Subjects were then
randomly assigned to receive treatment in a melasma spot area of 1cm<sup>2</sup>. One
group was treated with CO2 laser alone, whereas the other group received combination
therapy (first pass CO2 laser, followed by a second pass with QSAL). The authors stated
that the combination laser was highly effective since treatment determined complete
resolution inside the area treated and maintenance of results at 24-week follow-up.
Level of evidence: IV. </p><p>A split-face study designed by Angsuwarangsee et al. (2000) evaluated the efficacy of
QSAL laser isolated and in combination with CO2 laser to treat facial melasma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref></sup> Six female Thai patients with FSP II to V and refractory melasma participated in
the study. Only facial sides receiving combined therapy showed statistically-improved
maintenance in both Melasma Area Severity Index (MASI) and Melanin Index (MI), measured
by reflectance spectrometry, at 6 months follow-up (p=0.02 for both); however,
statistical analysis failed to show significant differences between treatments at that
time (p=0.08), formerly a reflection of the small sample studied. On the other hand,
patients with FPS IV and V showed transient postinflammatory hyperpigmentation in both
sides treated. Level of evidence: III. </p><p>Trelles et al. (2010) developed the most recent randomized controlled clinical trial
available in the literature comparing CO2 laser with traditional Kligman's formula.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref></sup> Thirty female patients with melasma, mean age of 38 years, FSP II-IV, were
randomly allocated to three groups. Group A received post-procedure treatment for 15
days with Kligman's formula followed by maintenance topical cream program (hydroquinone
2%, kojic acid, glycolic acid); group B, only CO2 laser fractional resurfacing using
high power, fixed pulse width and low frequency; and group C, both laser and maintenance
topical cream program. Subjects of all three groups received pre-intervention treatment
with antipigmenting topical cream for a period of 16 days. The satisfaction index and
overall efficacy in groups A, B and C were 100% at month one in all groups, but
progressively decreased in further assessments, except for group C, in which better
scores were maintained throughout. MASI score was assessed by blinded evaluators using
standard photographs. It showed a statistically significant improvement in group C
compared to A and B at six and 12 months follow-up (p&#x0003c;.001, for both). The study
presented a suitable methodology regarding randomization, blinding and appropriate
control group. Level of evidence: II. </p><p>A report of the case of a 59-year old woman with melasma treated with CO2 laser was also
recently published by Neeley et al. (2010).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref></sup> The patient had FSP V and a refractory malar dermal melasma. She had been
irresponsive to previous 17 sessions of non-ablative fractional lasers (1320, 1440 and
1550nm) as well as to topical treatment. The patient underwent seven sessions of CO2
laser over a period of 10 months, with a reasonable improvement in skin pigmentation and
texture. No follow-up comments were presented by the authors. Level of evidence: IV. </p><p>No controlled clinical trial about the treatment of melasma with Er:YAG laser has been
found in the literature. However, a well-conducted case series study was developed by
Wanitphakdeedecha et al. (2009) in Thailand. The study involved 20 female patients with
epidermal melasma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref></sup> All the patients were treated monthly for a total of two treatments with an
Er:YAG laser set at square pulse parameters. This measure aimed to minimize nonspecific
heating of the surrounding tissues by avoiding the slow rise and the longer fall of
laser pulse power commonly observed in conventional laser technology platforms. The
patients were evaluated by MI measurement and were also clinically evaluated using a
visual analog scale and MASI scoring system at baseline and 1, 2, and 4 months
postoperative. Both MI and MASI score showed significant improvement at 2-month, but not
at 1-and 4-month follow-up visits (p&#x0003e;0.05). Furthermore, clinical improvement
assessed by blinded dermatologists showed that only 15% of patients sustained
improvement greater than 50% after 4 months of follow-up. Level of evidence: III. </p><p>Another recent case series study using Er:YAG laser was developed by Manaloto et al.
(2009).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref></sup> Ten female patients with FPS II to V presenting with facial melasma unresponsive
to previous therapy of bleaching creams and chemical peels were selected to receive
full-face skin resurfacing with Er:YAG laser. No pre-intervention treatment was offered
to the patients. There was marked improvement of melasma immediately after the laser
procedure; however, between 3 and 6 weeks postoperative, all patients exhibited
post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation demanding intervention with daily use of 20% azelaic
acid and glycolic acid peels biweekly. At six months postoperative, universal clinical
improvement of pigmentation was observed as well as reduction in MASI and melanin
reflectance spectrometry measurements (p=.027). Level of evidence: III. </p><p>A summary of laser parameters and side effects reported in the studies is presented in

These cells produce a higher number of mature dendritic melanosomas transferring them to
keratinocytes, which ultimately leads to skin hyperpigmentation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r02">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r03">3</xref></sup> The distribution of melanin pigments in the skin layers is an important factor
related to the success or failure of melasma treatment. This is particularly important
in cases of mixed melasma, in which removal of dermal pigment has been found to be
strongly difficult with standard therapies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r02">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r03">3</xref></sup>
</p><p>Ablative lasers, by targeting water, can indirectly reduce melanin deposits from both
the epidermis and dermis. Due to tissue vaporization, the number of abnormal epidermal
melanocytes and melanin content are reduced, as probably occurs with the amount of
melanin deposited into dermal melanophages occasionally reached by laser beams. Also,
during the healing process, the epidermis is regenerated from the appendiceal units;
therefore, it is believed that the inward migration of new melanocytes to the epidermis
is unable to produce localized areas of hyperpigmentation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref></sup> Nevertheless, a challenge still remains. Reducing residual thermal damage, which
represents the mainstay for the development of postinflammatory hyperpigmentation
commonly observed after ablative laser treatments, is difficult.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref></sup> Pulses shorter than thermal relaxing time of the epidermis are important to
minimize this risk.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref></sup>
</p><p>Initial studies on the use of CO2 laser to treat melasma were developed using
non-fractional technology and showed a high rate (50%) of postinflammatory
hyperpigmentation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref></sup> In the same studies, combined treatment with QSAL targeting dermal melanin was
found to increase treatment efficacy,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref></sup> but controversially failed to prevent postinflammatory hyperpigmentation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref></sup> These poor results were quite discouraging as many years passed until the
development of new studies addressing the issue.</p><p>Ultimately, a new study was developed in 2010 using fractional CO2 laser, a technology
that is already well established for skin resurfacing treatments. Trelles et al. opted
to use high power energy (150mJ/pulse) combined with short pulse duration (350ms) and
low-density energy (11.3J/cm2) in order to minimize residual thermal damage which could
trigger pigmentation rebound.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref></sup> This approach promoted deep but narrow non-selective ablation zones also capable
of reaching dermal melanophages. The results of the combination therapy group (laser and
antipigmenting cream) were quite impressive, with maintenance of improvement after a
12-month follow-up. These data, along with the poor results obtained by the laser-only
group, reinforce the major role of antipigmenting cream in preventing recurrence of
melasma. In fact, its use was considered mandatory by the authors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref></sup>
</p><p>The same principle of minimizing residual thermal damage was used by Wanitphakdeedecha
et al. when studying the use of Er:YAG laser to treat melasma. The short square-shaped
pulse (300&#x000b5;s) produced more controlled heating and minimized post-inflammatory
hyperpigmentation when compared to conventional short-pulsed Er:YAG.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref></sup> The mechanism of action proposed by the authors involved ablation depth limited
to the epidermis, probably eliminating excess epidermal melanin as well as stimulating
epidermal turnover.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref></sup> However, even such superficial ablation wasn't enough to reduce
post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. </p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Both Er:YAG and CO2 lasers have already been studied in the treatment of facial melasma,
although only a small number of patients were enrolled in clinical trials. To date,
studies have shown that short pulses along with low-density energy seem to be rational
parameters to target melasma because they limit residual thermal damage and the risk of
post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. Both Er:YAG and CO2 laser were safe to treat
patients even with high skin phototypes. High rates of post-inflammatory
hyper-pigmentation were adequately targeted with the use of antipigmenting agents, which
makes them mandatory. No final conclusions can be made about the advantages between
