Reduced dynamic balance and mobility following stroke, or &#x02018;walking balance&#x02019;, is associated with reduced self-efficacy and restrictions in daily living activities, community integration, and quality of life. Targeted training of movement speeds required to effectively regain balance has been largely overlooked in post-stroke rehabilitation. The Fast muscle Activation and Stepping Training (FAST) program incorporates fast functional movements known to produce bursts of muscle activation essential for stepping and regaining standing balance effectively. The purpose of this study is to: 1) compare the effectiveness of an outpatient FAST program to an active control outpatient physiotherapy intervention in improving walking balance following stroke, and 2) explore potential mechanisms associated with improvements in walking balance.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>This will be an assessor-blinded, parallel group randomized controlled trial design. Sixty participants (30 per group) who have sustained a stroke within the previous six months will be randomly assigned with stratification for lower limb motor recovery to receive twelve 45-minute 1:1 physiotherapy intervention sessions over 6 &#x02013; 10&#x000a0;weeks in an outpatient setting of either: 1) FAST intervention - systematic and progressive practice of fast squatting and stepping exercises, or 2) active control - conventional physiotherapy directed at improving balance and mobility that includes no targeted fast movement training. The same blinded research physiotherapist will assess outcomes at three time points: 1) baseline (prior to intervention), 2) follow up (within one week post-intervention); and 3) retention (one month post-intervention). The primary outcome is dynamic balance assessed using the Community Balance and Mobility Scale. We will also assess fast and self-selected walking speed, balance self-efficacy, and the ability to respond to internal and external perturbations to balance and associated changes in postural muscle activation.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The targeted training of fast functional movements in the FAST program is expected to improve walking balance following stroke compared to the active control intervention.

Dynamic balance and mobility or &#x02018;walking balance&#x02019; can be described as the ability to control the centre of mass (COM) within the base of support to remain upright during ambulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and encompasses a range of walking-related tasks which challenge the balance system. The impact of diminished dynamic balance can be significant for stroke survivors. The resulting mobility limitations are associated with decreased self-efficacy, loss of independence, and restrictions in activities of daily living, community integration, and quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>People following stroke struggle to produce sufficient power (the product of force and speed) with their paretic muscles; deficits in speed of movement are well-documented after stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. It has been suggested that power may be more important than absolute force production in functional mobility tasks, and velocity of movement may be instrumental to counteract potentially destabilizing forces exerted on an individual&#x02019;s COM by gravity and environmental interactions (external perturbations) as well as voluntary movements (internal perturbations) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Modest perturbations to quiet stance can be accommodated using an inverted pendulum model of balance control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] in which the ankle musculature plays a pivotal role in the maintenance of stance, while activation of muscles around the hips is essential in responding to larger perturbations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], particularly if a step is required to maintain balance - termed a stepping reaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. There may be a greater reliance on stepping behaviours to avoid a fall after stroke than in healthy individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]; however, impairments in paretic muscle activation make it difficult for these individuals to step with sufficient speed, coordination and amplitude to effectively to regain their balance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>Current clinical practice guidelines advocate task-oriented exercise programs involving the practice of &#x02018;real life tasks&#x02019; following stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], but specificity of task practice with respect to the speed required for postural reactions has received relatively little attention. A single session of fast functional squat and stepping training in stroke survivors has been found to improve paretic muscle activation and postural responses during an internal perturbation balance task after the exercises [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. A recent case series reported improvements in walking balance that were retained for one year following a 12-session stepping retraining program in community-dwelling individuals with chronic stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. These changes in balance were accompanied by an increase in participation in meaningful activities in the community, and improvements in the movement kinematics of stepping reactions. These findings suggest that Fast muscle Activation and Stepping Training (FAST) may be an effective approach to improve walking balance following stroke.</p><p>The primary objective of this assessor-blinded, parallel design, randomized controlled trial is to investigate the effectiveness of an outpatient FAST program commenced within the first six months following stroke compared to an active control intervention of conventional outpatient physiotherapy (active control) that includes no targeted fast movement training for improving walking balance. As many people fall in the first few months after discharge from inpatient rehabilitation, this was thought to be an important window for this balance intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The primary hypothesis is that improvements in walking balance (as measured with the Community Balance and Mobility Scale, CB&#x00026;M [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]) will be larger following 12 sessions of FAST intervention compared to 12 sessions of active control intervention. The secondary hypothesis is that CB&#x00026;M scores will continue to be higher in the FAST group compared to the active control group one month following the intervention. Another aim of this study is to explore potential mechanisms associated with improvements in walking balance including; improvements in walking speed, balance self-efficacy, ability to respond to internal and external perturbations to balance and associated changes in postural muscle activation. Our <italic>mechanistic hypotheses</italic> are that compared to the active control intervention; the FAST retraining will result in:<list list-type="alpha-lower"><list-item><p>Increased fast and self-selected natural walking speed (gait assessment);</p></list-item><list-item><p>Reduced postural sway (balance perturbation assessment);</p></list-item><list-item><p>Improved timing and amplitude of muscle activation (EMG onset timing, burst area and slope) during balance perturbations and gait;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Increased balance self-efficacy (using Activities-specific Balance Confidence (ABC) scale).</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>The study is a single-blind, parallel design, randomized controlled trial, with the assessor blinded to the group allocation of the participants (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

The physiotherapist will ask them if they are interested in learning more about the study and, if interested, ask them if they will give consent to have the research coordinator review their chart to confirm eligibility. After reviewing their chart, the research coordinator will approach the prospective participant to describe the study in more detail or explain why they are not eligible. The research coordinator will review the letter of explanation and the consent form with the prospective participant and answer any questions. The research coordinator will return at least 24&#x000a0;hours later to obtain written consent before participating. Family members may be present to assist if there are any language barriers. All patients admitted with a primary diagnosis of stroke will be screened by their physiotherapists at two hospitals using a screening checklist. In accordance with CONSORT guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], the number of screened patients who are ineligible (and the reasons for ineligibility) or who are potentially eligible but are not interested in the study will be recorded.</p><p>To optimize recruitment, all members of the stroke rehabilitation teams at each recruitment site including physiotherapy managers, site coordinators, intake clerks and physiotherapists will be engaged in refining the processes for screening and recruitment specific to their organizations; strategies that are tailored to the sites will be developed collaboratively including reminders, flow charts for processes and communication, and screening forms designed to minimize burden for the site staff and their patients. These processes will be reviewed and revised based on feedback and will be sustained by onsite coordinators who serve as local leaders and champions for the study in collaboration with the research coordinator.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Group allocation and data management</title><p>Data will be managed using web-based software (EmPower Health Research, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.empowerhealthresearch.ca/">http://www.empowerhealthresearch.ca/</ext-link>). Upon registration, the software assigns each participant a unique identification number. Upon screening eligibility, providing signed consent and completion of the baseline assessment, participants will be randomized by the research coordinator using the integrated randomization software, &#x0201c;Integration&#x0201d;. This software protects allocation concealment by ensuring screening is complete and the participant is eligible prior to randomization as well as preventing multiple allocation of the same participant or unjustified removal of participants post-randomization. Participants will be stratified by their (combined leg and foot &#x02013; affected limb only) CMSA score (&#x02264;8 or &#x02265;9) to force a balance between groups in the motor recovery of the leg and foot. The randomization scheme is set up in permuted blocks of 2 and 4 to ensure a similar number of participants between groups and to prevent screening clinicians from guessing the next allocation. All outcome data will be entered into EmPower by the research coordinator, and the accuracy of data entry will be double-checked by a second person who will be blinded to participant group allocation. Research personnel who are to remain blind to group allocation (outcome assessors, data analysts) will not have access to the randomization form when they log into the database to enter data. The data management software contains an audit log that records the user with date and time stamps for all data entries, changes to data and explanations for changes. Data verification and the audit trail ensure high standards of data integrity and validity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Intervention</title><p>Participants in both intervention groups will receive 12 individual 45-minute physiotherapy sessions. These sessions are intended to be scheduled twice per week over a 6&#x000a0;week time frame. A pragmatic window will be set for completion of the 12 sessions within 10&#x000a0;weeks to accommodate interruptions (e.g. illness, vacations, etc.). This dosage is established firstly, to be consistent with the estimated dosage of regular out-patient physiotherapy following stroke reported by the two participating hospitals, thereby supporting the potential external validity of the study, and secondly, based on previous research reporting improvements in community- level balance and mobility (assessed by CB&#x00026;M score), and in movement kinematics following 12 sessions of stepping reaction training in individuals with chronic stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>FAST intervention program</title><p>The FAST intervention will involve the systematic and progressive practice of fast functional movements to retrain the rapid bursts of muscle activation and anticipatory postural adjustments of the leg and trunk muscles essential for regaining standing balance and community mobility activities (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].

Squats will be used as a warm up activity and to encourage more equal weight distribution between the paretic and non-paretic legs. As participants improve, this squatting task will be relatively easy to perform, and therefore more time within the intervention session will be spent performing the stepping activities.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Stepping</italic>: The progressive retraining of the quick automatic stepping responses required to re-establish balance following perturbations is the core element of the FAST intervention. The stepping training activities will be based on a previously published program used with community dwelling individuals following stroke, and adapted to the abilities of the subacute stroke participant group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Initially, participants will be permitted to take as many additional steps as required to regain their balance, but will later be instructed to stop their momentum within 2&#x02013;3 steps. This stepping activity elicits fast bursts of muscle activation in the stepping leg(s) and fast postural adjustments to alterations in balance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Step exercises will be performed with both legs in all directions (forward, backward and laterally to each side).</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Complementary activities</italic>: Finally, additional complementary activities will be provided to add challenge and variety for high level participants who quickly and easily complete the core step training program within the individual intervention sessions. These activities were selected as they were likely to evoke fast bursts of muscle activation and quick steps consistent with the goal of practicing fast lower limb movements. They will include the option of a 4-square exercise adapted from the clinical &#x02018;4-square test&#x02019; of stepping and change of direction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], and more challenging stepping and bounding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] activities.</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Active control program</title><p>Similar to the FAST intervention, the active control intervention will include activities tailored to the individual needs and goals of the participant to regain balance and mobility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The content of the active control physiotherapy intervention will include task-specific practice of standing balance and walking activities, as well as stretching, strengthening and endurance exercises. The main difference in the treatment between active control group and what might be delivered in regular out-patient physiotherapy is that there will be no specific training of fast stepping responses and no systematic training of fast over-ground walking (including treadmill training). These activities are not typically part of the conventional treatment provided at the two participating hospitals. Additionally, there will be no training of bounding, hopping or other exercises that emphasize high velocity contraction.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Concomitant care</title><p>During the study, participants will be advised not to undertake concomitant specific balance and mobility training or treatment. Participants will receive their other outpatient treatment programs (e.g. occupational therapy, speech-language therapy) and can engage freely in community-based activities that may include aqua-exercise, senior&#x02019;s activity programs, etc.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Intervention fidelity and monitoring of adverse events</title><p>Treatment physiotherapists who will be delivering the FAST and active control interventions will be provided with a treatment handbook outlining the intervention program. This material will be reviewed in a group training session with case examples and opportunities for discussion to provide feedback to refine and clarify the written materials. During the study, the research coordinator, an experienced physiotherapist and clinical researcher, will go to individual sites to facilitate the implementation of the proposed interventions, providing 1:1 guidance specific to the knowledge and beliefs of the treatment physiotherapists, their environment, and the needs of their participants while still ensuring the critical elements of the intervention are provided as planned [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Standardized recording forms (Additional files <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>) developed with feedback from the treatment physiotherapists will be used to record the content and duration of interventions provided to the participants. The number of repetitions of activities, the level of assistance (overhead harness, transfer belt), scheduling of practice (blocked, semi-random, random) and feedback (immediate, summary) will be recorded for each FAST intervention session.</p><p>Ongoing correspondence will be maintained with the treatment physiotherapists to ensure that the interventions are being provided as planned, to share information between treatment physiotherapists, and to further revise and clarify treatment information based on their feedback and experience. Audit and feedback based on the recorded treatment information will be used by the research coordinator to monitor and provide a post-hoc assessment of the FAST implementation fidelity in terms of primary measures of content (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) and minimum dosage (indicated in &#x02018;dosage&#x02019; for each activity, Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The performance target is for all FAST participants to be capable of performing the random nomination of lead leg activity (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, Activity 2d) with the support of a walking belt and standby assistance from a therapist by the end of the 12 sessions of intervention period. Similarly the content of the active control intervention will be audited and feedback will be provided in those instances where fast movement related interventions are documented. The individual onsite visits will be used to provide a formative assessment and feedback to the treatment physiotherapists regarding the extent to which the individual treatment sessions match with the intended intervention programs.</p><p>Participants entering the study will be warned that they may experience exercise-related muscle discomfort 24&#x02013;48 hours following the intervention sessions, as many participants will not have participated in vigorous physical activities recently. Any unanticipated or adverse events will be documented in accordance with the policies of the hospital site and recorded in the EmPower data base, with referral for appropriate medical follow up. As this is an effectiveness study, the interventions will be modified to accommodate co-existing conditions (e.g. ankle sprain) and emerging issues (e.g. recovery from an acute respiratory infection).</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Outcome assessment and data collection</title><p>A summary of the measures to be collected at four time points (enrolment, baseline, follow up and retention) is provided in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>.

The study design and the intervention parameters have been deliberately established to optimize the generalizability the FAST program to other outpatient stroke clinical settings. Unique to this study is the focus not only on clinical effectiveness, but also mechanistic outcomes to evaluate physiological changes in walking and balance performance as well as perceived balance self-efficacy.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec25"><title>Additional files</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12883_2014_187_MOESM1_ESM.docx" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>
