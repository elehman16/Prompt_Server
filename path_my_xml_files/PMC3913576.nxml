It was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency in 2008 for clinical use in adults with incomplete virologic suppression and resistance to multiple antiretroviral agents, including previous NNRTI, in combination with a ritonavir-boosted protease inhihitor (PI) <xref rid="pone.0084676-Thompson1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0084676-European1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p><p>The clinical recommendation for market authorization of etravirine was mainly based on the results of 2 pivotal phase 3 studies, DUET-1 and DUET-2 <xref rid="pone.0084676-Madruga1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0084676-Lazzarin1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. The etravirine-containing arm showed higher rates of viral suppression than the placebo arm, and the likelihood of virologic failure was correlated with the number of baseline NNRTI and nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) resistance mutations <xref rid="pone.0084676-Madruga1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0084676-Andries1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. In addition, patients taking etravirine, administered twice daily, tolerated the regimen well, and the magnitude of the adverse events observed during treatment suggests that etravirine has a favorable safety and tolerability profile <xref rid="pone.0084676-Madruga1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0084676-Lazzarin1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0084676-Katlama1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p><p>Since pharmacokinetic studies support the use of etravirine once daily <xref rid="pone.0084676-Molt1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0084676-Boffito1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, it appears to be a suitable option in antiretroviral simplification strategies. However, data on simplification with etravirine are lacking, and only 2 recently published studies have assessed switching from the NNRTI efavirenz to etravirine in virologically suppressed patients <xref rid="pone.0084676-Waters1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0084676-Nguyen1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Both studies showed the etravirine-containing regimen to be well tolerated and reported a significant improvement in efavirenz-related central nervous system symptoms. Nevertheless, we do not know whether patients with sustained undetectable HIV-1 RNA levels receiving a PI-based regimen can safely switch their current PI to etravirine. As nowadays antiretroviral treatment should be continued indefinitely, different effective and safe options, other than PI-based combinations, are required, mainly for those subjects suffering PI- or ritonavir-related toxicities or reporting an uncomfortable dosin Schedule with the regimen (twice daily dose, use of ritonavir&#x02026;).</p><p>We designed a pilot study to test the efficacy and safety of switching from a PI to etravirine as an antiretroviral switching strategy in patients with a suppressed viral load. Our approach was based on the high antiviral potency and high genetic barrier to resistance of etravirine, as well as the favorable safety profile and patient-friendly dosing (once daily dose and dissolved in water).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0084676.s002">Checklist S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0084676.s001">Protocol S1</xref>.

For therapy to be switched to etravirine, patients had to fulfill at least 1 of the following criteria: dyslipidemia (low-density lipoprotein [LDL] cholesterol &#x0003e;130 mg/dL or triglycerides &#x0003e;150 mg/dL, according our reference laboratory, or current use of lipid-lowering agents), antiretroviral-related gastrointestinal disturbances, or a repeatedly expressed dissatisfaction with the current antiretroviral regimen.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Randomization, Follow-up, and Assessment</title><p>Participants were randomly assigned in a ratio of 1&#x02236;1 to switch from the PI to etravirine (400 mg/day, dissolved in water; ETR group) or to continue with the same PI-based regimen (control group).

Briefly, NNRTIs were non-inferior (in terms of antiviral potency) to PIs used in simplification strategies. Additionally, the lipid profile improved in most patients, especially with nevirapine <xref rid="pone.0084676-Martinez2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0084676-Barreiro1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.

The main reasons for switching from PIs in the clinical practice include PI-related laboratory toxicity (mainly metabolic abnormalities), clinical disorders (mainly gastrointestinal), and dosing-related conditions. In our study, the main reasons for switching were dyslipemia (almost half of all patients) and low satisfaction with the previous regimen (twice-daily dosing and the need to store ritonavir in a refrigerator) (around 40%). The low rate of patients who switched because of gastrointestinal disorders (11.6%) indicates that current regimens are generally well tolerated. The most frequently switched PI was atazanavir/ritonavir (56%), since, at the initiation of the study, ritonavir had to be kept in a refrigerator (a complaint from many patients).</p><p>Although this is a pilot study, our results revel that the switch from a PI to etravirine maintains virological suppression after 48 weeks of follow-up. No patients experienced viral rebound in either treatment arm. Moreover, CD4 T-cell counts increased slightly in patients who switched to etravirine. Although this increase was not statistically significant, it could be clinically relevant in some patients, especially in those with low CD4 T-cell counts.</p><p>As expected, and consistent with previous data for the effect of etravirine on lipid profile <xref rid="pone.0084676-Madruga1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0084676-Lazzarin1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0084676-Nelson1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0084676-Ftkenheuer1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, the switch from a PI to etravirine led to an improvement in metabolic parameters. After 48 weeks, a significantly more favorable metabolic profile (decreased levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, glycemia and no patients with grade 3&#x02013;4 dyslipidemia at week 48) was observed in patients who switched to etravirine than in those who continued with a ritonavir-boosted PI. This improvement in metabolic parameters, including glycemia, was specially observed in those patients who switch to etravirine because of dyslipidemia, and especially marked in those patients who switched from lopinavir/ritonavir. Therefore, a favorable lipid profile is likely to reflect a class-wide association <xref rid="pone.0084676-Tohyama1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0084676-Negredo3" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>.

Only 1 patient interrupted the study prematurely because of toxicity (grade 1 diarrhea), which eventually did not seem to be associated with etravirine. A further 2 patients (1 in each arm) interrupted the study for other reasons (simplification and voluntary discontinuation). No grade 3&#x02013;4 drug-related adverse events were reported in any patient receiving etravirine. As well, no significant increases in liver enzymes were recorded with the use of etravirine, even in patients with hepatitis C or B coinfection.</p><p>As patient satisfaction is generally high with current antiretroviral combinations, it is usually difficult to demonstrate differences after a switch. Among our patients, however, satisfaction improved significantly after switching to etravirine (even though the subgroup of patients evaluated was small), specifically in those with gastrointestinal disturbances at baseline. Nonetheless, some patients did not consider 4 tablets of etravirina (used in the study) plus the rest of the nucleoside backbone a simplified regimen. Marketing of 200-mg etravirine tablets has recently been approved in North America and in Europe. This new formulation will facilitate dosing and, consequently, patient acceptance and satisfaction. In addition, plasma concentrations of etravirine, administered once daily dissolved in water, were in the same range to those observed in subjects receiving undispersed etravirine tablets <xref rid="pone.0084676-Molt1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0084676-Boffito1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. As well, all patients showed etravirine concentrations above the protein-binding adjusted 50% effective concentration 4 ng/mL. This data support the safety use of once daily dosing for etravirine, and the possibility of dispersing the tablets in order to enhance treatment convenience.</p><p>The limited sample size of the study does not permit to strongly state our conclusions but this pilot study provides initial data about the use of an etravirine-based regimen as a possible strategy in subjects with PI-associated toxicities or dissatisfied with their regimens. Additionally, this exploratory study allows us to establish guidelines for future studies with more patients. The randomized and controlled study designs, however, are both strengths of the study that becomes our results in useful information.</p><p>In conclusion, this randomized trial seems to demonstrate the maintenance of antiviral efficacy 48 weeks after switching from a PI to etravirine. Our results also confirm the favorable safety profile of etravirine, which has a lipid-friendly profile that is similar to that of the other commercialized NNRTIs and better than that of PI-containing regimens. Consequently, etravirine could be considered as an alternative in virologically suppressed HIV-infected patients receiving a PI-based antiretroviral combination and who have not experienced failure with other NNRTI-based regimens, mainly in those with metabolic disturbances.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0084676.s001"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0084676.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0084676.s002"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0084676.s002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0084676-Thompson1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
