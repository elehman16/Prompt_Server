Introduction</title><p>The famous French surgeon Dr. Lapeyronie described the first details about a disease from nodular diseases of cave bodies that cause deviation that it was named in his honor Peyronie&#x02019;s disease (<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">Iacono et al., 1993</xref>). The disease is almost synonymous with the kind of penile fibromatos disease affects one percent of white men and therefore considered a difficulty for the urologist and is considered a common disease (<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">Bella et al., 2007</xref>). Peyronie&#x02019;s disease with two definitions of fibromatos and penile curvature and erectile dysfunction mostly occur in men aged 40 to 60 (<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">Gonzalez-Cadavid, 2009</xref>), but like any other disease in the area of empirical sciences exceptionally analyzed and reported in younger men (<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">De Young &#x00026; Bella, 2010</xref>). The main complaint that makes a visit to the clinic, is of creating fibromatos nodules on the upper surface of the penile, which leads to the curvature and deviation of penile especially during erection, while create no problem with urinary in terms of urine (<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">Pohlers et al., 2009</xref>). The main problem created by the diversion is disruption during intercourse, pain during sexual intercourse and abnormality in rhythm of sexual movements (<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">El-Sakka et al., 1997a</xref>). Fibromatos nodular disease and Peyronie&#x02019;s disease is related to the connective tissue and elastic diseases and the overall course of the disease is divided into two stages. First phase is characterized by the onset of disease in inflammatory and active phase of the disease and with penile pain during intercourse without any diversion or obstruction disorder in the urinary tract (<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">El-Sakka et al., 1997b</xref>; <xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">Moreland et al., 1995</xref>). The aetiology of this stage is associated with crescent-shaped superficial vein thrombosis and also deep veins that its diagnosis is known by a typical hypodense region in the septum or in the posterior tunica of penile (<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">Cutroneo, 2007</xref>). This process takes about 9 to 15 months to reach the second stage in the natural history of the disease, including fibrosis stage (<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">Kuang et al., 2007</xref>). In this stage the first phenomenon is the formation of connective tissue plaques. Establishing the nature of the fibrous tunica albuginea creates less elasticity and so distortion and pain during intercourse in the penile (<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">Wagenseil &#x00026; Mecham, 2007</xref>). Only a small number of drugs based on the specifications based on evidence have tested and two products one as oral (pentoxifylline) and the other as injection of nodules (verapamil) have shown relatively good therapeutic effect in the natural history of the disease (<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">Stewart, 1994</xref>; <xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">Akkus et al., 1997</xref>). TGF-B1 has underlying role in the pathogenesis of Peyronie&#x02019;s disease and elastin and collagen metabolism (<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">Deree et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">Hung et al., 2008</xref>). Pentoxifylline, which is an antagonist of TGF-B, in doses of 100 micro moles per liter prevent the proliferation of fibroblasts (<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">Lin, 2005</xref>). TGF-B1 will perform elastogen mobility and deposition of collagen I fibers in TADF&#x02019;s (fibroblasts derived from tunica albuginea) in a given time and dose (<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">Ng, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">Valente et al., 2003)</xref> Pretreatment with pentoxifylline decreases significantly elastogen by TGF-B1 and deposition of collagen fibers in TADF&#x02019;s in people with and without Peyronie&#x02019;s disease (<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">Brant, Dean, &#x00026; Lue, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">Lin, 2005</xref>). Collagen I synthesis in patients&#x02019; tunica with Peyronie who were not treated is more than the tunica of normal people. (<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">Mulhall et al., 2005)</xref> And pentoxifylline may reduce collagen synthesis (<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">Lin, 2004</xref>). This effect is seen in the tunica of patients with Peyronie&#x02019;s disease and cannot be seen in the tunica of healthy people (<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">Ten Dijke &#x00026; Hill, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">Derynck &#x00026; Zhang, 2003</xref>). This indicates the differences between normal cells tunica and tunica of patients with Peyronie&#x02019;s disease (<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">Hirai et al., 2007</xref>). Making elastin and collagen is stimulated by TGF-B1 in TADF&#x02019;s that causes Peyronie&#x02019;s disease phenotype formation (<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">Hassoba, El-Sakka, &#x00026; Lue, 2005</xref>). Pretreatment with pentoxifylline reduces deposition of collagen fibers and elastogen in TADF&#x02019;s that are exposed to TGF-B1 that this effect is a useful role of pentoxifylline in the treatment of Peyronie&#x02019;s disease (Bivalacqua et al., 2000; <xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">Mulhall et al., 2002</xref>). An intralesional injecting therapy involves a direct injection into the plaque. In this way to achieve a high local concentration by avoiding systemic side effects can be created. No medication should help solve or at least soften the plaque. Signs should either improve or disappear entirely but it should be noted that each injection is painful as well as we cannot rule out the damage resulting from the injection of an inflammatory process. It is believed that calcium channel blockers such as verapamil by calcium-dependent secretion of macromolecules from fibroblasts reduced collagen production and enhances collagenase activity, also inhibits the synthesis and secretion of fibronectin (<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">Del Carlo, Cole, &#x00026; Levine, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">Szardening-Kirchner et al., 2009</xref>). In a study conducted in a number of patients with Peyronie after receiving a dozen sessions of intralesional verapamil (every two weeks at a rate of ten milligrams) shows one hundred percent pain reduction and thirty percent plaque reduction and seventy-six percent penile deviation regression and seventy-two percent improvement in sexual activity of patients (<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">Hoff, Perkins, &#x00026; Davidson, 1999</xref>). In another study performed on patients with Peyronie which amounted to four hundred milligrams of pentoxifylline orally twice a day generally received thirty-seven percent of positive therapeutic response (<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">Cantor, Keller, Mandl, &#x00026; Turino, 1987</xref>). But, effective studies have not been conducted yet in connection to efficiency and effectiveness of these two drugs and their combination in the control of symptoms and stop or slow the disease process and improve symptoms. Hence, we investigated the effects of two injectable verapamil and oral pentoxifylline and the combination of these two drugs in the treatment of the amount of pain, the size of the plaque, the amount of circumflexion, erectile dysfunction and the control of progress of the disease and improvement of symptoms of peyronie&#x02019;s disease. It also appears that receiving a combination of two pentoxifylline with mechanism of reduced collagen fiber deposition and elastogen and intralesional verapamil with mechanism of inhibition of synthesis and secretion of fibronectin and also decreasing collagen production and increasing the activity of collagenase had a greater improving effects to receive each drugs in the treatment protocol of Peyronie&#x02019;s disease alone. At the end of the study and statistical survey, if possible, an appropriate treatment and suggestions to improve treatment process that is providing presently which focuses on the second stage of the course that has stronger and more serious malignant changes.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-2"><title>2. Materials and Methods</title><p>In this empirical study a total of 90 patients with signs and symptoms of the peyronie&#x02019;s disease were enrolled in the age range 40 to 70 years. Excluding parameters are including patients that taken treatment, surgery, trauma, investing tool, radiotherapy, or underwent a treatment protocol as well as patients who have diabetes or taking alcohol or other significant underlying disease other than Peyronie were also excluded from the study. Then patients were randomly divided into 3 groups of 30 and one oral pentoxifylline group at the dose of 400 mg three times a day and the next group intralesional verapamil (10 m every other week for up to 12 sessions) injected and finally, the third group received both treatments in combination. Then the co-trainer, who was trained about Peyronie&#x02019;s disease and the study, over the course of 6 months&#x02019; treatment protocol, plaque size and nature change, deviation or curvature of the penile, pain, level of erectile dysfunction and changes in sexual function of patients in both groups were asked and viewed and raw data was recorded. The recorded data were analyzed and the results were recorded. In our study, the recovery rate of variables (erectile dysfunction, size of curvature, plaque size and pain) was considered before and after intervention. Improvement in erectile dysfunction: if the rate of improvement in erectile dysfunction before and after the intervention based on IIEF was more than 10 score was considered as improvement in erectile dysfunction, and if it was lower was considered as a failure to improve erectile dysfunction. Curve reduction: if the curve reduction rate before and after the intervention was greater than10 &#x000b0; was considered as the curve reduction. Plaque size reduction: if reduction in the size of the plaque before and after the intervention was greater than 3 mm was considered as a reduction in plaque size. Pain reduction: if the pain reduction rate before and after the intervention was more than 2 score was considered as pain reduction. For data analysis of this study Spss 16 software was used (<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">Majazi-Dalfard et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec1-3"><title>3.

Discussion</title><p>Peyronie&#x02019;s disease with two definitions of fibromatos and penile curvature and erectile dysfunction mostly occur in men aged 40 to 60 (<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">Gonzalez-Cadavid, 2009</xref>). The main complaint that makes a visit to the clinic, is of creating fibromatos nodules on the upper surface of the penile, which leads to the curvature and deviation of penile especially during erection, while create no problem with urinary in terms of urine (<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">Pohlers, 2009</xref>). But, effective studies have not been conducted yet in connection to efficiency and effectiveness of these two drugs and their combination in the control of symptoms and stop or slow the disease process and improve symptoms. Hence, we investigated the effects of two injectable verapamil and oral pentoxifylline and the combination of these two drugs in the treatment of the amount of pain, the size of the plaque, the amount of circumflexion, erectile dysfunction and the control of progress of the disease and improvement of symptoms of peyronie&#x02019;s disease. In this study a total of 90 patients with signs and symptoms of the peyronie&#x02019;s disease diagnosis in the age range 40 to 70 years were studied. In 30 patients who received pentoxifylline, 26.7% curvature reduction, 30% plaque size reduction, 46.7% the recovery of erectile dysfunction and 73.3% pain reduction was reported. Each of these cases were in patients who used verapamil was 36.7%, 33.3%, 66.7% and 76.6%, respectively, in patients, who used verapamil and pentoxifylline, curvature reduction was 36.7%, plaque size reduction was 33.3%, the recovery of erectile dysfunction was 86.7% and pain reduction was 80%. According to the results there is no significant difference between the two drugs used and their function on Peyronie&#x02019;s disease in terms of curvature reduction, plaque size reduction and pain reduction. However, there was a significant difference between the recovery rate of erectile dysfunction in patients who used verapamil, compared with patients who had been taking pentoxifylline alone with studies conducted by <xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">Safarinejad et al. (2009)</xref> that analyzed the efficacy and the safety of extended-release pentoxifylline (PTX-SR) in the treatment of patients with basic course chronic Peyronie&#x02019;s disease. Overall, 36.9% of patients who received PTX-SR had a positive response to treatment. While only 4.5% in the control group stated this. Improvement of erectile dysfunction was reported 34%, plaque size reduction 25%, pain reduction 89.2% and curvature reduction 40% and thus extended-release pentoxifylline has average effect in the treatment of basic course chronic Peyronie&#x02019;s disease that is consistent with findings of our study. In our study pentoxifylline compared with oral administration of pentoxifylline with verapamil had less effect. In another study by <xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">Shindel et al. (2009)</xref> had been finally concluded, as regards metabolism and production of collagen and elastin affect regulatory TGF-B1 at TADF cells, the inhibitory effect of pentoxifylline on TGF-B1 causes reduction in the secretion and production of elastin and collagen and these suggestive changes are the beneficial role of pentoxifylline in the treatment of Peyronie&#x02019;s disease, is consistent. In a study that was conducted by <xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">Levine et al. (2002)</xref> as a result of intra-plaque injection is an effective treatment in reducing pain and curvature and improve sexual activity and very low rate of complications in the treatment of Peyronie&#x02019;s disease that the complications observed in our study in patients treated with verapamil are as follows: Dizziness in 3 patients, weakness in 5 patients, and nausea in 2 patients and sweating in 7 patients, in the pentoxifylline reported side effects were: headache in 3 patients, nausea in 8 patients and vomiting in 4 patients was reported. In the comparison of these results with a study conducted by <xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">Levine et al. (2002)</xref> in terms of reducing pain and improving erectile dysfunction and fewer complications are consistent.</p><p>In our study, the softening of plaques was also investigated and the results showed that soft plaque in patients receiving pentoxifylline was 51% and in verapamil was 47% and in recipients simultaneously pentoxifylline and verapamil was 70%. Given that in our study improvement of symptoms of Peyronie&#x02019;s disease in the group receiving verapamil had no significant difference compared to pentoxifylline, taking pentoxifylline and verapamil simultaneously may improve symptoms of Peyronie&#x02019;s disease (erectile dysfunction, curvature rate, plaque size, pain) which was significant in terms of improvement of erectile dysfunction and can won more improvement by combination of these two drugs than prescribing pentoxifylline or verapamil.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="ref1"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Akkus</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Carrier</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Baba</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Hsu</surname><given-names>G.
