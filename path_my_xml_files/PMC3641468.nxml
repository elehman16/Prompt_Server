<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref> Standard treatment is surgery to remove the uterus, fallopian tubes and ovaries. In selected patients, retroperitoneal pelvic and/or aortic lymph nodes are removed to establish the extent of the cancer and assist in ongoing treatment choices. Total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH) has been proposed as an alternative to total abdominal hysterectomy (TAH) widely used by gynaecological cancer surgeons and has been tested in three randomised trials worldwide. Patients who had TLH instead of TAH for uterine cancer had better postsurgical quality of life (QoL), fewer complications and shorter hospital stay.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6 R7 R8">6&#x02013;8</xref> One study did show an incidence of major and minor surgical complications as similar in patients undergoing a TLH or TAH.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref> The aim of the research reported here is to identify how costs and health benefits will change with the adoption of TLH over TAH through laparotomy for the treatment of early stage endometrial cancer. A health services perspective is adopted and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) estimated. Information for this modelling study was available from the LACE trial.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Method</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Randomised controlled trial</title><p>The LACE trial is registered with clinicaltrials.gov (NCT00096408) and the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (CTRN12606000261516) and was approved by all relevant hospital and university human research ethics committees. A detailed description of the study including details of the two surgical approaches has been published previously.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref> Between October 2005 and June 2010, 760 patients were recruited through 1 of the 20 participating tertiary gynaecological oncology centres in Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong and Scotland. Women were eligible if they were aged 18&#x02005;years or older, with histologically confirmed endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium of any FIGO grade, and had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score of less than 2. Further inclusion criteria included imaging studies suggesting the absence of extra-uterine disease. Patients were excluded from the study if any of the following criteria were met: histological cell-type other than endometrioid on curettage, clinically advanced disease (stage II&#x02013;IV) or bulky lymph nodes on imaging, uterine size greater than 10&#x02005;weeks of gestation, estimated life expectancy of less than 6&#x02005;months, medically unfit for surgery, patient compliance or geographic proximity preventing adequate follow-up or unfit to complete QoL questionnaires. The FIGO criteria for stage (2009) were used. Randomisation using stratified permuted blocks was carried out centrally and independent from other study procedures through a web-based system at the University of Queensland. Randomisation was stratified according to treating centre and by grade of differentiation as taken from the endometrial biopsy/D&#x00026;C.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref> All surgeons on the trial had to be accredited by the trial management committee before being eligible to enrol patients. After informed consent was obtained, trial staff checked eligibility and received notification of the allocated treatment via the web-based case report system. Blinding was not possible due to ethical considerations and the nature of the treatment.</p><p>Primary outcomes from the LACE trial have been published<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref> and show the TLH and TAH groups were similar according to clinical and demographic factors and the incidence of intra-operative adverse events were comparable. The incidence of postoperative adverse events and serious adverse events was significantly higher in the TAH group compared to the TLH group. There were differences in the rates of lymph node dissection with 60.2% in the TAH group and 39.9% in the TLH group and this may influence adverse events and costs and the QoL outcomes. The average operating time was higher for TLH (132&#x02005;min) as compared to TAH (107&#x02005;min), but the median length of stay was lower for TLH (2&#x02005;days) as compared to TAH (5&#x02005;days). QoL outcomes were published for a subset of the participants and it show that in the early phase of recovery the TLH group had better QoL from baseline compared to the TAH group in all subscales of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G) V.4, except for emotional and social wellbeing. Some QoL advantages were still present up to 6&#x02005;months after surgery.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Cost-effectiveness analysis</title><p>A two-state Markov model was used to predict how a generalised population of patients transitioned into a state of DEAD from ALIVE for a modelled cohort of 1000 TAH and TLH patients during the 1825&#x02005;days or 5&#x02005;years postsurgery. Daily risks of death were estimated for either arm of the trial and applied to the two cohorts based on survival data reported by Walker <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref> This was a separate study of mortality risk from laparoscopy versus laparotomy for comprehensive surgical staging of uterine cancer and it revealed 5-year survival of 89.8% for patients randomly assigned to laparoscopy and 89.8% for patients randomly assigned to laparotomy. For each day of the model, a utility score was assigned to those in the ALIVE state based on the individual EQ-5D tariffs reported from trial participants. Values were collected presurgery and 1&#x02005;week, 4&#x02005;weeks, 3&#x02005;months and 6&#x02005;months postsurgery. The 6-month value was used for all days from 6 to 12&#x02005;months. After 12&#x02005;months, it was assumed that the QoL was similar for both groups and a mean score was used until day 1825. Health benefits arising in future time periods were discounted at 3% in line with recent guidelines. The costs of the two surgical treatments included theatre nursing costs, allocated by duration of procedure; all equipment and consumables used; and Medicare Benefits Schedule<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref> items for surgical and anaesthetics fees for abdominal and laparoscopic procedures. The costs of health services used in the 6&#x02005;months following surgery were consultations with doctors other than gynaecology oncology; psychiatrist, psychologist or other mental health counsellors; nurse practitioner; home health nurse and physical/occupational or respiratory therapist; and consultations as an outpatient and visits to the emergency department. The number of days in hospital recovering from the initial surgical treatment and any subsequent admissions during the 6&#x02005;months after treatment were aggregated and valued by a national hospital pricing model<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>; these prices were adjusted to 2011 values based on 3% annual price inflation. All costs were valued in Australian dollars at 2011 prices, health benefits represented by QALYs and the marginal QALY was given a monetary value of $64&#x02005;000.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref> Net monetary benefits were estimated by multiplying each QALY gained by $64&#x02005;000 and then deducting the change to costs. Uncertainty among the model parameters was included by fitting the individual data to probability distributions. The &#x003b2;-distribution was used for transition probabilities and utility scores, and the &#x003b3;-distribution was used for the costs.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref> One thousand random samples were taken from the prior distributions to reveal the joint distribution of cost and QALY outcomes for patients in both arms of the trial.</p><p>Because of different rates of lymph node dissection among the two groups, an alternate version of the model that excluded all patients with lymph node dissection was also evaluated. This scenario analysis will assess the sensitivity of the conclusions to any bias on outcomes arising from the differences in rates of lymph node dissection.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>The mean and SD for the EQ-5D scores for TAH and TLH for 1&#x02005;week, 4&#x02005;weeks, 3&#x02005;months and 6&#x02005;months postsurgery are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2012001884TB1">table 1</xref>.

They concluded that LH is unlikely to be cost-effective in the National Health Services (NHS) context. Similarly, a large cross-sectional analysis by Campbell <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref> associated TLH with higher hospital costs. This was confirmed by Lenihan <italic>et al,</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref> but they also noted decreased indirect costs to employers due to a faster recovery and fewer hours at work lost.</p><p>Although cost estimates may vary due to different patient populations, perspectives, surgical and measurement techniques, the majority of recently published literature favours TLH over TAH economically.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref> We believe that our findings derived from the large multicentre LACE trial represent an accurate estimate of outcomes. The use of TLH is recommended although decisions on the technique employed should be based on individual patient circumstances, including age and comorbidities. Future studies could look at long-term effects from a societal perspective. The data from Walker <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref> were used to show mortality risks for the two competing treatments. The reasons for this are their data were complete for a 5-year period and were audited with all follow-up-consistent and survival status obtained for each patient at the time of database lock, this is not the case for the LACE mortality outcomes; their publication has be reviewed by referees, statistical methods have been independently agreed upon and as such the survival curves for both groups reflect the scientific design for a non-inferiority equivalence design, this is yet to be achieved for the LACE trial.</p><p>Our data show that TLH is a safe and cost-effective treatment approach for early endometrial cancer and is likely to improve patients&#x02019; health outcomes whilst saving healthcare resources. The main drivers of the cost savings are reduced length of stay and reduced complications. Data from LACE<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref> however show complications were 14.3% for TAH and 8.2% in TLH, operating time was lower (132 vs 107&#x02005;min) and length of stay in hospital was reduced from 5 to 2&#x02005;days. Another recent study from the USA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref> showed TLH had fewer moderate to severe postoperative adverse events (14% vs 21%), similar rates of intraoperative complications, but the length of hospital say was reduced by 2&#x02005;days. To date, hysterectomy remains the most common major gynaecological surgical procedure, but the uptake of TLH amongst gynaecological surgeons has been slow. Further research might examine how a minimally invasive surgical approach can be established in real, day-to-day clinical practice to the benefit of women and their communities.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e182" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2012-001884.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e183" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2012-001884.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are grateful to the Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) for sharing their data on a 5-year mortality risk for laparotomy and laparoscopy patients.
