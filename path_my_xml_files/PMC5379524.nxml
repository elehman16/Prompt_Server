These may require management approaches such as use of coercive practices, which impact the well-being of staff members, visiting families and friends, peers, as well as patients themselves. Studies have proposed that not only patients&#x02019; conditions, but also treatment environment and ward culture may affect patients&#x02019; behaviour. Seclusion and restraint could possibly be prevented with staff education about user-centred, more humane approaches. Staff education could also increase collaboration between patients, family members and staff, which may further positively affect treatment culture and lower the need for using coercive treatment methods.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This is a single-blind, two-arm cluster randomised controlled trial involving 28 psychiatric hospital wards across Finland. Units will be randomised to receive either a staff educational programme delivered by the team of researchers, or standard care. The primary outcome is the incidence of use of patient seclusion rooms, assessed from the local/national health registers. Secondary outcomes include use of other coercive methods (limb restraint, forced injection, and physical restraint), service use, treatment satisfaction, general functioning among patients, and team climate and employee turn-over (nursing staff).</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The study, designed in close collaboration with staff members, patients and their relatives, will provide evidence for a co-operative and user-centred educational intervention aiming to decrease the prevalence of coercive methods and service use in the units, increase the functional status of patients and improve team climate in the units.

Every year over 38% of the total European Union (EU) population suffer from mental disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], and the lifetime prevalence rate is 25% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Mental health conditions are the one of the most dominant contributors to the global economic burden of non-communicable diseases, and schizophrenia constitutes the second greatest global burden in terms of disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Schizophrenia is a severe mental disorder characterised by profound disruptions in thinking, affecting language, perception, the sense of self and impairing functioning through the loss of an acquired capability to earn a livelihood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, schizophrenia is a treatable disorder: there is strong evidence that antipsychotic medication and family psychoeducation can improve outcomes for people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. At the same time, challenging behaviour in people with serious mental disorders is an international concern. Although contradictory opinions exist in the literature, the association between an increased risk of violent behaviour and mental disorders has been documented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In regards to lifetime violence, a significant association has been found with diagnosis of schizophrenia and other psychotic conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. It is also known that patients&#x02019; violent behaviour decreases physical [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and psychological health among staff members in psychiatric inpatient care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>Discussion about the treatment of patients with aggressive or self-harming behaviour is frequently accompanied by an ethical conflict between patients&#x02019; autonomy on one hand and the requirement to prevent harm on the other [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The proportion of people who experience different coercive measures is relatively small and numbers are decreasing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, frequencies of compulsory admission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and other types of coercion vary across the EU [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Still seclusion, physical restraint and forced medication are used in many psychiatric hospitals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. According to the recent health statistics in Finland, out of all people treated in in-patient psychiatric care in 2014 (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;25,552), 14% (3,329 patients) were exposed to coercive methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Of those, 46% (1,520 patients) were isolated in seclusion rooms, 21% (696 patients) were tied to a bed with special belts in seclusion rooms (limb restrains), 24% (787 patients) received forced injections, and 10% (326 persons) were physically restrained [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. With regards to the burden on families, relatives have experienced that involuntariness in patient care has been associated with the feeling of being excluded from treatment participation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. From the perspective of patients, their experiences of coercion are mainly negative [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. As an outcome of coercive measures, it was found in Finland that the use of coercive measures was associated with increased mortality of acute psychiatric hospital patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p>Less coercive measures and restrictive techniques are being recommended for managing patient aggressive behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Some actions have already been taken to decrease seclusion and restraint [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Putkonen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] found that, in state hospital wards for men with schizophrenia and violent behaviour, seclusion and restraint could be prevented with staff education and without an increase of violence. Some evidence has also shown that less restrictive interventions, such as cognitive skills programmes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] or short-term risk assessment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], have some effects in decreasing the number of aggressive incidents on psychiatric wards.</p><p>Still, use of less restrictive interventions to manage aggressive patients is controversial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Institutional organisation and clinical responsibility has traditionally aimed to provide a structured and safe environment for patients, to facilitate and monitor their treatment processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. However, a clinical trial in Brazil by Huf et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] found some limited evidence that using less restrictive measures did not harm patients, such as increase overall time of being restricted. Bergk and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] in their clinical trial in Germany showed that patients did not show a clear difference between coercion experiences after seclusion or mechanical restraint use although contrary experiences have also displayed with low quality study methodology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p><p>Despite the controversy of this topic, there is a need to establish, in collaboration with various parties, humane evidence-based interventions for prevention of aggressive behaviour among psychiatric patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Critical assessment of the content of patient treatment, as well as the consideration of patients&#x02019; and family members&#x02019; voiced opinions and concerns, are too often neglected by services, even though they are included in modern treatment agendas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Procedures used for dealing with patients&#x02019; behavioural problems are still largely based on the needs of staff and are untested in comparative studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. On the other hand, if new interventions are being used, descriptions of the content of the new interventions are often incomplete which hinders their implementation in practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. There is also a lack of knowledge, which elements of interventions or programmes are effective or which mechanisms or processes have a real impact [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. In addition, staff members may have their own untested traditions how to manage patients&#x02019; challenging behaviour on the wards because they are not always sufficiently aware which interventions are more cost-effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] or are more effective, particularly in managing aggressive patient behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] than others. Finally, the understanding of aggressive patient events is still unclear and there is a lack of studies investigating causal associations between risk factors and patient violence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].</p><p>Positive experiences of making a difference in a wider context can also be found. The recent large-scale trials covering wide geographical areas in the United Kingdom [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>], South Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>] and Switzerland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>] have encouraged us to design and conduct a nation-wide cluster randomised clinical trial to test the effects of user-centred and collaborative intervention to prevent and decrease coercive events in psychiatric hospitals. Contrary experiences of the impact of large-scale intervention trials also exist. Thornicroft et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] found in their study (64 generic and specialist community mental health teams) that the Joint Crisis Plan (JCP) was not significantly more effective than usual treatment. One reason was that the JCP was not fully implemented in all study sites, and it was combined with routine clinical review meetings, which did not actively incorporate patients&#x02019; preferences. Other studies have also found problems in new working methods, which may hinder their use in clinical practice. These problems include, for example, that interventions have been difficult to adhere to, use and to adopt into routine care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Other hindrances related to the assessment of the new methods have been slow patient recruitment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>] and sudden changes in local mental health policies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. In Norway, Aakhus et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>] examined in a cluster randomised trial with 80 municipalities, whether adherence to treatment guideline recommendations for elderly patients with depression could be approved by targeting healthcare professionals, patients and administrators. They found that the effectiveness of tailored intervention in implementing recommendations for elderly patients with depression in primary care was uncertain. Further, a one-year team-level intervention (14 teams in the REFOCUS group, 13 in the control group) did fail to coach staff behaviour toward a positive partnership between staff and patients with psychosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>].</p><p>Although treatment systems in psychiatric hospitals have already developed toward having more positive approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>], the importance of developing interventions and making ward atmospheres more active and caring should not be forgotten [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. Recently Boumans et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] described a reduction in the use of seclusion in a psychiatric setting. Patients and families worked together, in close collaboration, which included cyclic evaluation and readjustment of the treatment and a nurse care plan. Implicit, positive changes were found in the team process, such as increased interdisciplinary collaboration, team cohesion, and professionalization. Our previous small-scale project (funded by the Finnish Work Environment Fund, 111298) also identified the need and promises in improving ward atmospheres in psychiatric hospitals by educating staff members toward close collaboration between patients, relatives and staff members [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. In the randomised controlled trial (RCT), we will also use user-driven approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>] that includes, close collaboration with patients, staff, and family members in implementing the intervention in clinical practice and listening and accounting for their preferences and needs in daily practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. The focus of the approach will therefore be bottom-up rather than top-down [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. However, this requires stronger effort in our intervention in organising meetings, discussions and workshops with end-users to ensure everyone is aware of end-user needs and preferences.</p><p>In this study, we will implement an educational intervention for nursing staff to improve treatment culture on psychiatric wards and support team climate in staff members in psychiatric hospitals with a nation-wide cluster trial to test the effects of the educational intervention to decrease coercive incidents in psychiatric hospitals.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Aim of the study</title><p>To compare the effects of an educational intervention to usual practice (standard care, no specified staff education) on improving treatment culture and supporting team climate in staff members, which further could reduce the need for the use of coercive methods in psychiatric care. Although the intervention is designed to impact the daily practice and treatment culture of each hospital organisations, our attempt is also to improve outcomes at the level of the individual patient and nursing staff. Therefore, the outcomes of the study will be assessed from the organisational, patients&#x02019;, and staff members&#x02019; points of view.</p><p>The primary objective is to investigate whether the educational intervention for staff will decrease the incidence of patient restrictions - specifically use of seclusion rooms on psychiatric wards of hospitals. The secondary objectives are to investigate whether the educational intervention changes the incidence of limb restraint, forced injection, physical restraint and service use in psychiatric hospitals. The study will also investigate whether the educational intervention for staff members changes patients&#x02019; functional capacity, level of treatment satisfaction and quality of life. From the point of view of the nursing staff, the study will investigate whether the educational intervention effects team climate and staff turn-over.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Trial design</title><p>Our study is a single-blind, two-arm, stratified cluster randomised trial.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Setting and sample</title><p>This is a nation-wide study to be conducted across Finland in hospitals with psychiatric beds. Finnish mental health services are arranged by municipalities (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;317 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]), each individual municipality forms joint municipal authorities with other municipalities, or hospital districts, and are supplemented by private and third sector services (e.g. associations and foundations). People in need of inpatient psychiatric care are treated in general health services (e.g. health centres) or specialised medical care services organised by hospital districts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. This study will be conducted in hospitals with psychiatric beds in the non-private sector. Hospitals as cluster will be recruited and randomised.</p><p>Inclusion criteria of required participating hospital organisations are: Finnish-speaking, to have at least 1 psychiatric ward, open 24&#x000a0;h a day, seven days a week, and, when necessary, are able to use coercive measures defined in the Finnish Mental Health Act (1116/1990, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]) (seclusion room, limb restraint, forced medication, physical restraint). Wards will be excluded if they are specialised in forensic, psychogeriatric, or child and adolescent mental health care alone or if a similar type of project is underway or is planned to start there. In total there are 28 eligible hospitals. Once a hospital is allocated to any comparison arm, all health care professionals working in wards of the hospital and patients admitted to those wards are eligible to participate to the study. Based on the Finnish health statistics of the National Institute for Health and Welfare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], patients with a primary diagnosis of schizophrenia represents the second most common diagnostic group in psychiatric hospitals, after people with depression or recurrent depressive disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. People with schizophrenia are treated in psychiatric hospitals if they are in an acute phase and need for specialized care: 60% of all hospitalised patients in 2014 were hospitalised through an emergency admission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Study procedure</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>Recruitment and randomisation</title><p>Written information letter describing the study are to be sent to the administrators of each hospital organisation. They are given up to four week-time to show their preliminary interest and willingness to participate. This allows an adequate time for them to think through their decision and ask any questions related to the study.</p><p>Hospital organisations, within which there will be eligible wards, agreeing to participate will be randomly allocated to either receive staff education intervention (intervention group) or not receive staff education (passive control group). This allocation is organised by the research group as soon as baseline information of the wards is collected. The unit of randomisation is the hospital organisation within which there will be psychiatric wards. The cluster design will be used to avoid contamination in intervention effects between individual staff members. We will use centralised randomisation at the University of Turku (Department of Mathematics and Statistics) stratified by number of patient beds and nursing staff to assure as similar number of participants as possible in the intervention group as in the passive control group. Randomisation will be fully concealed and computer-generated by an independent statistician, who is not involved in the study. Investigators enrolling wards will not be able to foresee the assignment.</p><p>Data analysts will be kept blinded to allocation. Due to the type of intervention, allocation will be unmasked after randomisation to patients and their relatives, contact persons on each ward, health care staff delivering patient care on the wards, and the researchers participating in the intervention design and implementation; this will reflect real-world care. The Data Management Committee (DMC) will undertake ongoing safety surveillance. Investigators running the preliminary analysis for the DMC will be masked to data until investigators release the database. In addition, the statisticians and the National Register holder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>] responsible for Finnish routine data used in this study will be masked to ward allocation and patient data in each arm.</p><p>Local medical registers in each study hospital will form the data base of the study. For patient survey, staff in sampled hospitals will recruit every Finnish speaking patients and over 18&#x000a0;years admitted and treated on the wards during the patient data collection period before their discharge to achieve a sufficient sample of patients in anonymous survey. Inclusion criteria are patients aged over 18&#x000a0;years, of either sex, on discharge from a psychiatric hospital, are able to use the Finnish language, and are able to participate in the study based on their free will. Returned completed questionnaire will be interpreted as a voluntary participation in this study. We will include no formal test of capacity but will rely on the judgment of experienced health care professionals in their routine assessment, when nearing the point of discharge. Further formalized assessment is not part of routine care.</p><p>Patients who are under 18&#x000a0;years, incapable to use the Finnish language or judged to be not capable to participate in the study based on their mental status will be excluded.</p><p>The flow of the study is described in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.
