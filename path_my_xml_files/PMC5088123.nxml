It
refers to the force of the hands enabling diverse actions in ordinary life such as writing
with a ballpoint pen, using chopsticks to eat food, grasping a cup to drink water, and
holding exercise equipment during exercise<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Flexion, extension, and supination of the wrists have important
influences on grip and muscle strength<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.
The wrist joints have 2 degrees of freedom. The wrist joints rotate in the long axis of the
forearm and may hold freely and maintain objects. The ranges of wrist flexion and extension
for a healthy person are 0&#x000b0; to 90&#x000b0; and 0&#x000b0; to 70&#x000b0;, respectively<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Taping is being used as an important means of prevention of
injuries and management of acute damage in athletes during training and competition<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Such taping affects proprioceptive senses
and therefore is thought to have an effect on prevention of injuries<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Proprioceptive senses refer to senses modifying and
delivering information on one&#x02019;s physical location, posture, and movements from receptors of
the skin, muscles, tendons, and joints to the central nervous system<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. When tape is applied to an area of pain by extending the
muscles as maximally as possible, the area where the tape is applied exhibits flexion when
the muscles return to their normal locations<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. When this occurs, the skin is raised
upward, and the space between the skin and the muscles increases, improving circulation of
blood, lymph fluid, and tissue fluid in the space and enhancing motor functions of the
body<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Taping is one of the treatment
techniques developed in 1985 by Arikawa in Japan to treat patients<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. The tapes used have a rate of expansion and contraction
similar to that of the human body and constant adhesive durability. They have excellent
permeability and act in contraction and relaxation of the muscles. They are largely used for
treatment of acute and chronic orthopedic diseases<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. There have been diverse studies aimed at relieving pain of the
ankle, shoulder, elbow, and wrist joints, but research on the effect of forearm elastic
taping on the muscle strength of the wrists has been lacking<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to examine the effects of
forearm elastic taping on the grip strength and muscle strength of the wrist joints.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study selected 40 healthy subjects with no history of orthopedic disorders and was
conducted after consent to participate was obtained. Written informed consent according to
the ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki was provided by all subjects prior to
participation, and all agreed to participate in the project. Their average age, height, and
weight were 21.21 &#x000b1; 1.63&#x02005;years old, 173.51 &#x000b1; 8.54&#x02005;cm, and 71.18 &#x000b1; 8.47&#x02005;kg, respectively.
Sufficient explanation of the study&#x02019;s intent and overall purpose was given.</p><p>Guidelines for taping of the forearm were consistent with the protocol for medial
epicondylitis of the elbow as suggested by Kase et al<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Tape was applied to the wrist flexor muscle of the dominant hand.
To verify the effects of taping, two conditions were tested: forearm elastic taping and
nonelastic taping. The two tapes used in the study were the Standard Kinesio Tex Classic-2&#x0201d;
(5&#x02005;cm) Blue Tape (Kinesio Holding Company, Albuquerque, NM, USA) (elastic group) and a
nonelastic tape (Leukotape nonelastic, BSN Medical GmbH &#x00026; Co. KG, Hamburg, Germany)
(noneleastic group) .</p><p>Before applying the tape, the length of tape was measured from 2&#x02005;cm inferior to the medial
epicondyle of the humerus to the line of the wrist joint. A strip was cut from a roll of
tape and then cut down the middle to produce 2 tails or a &#x0201c;Y-strip&#x0201d;. The Y-strip was applied
to the common wrist flexor muscle from its insertion to origin with 15&#x02013;20% stretch tension.
The first tail of the Y strip was applied to the middle of the forearm with the wrist in a
hyperextended position, the elbow in full extension, and the forearm in full supination. The
second tail of the Y-strip, also applied from insertion to origin with 15&#x02013;20% stretch
tension, was applied along the medial edge of the forearm to wrap the common wrist flexor
muscles<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The nonelastic tape was applied with the same method as used for the elastic taping
group.</p><p>The outcome measures for this study consisted of maximal grip and wrist flexor muscle
strength. The maximal grip strength was assessed to determine handgrip strength. It was
measured by using a Jamar Hydraulic Hand Dynamometer (5030 KIT, Preston, USA). To measure
wrist flexor muscle strength, a Commander Muscle Tester (JTECH Medical, Midvale, UT, USA)
was employed. For measuring grip strength, the subjects were asked to adduct their shoulder
joints while sitting in a chair such that their arms were resting againist their trunk, flex
their elbow joints to 90 degrees, and to place their forearms and wrist in a neutral
position according to the method applied by Shimose et al<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Wrist flexor muscle strength was measured in a neutral position
(0&#x000b0;) after measuring grip strength. During the measurement of wrist flexor muscle strength,
the measurement pad was applied to the second to fifth middle phalanges area while the
subjects clenched their first strongly. The maximal isometric muscle strength was measured
by applying force with a wrist joint flexion motion. The average value was employed after
repetitive measurement for five seconds three times.</p><p>Data analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 20.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY,
USA). The mean and SD were calculated for each variable. Before the intervention,
differences in the general characteristics of the experimental and control groups were
compared using independent t-tests. Comparisons of variables before and after taping within
each group were made using paired sample t-tests. The statistical significance level was set
at &#x003b1;=0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>After application of forearm elastic taping, grip and wrist flexor muscle strength

angles of joints during muscle strength measurement, and the distance of action of the force
from the joint axis<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Accordingly, this
study was conducted to examine the effects of forearm taping on grip and wrist flexor muscle
strength. After application of forearm elastic taping, grip and wrist flexor muscle strength
significantly increased.</p><p>Diverse methods aimed at muscle strength improvement have been presented. Among the
methods, a lot of research has been conducted on taping techniques prove that the methods
also improve muscle functions<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
results of applying taping to the knee joints of patella femoral dysfunction patients
revealed that it was effective for improving their muscle strength<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the present study, the reason for the increase in muscle
strength after application of forearm elastic taping may be explained by the following
mechanism. According to the cutaneous fusimotor reflex theory, a fusimotor reflex triggers
contraction of subcutaneous muscles stimulated through the gamma motor reflex when different
types of stimulations, such as contact and vibration, are applied to the skin<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. In other words, stimulation of the skin
through application of taping may trigger contraction of muscles and improve muscle
strength<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Taping will be effective for
improving wrist flexor muscle strength and preventing wrist joint damage if it is applied to
patients who have difficulty with wrist flexion and extension, athletes, or those in the
industrial sites who use their hands often. Future studies should suggest standardized
application methods for nerve mobilization techniques and continue to research nerve
mobilization techniques combined with interventions for various musculoskeletal
diseases.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Shim</surname><given-names>JM</given-names></name><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>WH</given-names></name><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>SY</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Comparison of hand power and muscle activation during
