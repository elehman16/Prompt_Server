using a horse riding simulator (HRS) and a ball on static and dynamic balance of elderly
people. [Methods] Thirty-two elderly people hospitalized in geriatric hospitals were
randomly assigned to the HRS exercise group or the ball exercise groups, and they
performed exercise for eight weeks. [Results] The length of postural sway during quite
standing with and without eyes closed significantly decreased in both groups after the
exercises and there was no significant difference between both groups in the Romberg test.
In the functional reach test (FRT), there were significant increases in distance in both
groups after the exercises, and the distance of the HRS exercise group was significantly
greater than that of the ball exercise group. In the Timed Up &#x00026; Go test (TUG) and
Timed 10-meter walk test (10MWT), the time significantly decreased in both groups, and
there was a more significant decrease in the HRS exercise group than in the ball exercise
group. [Conclusion] The results of this study indicate that HRS and ball exercises may
improve the balance and gait ability of elderly people hospitalized in nursing homes or
geriatric hospitals.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Elderly</kwd><kwd>Balance</kwd><kwd>Hippotherapy</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Although the development of science and medicine has resulted in longer human lifespans
decreased balance control ability due to aging may degrade elderly people&#x02019;s quality of life.
Many aged people receive injuries such as fracture or brain damage, or even die in falls,
and the risk of falls increases even for the uninjured because of the functional loss that
occurrs secondary to restricted activities, due to fear or concern about another fall<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Continuous exercise and environmental
improvement are effective at increasing stability and reducing the risk of fall for elderly
people<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Diverse tools and programs are utilized in order to induce interest
and motivate elderly people whose will to exercise has been degraded because of low activity
levels and quality of life<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. In particular, activity levels of elderly people residing
in hospitals or nursing homes, where they mostly stay indoors, are lower than those of
elderly people who independently conduct daily living activities, and therefore specific
exercise programs are necessary for such persons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Research on the effects of fall prevention programs practiced by
hospitals have reported that fall prevention programs in acute hospitals are effective at
reducing falls<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref><sup>)</sup>, and targeted multifaceted
interventions are helpful for decreasing fall incidents in hospitals<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. On the other hands, fall prevention programs for patients
who stay in hospital for a short period have proven ineffective<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Hippotherapy is drawing attention as a new treatment technique for improving balance and
gait ability<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Movements of horse
walking and the rhythms on horseback are similar to those of normal human gait. Feeling the
rhythms on horseback gives comfort and pleasure and may be helpful for emotional stability.
Therefore horse riding is employed in rehabilitation as well as in the fields of sports or
recreation. Hippotherapy is known to be effective for improvement of subjects&#x02019;
three-dimensional movements using the horse as a medium, as well as inducing responses to
the horse&#x02019;s movements, adjusting abnormal muscle tension, improving movement patterns,
strengthening muscles, adjusting balance of the trunk, and enhancing gait<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Hippotherapy has been utilized to treat cerebral palsy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref><sup>)</sup>, multiple sclerosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref><sup>)</sup>, spinal cord injury<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref><sup>)</sup>, stroke<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref><sup>)</sup>, and
intellectual disabilities<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is
difficult to secure space for the therapy, and maintenance costs of horses and facilities
are expensive. In addition, there is the risk of falls<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, horse riding equipment or tools imitating a horse&#x02019;s
movements that may be utilized indoors have been recently developed<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. A horse riding
simulator or tools for hippotherapy could be employed for functional improvement and fall
prevention of elderly people hospitalized in nursing homes or geriatric hospital, but
relevant studies are insufficient. Therefore, this study examined the effects of horse
riding exercises on the HRS and a ball on static and dynamic balance of elderly people.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>In this study, thirty-two elderly people hospitalized in geriatric hospitals were randomly

The criteria for the selection of the subjects were as follows: 65&#x02005;years of
age or older; no experience of a fall in the last one year; ability to walk more than 10&#x02005;m
without the help of gait aiding tools or other persons; no disease that might have affected
the performance of exercise programs; and a score of 24 or higher score on the Korean
version of the mini-mental state examination (MMSE-K). The exclusion criteria were as
follows: visual or auditory deficit or problems with the vestibular system; and inability to
understand the content of the experiment.Information about this study was provided to all
the subjects and they submitted their written consent to participation in this study. They
were permitted to receive ordinary physical therapy during the study period. Ethical
approval was obtained from the research ethics boards of Daegu University and local
hospital.</p><p>Both the HRS exercise group and the ball exercise group performed horse riding exercise
five times per week, 20 minutes each time.</p><p>The HRS (Honjin, Korea) was developed for indoor hippotherapy, and it imitates the
three-dimensional movements (forward and backward, left and right, and up and down) of a
live horse. Images of horse riding are displayed at the front for visual reality effects.
The HRS group did warm-up exercise for 5 minutes prior to the horse riding exercise and a
physical therapist continuously observed them during the 15-minute horse riding exercise for
their safety. While the HRS was moving, the subjects maintained balance, and the speed of
HRS was adjusted to be physical capabilities of each subject. The ball exercise was
conducted in a similar manner to horse riding, with the subject riding on the ball. The
exercise program consisted of pelvic tilt on the ball (forward and backward, side to side)
and bounce on the ball (up and down). A research assistant demonstrated how to exercise on
the ball, and after 5 minutes of warm-up exercise, the subjects performed the exercise for
15 minutes. The ball used in the study was the Professional Exercise Ball (Thera-Band, USA)
and the diameter of the ball was 55 to 65&#x02005;cm, so that the subject&#x02019;s feet were comfortably
placed on the ground when sitting on the ball.</p><p>The Romberg test was used to assess static balance. Subjects stood on the platform of the
Bioresque (RM Ingenierie, France) place their feet shoulder width apart with their eyes open
for 1 minute, and then closed their eyes for another minute. The length of the center of
pressure sway was measured.FRT was used to assess dynamic balance in standing. The subjects
stood barefoot, placed their feet shoulder width apart, and held both arms parallel to the
ground with the palms facing down. The subjects extended both arms to the maximum, then
stretched forward as far as possible with their arms parallel to the ground and the distance
moved was measured. In order to measure dynamic balance and agility, the TUG test was
used<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. The subject sat in an armchair.
At the start of the test, they stood up and walked 3 meters, then walked back to and sat in
the armchair. Individuals walked 10&#x02005;m without assistance and the time taken to walk the
intermediate 6 meters was measured to eliminate the effects of acceleration and
deceleration. Each measurement was made three times and the best record was used.</p><p>The paired t-test was used in order to examine differencess between pre- and post-exercise
in both groups and the independent sample t-test was conducted for comparison between the
HRS exercise and ball exercise groups. The PASW 18.0 program (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA)
was used for data analysis. The results were accepted as statistically significant for
values of p&#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The pre- and post-exercise results are described in <xref rid="tbl_002" ref-type="table">Tables 2</xref> and<xref rid="tbl_003" ref-type="table"> 3</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title> Results of the Romberg test (Eyes open/closed) for static balance</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Variable</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Group</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pre</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Post</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="2" colspan="1">EO lengh (cm)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">HRS exercise</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">48.9 &#x000b1; 11.6</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">45.2 &#x000b1; 12.7*</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Ball exercise</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">51.4 &#x000b1; 15.3</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">38.4 &#x000b1; 10.8*</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="2" colspan="1">EC lengh (cm)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">HRS exercise</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">64.2 &#x000b1; 21.0</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">46.3 &#x000b1; 15.6*</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Ball exercise</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">62.3 &#x000b1; 20.3</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">41.9 &#x000b1; 11.7*</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>*p&#x0003c;0.05 Mean &#x000b1; SD, EO: eyes open, EC: eyes closed, HRS: horse riding simulator</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap>.

successful intervention strategy providing both safety and pleasure. This study examined the
effects of horse riding exercise on static and dynamic balance, and gait ability of elderly
people, and we verified that horse riding exercise using the HRS or the ball significantly
improved their balance and gait.</p><p>Elderly people&#x02019;s postural sway is larger than that of young people<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref><sup>)</sup>, and the range of postural sway of those who have several
experiences of fall is larger than that of those who do not, and their balance responses are
delayed. Therefore, they have difficulty in efficient postural adjustment and a higher risk
of fall<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this study, the length of postural sway in standing with the
eyes open and closed significantly decreased after 8 weeks of exercise. However, Araujo
observed that the static balance of the elderly who live at home didn&#x02019;t show significant
difference after horse riding exercise<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.
The differences between the findings of this study and previous reports may be due to the
health status of the subjects. Those who participated in Araujo&#x02019;s study were physically
healthy and able to do ordinary activities at home, whereas those who participated in this
study were hospitalized in geriatric hospitals and did relatively fewer activities. Kim
reported that the elderly living at home had significantly higher scores of fitness and
activities of daily living than those living in institutions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is known that appropriate ankle and hip postural strategies are
necessary for maintaining dynamic balance while standing, and an increase in FRT distance
indicates improvement of dynamic balance ability in the standing position. In this study,
FRT distance significantly increased in both the HRS and the ball exercise groups. A similar
increase in FRT distance was found by Mitani, whose study reported posture and movement of
the elderly improved after 12 weeks of HRS exercise<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In this study, TUG performance time decreased and gait speed increased after both the HRS
exercise and the ball exercise. The study by Mitani used a device similar to the HRS in our
present study, and the study of Araujo. Which conducted equine-assisted therapy, showed that
elderly individuals had shorter TUG performance time and increased gait speeds after horse
riding exercise<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. In our present study, the HRS group demonstrated better dynamic
balance ability and gait ability than those of the ball exercise group. It was possible for
the participants to predict their own actions in the exercises on the ball, when riding on
the HRS, which generates three-dimensional dynamic movements (forward and backward, left and
right, and up and down), the movements couldn&#x02019;t be predicted and greater, postural responses
were elicited by the HRS. The movement of horse riding provides inputs to the motor, visual,
somatosensory and vestibular systems. Horse riding is believed to promote motor performance
and strengthen the lower limb muscles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Heinereported that the movement of a horse generates continuous vestibular inputs.
Stimulating postural reaction, and feedback and feedforward repeatedly take place during
horse riding exercise to maintain a sitting position and to execute efficient postural
strategies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Although the horse riding exercise was performed in different forms, the exercises were
verified to have positive effects on the balance and functional mobility of the elderly.Many
elderly people commonly experience late-life depression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. Kim and Jungreported that leisure activity programsimproved
physiological, psychological functions and daily living activities of the elderly living in
a city<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Horse riding exercise not only
elicits physical improvement, but also provides psychological pleasure and physical
convenience. In the indoor HRS exercise that was conducted in this study, the elderly
subjects were able to experience horse riding while looking at an image depicting a virtual
reality; therefore, they were able to enjoyably participate. Simulated horse riding exercise
on a ball may also be performed by elderly people at anytime without restriction of time or
space, and has the merit that it may be performed by a group of people in hospitals or
institutions. The limitations of this study were as follows. The number of subjects was
small and was not representative of all elderly people. Also, follow-up evaluations of how
long the improved balance and gait function of elderly patients staying in hospitals are
maintained are necessary.</p><p>In an aging society, the number of ole people is continuously increasing, and the need of
methods to prevent elderly people&#x02019;s falls and enhance their balance ability has been made
clear. Indoor horse riding exercise is a good method for improving elderly people&#x02019;s balance
ability and preventing falls.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by the Daegu University Research Grant, Grant No 20120330.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Sihvonen</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Kulmala</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Kallinen</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Postural balance and self-reported balance confidence in
