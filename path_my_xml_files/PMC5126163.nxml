Granulation proliferation is one of the main complications.

The observation period was 5 months. One beagle in both groups was sacrificed at the end of the 1<sup>st</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> months, respectively. The last two beagles in both groups were sacrificed at the end of 5<sup>th</sup> month. The proliferation of granulation tissue and changes in tracheal mucosa were compared between the two groups.

Therefore, endoscopic tracheal stent placement can be an acceptable palliative treatment. Thus, a better long-term prognosis is needed.</p><p>It is known that a fibrotic airway repair process involves fibroblasts that cause recurrent, excessive scar formation.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] It can be partially inhibited using antiproliferative drugs. The main focus of the present study was on the degree of reduction of granulation tissue formation by employing a stent with antiproliferative coating (paclitaxel), as well as on the pharmacokinetic features and safety profiles of the coated drug.</p><p>The concept of a DES is not new, but most successful examples are in the cardiology field.

This result was consistent with the findings of other similar studies.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] In addition, the release period could be adjusted by changing the ratio of PLGA/paclitaxel.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>The inherent growth-inhibitory properties of many anticancer agents make them ideal candidates for preventing restenosis.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] However, one of the major concerns is the unpredictable local and systemic toxicity caused by the coated drug. In the present study, a high concentration of paclitaxel was not noted in the trachea (in the stented and adjacent unstented areas) and lung tissue during the observation period, and blood test showed no side effect. The results also showed that the PLGA had good safety and tissue compatibility. They also confirmed that in an appropriate concentration range, paclitaxel did not cause necrosis of the surrounding tissue and did not affect the healing and epithelialization of the tracheal mucosa.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</p><p>The significance of the present results was limited due to the small sample size. However, the results can guide further research on drug-eluting tracheal stents. Moreover, in this study, the drug-eluting model was constructed on nondiseased beagle trachea. The efficacy of stents in humans remains unknown. Therefore, future studies should consider the performance status, comorbidities, extent of disease, and anatomical malformations of patients.</p><p>The present study preliminary investigated the efficacy of the paclitaxel drug-eluting tracheal stent in reducing granulation tissue formation in a canine model. The results implied that the paclitaxel-eluting stent could reduce the granulation tissue formation after stent implantation, and it was safe <italic>in vivo</italic>. The potential use of PLGA for sustained release of lipophilic drugs such as paclitaxel was established. The results indicated that the paclitaxel-eluting tracheal stent developed in this study might be considered for potential use in humans in the future.</p><p><italic>Supplementary information is
