Induction of anesthesia was performed with 2.5% isoflurane in 30% oxygen / 70% nitrogen inside an anesthesia chamber (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston MA, USA). Mice randomized to receive splenectomy had a small rodent face mask applied and received 2.5% isoflurane. The abdominal wall was shaved prior to making a 1 cm abdominal incision. Under neurosurgical microscopic guidance, the spleen was freed from the surrounding tissue by blunt dissection. Blood vessels were ligated using 6&#x02013;0 silk suture, and the spleen was removed by transecting the blood vessels distal to the ligature. The skin incision was closed using 4&#x02013;0 silk suture. The time of surgery was approximately five minutes. To minimize variability, all surgeries were performed by the same individual. Under identical conditions, mice randomized to receive anesthesia alone were anesthetized on day 0 for the same amount of time without undergoing surgery.

In addition, this study supports our additional hypothesis that postsurgical treatment with the COX-2 inhibitor MEL would attenuate both anhedonia and neuroinflammation. Furthermore, anesthesia alone with or without MEL treatment had no effect on mood. These findings are supportive of our previous work where MEL attenuated short-term memory loss and hippocampal microglial activation following splenectomy in mice. Surgery anatomically distant from the CNS produced the combined sequelae of mood and memory changes with associated neuroinflammation that an anti-inflammatory treatment was able to modulate.</p><p id="P41">Comparisons for sucrose preference were made between treatment groups within a given test day rather than in comparison to the baseline measurements. Diminished sucrose preference indicative of anhedonia can be reversed by tricyclic antidepressants and can be used as an analogue for depressive behavior in mice [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. On day 1 after splenectomy, anhedonia was not observed in either control mice with saline or MEL-treated mice. However at day 5, mice treated with SAL experienced decreased sucrose preference, reflecting anhedonia, while mice treated with MEL did not exhibit anhedonia. Anhedonia was not observed in either control with Saline or MEL-treated mice at days 9 and 14. Mice receiving anesthesia alone followed by either SAL or MEL did not exhibit decreased sucrose preference at any stage, suggesting that the administration of anesthesia is not the cause of the behavioral changes observed. The anesthetic procedures used here were comparable to those of Cao et al.[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], wherein anesthesia was also shown to have no role in the development of cognitive dysfunction.</p><p id="P42">Comparisons of reactive astrocytosis in treated mice versus control showed significant decreases on days 5, 9 and/or 14 depending on the region examined by the Mann-Whitney test for non-parametric data. Thus, we found a temporal association between hypothalamic inflammation and anhedonia as well as the absence of anhedonia after COX-2 treatment. Hippocampal CD45 microglia staining showed a significance decrease on day 14.We did not see the same pattern of microglial activation as in our previous work using tomato lectin antibodies, where activation peaked at day 5 and declined thereafter [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This may be because of the different histological methods used. The hippocampus is very prone to dysfunction following the activation of the immune system [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. We observed that overall neuroinflammation decreased in MEL treated animals versus SAL treated animals. Significant difference was also observed in CD45 between MEL and SAL treated animals in all the pyriform cortex and hypothalamus. This is consistent with other reports that show meloxicam can reduce hippocampal inflammatory gene expression in settings such as HIV infection [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p id="P43">Overall, in GFAP-stained sections, a significant difference was observed in hippocampus, cortex piriform cortex and hypothalamus; although, the day(s) these reductions were observed were distinct in different brain regions.

Astrocytes support and sustain the CNS milieu but are increasingly thought to play a role in the inflammatory response [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. However, in this study, microglial activation has a stronger association with anhedonia than does astrocytosis. Hypothalamic inflammation secondary to cytokines can lead to depression via the Hypothalamus-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis by deregulating the activity of the sympathetic nervous system and the endocrine release of stress hormones and glucocorticoids [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Peripheral inflammation secondary to cytokines causes release of free radicals, oxidants, and glucocorticoids that change microglial cell function and may damage neurons. These findings are in keeping with the putative greater role of microglia in neuroinflammation.</p><p id="P44">While all groups of mice exhibited an upward trend in total fluid consumption on day 5 regardless of treatment after either splenectomy or anesthesia alone, there was no significant difference in fluid intake between groups on any given day. This, in addition to the alternating of tube position, indicates that neither thirst nor water or sucrose tube placement were factors in the behaviors observed. Locomotor testing showed that the treatment used after splenectomy resulted in different behaviors over a 12 day period, with MEL-treated mice significantly more active throughout. Therefore, locomotion played no role in sucrose preference or fluid consumption. It could be argued that our locomotor and anhedonia findings are caused by pain. Pain, one of the cardinal manifestations of trauma and inflammation, can also result in decreased motor activity that mirrors that of depressive behavior [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In addition, cytokine-associated hyperalgesia has been observed in several different models [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The potential effects of pain on movement are obvious, and concurrent pain may change motivation to counter thirst in a particular manner. However, all of the above findings in concert show a MEL effect long past its reported half-life. Oral or intravenous treatment of mice with MEL shows a half-life of 4.8 and 6.4 hours, respectively, with the i.p. half-life likely to be intermediate. MEL is metabolically cleared with 8% of the dose remaining at 72 hours, followed by complete elimination at 96 hours in mice [<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Therefore, a direct effect of MEL on pain is unlikely when behavioral changes are observed at day 5 and, with regards to locomotion, through day 12.</p><p id="P45">Furthermore, in a model of acute hypotension, a similar transient delayed pattern of neuroinflammation, memory loss, and anhedonia was noted by our group. We found that MEL given either immediately after or eight hours after surgery had no significant effect on ameliorating cognitive dysfunction, but there was a significant reduction in cognitive dysfunction when MEL was given 24 hours following surgery[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This observation corresponds to the finding that cytokine release peaks at 24 hours following brain damage in rodents [<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Our timing of MEL treatment was based on a likely COX-2 based effect of MEL on cytokine function in the immediate period after 24 hours rather than a longer lasting direct effect of the drug.</p><p id="P46">The cytokine-mediated inflammatory response following surgical trauma, therefore, is the likely target of COX-2 inhibition in our study. This is similar to the response elicited by infection or injury, and can present with comparable manifestations. Postoperative inflammation is associated with cognitive dysfunction and depression [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Peripheral immune stimulation in response to infection or injury stimulates the release of cytokines that may change behavioral and motivational states. These changes, which may manifest as anorexia, malaise, lethargy, decreased activity, and social withdrawal, reorganize the individual&#x02019;s priorities towards fighting infection or healing from injury [<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Such changes may simultaneously serve as an evolutionary adaptive behavior to minimize the physical or psychological impact of a stressor and to facilitate responses to help overcome it [<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Collectively, this constellation of changes is referred to as &#x0201c;sickness behavior.&#x0201d; Just like the fear response that is provoked by the threat of a predator, sickness behavior is an adaptive and normal biologic response that can become pathologic if it arises in the wrong context or is excessive in intensity or duration.</p><p id="P47">Because sickness behavior and major depressive disorder share many similar clinical manifestations, it has been postulated that major depressive disorder represents a maladaptive pattern of sickness behavior that has been inappropriately activated or out of proportion to what would be expected [<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Studies have shown that while sickness behavior tends to manifest relatively early on in the time course following cytokine treatment before dissipating within 24 hours, depressive behavior has a more delayed onset and persists beyond 24 hours [<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. These findings suggest that despite their similar clinical manifestations, sickness behavior and depression are two distinct entities. Immunological challenges may also provoke the development of depression, and psychological stress, in turn, can compromise immune function [<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Such stressors, which can include discrete negative life events (e.g. bereavement, loss of a job) or as the culmination of many negative events (e.g. daily struggles of life) [<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], activate the HPA axis and can dysregulate the synthesis and activity of neurotransmitters such as serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine [<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p id="P48">The interplay between stress and processes involving the endocrine and immune systems suggests a role for inflammation in the development of depression. Indeed, depression has been described as an inflammatory disease characterized by elevated levels of cytokines [<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Major depressive disorders have been reported in patients being treated with the recombinant cytokines interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interferon-&#x003b1; (IFN-&#x003b1;) [<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], and chronic inflammatory diseases such as coronary artery and autoimmune diseases have been associated with an increased incidence of mood disorders [<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Other studies have shown that IL-1&#x003b2;-treated rats have decreased performance in a task required to obtain a sucrose solution reward, and rats given lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a potent inducer of cytokine production, experienced persistent reduction in motor activity and a decreased preference for a sweetened drinking solution [<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Cytokines in the periphery activate the transcription of cyclooxygenase-2(COX-2), which synthesizes prostaglandins vital to the cardinal signs of inflammation and to sustaining the inflammatory response. In addition, acute peripheral inflammation activates the brain&#x02019;s innate immune system (i.e. microglia), central nervous system expression of cytokines, and other inflammatory mediators. Therefore, COX-2 function has a role in postsurgical neuroinflammation that contributes to cognitive dysfunction and possibly to depression [<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>].</p><p id="P49">Peripheral cytokines can stimulate the release of other proinflammatory cytokines and activate the transcription of COX-2, which is the rate-limiting enzyme in the production of prostaglandins and is suspected of playing a role in the postsurgical neuroinflammation [<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Cytokines act centrally by altering the permeability of the Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) via increased expression of vasoactive and inflammatory molecules such as COX-2 and histamine [<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Endothelial cells of the BBB have shown up-regulated transcription of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-&#x003ba;B), a signal transduction protein shared by many cytokines, and increased release of prostaglandins and inflammatory mediators like COX-2 and histamine in response to cytokines [<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. It has been proposed that cytokine activation in the periphery triggers neuroinflammation by either a humoral or neuronal pathway, modulated by upregulation of a number of peripheral inflammatory markers [<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The resulting changes to the brain can manifest as fever, anorexia, and cognitive impairment.</p><p id="P50">Our study has several limitations. One is the possible role of pain in our findings, which we have discussed above. Another potential limitation is the possibility that while anhedonia may be indicative of a mood disorder, it is also a symptom of cytokine-mediated sickness behavior. This is also discussed above. It is likely that sickness behavior-associated mood changes are on a temporal and pathological continuum with depression despite their different time courses.</p><p id="P51">In summary, we have shown that postoperative anhedonia and neuroinflammation develop in a delayed transient manner following splenectomy in mice and are attenuated by delayed MEL treatment. These findings suggest that COX-2-dependent mechanisms may play a role in the development of postoperative mood disorders, possibly via modulation of peripheral effects on CNS neuroinflammation. The results indicate that future research is warranted to further elucidate the role of COX-2-dependent or other immune modulator effects on the onset of postoperative sickness behavior and mood disorders-in translational and clinical studies.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="S23"><p id="P52">This manuscript was supported by NIH grants NS073502 (TW) and AG20245 (TW), and The Cultural Mission of
