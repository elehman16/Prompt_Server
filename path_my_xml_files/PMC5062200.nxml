All the patients were randomly allocated into two groups of 30 each using computer-generated random number. An informed, valid, written consent was obtained for conduct of the study. All patients were kept nil by mouth from midnight before surgery and tablet alprazolam (0.01 mg/kg) was administered at bedtime the day before surgery. Intravenous access was established with an 18-gauge cannula and preloading was done with 15 ml/kg lactated Ringer's solution, 30 min before the procedure. A pulse oximeter, noninvasive blood pressure (BP), and electrocardiogram monitor were applied to each patient on arrival to the operating room and baseline parameters were recorded. All the patients were randomly allocated into two groups of 30 each by computer-generated number. The patient and the anesthesiologist were blinded to the treatment group, and all recordings were performed by an anesthesiologist, who was blinded to randomization schedule. An anesthesiologist, who was blinded to the study drug used, documented all the parameters. Group 1 (dexmedetomidine) was Bupivacaine and dexmedetomidine group and Group 2 (control) was Bupivacaine and saline group.</p><p>Under strict aseptic conditions, subarachnoid block was performed at L3&#x02013;L4 intervertebral space through midline approach using a 25-gauge Quincke spinal needle. After ensuring free flow of cerebrospinal fluid 0.5% heavy bupivacaine, 15 mg was administered intrathecally. Group 1: Intravenous dexmedetomidine at a rate of 1 &#x000b5;g/kg as a loading dose in first 10 min was immediately administered after spinal anesthesia, later at the rate of 0.5 &#x000b5;g/kg/h as maintenance dose. Group 2: Intravenous 0.9% saline in equal amounts was administered. Hemodynamic parameters of the patient were recorded.</p><p>Following parameters were recorded:</p><p>Onset of analgesia was assessed by loss of sensation to pinprick every 30 s till the level of T10 dermatome was achieved. The highest level of analgesia after 10 min was assessed. Intensity of motor blockade was assessed by modified Bromage scale every 2 min for first 10 min. Duration of sensory blockade was assessed by two segments regression and analgesia was assessed from the onset of subarachnoid block to the time of administration of rescue analgesia. Duration of motor blockade was noted. Vital parameters were monitored. Modified Bromage scale was used to assess the motor blockade as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>. Side effects if any such as bradycardia, hypotension, and nausea were recorded during the study period. Duration of analgesia was defined as the time from subarachnoid block to visual analog scale &#x0003e;2, at that point rescue analgesia was given as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Modified bromage scale</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AER-10-497-g001"/></table-wrap><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Visual analog scale</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AER-10-497-g002"/></fig><p>Ramsay level of sedation score was used to assess the level of sedation as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>.</p><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Ramsey level of sedation score</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AER-10-497-g003"/></table-wrap><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis was done using Student's <italic>t</italic>-test and <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec1-3"><title>OBSERVATIONS AND RESULTS</title><p>In this study, sample was taken at random from a population when each member of the population has an equal chance of being chosen. The purpose is to produce groups that are as nearly similar as possible before the experimental procedure. We used Student's unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test for statistical analysis. It was used because two sets of population were compared which were independent and identically distributed. The statistical software used was SPSS version 16 (SPSS for Windows, SPSS Inc., Released 2007, Chicago, IL, USA) for analysis. For the operational feasibility in the time-bound period, we decided a sample size of 60 patients. However, for the extrapolation of the results to general population, a larger sample size would be mandatory.</p><p>Following were the observations and results of the present study.

To prolong the duration of spinal anesthesia, various drugs such as magnesium sulfate, neostigmine, midazolam, fentanyl, and clonidine have been used through intrathecal route as adjuvant to local anesthetic. Opioids have attained an integral role as a spinal anesthetic adjuvant, but its addition to local anesthetic solution may lead to pruritus and respiratory depression.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>Clonidine, an &#x003b1;2 agonist, is widely used by oral, intrathecal, and intravenous routes as an adjuvant to prolong the duration of spinal anesthesia.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Recent studies have shown that giving dexmedetomidine intravenously can also prolong the duration of spinal anesthesia with better hemodynamic stability and minimal side effects.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Dexmedetomidine is a new &#x003b1;2 agonist, approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1999 for use as an analgesic and sedative in the intensive care units.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] &#x003b1;-adrenoceptor agonists have different &#x003b1;1:&#x003b1;2 selectivity. Clonidine, the first developed and the most known &#x003b1;2 agonist, is considered as a partial &#x003b1;2 agonist, since its &#x003b1;1:&#x003b1;2 selectivity is 200 while &#x003b1;1:&#x003b1;2 selectivity of dexmedetomidine is 1620 and hence has 8 times more affinity for &#x003b1;2 receptors than that of clonidine.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Intravenous dexmedetomidine has been used as an adjuvant agent with spinal anesthesia as it prolongs motor and sensory blockade[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] with early onset and prolonged duration of action.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Dexmedetomidine differs from clonidine as it possess most selective &#x003b1;2 adrenoceptor agonist activity especially for the 2A subtype of this receptor, which makes it a more sedative and analgesic agent than clonidine<sub>.</sub> Due to this greater selectivity, dexmedetomidine is more suitable adjuvant to spinal anesthesia compared to clonidine.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Despite sound levels of sedation, there is limited respiratory depression, providing wide safety margins.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Dexmedetomidine is thus used as an adjuvant in epidural,[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] spinal,[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and intravenous regional anesthesia. A biphasic cardiovascular response has been described after the administration of dexmedetomidine. The administration of a bolus of 1 &#x000b5;g/kg dexmedetomidine initially results in a transient increase of the BP and a reflex decrease in heart rate. The initial increase in BP is probably due to the stimulation of peripheral &#x003b1;2 &#x003b2; receptors. The initial response lasts for 5&#x02013;10 min and is followed by a decrease in BP below baseline, and a stabilization of the heart rate, both of these effects are caused by the inhibition of the central sympathetic outflow overriding the direct stimulating effects.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>In our study, the demographic profile (age-, gender-, weight-, and height-wise distributions) was comparable in both the groups. The mean of maximum height of sensory blockade in dexmedetomidine group was (T4&#x02013;T6) compared to (T6&#x02013;T8) level in control group. The maximum height of sensory blockade of the present study was in accordance with study of Kaya <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] in both the groups.
