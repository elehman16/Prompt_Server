Four individuals play together, in teams of two, competing to outmanoeuvre the opposing team. The goal of the game is to capture the opponents&#x02019; flag. Movement in the game is encouraged through the goal; guarding your own flag from opponents and getting their flag back to your base. In order to further motivate movement, the players also regenerate ammunition that can be used to shoot an opponent based on the distance moved within the game, generated by cycling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>). Each game consists of a preselected number of rounds that end once one team manages to capture the flag or when a 2&#x02009;min timer runs out.

The participants rested in the laboratory for 15&#x02009;min between the two conditions. Before the experiment started, the participants practised the Pedal Tanks game for 15&#x02009;min to familiarise with the exergame. We asked the participants to do both activities for a minimum of 15&#x02009;min and to continue for as long as they wanted up to 60&#x02009;min.</p><p>The PLAY condition comprised participants playing the Pedal Tanks at self-selected exercise intensity. The participants played in &#x02018;best-of-5-rounds&#x02019;, meaning that&#x000a0;they played until one team won for the third time. Each of these rounds has&#x000a0;a maximum of&#x000a0;2&#x02009;min. In-between each game, they had a short break (15&#x02009;s), and between each &#x02018;best-of-5-round&#x02019; they had a 3&#x02009;min break.</p><p>In the WALK condition, the participants walked outdoors at a self-selected moderately&#x000a0;paced speed, with no supervision from the researchers. They walked in groups of four in order to mimic the social interaction in PLAY. The weather was 14&#x000b0;C&#x02013;18&#x000b0;C, cloudy but not raining. The reason for choosing moderate-intensity walking as a control condition was that such brisk walking performed in bouts of at least 10&#x02009;min is recommended in the guidelines for physical activity to promote health in adults.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Measurements</title><p>The participants filled out a questionnaire on hours per week of exercise training and gaming.

From the activity monitors, we registered the estimated absolute and relative energy expenditure (in total kilocalorie and kilocalorie per minute, respectively). Immediately after each session, the participants rated their perceived exertion and enjoyment of the activity on 10&#x02009;cm 0&#x02013;10 Visual Analogue Scales (VAS).</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis was performed using Stata version 13.1. We did not perform a sample size calculation prior to the data collection. The reason for this was that this trial was considered a pilot study. We used the Shapiro-Wilk test to check for normality of data. The duration of both activities, perceived exertion of PLAY, average HR during play and time spent in different intensity zones were not normally distributed. We therefore used Wilcoxon signed rank tests to assess differences between these outcome variables of the two activities (WALK and PLAY). We used paired-samples t-test to assess differences between the remaining outcome measures of the two activities. Data are presented as mean&#x000b1;SD unless otherwise stated.

They found the exercise intensity&#x000a0;during exergaming to be significantly higher than &#x000a0;during sedentary computer games; however, the intensity of the exergames was comparable with bowling<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> and significantly lower than of treadmill walking or jogging.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Even if low-intensity activities might attenuate the detrimental effects of prolonged sitting,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> we argue that activities of moderate and high intensities should be advocated to achieve superior health benefits. Maintaining a good cardiorespiratory fitness over years is strongly and independently associated with improved health outcomes and survival.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21 22</xref> According to recent systematic reviews,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23&#x02013;25</xref> high-intensity interval training is more effective on improving cardiometabolic risk and aerobic capacity than other forms of exercise in various populations. In the present study, the exercise intensity during exergaming was similar to conventional high-intensity interval training, indicating that such game play would significantly improve the participants&#x02019; cardiorespiratory fitness if undertaken over time. There is still limited evidence available to conclude on the long-term efficacy of exergaming for improvement in cardiorespiratory fitness, and further studies should examine the chronic adaptations after exergaming. However, Warburton and coworkers<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> showed an&#x000a0;11% increase in maximal oxygen uptake after 6 weeks of exergaming on a stationary bike for 30&#x02009;min on&#x000a0;3 days/week.</p><p>It is hard to overestimate the health benefits of regular exercise training, as physical activity is associated with reduced chances of acquiring more than 25 chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, several cancer forms and psychological disorders.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Nevertheless, many adults fail to meet the recommended level of 150&#x02009;min of moderate-intensity physical activity or 75&#x02009;min of vigorous intensity physical activity per week.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Enjoyment</title><p>Perceived enjoyment of an activity is an important determinant for the time allocated to an activity. In general, people are inclined to undertake activities that make them feel good and to avoid activities that do not.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> The tendency of humans to maximise pleasure and minimise displeasure can also be proposed as a mechanism for exercise adherence,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> and affective responses during exercise have been shown to predict future physical activity.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> The use of enjoyable exergames can therefore be a fruitful strategy for promoting physical activity, in particular for those less motivated by more traditional exercise.</p><p>In our study, the participants rated the enjoyment of exergaming as high even though the intensity was vigorous. Some previous studies have shown that the affective responses to high-intensity training are worse than those associated with moderate-intensity exercise<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31 32</xref> and, therefore, recommend moderate intensity to increase future adherence to exercise. We do, however, argue that our results indicate that exergaming can be a fun and acceptable high-intensity training intervention. The specific exergame played in our study (Pedal&#x000a0;Tanks) included gameplay features from popular ordinary (non-exergame) games, such&#x000a0;as player progression and team-based multiplayer design. Such game qualities are&#x000a0;associated with player enjoyment and can potentially increase the adherence to the exergame over a longer period. Exercise persistence during exergaming can increase if you are playing with a partner who shows signs of fatigue over time.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> In our study, the participants changed teams and position between each test day in order to minimise the influence of different social and environmental contexts on exercise intensity and enjoyment.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Limitations</title><p>Limitations of the present study include a small sample. Further, participation in the study was voluntary and therefore the rating of enjoyment of exergaming may be higher than for those who did not want to participate. Hence, we do not know if our results can be generalised beyond our sample. Energy expenditure was not directly measured but estimated using an activity monitor. The SenseWear armband has, however, been found to have a very good linear correlation with indirect calorimetry, although with a slight underestimation of energy expenditure during cycling.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> We chose not to use indirect calorimetry measurements in the&#x000a0;present study as we think that wearing a mask or mouthpiece would have affected the rating of enjoyment and the chosen duration time of the activities. Another limitation to the validity of our measurements is the estimated HR<sub>max</sub> used in calculating the relative intensity. However, this does not limit the value of the comparison between the two activities (walking vs exergaming). In our study, the time frame of assessments was short, and we investigated only acute physiological and enjoyment responses. We need longitudinal studies to determine if these responses will sustain and to assess if exergaming can continue to be an enjoyable way of doing&#x000a0;high-intensity training in the long run. One possible explanation for why the participants chose to spend more time playing than walking might have been the novelty of the PLAY task. Users of a new exergame might want to spend more time with the game in order to explore and understand it. Outside walking was chosen as the control condition. We realise that a high intensity would not be reached during brisk walking in our participants. The reason for choosing walking as a comparison was mainly that we wanted to investigate the enjoyment and self-selected duration of this activity compared with exergaming and not as much the intensity reached during the two activities. Given the novelty of the exergame, the focus was on whether high-intensity interval training could be possible and not comparison with other types of interval training. Further work should also consider the comparison of intensity, enjoyment and duration of exergaming versus other types of physical activity and exercise, in particular comparing exergaming with traditional high-intensity interval training.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Playing a biking exergame elicited high exercise intensity and was perceived as enjoyable.
