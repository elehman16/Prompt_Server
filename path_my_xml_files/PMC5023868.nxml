About 80% of lung cancer patients have nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), 30% of who are diagnosed with stage III disease.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup> Platinum combined with third-generation anticancer agents is considered the standard first-line chemotherapy for NSCLC patients.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> However, most NSCLC patients are either refractory to first-line chemotherapy or show relapse after an initial response. In addition, compared to sequential chemoradiotherapy, it is also associated with greater acute toxicity, which includes bone marrow suppression and esophagitis.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup></p><p>S-1 (Taiho Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) is a novel oral fluoropyrimidine formulation that consists of tegafur, 5-chloro-2,4-dihydroxypyridine, and potassium oxonate in the molar ratio of 1:0.4:1.<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> S-1 has been shown to induce a response that is comparable to those of other single agents used in the treatment of NSCLC.<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> Previous studies on the use of S-1 plus cisplatin in the treatment of advanced NSCLC showed a response rate of 32.7% to 47% and a median survival of 11 to 16 months. Most importantly, little severe gastrointestinal or hematological toxicity was reported.<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> However, S-1 is seldom used for the treatment of NSCLC in China.</p><p>To date, no multicentre randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been conducted in China to evaluate the efficacy and safety of S-1 plus cisplatin with concurrent radiotherapy (SCCCR) versus cisplatin with concurrent radiotherapy (CCCR) in patients with NSCLC. Therefore, we conducted a multicentre, randomized controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SCCCR for the treatment of NSCLC in China.</p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Patients and methods</title><p>Between January 2012 and December 2014, 72 Chinese patients with histologically proven unresectable stage IIIA or IIIB NSCLCs were recruited. The inclusion criteria were as follows: the determination of clinical or pathologic stage based on the general rules for the TNM Classification of Malignant Tumors (6th edition)<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup>; age of 20 to 80 years; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1; no previous chemotherapy or radiotherapy; and adequate hematologic, hepatic, and renal function. In addition, the results of the laboratory tests should satisfy the following criteria: leukocyte counts, 4000 to 12,000/&#x003bc;L, platelet counts &#x02265;100,000/&#x003bc;L, hemoglobin level of &#x02265;9&#x0200a;g per 100&#x0200a;mL, serum bilirubin level of &#x02264;1.5&#x0200a;mg per 100&#x0200a;mL, serum aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels of &#x02264;100&#x0200a;IU/mL, an alkaline phosphatase level of no more than twice the upper limit of normal, and a normal creatinine level with a partial arterial oxygen pressure of &#x02265;65&#x0200a;torr in room air. All eligible participants underwent computed tomography (CT) scans of the thorax. All patients provided written informed consent. This study was approved by the ethics committee of all the involved hospitals.</p><p>Patients were excluded if they were pregnant or had malignant pleural effusion, malignant pericardial effusion, a concomitant malignancy, or serious comorbidities (e.g., cardiac dysfunction, active infection, or neurologic or psychiatric disorders).</p><sec><label>2.1</label><title>Study design</title><p>A multicentre, RCT was conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of SCCCR and CCCR for the treatment of NSCLC. The participants were randomized using a computerized number generator and stratified by a statistician with no clinical involvement in the study. The SAS software package (Version 9.1; SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC) was used to produce block randomization. Subsequently, patients were randomly assigned to the SCCCR or CCCR group in a ratio of 1:1. This allocation was concealed in sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes.</p></sec><sec><label>2.2</label><title>Treatment schedule</title><sec><label>2.2.1</label><title>CCCR</title><p>CT scans of the chest tumor were taken for all patients to determine the tumor volume before intervention. Subsequently, patients received cisplatin (60&#x0200a;mg/m<sup>2</sup>) on day 1 followed by at 4-week intervals, and radiotherapy was administered concurrently on day 1 by chest irradiation. All patients received 2 different radiation target volumes. The initial dose (approximately 40&#x0200a;Gy) was applied to the primary tumor and subsequent 20-Gy dose boosts were given once daily for 5 days weekly over a period of 6 weeks using a linear accelerator that could generate at least 4-MeV photons depending on tumor shrinkage.</p></sec><sec><label>2.2.2</label><title>SCCCR</title><p>In addition to receiving the same treatment with the patients in the CCCR group, patients in the SCCCR group also received S-1 orally at 40&#x0200a;mg/m<sup>2</sup> daily dose divided b.i.d. on days 1 to 14.</p></sec></sec><sec><label>2.3</label><title>Response and toxicity evaluation</title><p>The response to treatment and toxicity were assessed for all patients who were included in the study. Chest radiography, complete blood counts, and blood chemistry measurements were evaluated once a week during the therapy period. In all patients, the response to treatment was evaluated according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours.<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> The toxicity was assessed and graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, Version 3.0.<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup></p></sec><sec><label>2.4</label><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>In this study, we performed an intention-to-treat analysis. The primary outcome was the overall response rate. The secondary outcomes were the overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and adverse events (AEs). OS was defined as the time from enrolment to death from any cause. PFS was defined as the time from enrolment to disease progression or death. In patients who did not show disease progression at the time treatment was discontinued, PFS assessment continued until progression was documented. The Kaplan&#x02013;Meier method was used to calculate the OS and PFS, and a <italic>P</italic>-value &#x02264;0.05 was considered statistically significant. All <italic>P</italic>-values were obtained using 2-tailed <italic>t</italic> tests.</p><p>The sample size was calculated based on the primary efficacy outcome of &#x003b1; = 0.05 (2-sided) and &#x003b2; = 0.20. The estimated sample size for the SCCCR and CCCR groups at a 1:1 ratio was 36 patients per group. Assuming a 20% dropout rate, this estimate indicated that at least 72 recruited patients were required for the present study.</p></sec></sec><sec><label>3</label><title>Results</title><p>In the present study, out of the 139 participants who were initially screened, 67 were excluded. Of the 67 patients who were excluded, 49 did not meet the inclusion criteria and 18 declined to participate. The remaining 72 patients (36 for each group) were enrolled. The efficacy and safety of the treatments were evaluated for all patients. Eleven participants withdrawn from the study.

First, this study was randomized thereby reducing selection bias. Second, the SCCCR and CCCR doses used were within the therapeutic range, which might contribute to the reasonable safety profile achieved in this study.</p><p>On the other hand, this study sill has several limitations. First, it had quite small sample size. In addition, only Chinese patients were included in this study, so it just reflected the efficacy and safety of Chinese patients with NSCLC. Finally, this study only focused on the disease stage of IIIA and IIIB. Future studies should also test the other disease stage of NSCLC.</p><p>In conclusion, this study demonstrated the promising efficacy and the very favorable toxicity profile for SCCCR in Chinese patients with NSCLC.
