For example, anionic and amphoteric surfactants are effective emulsifying and foaming agents, but in certain instances, they are less mild than nonionic surfactants and may have the potential to cause irritation.<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Furthermore, surfactants can penetrate through the stratum corneum (SC) and interact with proteins and lipids in the epidermis,<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> resulting in skin tightness, skin dryness, epidermal barrier damage, erythema, irritation, and itching.<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p><p>In those with atopic dermatitis (AD), use of a cleanser with traditional surfactants can exacerbate the disease, leading to a loss of intracellular lipids and skin with a red, scaly appearance. Further damage to skin in those with AD can lead to exposure of dermal nerve endings and itching, burning, and pain.<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Facial rosacea is also associated with an overly permeable skin barrier, and as a result, these individuals have a lower tolerance to many skin care products and cosmetics.<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> For these reasons, gentle skin cleansing is of particular importance to adults with acne, atopic dermatitis, eczema, rosacea, or other dermatologic conditions associated with compromised skin barrier integrity.<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p><p>Early soaps consisted of the salts of fatty acids and were derived from plant or animal triglycerides in combination with base, typically lye. Although soaps are effective cleansers, alkaline soaps can increase skin surface pH<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> and can dissolve fat-soluble and water-soluble components from the surface of skin.<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Because of these properties, alkaline cleansers have greater potential to irritate skin than neutral cleansers<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> and can adversely affect the skin&#x02019;s barrier repair mechanism.<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Liquid detergents enable the creation of liquid surfactant solutions at pHs below seven and enable less damage and dying of the skin. Addition of cationic polymers to skin cleansers can further protect the skin and improve moisturization.<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> To further improve cleanser mildness, adding hydrophobically modified polymers (HMPs) to cleansers that contain surfactants can help to create polymer&#x02013;surfactant complexes that are even less irritating to the SC lipid barrier.<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> HMPs interact with the hydrophobic tails of other surfactants, leading to the formation of larger surfactant structures and a reduction in the surfactant dynamics. HMPs also lower the effective concentration of free surfactant micelles in solution and facilitate foam formation.<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p><p>In this study, we describe the results of a clinical study that tested the tolerance and efficacy of a facial cleanser with HMPs against a gentle nonfoaming commercial facial cleanser. The goal of the study was to investigate and compare the tolerability of these cleansers in women with sensitive skin (e.g., AD, eczema, rosacea, or acne) as well as to evaluate efficacy of the cleansers to remove facial dirt, cosmetics, and sebum.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>This was a randomized, prospective, double-blind, comparative study designed to assess the tolerability and efficacy of a test liquid gentle foaming facial cleanser compared to a commercial liquid gentle nonfoaming facial cleanser commonly recommended by dermatologists. Female subjects were recruited from a private practice database of patients who possessed the desired dermatologic conditions required for entry into this sensitive skin study. The study protocol was approved by an independent ethics committee and was conducted in compliance with the current standards and principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonization Guideline for Good Clinical Practice. Prior to enrolling in the study, all women provided written informed consent. The subjects were compensated for their travel and time at the rate of $50 per visit for each completed visit.</p><p>Healthy female adults (aged 18&#x02013;65&#x000a0;years) with mild-to-moderate AD, eczema, acne, or rosacea within the previous 90&#x000a0;days (assessed by a dermatologist) were eligible to participate in the study. Mild-to-moderate AD was defined as atopy (hay fever, asthma, or eczema), recurrent dermatitis (past or present), recurrent itching, and history of recurrent dermatitis in the flexural areas within the previous 90&#x000a0;days. In the absence of any of the symptoms named above, AD was also diagnosed if at least two of the following conditions were present: onset of disease during infancy; nipple dermatitis; condition worsens with sweating or stress; recurrent hand dermatitis (past or present); cheilitis; allergies to food, pets, or pollen; or skin easily irritated by any of the following: soaps, detergents, household cleansers, solvents, cosmetics, or perfumes/fragrances.</p><p>Mild-to-moderate active rosacea was defined as having 3&#x02013;4 inflammatory papules and mild-to-moderate erythema within the previous 90&#x000a0;days. Mild-to-moderate active eczema was defined as having mild-to-moderate dryness, scaling, and erythema within the previous 90&#x000a0;days. Mild-to-moderate active acne was defined as having a minimum of 3&#x02013;4 inflammatory papules and 10 noninflammatory comedones within the previous 90&#x000a0;days. Women were required to continue their normal course of treatment for preexisting conditions throughout the study, substitute the assigned product for their usual facial cleanser for the duration of the study, and use birth control during the study (if needed). If a woman was using an oral or topical medication at the beginning of the study, no restrictions were placed on her use of the medication.</p><p>Women were excluded from the study if they met any of the following conditions: occurrence of skin disease other than AD, eczema, rosacea, or acne; occurrence of other medical conditions that might interfere with skin evaluations; occurrence of disease that might pose a risk to participating panelists; occurrence of clinically significant unstable medical disorder; use of topical therapy or medication other than hydrocortisone or triamcinolone 0.1% cream within 96&#x000a0;h of the study; pregnancy or intention to become pregnant; active lactation; participation in another study or trial &#x02264;30&#x000a0;days prior to enrolling in the study; use of an indoor tanning booth; unwilling or unable to comply with the requirements of the study protocol.</p><p>The study took place in a dermatology clinic and the routine setting of a woman&#x02019;s home. Participating women were divided equally into two groups. During randomization, study participants were stratified and balanced for demographics and the presence and severity of acne, eczema, rosacea, and atopic dermatitis. Women in each group were instructed to use their assigned liquid facial cleanser at least once daily for 3&#x000a0;weeks and to apply the cleanser to the face only and avoid the eye and mouth. Specifically, subjects were asked to wash their face with the provided test cleanser and then pat their face dry. They were allowed to use any nonmedicated facial moisturizer and normal-colored facial cosmetics. Subjects were reminded to not change their normal moisturizer or cosmetics during the study.</p><p>They were instructed not to share the test products with other household members. Study participants kept diaries that were collected and reviewed during each study visit. Diaries were used to insure that study participants were compliant and were using the facial cleanser as directed. Participants visited the study clinic at baseline and after weeks 1 and 3.</p><p>In this report, we describe the results from women who received a test liquid gentle foaming facial cleanser or a benchmark commercial gentle nonfoaming facial cleanser commonly recommended by dermatologists. The test foaming facial cleanser contained the HMP potassium acrylates copolymer, glycerin, and a surfactant system primarily containing cocamidopropyl betaine and lauryl glucoside (Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Gel Cleanser; Neutrogena Corp. Los Angeles CA, USA) prepared without fragrance. The commercial nonfoaming facial cleanser did not contain HMP (Cetaphil&#x000ae; Gentle Skin Cleanser; Galderma Laboratories, L.P., Fort Worth, TX, USA).</p><p>The primary endpoint of the study was the investigator-assessed presence or absence of facial irritation attributes (e.g., stinging, erythema, burning) or the worsening of eczema, atopic dermatitis, acne, or rosacea after 3&#x000a0;weeks of liquid facial cleanser use. Secondary endpoints included the investigator-led assessment of facial dirt removal and the removal of cosmetics and sebum following the use of each facial cleanser. Clinicians also evaluated facial skin softness, smoothness, irritation, erythema, and desquamation at each study visit. The presence of comedones and clogged pores was assessed for comedogenic potential of the cleansers. Global disease severity was visually rated by the dermatologist investigator as an overall assessment of skin condition independently from the other evaluation criteria. Facial skin attributes were assessed by clinicians using a five-point ordinal scale (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Ordinal scores at baseline and weeks 1 and 3 were used to calculate the percent change in facial skin attributes at weeks 1 and 3 from baseline. Direct comparisons between the facial cleansers were made throughout the study to evaluate and compare the relative performance of each cleanser.</p><table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Clinician and subject assessment scoring</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Evaluator</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Classification</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Score</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="5" colspan="1">Clinician</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">None</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Minimal</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mild</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Moderate</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Severe</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="5" colspan="1">Subject</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">None</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Minimal</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Good</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Excellent</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Superior</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>In addition to clinician assessments, study participants also assessed their skin and the performance of each facial cleanser throughout the study. The participants were asked to agree or disagree with specific statements about the efficacy of each facial cleanser at the 1- and 3-week time points. They also assessed facial cleanser tolerability and the change in symptoms associated with eczema, atopic dermatitis, acne, or rosacea throughout the study. They evaluated skin softness, smoothness, cleanliness, rich lather, overall cleansing experience, radiance, and the removal of facial dirt, cosmetics, and sebum. The women participants used an ordinal evaluation scale for self-assessments (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).

Clinicians rated various clinical aspects of skin conditions, such as erythema, irritation, global disease severity, smoothness, and softness, and consistently rated the test foaming cleanser with HMP to effectively improve symptoms at both the 1- and 3-week (primary endpoint) test periods. Irritation was reported by more users of the commercial nonfoaming cleanser than was reported by users of the test foaming cleanser with HMP. The subjects performed self-assessments that evaluated different endpoints. Self-assessment scores related to cleansing properties and improvements in skin characteristics were greater with the test foaming cleanser than with the commercial nonfoaming cleanser, although the differences were not statistically significant. These results indicated that the test cleanser with HMP was able to significantly improve clinician assessment of skin attributes from baseline values, effectively perform as a cleanser, and provide adequate lather. It also appeared to be as tolerable as the commercial nonfoaming cleanser.</p><p>Cleanser-induced irritation, skin tightness, and skin dryness are all associated with impaired skin barrier properties and penetration of surfactants into the SC.<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Mild moisturizing cleansers are expected to provide cleansing benefits without negatively altering the hydration and viscoelastic properties of skin.<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Formulators can use combinations of surfactants to create cleansers that are milder, which may be particularly ideal for individuals with AD.<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> For example, facial cleansers containing a blend of anionic and amphoteric surfactants can be formulated to be milder than cleansers containing a weight-equivalent proportion of anionic surfactant.<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Although gentle facial cleansers are effective at cleansing and removing makeup and other unwanted substances from skin, they are ineffective at generating foam, which may be less preferred by consumers.<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p><p>In addition to reducing the extent of surfactant penetration into the skin and thus reducing the potential for skin irritation,<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> HMPs and HMP&#x02013;surfactant complexes are surface active and can improve foaming by stabilizing the air&#x02013;water interface of bubbles.<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> In this way, HMP addition to surfactant-containing cleansers can both reduce the potential for skin irritation and improve foam and lather, a quality usually associated with traditional soaps. The ability to combine low irritation potential with foaming is a positive attribute of HMP-containing cleansers.</p><p>In conclusion, the test foaming cleanser with HMPs offers a new cleansing option for adults with sensitive skin. The test foaming facial cleanser with HMPs was effective and well accepted by most women in the study. The improvements in the evaluated skin categories that were reported by both clinicians and subjects using the test foaming facial cleanser were comparable to those observed in the subjects using the commercial nonfoaming cleanser.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="b1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group
