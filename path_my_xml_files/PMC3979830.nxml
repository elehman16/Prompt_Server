All subjects received basiliximab induction, mycophenolate mofetil, and corticosteroids. Safety and efficacy follow-up data through 4 years are reported.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Evaluations included patient and graft survival, study drug discontinuations, laboratory values including renal function and development of new-onset diabetes after transplantation, concomitant medications, and adverse events.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>At study termination, 129 Astagraf XL, 113 Prograf, and 79 CsA patients had continued follow-up. Demographic and baseline characteristics were similar in all arms. Four-year Kaplan-Meier estimates of patient survival in the Astagraf XL, Prograf, and CsA groups were 93.2, 91.2, and 91.7%, respectively, while graft survival was 84.7, 82.7, and 83.9%, respectively. At least one serious adverse event was reported in the majority of patients in each group during the study (65.9% Astagraf XL, 69.8% Prograf, and 65.6% CsA). Renal function was not significantly different between Astagraf XL and Prograf. HgbA1c levels were collected every 6 months; the 4-year Kaplan-Meier estimate for incidence of HgbA1c levels &#x02265;6.5% was significantly higher for both tacrolimus formulations compared to CsA; 41.1% (Astagraf XL), 33.6% (Prograf), and 21.3% (CsA).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this 4-year follow-up report, patients receiving Astagraf XL and Prograf showed comparable efficacy and safety profiles, with a higher incidence of new-onset diabetes after transplantation but superior renal function compared to patients receiving CsA.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>De novo kidney transplantation</kwd><kwd>Tacrolimus</kwd><kwd>Long-term follow-up</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>OPEN-ACCESS</meta-name><meta-value>TRUE</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Tacrolimus immediate-release (Prograf; Astellas Pharma US, Inc., Northbrook, IL), a twice-daily immunosuppressive agent to prevent graft rejection, has well-defined safety and efficacy profiles (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><italic>1</italic></xref>). However, dosing nonadherence can contribute to graft rejection and late graft loss (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr"><italic>2, 3</italic></xref>). To improve treatment adherence, a tacrolimus extended-release formulation (Astagraf XL in the US, formerly called MR or MR4, and approved as Advagraf, Graceptor, and Prograf-XL in other countries) was developed for once-daily dosing (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><italic>1</italic></xref>). Comparable steady-state systemic tacrolimus exposure with the two formulations in stable and de novo kidney and liver transplant patients has been demonstrated, allowing monitoring by trough levels as a surrogate for area under the drug concentration-time curve (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr"><italic>4, 5</italic></xref>). A large, randomized, open-label study was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Astagraf XL compared to Prograf and cyclosporine modified (Neoral; Pharmaceuticals Corp., East Hanover, NJ; CsA) when administered in combination with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), corticosteroids, and basiliximab induction in de novo kidney transplant recipients (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><italic>1</italic></xref>). One-year results were published in 2007 (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><italic>1</italic></xref>). Two-year data showed no unexpected safety or efficacy signals with Astagraf XL in renal transplant recipients (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr"><italic>6</italic></xref>). Since then, extended-release tacrolimus has been approved in 74 countries for prevention of rejection after kidney transplantation. Herein, we report 4-year follow-up results of the original study.</p><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>This was a 1-year efficacy and safety study (beginning in June 2003) followed by a clinical continuation phase.</p><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Patient Disposition</title><p>In the Astagraf XL, Prograf, and CsA groups, 226, 219, and 223 patients, respectively, were randomized; of those patients, 214, 212, and 212, respectively, received at least one dose of study drug.

Higher rates of patients experienced tremor leading to change in study drug in the Astagraf XL (12.6%) and Prograf (10.8%) groups than in the CsA group (4.2%).

Evidence from this trial showed similar efficacy between regimens over 48 months&#x02019; follow-up. Patient and graft survival rates were high (&#x0003e;90 and &#x0003e;80%, respectively) with no statistically significant pairwise comparison differences between groups; however, this study included a relatively low-risk population. Adherence was not evaluated; dropout resulting from noncompliance was similar between treatment arms. The higher rate of graft loss in black subjects at 4 years in all three treatment arms is compatible with 5-year data from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr"><italic>8</italic></xref>).</p><p>Long-term efficacy observed is similar to recent studies. In the European multicenter study in kidney transplant recipients, 1-year patient and graft survival in the Advagraf arm were 96.9 and 91.5%, respectively (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr"><italic>4</italic></xref>), and 98.6 and 96.7% in the current study. In two large kidney transplant trials, 3-year results have been reported. In the SYMPHONY study, patient and graft survival in the low-dose tacrolimus arm were 95 and 90%, respectively (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr"><italic>9</italic></xref>). In the belatacept trial, patient survival with functioning graft in two calcineurin-free belatacept arms and the CsA arm were 92, 92, and 89%, while graft survival rates were approximately 87, 88, and 84%, respectively (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr"><italic>10</italic></xref>). In the current study, 3-year patient survival rates in the Astagraf XL, Prograf, and CsA arms was 95.5, 93.2, and 93.9%, and graft survival rates were 89.7, 87.9, and 88.0%, respectively.</p><p>Renal function was significantly better over 4 years for Astagraf XL than CsA when calculated by both the Cockroft-Gault and MDRD formulas; Prograf was significantly better than CsA only using the MDRD formula. The lack of interaction between time and treatment (test for interaction: <italic>P</italic>&#x02265;0.8779) indicated that there was no evidence of differing rates of improvement in renal function over time between the treatment groups (i.e., the slope over time was similar between treatment groups); therefore, average differences in renal function were consistent after the kidney stabilized and were maintained through 4 years post-transplant. Having adjusted for month 1 renal function and time, this analysis supports the conclusion that Astagraf XL showed a benefit in renal function which was maintained through the horizon of collected data. However, the sponsor supplied Astagraf XL for the duration of the study and Prograf and CsA for only the first year. Other studies have shown better renal function with tacrolimus than CsA (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr"><italic>11, 12</italic></xref>).</p><p>The incidence of new onset diabetes after transplant (NODAT) was significantly higher in tacrolimus arms, and the 1-year difference persisted throughout follow-up. Between the tacrolimus arms, no meaningful difference in the incidence of diabetes markers existed. The higher incidence of NODAT with tacrolimus than CsA has been widely documented in literature (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr"><italic>11, 13&#x02013;15</italic></xref>). The long-term relevance of NODAT with Astagraf XL and extrapolations to other populations should be interpreted with caution and evaluated further. Comparative rates of NODAT with tacrolimus formulations have been reported in two other large clinical trials. In patients without a history of or baseline diabetes mellitus, the OSAKA trial reported NODAT in 16.1% of 274 patients treated with Prograf and 13.2% of 265 patients receiving the same dose of Astagraf XL (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr"><italic>16</italic></xref>). In the European study (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr"><italic>4</italic></xref>), the rate was 20.5% in both treatment arms, similar to the 1-year rates of 21.0 and 23.3% in Astagraf XL and Prograf, respectively, in this study. In addition, a systematic review of once-daily versus twice-daily tacrolimus revealed no statistically significant difference in NODAT incidence between formulations (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr"><italic>17</italic></xref>).</p><p>Data for cytomegalovirus (CMV) and human polyomavirus infections were only collected by AE reporting. Incidence of CMV infections was similar between treatment arms. The absence of systematic reporting for CMV disease likely contributed to the low rate of CMV infections.</p><p>Human polyomavirus infections and changes in study drug dose were numerically more frequently reported in patients on tacrolimus than CsA. The same caveat as for the CMV infections applies because systematic reporting was not done. If a difference in the incidence of human polyomavirus infections existed, it could be related to concomitant dosing with MMF and the pharmacokinetic interaction between CsA and mycophenolate acid, which was not as widely known, and to MMF given at the same dose to patients on tacrolimus and CsA (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr"><italic>18</italic></xref>).</p><p>Statistical comparisons of treatment groups within the continuation phase should be interpreted with caution. As shown in the patient disposition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>), fewer patients entered the &#x0201c;clinical continuation&#x0201d; from CsA (151) compared to Astagraf XL (182). Additionally, the Prograf and CsA arms included 22 patients classified as &#x0201c;withdrawal of consent&#x0201d; during the continuation phase whereas three patients in the Astagraf XL group had this classification for reasons for discontinuation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). There was a difference by treatment arm in the amount of missing data and therefore censoring in the continuation phase of the study, which may be informative rather than random. It is also likely that these findings relate to the commercial availability of Prograf and CsA and not Astagraf XL and because the sponsor supplied Astagraf XL for the duration of the study and only for the first year in subjects randomized to Prograf and CsA. Given this difference in missing data, censoring by treatment arm, and the potential for informative censoring, comparisons between groups may be biased or confounded.</p><p>The long-term safety profile of each treatment regimen in this study was consistent with extended use of immunosuppressive regimens in transplant recipients. These findings provide long-term follow-up and confirmation of 1-year findings in de novo renal transplant recipients for administration of Astagraf XL in combination with MMF and steroids.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>Silva et al. (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><italic>1</italic></xref>) describes detailed methodology for the first year of this study; a summary is provided below. This was a randomized, open-label, comparative study in de novo kidney transplant recipients &#x02265;12 years of age. Eligible patients were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of three parallel treatment groups:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Astagraf XL</p></list-item><list-item><p>Prograf</p></list-item><list-item><p>CsA</p></list-item></list><p>Dose adjustments of primary immunosuppressants were allowed on the basis of clinical evidence of efficacy, occurrence of AEs, and whole blood trough concentrations. All patients were to receive basiliximab induction therapy (20 mg iv on day 0 and a second dose between day 3 and 5) and corticosteroid treatment.</p><p>All patients were to receive MMF and corticosteroids concomitantly with study drug. The MMF dose was 1 g twice daily (bid) (1.5 g bid was permitted in black patients) throughout the study. Dose-equivalent bid, three times daily, or four times daily dosing was permitted if tolerability was a concern.</p><p>Patients could cross over to another regimen within the study to address AEs or severe refractory rejection that led to discontinuation of study drug; however, crossover to the Astagraf XL arm was not permitted. Patients who crossed over to another regimen or discontinued primary study drug (but did not withdraw consent) were to be followed throughout.</p><p>Patients were evaluated frequently during the first year and were eligible to continue the clinical continuation upon completion. The first visit of the clinical continuation phase occurred at month 18 with subsequent visits every 6 months for safety and efficacy follow-up. However, biopsy-proven acute rejection data were only collected as AE reporting past year 1.</p><p>All patients who received at least one dose of study drug were analyzed. Treatment-emergent AEs (reported as starting from first dose of study drug through the end of study) were summarized. Patient and graft survival were presented through 4 years posttransplant using Kaplan-Meier analysis with censoring on the day of last follow-up. Kaplan-Meier analysis was also used to analyze events of HgbA1c &#x02265;6.5% through 4 years with last follow-up visit used as censoring time for those without an observed event. Renal function over 4 years was assessed using a repeated measures mixed-model analysis of covariance with treatment and scheduled visit as factors while adjusting for month 1 renal function. In this analysis, the month 1 renal function was used as a surrogate for baseline covariate to allow this parameter to stabilize following kidney transplantation; therefore, claims for posttransplant differences between treatment arms have accounted for any differences present at month 1. The effect of time was also adjusted for by the model.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>This study was supported by Astellas Pharma US, Inc., Northbrook, IL.
