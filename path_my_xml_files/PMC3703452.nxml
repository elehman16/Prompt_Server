Hemodynamic impairment and thromboembolic events related to AF result in significant morbidity, mortality, and increase medical financial burden. So far, treatment of AF remains unsatisfactory. Pharmacological approaches for cardioversion and maintaining sinus rhythm in patients with AF appear simple but are less efficacious. The major risk related to antiarrhythmia medicine is the considerable potential drug toxicity and proarrhythmic effects. Cardiac radiofrequency catheter ablation of AF has developed rapidly in recent years, but the success rate still remains relatively low, especially in persistent AF patients. The higher recurrence of AF is also a big challenge in short- and long-term follow-up. In addition, the complications associated with AF ablation procedures are likely to result in prolonged hospitalization, long-term disability or death. Hypertension is the most important risk factor for AF, and increases the risk of thromboembolic complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In patients with AF, aggressive treatment of hypertension may retard or prevent the occurrence of AF. Recently, many clinical researchers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] have verified that catheter-based renal sympathetic denervation (RSD) could be safely used to substantially reduce blood pressure, left ventricular hypertrophy and sleep apnea severity, and improve glucose tolerance. Simultaneously, a marked reduction in muscle and whole-body sympathetic nerve activity is apparent, with a decrease in renal and whole-body norepinephrine spillover. Left ventricle hypertrophy, left atrium enlargement, high norepinephrine level, glucose tolerance abnormality and obstructive sleep apnea are all recognized as independent risk factors for the development and recurrence of AF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Thus, we designed this randomized, parallel-control, multicenter clinical study to demonstrate whether RSD is superior to antiarrhythmic drugs (AAD) in reducing AF burden and blood pressure in patients with drug-resistant hypertension and symptomatic AF.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>General</title><p>The RSDforAF trial is a randomized, controlled, parallel, multicentre study. Patients with drug-resistant hypertension and symptomatic AF are randomly assigned to the medical antiarrhythmic and antihypertensive treatment group or the RSD group, with 50% of the patients assigned to each treatment arm. The first patient was randomized in July 2012. A total of 200 patients will be included and followed for a period of 12&#x000a0;months after inclusion. Enrollment is expected to be completed by October 2014. This study is designed to assess the safety and efficacy of RSD in patients with hypertension and symptomatic AF. The trial is registered at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov">http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>, registry number: NCT01713270. The independent medical ethics committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University has approved this RSDforAF trial protocol, with the approval number 2012-SR-080.

After standard femoral vascular access, contrast renal angiography was performed to localize and assess the renal arteries for accessibility and appropriateness for RSD. Once the anatomy was deemed acceptable, the internally irrigated radiofrequency ablation catheter (Celcius Thermocool, Biosense Webster, Diamond Bar, CA, USA) was introduced into each renal artery. This was then maneuvered within the renal artery to allow energy delivery in a circumferential, longitudinally staggered manner to minimize the chance of renal artery stenosis. About four to eight ablations at 10&#x000a0;W for 60&#x000a0;seconds each were performed in both renal arteries. During ablation, the catheter system monitored tip temperature and impedance, altering radiofrequency energy delivery in response to a predetermined algorithm. Visceral pain at the time of energy delivery was managed with 0.05 to 0.1&#x000a0;mg intravenous fentanyl. After renal sympathetic denervation, patients with persistent AF accepted direct-current cardioversion immediately.</p><p>If clinically indicated, class IC AAD treatment (propafenone) is a first-line therapy for patients without contraindications, otherwise amiodarone is the drug of choice, and also metoprolol may be prescribed. If necessary, AAD can be supplemented by agents such as digoxin, diltiazem and metoprolol that slow the atrioventricular conduction. Combination of several AAD is not allowed. Recommended drugs are shown in Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>. After 3&#x000a0;months, AAD treatment is discontinued. Efforts will be made to document any relapse of symptomatic arrhythmia by either 12-lead electrocardiogram or Holter monitoring.

To account for an approximate 20% premature withdrawal rate prior to the 12-month time point, 180 patients will be randomized.

No death has occurred and there has been no documented lasting damage to a kidney. The most common side effect we have observed is bruising at the groin. Other rare but potentially more serious side effects that have been described are as follows:</p><p>1. Acute renal artery dissection. This can usually be dealt with by placing a stent in the damaged artery.</p><p>2. Persistent abdominal pain lasting beyond the time of the procedure.</p><p>3. Low heart rate.</p><p>4. Large drop in blood pressure. This may require patients to stay in hospital for a few days to adjust their medication.</p><p>5. Damage to the artery in the groin. This occurs in about 1% of cases. Blood transfusion or rarely a small procedure or operation to the artery may be required.</p><p>6. Risk of failure to respond to renal sympathetic denervation in 10 to 15% of cases.</p><p>Other possible side effects that have not been seen with RSD, but which can occur after any procedure where an artery is catheterized include an allergic reaction to the X&#x02012;ray contrast, or contrast-induced nephropathy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Cardiac catheter ablation for AF has become a very commonly and widely accepted procedure in recent years, but the low success rate and high recurrence after procedure in the short and long term is disappointing. A recent report of the long-term success rate in patients with symptomatic drug-refractory AF ablated at a prestigious institution was dismal at 23% after 6&#x000a0;years of follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. When Cosedis and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] compared radiofrequency catheter ablation with AAD therapy as first-line treatment in patients with paroxysmal AF, there was no significant difference between the ablation and drug therapy groups in the cumulative burden of AF over a period of 2&#x000a0;years. Furthermore, left atrial ablation probably leads to serious complications, including cardiac perforation, stroke, pulmonary vein stenosis, and atrial esophageal fistula formation.</p><p>So far, the most common risk factor of AF is hypertension. Research on Chinese hospitalized patients revealed that more than half of AF sufferers had the co-morbidity of hypertension. Hypertension is associated with left ventricular hypertrophy, impaired ventricular filling, left atrial pressure increases, left atrial enlargement, and slowing of atrial electrical conduction velocity. These changes in cardiac structure and electrical characters, also called remodeling, favor the development and maintenance of AF. AF itself increases the risk of thromboembolic complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Based on 38-year follow-up data from the Framingham Study, echocardiographic predictors of AF include left atrial enlargement (39% increase in risk per 5&#x000a0;mm increment) and left ventricular wall thickness (28% per 4&#x000a0;mm increment) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Another study examined the impact of increasing atrial pressure on pulmonary vein muscle sleeve activation, and found that, as left atrial pressure was increased above 10&#x000a0;cmH<sub>2</sub>O, the left atrial&#x02013;pulmonary vein junction became the source of dominant rotors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In addition, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system activity increased in hypertensive heart disease. Angiotensin II is a well characterized profibrotic molecule, giving rise to atrial fibrosis and conduction heterogeneity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Lau and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] have confirmed that hypertension is associated with early and progressive changes in atrial remodeling. Atrial remodeling occurs at different time domains in chronic hypertension with significant electro-structural correlation of the remodeling cascade. Antihypertensive treatment at an early stage may prevent formation of a substrate capable of maintaining AF.</p><p>Sympathetic nerve activity is crucial for initiation and maintenance of systemic hypertension. It plays an important role in the development and maintenance of AF. Animal models indicated that beta-adrenergic stimulators agents (isoproterenol and adrenaline) can increase the occurrence rate of AF by programmed electrical stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In a study by Oraland and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], among the 80 patients with paroxysmal AF, persistent AF was induced in 67 patients (84%) by isoproterenol. Recently, clinical studies have verified that metoprolol was effective in preventing relapse into AF or atrial flutter after cardioversion of persistent AF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Both local and international scholars found that significant nerve sprouting and sympathetic hyperinnervation were present in animal models of sustained AF produced by prolonged right atrial pacing. Over-activity and inhomogeneous distribution of regional sympathetic nerve play an important role in AF induction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>Sympathetic activation of the heart increases calcium entry and the spontaneous release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, and thus shortens the action potential duration and atrial refractory period. Abnormal intracellular calcium handling and short action potential durations are key features of electrophysiological remodeling in AF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In 2012, using animal models, Zhao and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] reported that episodes of AF could be decreased by renal sympathetic denervation during short-term rapid atrial pacing. This effect might have a relationship with the decreased activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. In a swine model for obstructive sleep apnea, renal denervation displayed antiarrhythmic effects by attenuation of negative-tracheal-pressure-induced atrial effective refractory period shortening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Therefore, AF inducibility was reduced, and simultaneously, postapneic blood pressure rises were inhibited. In another study with 12 swine undergoing renal denervation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], heart rate as well as atrioventricular nodal conduction was reduced during sinus rhythm. After 30&#x000a0;minutes of atrial tachypacing, the duration of induced AF episodes was significantly shortened compared with sham controls . Accordingly, we hypothesize that renal sympathetic denervation could have a salutary effect on AF patterns in patients with hypertension by improving blood pressure control and by reducing central sympathetic cardiac driving.</p><p>Renal sympathetic denervation is a newly available therapeutic option for drug-resistant hypertension. In 2009, the Australian researchers Krum and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] reported for the first time that percutaneous renal sympathetic denervation acquired positive and sustained blood pressure reduction in patients with resistant hypertension. Post-procedure office systolic/diastolic pressures were reduced by 32/14&#x000a0;mmHg at 24&#x000a0;months, without serious adverse events. Later, Witkowski and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] studied 10 patients with refractory hypertension and sleep apnea who underwent renal denervation and completed 6-month follow-up evaluations. Significant decreases in office systolic and diastolic blood pressures were observed; plasma glucose concentration 2&#x000a0;hours after glucose administration and the hemoglobin A1C level, as well as the apnea-hypopnea index at 6&#x000a0;months, were also decreased remarkably. In addition to the known effect on blood pressure, the study by Brandt and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] showed renal denervation significantly reduces left ventricular mass and improves diastolic function. In another study, there was a marked reduction in muscle and whole-body sympathetic nerve activity, with a decrease in renal and whole-body norepinephrine spillover [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Left ventricle hypertrophy, left atrial enlargement, high norepinephrine levels, glucose tolerance abnormality and obstructive sleep apnea are all recognized as independent risk factors for the development and recurrence of AF. Recently, a case was reported with renal artery ablation instead of pulmonary vein ablation in an uncontrolled hypertensive patient with symptomatic, drug-resistant persistent AF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Six months later, the patient presented marked improvement in symptoms and exercise capacity, and was still free of symptoms and in normal sinus rhythm; echocardiography showed a progressive decrease of the left atrial diameter from 45&#x000a0;mm just prior to renal ablation to 40 and 36&#x000a0;mm at 3 and 6&#x000a0;months thereafter, respectively. Pokushalov and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] found that, at 1&#x000a0;year follow-up, the success rate (that is, being AF free) for the combined procedure was achieved in 9 of the 13 patients (69%) treated with pulmonary vein isolation and renal artery denervation as compared with only 4 of 14 patients (29%) in those treated with only pulmonary vein isolation.</p><p>Should renal artery denervation be part of the ablation procedure for all patients undergoing catheter ablation for the treatment of AF, or should renal artery denervation be performed instead of left atrial ablation? Larger clinical studies are needed to help answer these questions. The RSDforAF trial is testing the hypothesis that RSD is superior to AAD in reducing AF burden and blood pressure in patients with drug-resistant hypertension and symptomatic AF.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial status</title><p>The trial is registered at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov">http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>, registry number: NCT01713270.
