FLS can lead to poor treatment adherence and early IFN&#x003b2; discontinuation. The involvement of interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the occurrence of FLS has been suggested. We hypothesized that cetirizine, a second-generation histamine H1 receptor antagonist able to reduce the levels of IL-6, might improve IFN&#x003b2;-induced FLS.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><p>We conducted a pilot, cross-over, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study to evaluate the efficacy of cetirizine 10 mg added after each IFN&#x003b2; injection to the standard of care for FLS (acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) on FLS in patients with RRMS treated with IFN&#x003b2;. Patients were randomized to two treatment sequences: 1) 4-week treatment with placebo added to the standard treatment for FLS, followed by 4-week treatment with cetirizine added to the standard of care, and 2) first addition of cetirizine, then of placebo.

IFN&#x003b2; has generally proven to be a well-tolerated drug, with the most frequent adverse events being reactions at the injection site and the flu-like syndrome (FLS) [<xref rid="pone.0165415.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The FLS, which affects approximately 75% of patients injecting IFN&#x003b2;, includes symptoms like fever, chills, muscle pain, weakness, and headache [<xref rid="pone.0165415.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. These symptoms usually occur 3&#x02013;6 hours after IFN&#x003b2; injection and resolve within 24 hours. Their incidence typically declines during the first 3 months of therapy, but in some patients FLS may persist or recur resulting in poor adherence to therapy and early discontinuation of IFN&#x003b2; [<xref rid="pone.0165415.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0165415.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Current strategies to prevent or reduce FLS include injecting IFN&#x003b2; in the evening (to &#x0201c;sleep through&#x0201d; the symptoms), gradual up-titration of IFN&#x003b2;, prophylaxis with acetaminophen or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and, for the most severe cases, low-dose oral corticosteroids [<xref rid="pone.0165415.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0165415.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0165415.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>The mechanisms underlying IFN&#x003b2;-related FLS are largely unknown. The scant evidence available suggests the involvement of interleukin-6 (IL-6), a pro-inflammatory cytokine, as the expression of IL-6 appears to be induced by IFN&#x003b2; [<xref rid="pone.0165415.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0165415.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In the earlier studies investigating the mechanism of IFN&#x003b2;-related FLS, higher levels of IL-6 were shown to correlate with increased severity of FLS [<xref rid="pone.0165415.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0165415.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], while the improvement of FLS observed in RRMS patients following the addition of low-dose steroids to acetaminophen at the onset of IFN&#x003b2; therapy was found to be associated with a decrease in IL-6 induction [<xref rid="pone.0165415.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. IL-6 may therefore be an interesting target in the development of more effective strategies for the management of IFN&#x003b2;-related FLS.</p><p>Cetirizine is a second-generation, long-acting, selective histamine H1 receptor antagonist, with proven efficacy and a favorable safety and tolerability profile in the management of allergic disorders in adults, adolescents and children [<xref rid="pone.0165415.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Cetirizine counteracts the allergic response to antigenic stimuli through several mechanisms including anti-allergic, anti-histaminic, and anti-inflammatory effects [<xref rid="pone.0165415.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In particular, studies <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> have shown that cetirizine reduces eosinophil migration induced by inflammatory mediators, diminishes the expression of adhesion molecules associated with eosinophil migration and the adhesion of eosinophils to epithelial cells, and inhibits the expression of various pro-inflammatory molecules, including IL-6 [<xref rid="pone.0165415.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>We hypothesized that, thanks to its multiple effects on inflammatory responses and its ability to decrease IL-6 secretion, cetirizine given before each IFN&#x003b2; injection might improve or prevent FLS. We tested this hypothesis in a pilot, randomized, placebo controlled, cross-over trial involving patients with RRMS in therapy with IFN&#x003b2; (Flu-LIGHT study, <bold>Flu L</bold>ike <bold>I</bold>nhibition <bold>G</bold>iving anti-<bold>H</bold>istamine <bold>T</bold>herapy).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec007"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec008"><title>Study design</title><p>This was a pilot, cross-over, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase IIIb study <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165415.g001">Fig 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0165415.s002">S1 File</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0165415.s001">S1 Checklist</xref>.

Patients were using following one of the IFN&#x003b2; products: subcutaneous IFN&#x003b2;-1b (Betaferon<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Bayer), subcutaneous IFN&#x003b2;-1a (Rebif<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Merck Serono), and intramuscular IFN&#x003b2;-1a (Avonex<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Biogen). Inclusion criteria were: subjects of both sexes; age &#x02265;18 years and &#x02264;55 years; diagnosis of RRMS; therapy with IFN&#x003b2; for at least 3 months; negative pregnancy test performed no more than 30 days from the baseline visit; FLS-score (FLS-S) &#x02265;2 despite standard therapy for FLS; ability to provide written informed consent for participation in the study; absence of clinically relevant conditions or situations which in the opinion of the investigator would interfere with the study evaluation or with the participation in the study; use of effective birth control methods, or condition of menopause for at least 6 months. Exclusion criteria were: subjects (male or female) potentially fertile not using contraception; pregnant or breastfeeding women; intolerance or known contraindications to the use of cetirizine; hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, Lapp lactase deficiency, glucose-galactose malabsorption; contemporary participation in other studies.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Treatment allocation</title><p>Patients were randomized to two treatment sequences: sequence 1, 4-week treatment with standard therapy for FLS (acetaminophen or NSAIDs) plus placebo, followed by 4-week treatment with standard therapy plus cetirizine 10 mg; and sequence 2, the opposite of sequence 1 (cetirizine in the first period and placebo in the second period). Allocation to the treatment sequence was generated by the Contract Research Organization (CRO) utilizing the completely automated nQuery program to guarantee anonymity and confidentiality. Each subject was assigned a "Unique Trial Subject Code" (UTSC) and a "Personal Identification Code" (PIC). At randomization, each PIC was assigned a randomization number (RN), a sequential number between 01 and 40, which corresponded to the number on the medicinal product used by the subject.</p><p>During the study each subject was therefore identified using the UTSC, the PIC and the CodRand (Randomization Code, consisting of PIC+RN), which was recorded on the questionnaire and patient diary. The randomization list was balanced every four subjects and prepared by the CRO and held in a password-protected file by the person in charge of packaging at the production site, with a copy archived by the CRO. Only the Scientific Director of the CRO and the person controlling packaging at the production site had access to the randomization list until unblinding was authorized by the Pharmacovigilance Service of Biogen Idec Italy Srl. The investigator and staff of the trial center, the Sponsor and the CRO were blind to the sequence throughout the duration of the study.</p><p>Cetirizine 10 mg and placebo (both as oral capsule formulations) were to be taken 1 hour before each injection of IFN&#x003b2;. The dosage of standard therapy for FLS was maintained as stable as possible. Dose and frequency of IFN&#x003b2; therapy were also stable.</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Efficacy evaluation</title><p>Patient assessment visits were scheduled at the following time points: at baseline (enrollment in the study and randomization); at 4 weeks (end of first period of treatment); and at 8 weeks (end of second period of treatment). The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change of FLS severity from before IFN&#x003b2; injection to 4 hours after injection, as assessed by patients on a visual analog scale (VAS) after 4 weeks of therapy within each sequence. Secondary efficacy endpoints were: the mean change in severity of FLS (as assessed using the VAS and the symptom score of FLS, FLS-S) from before IFN&#x003b2; injection to 4&#x02013;6 hours and 12&#x02013;15 hours after injection, over the entire study period; the proportion of patients with a decrease of &#x02265;2 FLS-S points compared to the value before IFN&#x003b2; injection (responders); and the incidence of FLS (defined as the proportion of patients with an increase &#x02265;2 of FLS-S compared with the value before IFN&#x003b2; injection) 4&#x02013;6 hours after injection and 12&#x02013;15 hours after injection during the entire study period. FLS severity was assessed by the patients on a VAS of 10 cm, where 0 indicated no discomfort due to the FLS, and 10 maximum discomfort imaginable due to the FLS. To get the FLS-S score, patients rated the presence and intensity of muscle pain, chills and weakness. Each symptom was evaluated separately, according to the following scale: 0 = absent; 1 = mild, did not interfere with daily activities; 2 = moderate, enough to interfere with daily activities; 3 = severe, required bed rest. Furthermore, the body temperature was recorded to determine the presence of fever using the following scale: 0: &#x0003c;37.3&#x000b0;C; 1: &#x02265;37.3&#x000b0;C and &#x0003c;37.8&#x000b0;C; 2: &#x02265;37.8&#x000b0;C and &#x0003c;38.4&#x000b0;C; 3: &#x02265;38.4&#x000b0;C. Scores of each symptom were added together to get the FLS-S, which thus ranged from 0 to 12. An increase in the total score &#x02265;2 points compared to the pre-injection score was considered positive for the presence of FLS. Patients entered the VAS and FLS-S scores measured 1 hour before IFN&#x003b2; injection, 4&#x02013;6 hours following injection, and 12&#x02013;15 hours following injection in their diaries, for each IFN&#x003b2; injection over 8 weeks. Any change in the dose of analgesics was also recorded in the diary.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Safety evaluation</title><p>Safety and tolerability of cetirizine were monitored during the entire study period. All adverse events and serious adverse events were recorded. In particular, the most common adverse reaction related to the administration of cetirizine (sleepiness) was assessed using the validated Italian translation of the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), at the baseline visit and at the visits at 4 and 8 weeks [<xref rid="pone.0165415.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0165415.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].

Choosing &#x003b1; = 0.05 and &#x003b2; = 0.20 (power = 80%), 34 patients had to be enrolled and treated sequentially in a cross-over design, as reported in the randomization list.

The efficacy analysis was performed on the Intention To Treat (ITT) population (i.e., all patients who received at least one dose of cetirizine or one dose of placebo and had, for both products, at least one evaluation before and after taking the drug; patients who did not have at least these four assessments were not evaluated for efficacy). During this study no major protocol violations/deviations occurred, so the ITT and Per Protocol (PP) populations coincided. It was therefore not necessary to perform additional analysis to check for any discrepancies.</p><p>To assess the primary efficacy endpoint, an analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures was performed, in accordance with a cross-over design. The values considered were the VAS scores collected 4 hours from the last IFN&#x003b2; injection, after 4 weeks of treatment, according to the treatment sequences 1 (placebo/cetirizine) and 2 (cetirizine/placebo). All analyses of the secondary efficacy endpoints were also performed on the ITT population. The mean change in FLS severity was evaluated with an analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures, similarly to the analysis performed for the primary endpoint. The values considered were VAS scores collected after 4&#x02013;6 and after 12&#x02013;15 hours following the last IFN&#x003b2; injection, after each week of treatment according to the treatment sequences 1 or 2. The same analysis was carried out considering the FLS-S score. The proportions of responders (patients with a reduction in FLS-S &#x02265;2 points) were analyzed with methods appropriate for a cross-over design [<xref rid="pone.0165415.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The FLS incidence defined as an increase of &#x02265;2 points in the FLS-S from before IFN&#x003b2; injection to 4&#x02013;6 hours and to 12&#x02013;15 hours following IFN&#x003b2; injection was analyzed as done for the proportion of responders.

The addition of cetirizine to the standard of care for FLS failed to provide a significant benefit compared with placebo. The findings from this pilot study, therefore, do not seem to support our hypothesis that cetirizine, via its multiple modulatory effects on allergic and inflammatory responses that include the down-regulation of IL-6, might alleviate IFN&#x003b2;-induced FLS in RRMS patients not adequately controlled by paracetamol or NSAIDs.</p><p>The adequate treatment of IFN&#x003b2;-induced FLS remains an unmet need in the management of patients with RRMS. FLS, though manageable in many cases, continues to be a common cause of poor adherence to IFN&#x003b2; therapy and early treatment discontinuation, an issue perceived also by patients [<xref rid="pone.0165415.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0165415.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In fact, according to a recent analysis of patient preferences for features of injectable disease modifying therapies for multiple sclerosis, treatment efficacy seems as important as reduction in injection frequency or reduction in some adverse events for patients using injectable medications [<xref rid="pone.0165415.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The relationship between adherence to IFN&#x003b2; therapy and the rates of multiple sclerosis relapse is well established. For example, a recent study comparing relapse rates and healthcare resource utilization in adherent and non-adherent patients found that the IFN&#x003b2;-adherent group tended to have a lower risk of relapse over a 3-year period than the non-adherent group [<xref rid="pone.0165415.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Adherent patients also had a lower risk of visits to the emergency department and hospital admission over the same period [<xref rid="pone.0165415.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>The severity of FLS varies considerably between and within patients. This characteristic of FLS was observed also in our patient population. This great variability might explain, at least in part, the absence of a significant effect of cetirizine compared with placebo on FLS. Also, the reported severity of FLS was mild to moderate on average, which might have precluded the detection of an effect caused by cetirizine. Studies in selected patient populations with a more homogeneous FLS status, and with moderate to severe symptom severity, might be more adequate for investigating the efficacy of a treatment in relieving flu-like symptoms.</p><p>A further limitation of our study was the heterogeneity of IFN&#x003b2; formulations used (intramuscular IFN&#x003b2;-1a, requiring 1 injection weekly; subcutaneous IFN&#x003b2;-1a, 3 injections weekly; subcutaneous IFN&#x003b2;-1b, 1 injection on alternate days), although it must be pointed out that about 70% of our patients used the same IFN&#x003b2; formulation, namely subcutaneous IFN&#x003b2;-1a 44 &#x003bc;g. Different IFN&#x003b2; administration modes resulted in different cetirizine dosages, according to the study protocol. Differences in the frequency of FLS with different IFN&#x003b2; administration modes cannot be excluded either, as the occurrence of FLS appears to correlate with the frequency of IFN&#x003b2; injections. With regard to the serum IFN&#x003b2; levels achieved with different formulations, a recent review of the pharmacokinetic data of the three formulations used in the present study showed that the occurrence of flu-like symptoms after IFN&#x003b2; injection clearly correlates with an increase of IFN&#x003b2; serum concentrations [<xref rid="pone.0165415.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. According to this review, however, the pharmacokinetic characteristics of the different types of IFN&#x003b2; and routes of administration are similar.</p><p>The time of IFN&#x003b2; injection appears to affect the severity of flu-like symptoms. A study comparing the time course of plasma hormone and cytokine levels and the severity of side effects in RRMS patients injecting IFN&#x003b2; in the morning or in the evening found that IFN&#x003b2; administration in the evening resulted in a more rapid increase in IL-6 plasma levels and temperature and was associated with more severe symptoms compared with morning administration [<xref rid="pone.0165415.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In a more recent study, the change of the IFN&#x003b2; injection time from evening to morning improved flu-like symptoms and sleep in a substantial proportion of the study cohort consisting of RRMS patients with persistent IFN&#x003b2;-related FLS [<xref rid="pone.0165415.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Our patients were all taking IFN&#x003b2; in the evening, according to current recommendations, with some patients injecting it in the early evening and others in the late evening. Whether this difference might have had an impact on FLS is currently unclear.</p><p>In the present study, cetirizine 10 mg was administered 1 hour before each injection of IFN&#x003b2;. The pharmacodynamic effect of cetirizine on IL-6 has not been studied in detail and it is currently unknown whether this dosage was sufficient to elicit an effect of cetirizine on IL-6 production, especially in patients on high-dose IFN&#x003b2;. Cetirizine has a rapid onset of action (15&#x02013;180 minutes), with its effects peaking at 4&#x02013;8 hours and persisting for at least 24 hours [<xref rid="pone.0165415.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0165415.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Thanks to these characteristics, cetirizine can be used on-demand for the treatment of clinical symptoms of allergic disorders, but it has been suggested that continuous administration (10 mg, once daily) may be necessary to achieve better efficacy by reducing also the underlying allergic inflammation [<xref rid="pone.0165415.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. A continuous administration of cetirizine may also be required for the control of FLS, at least during the first months of IFN&#x003b2; therapy.</p><p>In a recent attempt to identify genetic factors responsible for the occurrence of FLS, we analyzed whether a single nucleotide polymorphism in the promoter region of the IL-6 gene, known to affect IL-6 levels, would correlate with the incidence of FLS [<xref rid="pone.0165415.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Patients carrying at least one copy of the -174 G&#x0003e;C polymorphism expressed lower levels of IL-6 and were also found to be less prone to develop FLS. Furthermore, in these patients, FLS was less severe. Thus, the presence of at least one C allele at position -174 of the IL-6 gene determines a lower likelihood of developing IFN&#x000df;-related events. It is unknown how many patients in the present study population presented this polymorphism. Additionally, as this was a pilot clinical study we did not plan to investigate the pharmacodynamics of cetirizine in counterbalancing the release of IL-6 induced by IFN&#x000df;, by measuring IL-6 before and after treatment.
