The name of this dental pain was given the prefix &#x0201c;aero&#x0201d; (i.e., aerodontalgia) and was reported for the first time as an in-flight physiologic and pathologic phenomenon at the beginning of the 20<sup>th</sup> century. In the 1940s, with the appearance of scuba, many in-flight manifestations caused by barometric changes were found to be associated with diving as well. Consequently, the prefix was changed to &#x0201c;Baro.&#x0201d;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] Barotrauma is a pathological response to changes in barometric pressure that occur during flying, diving or hyperbaric oxygen therapy.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>]</p><p>In recent years, it has become increasingly common to go to a tropical destination for a holiday. There is often an opportunity to dive. Furthermore, scuba diving is one of the fastest growing sports in the world.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] A diver at 30 m is subjected to four times the pressure encountered on the surface.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] Previous literatures reported that, the pressure changes can affect retention of restoration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] and crown.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] Although this subject is rarely and only briefly discussed in dental text books,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] it is important for a dentist to be aware of the effect of pressure changes on other dental components in term of retentive strength as danger resulting from dislodgement of component during a dive is obvious.</p><p>Endodontically treated teeth may be damaged by decay, excessive wear or previous restorations, resulting in a lack of coronal tooth structure. The restoration of endodontically treated teeth with a significant loss of coronal tooth structure may require the placement of a post to ensure an adequate retention of a core foundation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] The most common luting agents used for cementing post are zinc phosphate, resin, glass ionomer, and resin reinforced glass ionomer cements. The recent trend has been toward resin cements because they increase retention,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] tend to leak less than other cements[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] and provide atleast short term strengthening of the root.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] Some luting resins are used with a separate etchant and primer (etch-and-rinse method), where as others contain an acidic primer in the luting cement (self-etching primer). More recently, a third category has been added (self-adhesive method), in which there is no etching and no primer.</p><p>Amaral <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] found that the glass fiber posts cemented with resin cement and the etch-and-rinse adhesive system presented higher pull out strength when compared to the resin cement with self-etching adhesive and self-adhesive resin cement. Post length and relining procedure are also key factors for improving the retention of glass fiber post.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] Cecchin <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] evaluated the effect of different root canal sealers on the bond strength of glass fiber post cemented with resin cement, found that the eugenol-based sealer inhibit polymerization of resin cement, negatively affecting the bond strength.</p><p>However, whether the pressure variations that the divers are exposed affects the retention of a post is still unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of pressure variations to which scuba divers are subjected on the pull out strength of glass fiber post luted with different luting cements.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>In this <italic>in vitro</italic> study, 120 extracted; single-rooted lower premolars, with straight root canals were selected. The inclusion criteria were: Straight roots; absence of root decay, defects, cracks, and/or previous endodontic treatment; and root length of atleast 15 mm. The selected teeth were cleaned of both calculus deposits and soft tissue using ultrasonic scaler. Each tooth was placed in 5.25% sodium hypochlorite for 2 h for surface disinfection[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] then stored in distilled water and prepared within 1 month of extraction. The coronal portion of each tooth was sectioned at the cemento-enamel junction perpendicular to the longitudinal axis using a slow-speed, water-cooled diamond disc (Isomet 2000, Buehler Ltd., Lake Bluff, IL, USA).</p><p>All root canals were prepared by one trained operator and the root canal of each tooth was explored using a size 06K-File (Dentsply Maillefer, Ballaigues, Switzerland). Roots lesser than 15 mm in length and with significantly smaller or larger root canal spaces were discarded to standardize the extent of dentine preparation for the posts as much as possible. Endodontic treatment was carried out following a standard crown-down technique using the profile system (Dentsply Maillefer, Ballaigues, Switzerland) and the X-Smart-Endo-Motor (Dentsply Maillefer, Ballaigues, Switzerland). The apical foramen was prepared to size 40 and 0.06 taper. The root canal was irrigated between instruments with 2 mL of 5.25% sodium hypochlorite. Final irrigation was carried out with 2 mL of 17% Ethylene Diamine Tetraacetic Acid (EDTA) solution for 3 min followed by 5 mL of distilled water. The root canals were dried with absorbent paper points (Sure Dent Corporation, Seongnamsi Gyeonggi-do, Korea) and filled with epoxy based endodontic sealer (AH Plus, Dentsply Caulk, Milford, DE, USA) and 0.06 taper gutta-percha points (Dia-dent Gutta-percha points, DiaDent Group International, Chongchong Buk Do, Korea) using the cold lateral condensation technique. Extra coronal excess of gutta-percha was removed using the heated instruments. The canal access was sealed with a temporary restorative material (Cavit G, 3M ESPE, St. Paul, MN, USA).</p><p>After storage at 100% humidity for 1 week at 37&#x000b0;C, the coronal seal was abraded by means of #240 Silicon Carbide (SiC) paper under water cooling and the gutta-percha was removed with Largo Peeso Reamer #1 (Dentsply Maillefer, Ballaigues, Switzerland), using the surgical operating microscope (D. F. Vasconcellos, M900-25X, S&#x000e3;oPaulo, Brazil), leaving 5 mm of apical seal. The post space was then prepared with FRC Postec Plus Reamer #1 (Ivoclar Vivadent AG, Schaan, Liechtenstein) to a fixed depth of 10 mm from cement-enamel junction. The canal was irrigated and dried as described previously.</p><p>Each root was embedded into a Poly-Vinyl Chloride (PVC) cylinder (height: 35 mm, diameter: 15 mm) filled with chemically cured acrylic resin (Orthocryl, Dentaurum, Ispringen, Germany) using the following steps: Micro retention were carried out with diamond burs at the apical third of each root, perpendicular to its long axis, promoting retention during the pull out test; FRC Postec Plus Reamer #1 was placed inside the prepared root canal; the reamer (with the root) was attached to an adapted surveyor (Degussa, Geschaftsbereich Dental, Frankfurt, Germany), where the long axes of the reamer, specimen and cylinder were parallel to each other and perpendicular to the ground [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]; the acrylic resin was prepared and poured inside the cylinder upto 3 mm of the most coronal portion of the specimen. Immediately after the acrylic reached its doughy stage, samples were detached from the surveyor and placed into a cool water bath so that polymerization reaction heat from the setting acrylic diffused away from the samples; when the acrylic had cooled to bath temperature, the samples were dried with compressed air and bench dried for 2 h.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Sample being mounted using surveyor</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="DRJ-10-737-g001"/></fig><p>Samples were randomly divided in six groups of 20 samples each, depending on luting cement used for inserting fiber post. FRC Postec Plus glass fiber post #1 (Ivoclar Vivadent AG, Schaan, Liechtenstein) of tip diameter 0.08 mm and head diameter 1.5 mm were tried in. The cements used and detail of luting procedure are described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>. Cements of Groups 1, 2, 3 were inserted into the root canal with Lentulospiral (Dentsply Maillefer, Ballaigues, Switzerland). The posts were inserted as close as possible to the centre of the post space, to maintain as even film thickness of cement circumferentially. The excess of luting material was removed. Dual-cure luting resin cements of Groups 4, 5, 6 were polymerized from the coronal side of the post with Litex 695 (Dentamerica, CA, USA) with a light output not less than 800 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> for 20 s, holding the curing light close to post.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Description of cements used in this study and the application protocols</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="DRJ-10-737-g002"/></table-wrap><p>Each group was randomly divided into two subgroups of 10 samples, one to act as a control, and the other to be used experimentally.

Compressed air was introduced into the pressure pot at a rate of 1 atmosphere/min, allowing the maximum pressure to be reached in 3 min. The posts in the pressure pot were subjected to 3 atmospheres pressure for 3 min and then decompressed over a 3 min period. The 15 cycles were repeated one after the other.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>]</p><p>A hole was prepared in the inferior third of the PVC cylinder for attachment to the inferior portion of a universal testing machine (Star Testing System, Mumbai, India).

The present <italic>in vitro</italic> study was to investigate the effect of pressure variations to which scuba divers are subjected on the pull out strength of glass fiber post luted with different luting cements.</p><p>In the present study, it was found that the pull out strength of glass fiber posts cemented with zinc phosphate and conventional glass ionomer was reduced significantly after pressure cycling. Resin reinforced glass ionomer provided clinically sufficient retention above 200 N, a limit considered as the minimum requirement to ensure clinical success of fiber post[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>] and was not significantly affected by pressure cycling. The pull out strength of fiber posts cemented with resin cements was also not significantly affected by pressure cycling.</p><p>The possible reason for reduction of the retention of glass fiber post cemented with zinc phosphate cement or conventional glass ionomer cement could be associated with Boyle's law, which states that at a constant temperature, the volume of a gas varies inversely with the surrounding pressure.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] Problem arises when the enclosed spaces containing gases cannot expand or contract to adjust the internal pressure to correspond to the outer pressure. During the mixing process of luting cement, air may become incorporated into mixture, forming voids.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>] The expansion or contraction of these microbubles during pressure cycling, which eventually led to disruption and weakening of cement layer, this could affect the retention of the component.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] Davidson <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>] found that micro-cracks appears as a result of volumetric contraction in luting cements, and when subjected to the pressure cycling may have produced tensile stresses that exceeded the cohesive and adhesive strength of the material, resulting in the significant reduction in tensile bond strength. This study confirmed the findings of Musajo <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] and Lyons <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] that the retention of full cast crowns cemented with zinc phosphate and conventional glass ionomer cement was reduced after pressure cycling.</p><p>The retentive strength of glass fiber post cemented with resin modified glass ionomer cement was not significantly affected by pressure cycling; this can be attributed to the higher tensile strength, lower elastic modulus, and greater amount of plastic deformation that can be sustained before fracture.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>] Furthermore, the consistent mixing of the two pastes, always accurately measured with a dispenser, minimizes the variation of mechanical properties of the two paste resin reinforced glass ionomer cements caused by the mixing of powder-liquid type cements.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>] Moreover, the retention of post luted with resin reinforced glass ionomer cement may be related to the frictional retention provided by hygroscopic expansion occurring after cement maturation,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>] which also aids the self-sealing at the dentine-cement interface. The failure mode observed for resin reinforced glass ionomer cement was predominantly adhesive between fiber post and the cement, suggesting the formation of a hybrid layer, and dentine pre-treatment with a weak acid may helped in the removal of the smear layer and increased dentin wetability, there by enhancing adhesion.</p><p>Milutinovi&#x00107;-Nikoli&#x00107; <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>] investigating the porous structure of cements by mercury intrusion porosimetry found that zinc phosphate cement contains higher porosities than glass ionomer cement while resin based cement has the lowest porosities. Davidson <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>] found that the bond strength of resin cement (Panavia Ex) was not significantly affected by volumetric contraction. In a study that used finite element analysis, Kamposiora <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>] found that under normal functional loads, resin cements exhibited less average internal stresses than zinc phosphate cement. Brittle cements, such as zinc phosphate and glass ionomer may be subjected to greater internal stresses than resin cements.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] It is likely therefore that the brittle and porous cements will be affected more by environmental pressure cycling as has been found in this study.</p><p>Resin cement with etch-and-rinse adhesive demonstrated significantly higher pull out strength compared to resin cement with self-etching primer and self-adhesive resin cement. It can be assumed that as a result of the preparation of post space on root dentine, a smear layer is created.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>] A previous study investigating the adhesion of fiber posts to dentine showed that the use of phosphoric acid completely dissolved the smear layer, whereas the weaker self-etching primer revealed only partial dissolution of the layer. Both systems were able to etch the underlying dentine. Self-adhesive resin cement lacks in genuine hybridization of the intact bonding substrates.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>] This is in accordance with the present results, which indicate that the pull out strength values depend on the etching capacity of the adhesive systems used.</p><p>The clinical significance of this study should be tempered by its limitations. First and foremost, the current study ignores the role of the core material and crown upon the retention of a fiber post. Furthermore, the retention strength was evaluated using a single-tensile load rather than a cyclical compressive-tensile load. The pressure in this study was held only for 3 min, whereas in real life a diver would spend a much longer time under water. It would be interesting to investigate the behavior of cements for longer duration of time. Finally, it must be noted that <italic>in vitro</italic> studies are limited in predicting the success of a material or technique in clinical use. Hence, the need for further <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> studies with more similar conditions seems rational.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Within the limitations of this study, it can be concluded that:</p><p>
