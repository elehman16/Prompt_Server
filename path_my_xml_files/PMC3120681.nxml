First we did not know which antidepressant to use as first line treatment. Second we do not know which dosage we should be aiming at with that antidepressant. Because more than half of the patients with major depression starting treatment do not remit after adequate trial with the first agent, they will need a second line treatment. Dose escalation, augmentation and switching are the three often recommended second line strategies but we do not know which is better than the others. Moreover, we do not know when to start considering this second line treatment.</p><p>The recently published multiple-treatments meta-analysis of 12 new generation antidepressants has provided some partial answers to the first question. Starting with these findings, this proposed trial aims to establish the optimum 1st line and 2nd line antidepressant treatment strategy among adult patients with a non-psychotic unipolar major depressive episode.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>SUN(^_^)D, the Strategic Use of New generation antidepressants for Depression, is an assessor-blinded, parallel-group, multi-centre randomised controlled trial. Step I is a cluster-randomised trial comparing titration up to the minimum vs maximum of the recommended dose range among patients starting with sertraline. The primary outcome is the change in the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-9 scores administered by a blinded rater via telephone at week 1 through 3. Step II is an individually randomised trial comparing staying on sertraline, augmentation of sertraline with mirtazapine, and switching to mirtazapine among patients who have not remitted on the first line treatment by week 3. The primary outcome is the change in the PHQ-9 scores at week 4 through 9. Step III represents a continuation phase to Steps I and II and aims to establish longer-term effectiveness and acceptability of the above-examined treatment strategies up to week 25. The trial is supported by the Grant-in-Aid by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, Japan.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>SUN(^_^)D promises to be a pragmatic large trial to answer important clinical questions that every clinician treating patients with major depression faces in his/her daily practices concerning its first- and second-line treatments.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01109693">NCT01109693</ext-link></p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><sec><title>Depression is costly</title><p>Major depression is the 1<sup>st </sup>leading cause of disability adjusted life years (DALY) lost excluding death, and the 3<sup>rd </sup>leading cause of DALY including death in the world according to the most recent WHO estimates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Moreover, this burden is expected to rise in the next 20 years. According to the same estimates, major depression is currently the 1<sup>st </sup>leading cause of DALY excluding death and the 2<sup>nd </sup>leading cause of DALY including death after cerebrovascular disease in Japan, comprising approximately 6% of all DALY lost among its people.</p><p>Major depression is indeed one of the most prevalent mental disorders in the United States and Europe, with 16.2% and 6.6% lifetime prevalence for American women and men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] and with 16.5% and 8.9% for European women and men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In Japan, while the point estimates are lower than in US or Europe, it is still the most prevalent mental disorder for its people, affecting one in 12 women (8.5%) and one in 29 men (3.5%) at least once in their lifetime [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>Both pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy have been found to be equally effective in treating major depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] but the former remains the mainstay in everyday clinical practices due to its greater availability, tighter quality control and cheaper costs. Effective antidepressive agents include heterocyclic antidepressants (HCA), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRI), noradrenalinergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant (NaSSA) and others (such as bupropion). The dramatic rise in the consumption of antidepressants in developed countries in the past two decades has been mainly due to increase in use of SSRI, SNRI and other new generation antidepressants, which now are the most commonly prescribed antidepressants in the world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In Japan the market for antidepressants had been hovering around 15 billion yen (166 million US dollars) per year up to 1999 but has been expanding by some 20% annually, reaching 120 billion yen (1.3 billion US dollars) in 2009, in which new generation antidepressants holds 89% share.</p></sec><sec><title>Evidence on 1<sup>st </sup>line choice of antidepressants</title><p>There is no question that we need a specific, detailed and appropriate guidelines in the treatment of major depression. However, all the guidelines up to 2008, including the one by the American Psychiatric Association [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], the one by the Canadian Psychiatric Association [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], the one by the National Institute of Clinical Excellence in the United Kingdom [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and the Japanese one [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], recommend that the choice of antidepressants be made "on the basis of adverse effect profiles, cost, and patient preferences" [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] because there are differences in side effect profiles but not in effectiveness among various antidepressants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>However, in 2009, the research group from Japan, Italy and UK published the results of a systematic review of 117 RCTs (25928 subjects) of 12 new generation antidepressants in the acute phase treatment of major depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The Meta-analyses of New Generation Antidepressants (MANGA) study is based on the most comprehensive dataset of RCTs involving new generation antidepressants from the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group and makes use of a new meta-analytic method called multiple-treatments meta-analysis (MTM; also sometimes referred to as network meta-analysis), which integrates data from direct (when treatments are compared within a randomised trial) and indirect comparisons (when treatments are compared between trials by combining results on how effective they are compared with a common comparator treatment). MTM thus allows a more precise estimate of comparative effectiveness with narrower confidence intervals than the traditional meta-analyses because it makes use of all direct and indirect comparisons. MTM also minimizes the influence of publication bias because a possible publication bias favoring a particular antidepressant can be counterbalanced by other similar biases favoring other antidepressants when all direct and indirect comparisons are combined through MTM.</p><p>The MANGA Study observed many statistically significant and clinical meaningful differences among the 12 new generation antidepressants. In terms of efficacy, mirtazapine, escitalopram, venlafaxine and sertraline were among the top four drugs; in terms of acceptability, escitaloporam, sertraline, bupropion and citalopram were superior to the others. The authors concluded that sertraline might be the best choice when starting treatment for moderate to severe major depression in adults because it has the most favorable balance between benefits, acceptability, and acquisition cost.</p></sec><sec><title>Evidence on 2<sup>nd </sup>line choice of antidepressants</title><p>Treatment of major depression is not easy because only some 50% respond, i.e. achieve depression severity less than half that at baseline, or only some 30% achieve remission, i.e. return to an euthymic state, after treatment with an adequate dose of antidepressant given for an adequate duration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. When patients show no to only partial response to the 1<sup>st </sup>line treatment, 2<sup>nd </sup>line treatments must be initiated. Guidelines recommendations for the 2<sup>nd </sup>line treatment include dose escalation, switching to a different antidepressant possibly from a different class and augmentation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Unfortunately, however, when many RCTs are planned and executed with the purpose of drug approval by the regulatory agency and as part of initial marketing strategy, evidence on the 2<sup>nd </sup>line treatment is much scanter than that on the 1<sup>st </sup>line.</p><p>First, with regard to dose escalation strategy, three systematic reviews have been published and all concluded that there is no evidence to suggest that dose escalation increases efficacy in comparison with continuing on the same dosage after failure to respond to the 1<sup>st </sup>line antidepressant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Next, with regard to switching, we find two systematic reviews in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] both of which was able to identify only one RCT that directly compared continuing on the same drug and switching to another. In this trial, 104 patients not responding to 6 weeks of fluoxetine 20 mg/d were randomly assigned to further 6 weeks of fluoxetine and switching to mianserin 60 mg/d; the remission rate was 18% and 36%, respectively (p = 0.10) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. When different switching options are compared, switching to venlafaxine after failure to respond on an SSRI may be marginally better than switching to another SSRI but there was no strong evidence to recommend other classes of antidepressants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Lastly, many RCTs and systematic reviews have been published on various augmentation strategies. The ones with most randomized evidence include lithium augmentation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], thyroid hormone augmentation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] and augmentation with atypical antipsychotics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Other options include augmentation with mirtazapine/mianserin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] and augmentation with pindolol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>Even less evidence can be found comparing these different 2<sup>nd </sup>line strategies against each other than comparing each strategy with staying on the former treatment. For example, the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D), which was funded by the NIMH and cost approximately 3 million dollars, examined five switching strategies and four augmentation strategies among the patients who had not achieved remission to the 1<sup>st </sup>line SSRI treatment but was unable to compare switching versus augmentation as few patients agreed to this randomization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>How to establish the optimum treatment strategy with new generation antidepressants</title><p>Review of the literature has revealed that there are indeed many urgent and critical clinical questions that must be answered before clinicians can confidently and competently administer pharmacotherapy for major depression. Urgent because every practitioner encounters these clinical questions almost on a daily basis. Critical because answers to these clinical questions can materially affect the patients' lives. Bandolier (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/bandolier/index.html">http://www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/bandolier/index.html</ext-link>), an independent evidence review journal in UK, concluded its review on the MANGA Study by saying, "What the meta-analysis provides is the raw material for the next step, namely creating and testing a care pathway or pathways for depression that provides good results for the largest number of sufferers in the shortest time and at the lowest cost." (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/bandolier/booth/mental/cipriani.html">http://www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/bandolier/booth/mental/cipriani.html</ext-link>). This proposed study precisely aims to create and test this optimum care pathway for depression.</p><sec><title>1<sup>st </sup>line treatment</title><p>According to the results of the MANGA Study, it is wise to use sertraline as 1<sup>st </sup>line treatment of major depression in Japan because it represents the best balance in effectiveness and acceptability. However, practitioners immediately face an important clinical decision question at this stage, namely the problem of initial dosing strategy. The standard dosage range for sertraline is 50-100 mg/d but should clinicians aim at achieving 50 mg/d or 100 mg/d in the initial dosing strategy? Papakostas et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] published a systematic review of fixed-dose trials comparing different starting doses of SSRIs. In comparison with starting with the minimum of the standard dose range, starting with the maximum of the standard range may be more effective (RR = 1.12, 95%CI: 0.99 to 1.27) but less acceptable (0.74, 0.54 to 1.00). The response rate may increase from 51% to 54%, at the expense of the dropout rate also rising from 10% to 17%. It must be noted that they compared different starting doses, i.e. they administered the minimum or maximum of the standard dose range from the very beginning, and the dropouts are accounted for by last-observation-carried forward which is bound to affect and bias the results in an unknown way.</p><p>Can the initial dosing strategy to gradually increase the dosage up to the maximum of the standard range, recommended by many guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], be more effective and at least not any more unacceptable than the strategy to aim at the minimum of the standard range? No one knows the answer. It is truly unacceptable that a clinical question as urgent as this, because every single patient with major depression starting treatment with antidepressant faces this decision point, is not yet answered. We therefore planned an RCT to answer this question.</p></sec><sec><title>2<sup>nd </sup>line treatment</title><p>Even if we optimize the 1<sup>st </sup>line antidepressant treatment strategy, more than half the patients cannot achieve remission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. What should we do as the 2<sup>nd </sup>line treatment, and when should we make this decision?</p><p>No systematic review has found evidence for dose escalation and the present study will therefore not examine this option. There are many RCTs examining various augmentation strategies but only mirtazapine or mianserin augmentation is allowable according to the current Japanese regulations. As reviewed, we do not yet know which of augmentation or switching is superior in terms effectiveness and acceptability. Furthermore, we do not yet know when we should make this clinical decision to consider the 2<sup>nd </sup>line treatment. Since each clinical research can answer only a limited number of well formulated clinical questions, this study will focus on switching to mirtazapine, which was the most effective antidepressant according to the MANGA study, and compare it to mirtazapine augmentation of SSRI, for which a number of RCTs provide some support.</p><p>Switching to mirtazapine is a plausible option as the 2<sup>nd </sup>line treatment for the following reasons. (i) MANGA study showed mirtazapine may be the most effective new generation antidepressant. Due to its less favorable acceptability profile, it was not recommended as the 1<sup>st </sup>line treatment but, when the latter fails, it is only logical to consider the more effective antidepressant. (ii) Switching is arguably to be preferred over augmentation because combining two drugs may lead to more known and unknown side effects than staying on the same drug.</p><p>Mirtazapine augmentation of SSRI is another option as the 2<sup>nd </sup>line treatment for the following reasons. (i) A number of RCTs have provided some evidence to suggest its effectiveness. One small RCT randomly assigned 26 patients who had not responded to SSRI, bupropion or venlafaxine to augmentation either with mirtazapine 15-30 mg/d or with placebo. The remission rates were 46% versus 13% (p = 0.068) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Another RCT administered fluoxetine plus mirtazapine or fluoxetine alone from the beginning of the acute phase treatment and the remission rates were 25% vs 52% (p = 0.052) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. (ii) It makes sense pharmacologically to combine sertraline, which is an SSRI (specific serotonin reuptake inhibitor), with mirtazapine, which is a NaSSA (noradrenergic specific serotonergic antidepressant). Mirtazapine increases noradrenaline and serotonin release through antagonism of central &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic autoreceptors and heteroreceptors. Mirtazapine also exhibits antagonism to both 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>, 5-HT<sub>2C </sub>and 5-HT<sub>3 </sub>receptors, which results in a net increase in 5-HT<sub>1</sub>-mediated neurotransmission which is believed to be the primary mediator of efficacy of most antidepressant drugs. Antagonsim of the 5-HT<sub>2A </sub>receptors has beneficial effects on sexual dysfunction and insomnia, that of the 5-HT<sub>2B </sub>receptors on anxiety, and that of 5-HT<sub>3 </sub>on gastrointestinal symptoms, all of which constitute major side effects of SSRIs. (iii) Mirtazapine does not inhibit any liver enzymes and poses very low risk of interaction with other drugs. Sertraline exerts mild inhibition against CYP2D6 and 3A4 but is generally believed to be a safer drug when administered concomitantly with other drugs than many other SSRIs.</p><p>Another very important clinical question to be answered with regard to the 2<sup>nd </sup>line treatment is when to consider it. As far as practitioners are concerned, this represents just as urgent a clinical question as that of initial titration strategy but, to the best of the authors' knowledge, no RCT has explicitly examined this issue and the guidelines are ambiguous and self-contradictory. For example, the guideline by the American College of Physicians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] recommends that clinicians modify treatment if the patient does not have an adequate response to pharmacotherapy within 6 to 8 weeks of the initiation of therapy but this time frame appears to be based on the average length of clinical trials conducted mainly for drug approval. The NICE guidelines are self-contradictory as it recommends 3-4 weeks at one place and 6-8 weeks at another before considering the 2<sup>nd </sup>line treatment alternatives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. We therefore decided to randomize the patients with regard to the 2<sup>nd </sup>line treatment as early as 3 weeks and aimed to examine if considering the 2<sup>nd </sup>line treatment at this early stage may or may not be beneficial in comparison with continuing the 1<sup>st </sup>line treatment for 6 more weeks.</p></sec><sec><title>Continuation treatment</title><p>The last but not least factor to be considered in constructing the optimum treatment strategy for the 1<sup>st </sup>and 2<sup>nd </sup>line treatments is the continuation treatment following the acute phase treatment. A systematic review has unambiguously demonstrated that discontinuing antidepressants at the end of acute phase treatment can double the relapse/recurrence rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], and all the guidelines recommend continuation treatment of at least several months following acute phase treatment. However, in reality, many patients do not stay on the continuation phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].

The "3-16 days" time frame was chosen to allow two possible visit days to accommodate the participant's schedule at a site where the site CRC makes his/her visits every week. After obtaining the written informed consent, the trial physician or the site CRC makes a face-to-face interview or the central CRC or the central rater will make a telephone interview to assess</p><p>1) PHQ9 at week 1</p><p>2) FIBSER at week 1</p><p>These week 1 assessment results will be entered into the EDC along with the complete data on the "Eligibility Form."</p></sec><sec><title>Allocation to treatments</title><p>Eligible participants will be allocated 1:1 to the sertraline 50 mg/d arm and to the sertraline 100 mg/d arm. We will employ cluster randomization by trial site. This cluster randomization will be made by the EDC system. The allocation will use the minimization method adjusting for the number of probable entries as judged by the principal investigator and co-principal investigators (40 or more participants per year vs less than 40 participants per year).</p><p>We employ cluster randomization for Step I for the following reasons.</p><p>1) The comparison for Step I is between physician's choice of a strategy to titrate sertraline used as the 1<sup>st </sup>line antidepressant up to the minimum effective range or up to the maximum effective range. It is therefore logical to randomize by physician.</p><p>2) In reality, because this is an open trial in which the trial physician gradually titrates the dosage taking into account the side effects, having one patient in the sertraline 100 mg/d arm and another in the sertraline 50 mg/d arm may at the same time create contamination in the doctor's decisions. That is, if we randomized by patient, the doctor might tend to stick to his/her personally preferred titration schedule regardless of the individual patient's assignment and reported side effects.</p><p>3) Likewise, having different doctors with different titration policies within the same trial site might cause unnecessary confusion among the physicians and co-medical staff at the site.</p><p>4) Asking the participant to undergo individual randomization twice might increase the barrier to participation.</p><p>5) A number of previous studies have repeatedly reported negligible to very small intra-cluster correlation coefficients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Treatments</title><p>The trial physician will prescribe according to either of the following schedule, depending on his/her own allocated treatment strategy.</p><p>1) In the 100 mg/d arm, prescribe 50-75 mg/d (once after dinner or before bedtime) for one week at week 1, then prescribe 100 mg/d (once or divided twice per day) for one week at week 2</p><p>2) In the 50 mg/d arm, prescribe 50 mg/d (once after dinner or before bedtime) for one week at week 1, then prescribe the same regimen for one week at week 2</p></sec><sec><title>Outcome assessments</title><p>The trial physician or the site CRC will ask the participant to fill in BDI2 upon week 2 and week 3 visits.

The central CRC will obtain the patient's name and phone number and will keep the rater blind to the name of the clinic and the treatment the participant is receiving. This telephone assessment will normally be conducted in a separate room after the patient arrives at the clinic and before the consultation with the trial physician, so that imminent suicidality may be handled promptly and appropriately according to the "Suicidality Management Manual." If the patient has dropped from the treatment, the telephone call will be made to the mobile phone which he/she has previously registered upon entry into the trial.

The EDC program will then output "The patient is making steady recovery. Please continue with the same regimen" if the PHQ9 score is 4 or less, and any one of "Augment with mirtazapine. Please add mirtazapine 15 mg/d," "Switch to mirtazapine. Decrease sertraline to half the current dose and add mirtazapine 15 mg/d," or "Continue with sertraline" if thePHQ9 score is 5 or more according to the above randomization.

Between week 4 and week 9, sertraline must be kept within the maximum as specified by Step I cluster randomization. If the dosage has not reached this maximum (e.g. 100 mg/d) at week 3, it can be increased to this maximum (in this case, 100 mg/d) between week 3 and week 9.</p><p>2) Continue sertraline as specified by Step I cluster randomization and add mirtazapine 15 mg/d at bedtime to augment sertraline. After week 4, mirtazapine can be given in 7.5-45 mg/d at bedtime. Between week 4 and week 9, sertraline must be kept within the maximum as specified by Step I cluster randomization. If the sertraline dosage has not reached this maximum (e.g. 100 mg/d) at week 3, it can be increased to this maximum (in this case, 100 mg/d) between week 3 and week 9. Mirtazapine should usually be started at 15 mg/d but can be halved by the treating psychiatrist taking into account age etc of the patient.</p><p>3) Decrease sertraline to half the current dose and add mirtazapine 7.5-15 mg/d at bedtime in order to switch to mirtazapine. Sertraline must be halved at week 3 and stopped by week 4 or week 5 (sertraline should no longer be prescribed at week 7 at the latest), so that the patient will receive mirtazapine 7.5-45 mg/d only between week 7 and week 9.</p></sec><sec><title>Outcome assessments</title><p>The trial physician or the site CRC will continue to ask the participant to fill in BDI2 at every visit between week 4 and week 9.

Its first version was developed in 1961 and slightly amended in 1979 but in 1996 a major revision was undertaken to make the scale more congruent with the modern diagnostic criteria for major depression. In its 40 years of usage, the BDI has become one of the most widely used instruments for detecting possible depression in normal populations and for assessing severity of depression in diagnosed patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>].</p><p>The time frame for evaluation is set to the past 2 weeks including the day of assessment. Each item in the BDI2 has a series of four statements, which describe symptom severity along an ordinal continuum from absent or mild (a score of 0) to severe (a score of 3). The total score therefore ranges from 0 through 63.</p><p>Good reliability and validity have been reported for the original [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] as well as the Japanese version [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>].</p><p>The original authors proposed the following rules of thumb for interpreting the BDI2 scores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]</p><p>0-13 Minimal</p><p>14-19 Mild</p><p>20-28 Moderate</p><p>29-63 Severe</p><p>Two subsequent studies from the US and from Japan basically confirmed these interpretations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>].</p><p>A rough guide for interpreting the changes in BDI2 scores may be [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]</p><p>0-9 no or slight change, with 5 indicating a minimally important clinical difference</p><p>10-19 moderate change</p><p>&#x0003e;= 20 large change.</p><p>Most patients are comfortable with this 21-item questionnaire and can complete them within 5-10 minutes.</p><p>In this trial, BDI2 will be filled in by the patient at each visit.</p></sec><sec><title>Frequency, Intensity, and Burden of Side Effects Rating (FIBSER)</title><p>FIBSER was originally used in STAR*D as a global rating scale for side effects.

The total sample size is therefore 1980.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size for Step II</title><p>The clinical question for Step II is the main hypothesis of this trial. Previous studies using PHQ9 in the acute phase treatment of major depression have shown that, on average, the PHQ9 scores will drop from 15 (SD = 5) at baseline to 10 (SD = 6) at end of treatment, with a mean change of 5 (SD = 5) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. We expect a difference of 20% (1 point) in the PHQ9 change scores among the intervention arms and consider this to be a clinically meaningful difference in effect. With alpha error set at 0.05 and statistical power at 0.80, in order to detect a between-group difference of 1 point (SD = 5) in the reduction of PHQ9 scores from baseline, we need 522 per group and 1566 in toto at Step II. Assuming a dropout rate of 20% and a remission rate of 10% at week 3, we need 2175 participants for Step I.</p><p>One point difference in the mean change score on PHQ9 corresponds with an effect size of 0.2. This is a small effect according to Cohen's rough rule of thumb for effect size interpretation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. However, because the present trial represents comparison among active treatments and because the true effect size of antidepressants over placebo appears to be around 0.3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>] and the average effect size of all the health interventions examined in the Cochrane Library appears to be between 0.3 and 0.4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>], we consider this to be a clinically meaningful difference in effectiveness worth detecting in a large clinical trial. As a matter of fact, an effect size of 0.2 will be translated into an NNT of 10 if the control event rate is around 50% (e.g. response as defined usually by 50% or greater reduction in depression severity from baseline) and 20 if the control event rate is around 20% (e.g. remission of depression) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. They therefore represent clinically meaningful difference in effect.</p><p>The sample size will be revisited after completion of the pilot study.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size for Step III</title><p>Step III represents continuation treatment for Steps I and II, and will therefore be examined as exploratory studies. We therefore will not calculate sample size necessary to detect a significant difference. However, we will calculate the obtained statistical power post-hoc.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size for pilot study</title><p>The pilot study is a feasibility study and needs no sample size calculation. The target sample size is 200. We will perform no statistical analyses looking at the comparison arms at the end of the pilot study, whose participants will therefore be included in the main study unless there is a major change in the study protocol.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Statistical analyses</title><sec><title>Primary analyses</title><p>For Step I, we will compare the sertraline 50 mg/d arm and the sertraline 100 mg/d arm at an individual level. We will test whether the changes in PHQ9 scores at week 1 through week 3 are statistically significantly different between the two arms. Because Step I employs cluster randomization, we will have to take into consideration intra-class correlation coefficients.</p><p>For Step II, we will test whether the changes in PHQ9 scores at week 4 through week 9 are statistically significantly different among the sertraline continuation arm, the mirtazapine augmentation arm and the mirtazapine switch arm. The null hypothesis that the changes are not different among the treatment arms will be tested by examining treatment effect parameters in the repeated measures analyses of all the eligible subjects in the ITT analysis. We will use random effects model taking into consideration the Step I randomization and Step II randomization factors. We will examine interaction effect of Step I cluster randomisation. The test will be double-sided. The alpha error is set at 0.05 and statistical power at 0.80. We will impute the missing data and carry out sensitivity analyses as necessary.</p></sec><sec><title>Secondary analyses</title><p>We will perform secondary analyses to supplement our primary analyses and to obtain more elaborate understanding of our clinical questions. The secondary analyses will use models similar to those of the primary analyses. We will calculate relative risks and their 95% confidence intervals for differences in proportions. We will calculate hazard ratios and their 95% confidence intervals for differences in treatment continuation.</p><p>Details of the statistical analyses will be laid down in the "Statistical Analysis Protocol", which will be prepared by the statistician in the Steering Committee by the time the analyses will be undertaken.</p></sec><sec><title>Interim analyses</title><p>We will not perform interim analyses to examine the study hypotheses for two reasons. First, we are not expecting a huge effect size for the planned comparisons and second, it is theoretically likely that trials stopped early for benefit may overestimate the true effect size.</p><p>However, we will examine the following aspects in order to ascertain the feasibility of the study without revealing the treatment allocation.</p><p>1) Number of entered subjects per trial site to calculate the number of trial sites and the time necessary to complete the intended study</p><p>2) The intra-cluster correlation coefficient will be calculated in order to make sure that it is not very different from the one assumed in this protocol.

This insurance will cover only death or grade 1 impairment or grade 2 impairment whose causal relationship with the trial cannot be negated. Grades 3-14 impairments will not be covered by this insurance but will be covered by the National Health Insurance, which therefore can incur some copayment.

In other words, they represent treatment alternatives from which both clinicians and their patients have difficulties choosing at the present moment.</p><p>Second, the clinical questions to be examined in this trial pertain to urgent and critical decision points for which the world psychiatric and psychopharmacological research community has hitherto failed to provide guidance or answer to.</p><p>Third, the trial will take place mostly in front-line psychiatric facilities such as private practices and departments of psychiatry of general hospitals from all over Japan, where many if not most of the patients with major depression receive their initial treatment. Because Japan does not have the primary care system as represented by the general practitioners in UK, these are the primary care mental health services in Japan and the current trial is thus expected to have maximum external validity with respect to initial treatment of major depression in Japan.</p><p>Fourth, several important measures are built in to ensure good internal validity for this pragmatic trial, such as central randomization, blind assessment of symptoms and side effects via telephone and adherence to true intention-to-treat principle through differentiation of discontinuation of protocol treatments and withdrawal from study. Whether we can achieve the last point will depend on whether we can follow up and assess all the patients even when they stop or deviate from the assigned treatments.</p><p>As discussed in the Introduction, major depression represents the greatest non-fatal burden of disease for the humankind, with commensurate rise in spending on the antidepressants world-wide. We maintain that this must be accompanied by commensurate increase in evidence base to guide their wise clinical administration. For example, the total annual sales of antidepressants amount to 120 billion yen (1.3 billion US dollars), and we would like to advocate that at least 0.1% of this sum be spent on public-domain pragmatic research of their use for mood and anxiety disorders. Many urgent and critical clinical questions can be answered with this research funds only if the research can be simple and pragmatic enough. We hope that SUN(^_^)D can be a template for such future clinical trials, and that it ultimately can provide good evidence to improve the treatment guidelines for depression in the world.</p></sec><sec><title>List of abbreviations</title><p>5-HT: 5-hydroxytryptamine; BDI2: Beck Depression Inventory-II; C-CASA: Columbia Classification Algorithm of Suicide Assessment; CRC: Clinical Research Coordinator; CRO: Contract Research Organization; CYP: Cytochrome pigment; DALY: Disability-Adjusted Life Years; DSMB: Data Safety Monitoring Board; EDC: Electronic Data Capturing; FIBSER: Frequency, Intensity, and Burden of Side Effects Rating; MANGA: Meta-Analyses of New Generation Antidepressants; MAO: Monoamine oxidase; NICE: National Institute of Clinical Excellence; NaSSA: Noradrenergic and Specific Serotonergic Antidepressant; NNT: Number needed to treat; PHQ9: Personal Health Questionnaire-9; RCT: Randomized controlled trial; SMO: Site Management Organization; SNRI: Serotonin &#x00026; Noradrenalin Reuptake Inhibitor; SSRI: Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor; STAR*D: Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression; SUN &#x0263a; D: Strategic Use of New generation antidepressants for Depression.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>TAF has received honoraria for speaking at CME meetings sponsored by Astellas, Dai-Nippon Sumitomo, Eli Lilly, GlaxoSmithKline, Janssen, Kyorin, MSD, Meiji, Otsuka, Pfizer, Shionogi and Yoshitomi.
