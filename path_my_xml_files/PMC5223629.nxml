<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p><p>In Japan, a multicentre, prospective, randomised, double-blind, phase III clinical trial<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> of recombinant human TM (rhTM), an anticoagulant agent used for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), was performed from 2000 to 2005 and included 234 patients with DIC caused by infection or haematological malignancy. Results showed that although rhTM was associated with a significantly higher DIC resolution rate than heparin, this rate was not significantly different for patients with infection. Further, no difference in 28-day mortality rates of patients with infection or haematological malignancy was observed. The trial had several weaknesses: (1) the primary outcome was the DIC resolution rate, which is a physiological parameter and (2) the control group included patients with DIC who were treated with heparin, which is not the established and standard treatment for sepsis-induced coagulopathy.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p><p>In 2011, Yamakawa <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> reported a retrospective historical control study with the mortality rate as the primary outcome. Twenty patients with severe septic -induced overt DIC (DIC criteria of the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis) who received rhTM between November 2008 and October 2009 were compared with 45 patients who did not receive rhTM between January 2006 and September 2008. The 28-day mortality rate was 25% for the rhTM group versus 47% for the control group. The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, C reactive protein (CRP) and fibrinogen degradation product (FDP) levels were significantly decreased in the rhTM group, whereas the platelet counts were significantly increased. Further, rhTM treatment also improved respiratory function in patients with sepsis-induced DIC.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p><p>In 2013, a retrospective cohort study adjusted by the propensity score was performed in patients with Japanese Association for Acute Medicine (JAAM) DIC scores &#x02265;4 who required mechanical ventilation, exhibited multiple organ failure and presented with platelet counts &#x0003c;80&#x02005;000/mm<sup>3</sup>. Mortality rates were significantly lower in patients treated with rhTM than in those who did not receive the therapy.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Although these studies investigated the mortality rate as the primary outcome, they were all retrospective cohort studies, which had certain biases.</p><p>In 2013, Vincent <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> reported a phase IIb double-blind randomised controlled trial (RCT) of rhTM, in which patients who fulfilled the DIC criteria of the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis were treated with rhTM or a placebo. Results showed that the 28-day mortality rate tended to be lower in the rhTM group.</p><p>It remains unclear whether rhTM is effective in treating patients with severe septic -induced DIC. Therefore, studies with high evidence level are required. Our open-label RCT aimed to investigate whether rhTM treatment increases the 28-day and 90-day survival rates in patients with severe sepsis and JAAM DIC scores &#x02265;4.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>This single-centre open-label RCT was approved by our institutional ethics committee.

The former study diagnosed DIC according to the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) criteria, and the latter study diagnosed DIC according to the JAAM DIC criteria. As we also administered rhTM to patients with sepsis according to the JAAM DIC criteria, our mortality rates may be lower than those of the retrospective studies.

<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> However, platelet counts and prothrombin times were not different between the groups.

In the heparin treatment group, the 28-day mortality rate among patients in whom the DIC resolved was 15% (3/20); the rate for those in whom the DIC did not resolve was 43.8% (7/16) (p=0.0732, Fisher's exact test).&#x0201d; They reported that &#x0201c;the 28-day mortality rates were significantly lower for patients in whom the JAAM DIC was resolved within 7&#x02005;days than in those in whom the JAAM DIC was not resolved.&#x0201d; Our results were similar to theirs.</p><p>We examined patients who experienced DIC resolution within 3 or 7&#x02005;days, but no difference in survival rates was recorded between the rhTM and control groups. Moreover, survival rates were not different between patients in the rhTM group who experienced DIC resolution within 3&#x02005;days and those in the control group who experienced DIC resolution within 7&#x02005;days. These results illustrated that the 28-day mortality rates were lower for patients in whom JAAM DIC was resolved within 7&#x02005;days, but the outcome did not change after the use of rhTM if patients recovered from DIC within 7&#x02005;days.</p><p>There were no differences in SOFA scores, number of ventilator-free days and volume of blood transfusion between the rhTM and control groups. Conversely, albumin and heparin use were lower in the rhTM group, although the small number of patients precludes any definitive conclusions. A decline in the DIC score by the rhTM use may not improve the outcome of patients with severe septic-induced DIC compared with the control group. Our study did not uncover sufficient evidence of the effects of treatment with rhTM for sepsis-induced DIC on patient outcome. However, rhTM use has been drastically increasing in Japan despite a lack of clear evidence of its effectiveness.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p><p>Our results unfortunately could not find an effectiveness of rhTM.

In addition, it requires caution and prudence for interpretation of our results due to a single-centre study. Our entry criteria targeted those patients diagnosed as DIC in accordance with the JAAM DIC criteria. For the ongoing phase III study performed in Europe/the USA, the entry criteria are set for patients with cardiovascular dysfunction or respiratory failure and severe sepsis with PTINR&#x0003e;1.40. Therefore, it is more severe than our entry criteria. Our study might show a difference in disease severity as compared to other studies. The number of patients calculated before the study might not possibly be appropriate. The ongoing phase III study planned that the estimated enrolment was 800 patients. The small number of patients in our study may have caused no significant result.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>rhTM treatment decreased <sc>d</sc>-dimer values in patients with severe septic-induced DIC but did not increase survival rates.
