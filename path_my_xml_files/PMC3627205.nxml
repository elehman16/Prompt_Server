We divided each study site into three clusters. After a baseline survey between July, and September, 2009, clusters in each site were randomly assigned to UCT, CCT, or control, by drawing of lots from a hat. Eligible households contained children younger than 18 years and satisfied at least one other criteria: head of household was younger than 18 years; household cared for at least one orphan younger than 18 years, a disabled person, or an individual who was chronically ill; or household was in poorest wealth quintile. Between January, 2010, and January, 2011, households in UCT clusters collected payments every 2 months. Households in CCT clusters could receive the same amount but were monitored for compliance with several conditions related to child wellbeing. Eligible households in all clusters, including control clusters, had access to parenting skills classes and received maize seed and fertiliser in December, 2009, and August, 2010. Households and individuals delivering the intervention were not masked, but data analysts were. The primary endpoints were proportion of children younger than 5 years with a birth certificate, proportion younger than 5 years with up-to-date vaccinations, and proportion aged 6&#x02013;12 years attending school at least 80% of the time.

Cash-transfer programmes can affect behaviour in several ways. Additional cash can help individuals to achieve specific behaviours&#x02014;eg, by providing resources for transport costs and reducing pressure put on children to work during school hours. Implementation of conditions can raise awareness about beneficial behaviours and provide additional incentives to overcome sociocultural barriers (eg, step-parents prioritising school attendance for their biological children rather than for their fostered children<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref>).</p><p>UCT programmes for orphans and vulnerable children are believed to be easier to implement and more appropriate in low-income settings than are CCT programmes.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> UCT programmes have been piloted in several sub-Saharan African countries with generalised HIV epidemics (eg, South Africa, Zambia, and Malawi).<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> However, cluster-randomised controlled trials from Latin America have shown that CCTs with school and health-clinic attendance conditions have positive effects on uptake of vaccinations<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> and school attendance.<xref rid="bib2 bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2,7</sup></xref> A trial in Malawi<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> showed that both UCTs and CCTs reduced infection with HIV and herpes simplex virus 2 in female adolescents and is the only study in sub-Saharan Africa that has directly compared UCT with CCT.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref></p><p>Because cash transfers are being considered as key components of social welfare programmes for orphans and vulnerable children in sub-Saharan Africa,<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> rigorous, peer-reviewed assessment of their effects on various outcomes is necessary in young and older children of both sexes. In this study, we investigated the effects of UCT and CCT on birth registration, vaccination uptake, and school attendance in children in Zimbabwe.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="cesec20"><title>Methods</title><sec id="cesec30"><title>Study design and participants</title><p>The Manicaland HIV/STD Prevention Project is a population-based cohort study in 12 sites in Manicaland, Zimbabwe,<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> where 17% of individuals aged 15&#x02013;49 years had HIV in 2006&#x02013;08.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> Sites were selected to represent four socioeconomic strata: subsistence farming areas, roadside trading settlements, agricultural estates, and small towns. The Project gathers data for HIV trends and the effect of the epidemic on the study population, including the effects on child wellbeing.</p><p>We did a matched, cluster-randomised controlled trial in these sites. Because of funding constraints, this trial was done in ten of the 12 original sites, but they represented all four socioeconomic strata. We used cluster randomisation to reduce conflict and contamination between households, which could arise if neighbouring households received different interventions. We divided each study site into three contiguous, socioeconomically homogeneous clusters, providing ten matched triplets of clusters.</p><p>Households within the clusters were eligible for inclusion in the trial when they contained children younger than 18 years and satisfied at least one other criteria at baseline: the head of the household was younger than 18 years; the household cared for at least one orphan (a child younger than 18 years with one or more deceased parents), disabled person, or an individual who was chronically ill; or the household was in the poorest wealth quintile. Households in the richest wealth quintile and those already receiving cash transfers for orphans and vulnerable children were not eligible.</p><p>We did a baseline survey of all households in the trial clusters between July, and September, 2009. We counted how many members made up each household and obtained information about trial endpoints and eligibility and exclusion criteria, including household asset data. We constructed a wealth index with a simple sum of reported household assets<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>). We ranked households according to their index score and then divided them into quintiles in each study site, thus identifying the poorest 20% of households in each site. We obtained informed consent from the most senior member of the household available at time of interview.</p><p>After the baseline survey, we passed lists of all households in the study clusters and their eligibility data to a non-governmental organisation (Diocese of Mutare Community Care Programme [DOMCCP]) so it could undertake community-based targeting. In every cluster, groups of community leaders were asked to define characteristics of the poorest, poor, average, less poor, and least poor households and then to use these characteristics to assign households to five equally sized groups in their clusters on the basis of wealth.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> Thus the community groups identified the poorest 20% of households in each cluster. The accuracy of the other eligibility data was also verified at community meetings.</p><p>Households had to be deemed to be eligible in the survey and in the community-based targeting and verification exercises to qualify for the interventions. One matched triplet (in a subsistence farming area; triplet 10) was used by DOMCCP as a pilot site; in these clusters, only the community-based targeting information was used. A follow-up survey was done in eligible households between March, and May, 2011.</p><p>Ethical approval was granted by Imperial College London's research ethics committee (ICREC_9_3_10), Biomedical Research and Training Institute's institutional review board (AP81/09), and the Medical Research Council of Zimbabwe (MRCZ/A/1518).</p></sec><sec id="cesec40"><title>Randomisation and masking</title><p>After the baseline survey, clusters were randomly assigned to UCT, CCT, or control at public meetings that any community members could attend. In each site, one cluster was assigned to UCT, one to CCT, and one to control. Allocation was done by the drawing of lots from a hat. Participating households and individuals delivering the intervention were not masked to cluster assignment. At follow-up, research assistants were not told the allocation of the household they were interviewing, but questions were included at the end of the questionnaire about whether households received transfers. LR was masked when doing the primary analysis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="cesec50"><title>Procedures</title><p>Community committees made up of the DOMCCP and other local stakeholders (eg, community health workers), who had experience of intervention delivery to vulnerable families through a network of local workers and volunteers, managed the cash-transfer programmes. DOMCCP enrolled eligible households in intervention clusters into the cash-transfer programmes. Every household enrolled in the UCT programme collected US$18 plus $4 per child in the household (up to a maximum of three children) from designated pay points every 2 months.</p><p>Households in the CCT group could receive the same amount, but were monitored for compliance with several conditions: an application for a birth certificate had to be made within 3 months for all children younger than 18 years (including newborn babies) whose births had not been registered; children younger than 5 years had to be up-to-date with vaccinations and attend growth-monitoring clinics twice a year; children aged 6&#x02013;17 years had to attend school at least 90% of the time per month; and a representative from every household had to attend two-thirds of local parenting skills classes held by DOMCCP. Compliance cards were issued to CCT households and were signed by service providers when beneficiaries accessed services. The signed cards were brought to the pay points every 2 months, along with other documents such as birth certificates, child health cards, and receipts for the payment of school fees. DOMCCP checked cards and documents before issuing the cash transfers.</p><p>Community committees were familiar with most people living in the trial clusters. If a household provided a good reason for not meeting conditions (eg, a child missing school because of illness), it was verified by the committee and judged on a case-by-case basis. Spot checks were done by DOMCCP: schools and clinics were visited to verify attendance.</p><p>To allow households time to begin meeting conditions, we did not enforce conditions for 6 months at the start of the intervention. After this point, DOMCCP offered support at the first check if a household was not complying with conditions. Households that were still non-compliant at the second check were assigned a community volunteer to help them to meet the conditions. If after another 4 months the household was still not meeting the conditions, the amount of their transfer was reduced by 10%. After a total of 6 months, the community volunteer assumed control of the household's transfers, with regular review by DOMCCP. If the household began meeting conditions, the volunteer was removed and the household received their full transfer. The CCT intervention was fairly soft&#x02014;ie, households who did not meet conditions would rarely have received reduced transfers or stopped receiving them altogether.</p><p>The first cash disbursement happened in January, 2010. We planned to continue the intervention for 2 years, but funding for the programme was not renewed in March, 2011, amid government plans to begin a national programme. The last disbursement took place in January, 2011. From September, 2010, DOMCCP provided parenting skills classes in all clusters, including control clusters. Eligible households in all clusters, including control clusters, received maize seed and fertiliser in December, 2009, and August, 2010.</p><p>We obtained data from eligible households for several primary endpoint indicators, which were selected to represent three domains of child wellbeing (identity, health, and education; <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>): proportion of children younger than 5 years with a birth certificate; proportion of children younger than 5 years with up-to-date vaccinations (measles; BCG; polio; and diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus); and proportion of children aged 6&#x02013;12 years attending school at least 80% of the time in the previous month. Additionally, we gathered data for the proportion of children aged 13&#x02013;17 years in vulnerable households that attended school at least 80% of the time in the previous month. To assess attendance, household respondents were asked whether children aged 6&#x02013;17 years were enrolled in school and, if yes, how many of the previous 20 school days had been missed.</p></sec><sec id="cesec60"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>We used Donner and Klar's formula for sample-size estimation in matched, cluster-randomised controlled trials.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> We based assumed baseline prevalences of endpoint indicators on national data for orphans and vulnerable children in Zimbabwe (2005):<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> 35% of children aged 0&#x02013;4 years had a birth certificate and 51% were fully vaccinated, and 69% of children aged 6&#x02013;12 years had good school attendance (having attended school at least once in the previous school year and not having been absent for more than 2 consecutive weeks).

In the CCT group, 989 (83%) of 1187 households that reported receiving cash also reported having to meet conditions (data for conditions missing for 18 households). In the UCT group, 400 (31%) of 1297 eligible households that reported receiving cash also reported having to meet conditions (data for conditions missing for five households), suggesting some contamination between the UCT and CCT groups. Of 964 eligible CCT households for which data were available for volunteer assignment, 341 (35%) reported being assigned a volunteer to help them to meet conditions.</p><p>After randomisation, two villages (62 [53%] of 118 eligible households) in a control cluster (triplet 5; small town) were accidentally enrolled in the UCT programme. For ethical reasons, these households received transfers throughout the intervention period. For all endpoints, we were missing data for less than 4% of children who were followed up in each group (<xref rid="fig2 fig3 fig4" ref-type="fig">figures 2&#x02013;4</xref>). Missing data were excluded from the analysis.</p><p>Most baseline characteristics were similar across the three groups (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>). However, the proportion of children aged 0&#x02013;4 years who were female was slightly higher and the proportion of children aged 13&#x02013;17 years who attended school at least 80% of the time in the previous month was slightly lower in the UCT group than in the other groups (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>).</p><p>We recorded no evidence of non-normality of model residuals. The increase in proportion of children aged 0&#x02013;4 years with a birth certificate compared with the control group was significant in the CCT group but not in the UCT group (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">figure 5</xref>). The proportions of children aged 0&#x02013;4 years with complete vaccination records were similar across groups (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">figure 5</xref>). The proportions of children aged 6&#x02013;12 years who had attended school at least 80% of the time in the previous month were higher in the UCT and CCT groups than in the control group, with the intervention groups having similar increases (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">figure 5</xref>).

Additionally, we repeated our primary analysis excluding the affected matched triplets of clusters in which two villages in the control cluster were enrolled in the UCT programme and where only information about community-based targeting was used; the results were consistent with the primary findings (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="cesec90"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have shown that UCT and CCT significantly increased the proportion of children with good school attendance in Manicaland, Zimbabwe. CCT, but not UCT, significantly increased the proportion with a birth certificate. However, neither programme significantly increased the proportion with a complete vaccination record. Our conditions were soft&#x02014;ie, households received support to meet conditions before their transfers were reduced. In view of the 6-month initial grace period, it is unlikely that many households received reduced transfers when they did not meet conditions. Therefore, identification of the specific component of the CCT programme that produced the reported effects is difficult. Interpretation is further complicated by the potential for respondents in the UCT and CCT groups to have been affected by the evaluation process: community awareness about the aims of the project could have affected actual or reported behaviours (eg, emphasis on school attendance as an outcome of the assessment by programme implementers could have encouraged caregivers to send their children to school).</p><p>Several factors could explain why CCT, but not UCT, had a large effect on birth registration. First, the proportion of children in the region with a birth certificate at baseline was less than 50%, which was probably related to bureaucratic barriers and poor awareness about birth registration. Second, DOMCCP helped many households in the CCT group to obtain birth certificates. Third, birth registration is a one-time event; it does not have to be maintained. Reviews<xref rid="bib17 bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17,18</sup></xref> suggest that economic incentives most effectively affect behaviours in the short term.</p><p>Neither UCT nor CCT significantly increased the proportion of children with up-to-date vaccinations. A previous systematic review<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> showed that CCT positively affected vaccination coverage when conditions included attendance at preventive health-care services.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> In Manicaland, vaccinations are often delivered via mobile outreach, and cash transfers might not affect access to these services. Furthermore, measles and BCG vaccination coverage was high at baseline (&#x0003e;94%; <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>), restricting the potential for the interventions to increase uptake.</p><p>In Malawi, both UCT and CCT improved school attendance in adolescent girls, although CCT produced the largest effect.<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> In our study, the effect of CCT on school attendance was only slightly larger than was the effect of UCT. In the 1980s, Zimbabwe expanded education services; adult literacy and school enrolment remain high compared with other sub-Saharan African countries.<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> Therefore, conditions might not be necessary to raise awareness about the benefits of education, which leaves poverty as the principal barrier to school attendance. However, the larger effect in the CCT group suggests that conditions&#x02014;either through support or provision of a direct incentive&#x02014;could also help to increase school attendance.</p><p>Strengths of our study were its cluster-randomised design, large sample size, low numbers of households that refused to participate, and high follow-up. Our clusters represent four different area types, which improves generalisability to similar rural areas in southern and eastern Africa. However, we did the study shortly after a period of economic crisis in Zimbabwe, which could limit this generalisability. We probably missed some vulnerable children&#x02014;eg, those living in institutions. However, most vulnerable children in Zimbabwe are cared for in households, usually within the extended family.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref></p><p>We did record evidence of contamination between groups: almost a third of UCT households reported having to comply with conditions. UCT households could have been inadvertently exposed to awareness campaigns about conditions, which were done in the study areas. DOMCCP representatives work throughout our study clusters; UCT households that reported having to comply with conditions could have also accessed support from these workers. Our finding that households that reported having to comply with conditions had higher proportions of children with birth certificates and good school attendance than did households that did not have to meet conditions could have meant that the intention-to-treat analysis overestimated the effect of the UCT. Furthermore, two control villages were accidentally enrolled into the UCT programme, which might have meant we underestimated the effects of the cash transfers in our intention-to-treat analysis.</p><p>Our study was limited by the short intervention period. Whether the effects of the programmes would change with time is unclear. The follow-up survey was done 2 months after interventions had finished, so fear of penalties should not have biased responses from CCT households, although the effects of the programmes could have attenuated by the time of the survey.</p><p>Overall, our results support strategies to integrate cash transfers into social welfare programming for orphans and vulnerable children that are presently implemented in several sub-Saharan Africa countries (<xref rid="box1" ref-type="boxed-text">panel</xref>). Further work is needed to assess whether the increased costs associated with monitoring compliance with conditions is compensated by greater improvements in child-welfare outcomes.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Shibuya</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Conditional cash transfer: a magic bullet for health?</article-title><source>Lancet</source><volume>371</volume><year>2008</year><fpage>789</fpage><lpage>791</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">18328910</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref2"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Adato</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Bassett</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Social protection to support orphans and vulnerable children and families: the potential of cash transfers to protect education, health and nutrition</article-title><source>AIDS Care</source><volume>21</volume><year>2009</year><fpage>60</fpage><lpage>75</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">22380980</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="book" id="sbref3"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Fiszbein</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Schady</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name></person-group><source>Conditional cash transfers: reducing present and future poverty</source><year>2009</year><publisher-name>World Bank</publisher-name><publisher-loc>Washington, DC</publisher-loc></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref4"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Nyamukapa</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Gregson</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Extended family's and women's roles in safeguarding orphans' education in AIDS-afflicted rural Zimbabwe</article-title><source>Social Sci Med</source><volume>60</volume><year>2005</year><fpage>2155</fpage><lpage>2167</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="book" id="sbref5"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>de Brauw</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Hoddinott</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group><source>Must conditional cash transfer programs be conditioned to be effective?
