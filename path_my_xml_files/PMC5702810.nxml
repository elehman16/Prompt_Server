exercise on the muscle strength and muscle activity of the ankle joint. [Subjects and
Methods] Twenty women in their 20s were randomly assigned to two groups: the open
kinetic-chain group and the closed kinetic-chain group. Each group performed 5 sets 3
times per week for 4 weeks. Exercise intensity was increased once after two weeks. The
muscle activity of the tibialis anterior, gastrocnemius, tibialis posterior, and peroneus
longus muscles were measured. The collected data were analyzed with two-way repeated
measures ANOVA. [Results] In the results for muscle strength, both groups showed
significant differences in dorsiflexion and plantar flexion between the pre-test and
post-test. In the results for muscle activity, no significant differences were noted for
either group. [Conclusion] Open and closed kinetic-chain exercises can help to improve
muscle strength.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Open and closed kinetic-chain exercise</kwd><kwd>Muscle strength</kwd><kwd>Muscle activity</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>An increase of initial muscle strength can result from the mechanism of nerve training, as
muscle activity is increased due to the improvement in the recruiting motor unit, and then
muscle strength increases as a result of muscle hypertrophy<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Understanding the effect of a change in muscle length on the
electromyographic (EMG) activity recorded in a muscle is essential in the functional
interpretation of EMG data during different activities<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. There is considerable debate regarding the relative efficacy of
open kinetic-chain (OKC) and closed kinetic-chain (CKC) exercise for increasing the strength
and control of knee muscles<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. OKC exercise
is performed in a state of free distal and fixed proximal extremities<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. The OKC exercises isolate specific muscle groups for
strengthening and evaluation purposes<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The use of axial-load exercises, which are known as CKC exercises, has grown considerably
in recent years. Biomechanically, the function of each segment of the body is considered in
relation to other interconnected segments. The whole body is considered as a chain; the
movement of one part affects the others<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>A study performed the OKC flexion and extension exercise for non-operative or
post-operative joint-disorder management; the results indicated that in the post-anterior
cruciate ligament reconstruction or injury period, the exercise could be safely employed to
strengthen the hamstring muscles without risk to the anterior cruciate ligament. In
contrast, post-posterior cruciate or lateral collateral ligament reconstruction or injury,
the OKC flexion exercise should be avoided under moderate to large flexion angles and
resistant forces<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. A study evaluated the
EMG activities of the vastus medialis obliquus (VMO) and vastus lateralis (VL) muscles in
open and closed kinetic-chain exercises in subjects with patellofemoral pain syndrome
(PFPS). The results showed that, for CKC exercises, more selective VMO activation was
obtained at 60&#x000b0; knee flexion. The maximal VMO/VL ratio was observed at this knee-flexion
angle, and the muscle-contraction intensity was also greatest at this angle<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. A study analyzed the immediate effects of
the OKC knee extensor exercise with difference loads on the anterior laxity of the knee on
the uninjured side. The study results indicated that the OKC knee extensor exercise at both
high loads and low loads caused an immediate increase in knee laxity, which began to
decrease within 90&#x02005;min<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Most of the previous studies that investigated the OKC and CKC exercises performed by
patients analyzed knee-joint muscles. This study analyzed the effects of OKC and CKC
exercises on the muscle strength and activity of the ankle joint in women in their 20s.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Twenty women in their early 20s participated in this study. None of the subjects had
impaired musculoskeletal or neurological systems, and none had a history of athletics or had
received any training in muscle strengthening within the past 6 months. The procedures of
the experiment were explained to the students; no problems with the experiment were
indicated, and all subjects voluntarily agreed to participate. They were each randomly
assigned to one of two groups: the 10 OKC exercise group and the 10 CKC exercise group. This
study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Namseoul University.</p><p>To measure the physical characteristics of the subjects, body composition analyzers (Inbody
720, Biospace Co. Ltd., Seoul, Republic of Korea) were used before each exercise. To
determine muscle strength, a functional rehab system (PRIMUS RS, BTE Tech., Hanover, USA)
was used. To determine muscle activity, the Free EMG system (Free EMG, BTS Inc., Milan,
Italy) was used.</p><p>Before the exercises, the physical characteristics of the subjects were measured. The
exercises were performed to non-dominant exercise. They kicked a ball to determine their
dominant lower extremity<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. The exercise
protocols, which were modified in reference to a previous study, included the performance of
OKC and CKC exercise for 60 minutes<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.
The exercise was performed on the non-dominant side<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. The protocol consisted of a warm-up exercise for 10 minutes, the
main OKC or CKC exercises for 40 minutes, and then a cool-down exercise for 10 minutes

were positioned in the physical rehabilitation equipment with their knees fully<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>, and the hip joints and the knee joints on
both sides were fixed into a neutral position using a strap to prevent compensation. The
subject was allowed to sit with knee flexion 90 &#x000b0;and to use tool number 701 to measure the
movement of the inversion (IV) and eversion (EV). The pelvic and knee joints were fixed in
order to prevent compensation. The equipment was calibrated before each exercise was
performed. The isometric exercises were performed three times by each subject to induce
muscle fatigue for maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC)<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. There was a 1-minute rest period between each
attempt<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. The mean of the three MVIC
measurements was selected as the MVIC in this study. The subjects were given verbal
reinforcement to encourage them to exert maximum force during the isometric
contractions<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>For surface EMG, electrodes were attached to the muscles at maximum static contraction to
prevent any technical difficulties from influencing the experiment. The skin was abraded
with sandpaper, shaved, and then cleaned with an alcohol-soaked cotton swab in order to
reduce the electrical impedance of the skin to less than 5 k&#x003a9;. Active electrodes (Carbon
electrode, 3M, USA) were placed 2&#x02005;cm apart<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup> in parallel with the muscle fibers on the tibialis anterior (TA),
gastrocnemius (GM), tibialis posterior (TP), and peroneus longus (PL) in the state of

the electrode was placed 25% of the way from the fibula head to the lateral malleolus<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. All electrodes were attached at maximal
static contraction by the same physiotherapist. The EMG signal that was measured was
analyzed using MyoLab software (BTS Inc., Milan, Italy). The MVIC was measured for 5-second
with each movement and used 3-second in this study excepted for the first and the last one
second. The root mean square (RMS) value of the EMG of the muscles was measured for
10-second.</p><p>Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS for Windows v. 22.0. The physical
characteristics are reported as mean &#x000b1; SD. The dependent variables were tested for normality
using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and for homogeneity of variance using Levene&#x02019;s test.
Two-way repeated measures ANOVA was used to examine the significance of the differences in
balance and to compare the muscle strength and the EMG of the muscles between the groups
(OKC and CKC exercise groups) and time (pre- and post-exercise). The statistical
significance level was &#x003b1;=0.05. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of

ligament forces. The CKC exercise activated antagonistic muscle groups across multiple
joints; as a result, it cannot be used to isolate or examine a single muscle group. The OKC
exercise isolated specific muscle groups for strengthening and evaluation purposes<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Resistance exercise using the Thera-band is
simple, economical, and safety. It is often used for rehabilitation purposes because the
training can be selected and adapted case by case due to the control of the loading
intensity<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>This study aimed to analyze the effects of the OKC and CKC exercises with a Thera-Band and
towel so that the exercises can be performed easily in daily life on muscle strength and
muscle activity.</p><p>In a previous study, the femoral quadriceps muscle was activated in isolation during the
OKC exercise, thus increasing the force of patellofemoral compression<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. A previous study examined the effects of the CKC exercise
and OKC exercise on muscle activation in the paretic lower limbs of chronic stroke subjects.
The muscle activation of the GM and TA increased significantly only in the CKC exercise
group. These findings indicate that the CKC exercise can improve lower-limb muscle strength
in chronic stroke patients, and this may carry over into an improvement in functional
performance<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. A previous study
analyzed the effects of a stable versus an unstable base of support on shoulder muscle
activity during CKC exercise; the CKC exercise with an unstable base of support did not
increase the muscle activity in comparison to the CKC exercises with a stable base of
support<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In the current study, there were significant differences in PF and DF in the muscle
strength between the pre- and post-tests for both the OKC and CKC exercise groups. There was
no significant difference in the muscle activity. The OKC and CKC exercises led to
muscle-strength improvement because they stimulated mechanoreceptors in the joint and
increased muscle fiber, and the number of motor units increased during these resistance
exercises. There were significant differences in PF and DF, rather than inversion and
eversion, because the OKC and CKC exercises in this study were focused on PF and DF
exercise. The intensity and duration of the OKC and CKC exercises was not high enough or
long enough, respectively, to change the muscle activity of young adult women.</p><p>In conclusion, this study aimed to analyze the effect of the OKC and CKC exercises on the
muscle strength and muscle activity of the lower extremity in young women. The OKC and CKC
exercises had a positive effect on the muscle strength of the TA and GM. These results can
help in devising an exercise protocol to improve muscle strength that can be used not only
at home but also in a clinical. Further studies are required in order to determine the
