</p><p>Patients allocation into one of the two study groups, &#x0201c;early feeding&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;delayed feeding&#x0201d; group was accomplished by a computer-generated list of random numbers. The group name was placed inside consecutively numbered opaque envelopes. The sealed envelopes were secured in a box and placed in the maternity ward from where they were drawn serially until completion of the study. Both the surgeon and the primary investigator were blinded of the study assignment into group. The managing team of obstetricians attended to the patients according to what was contained in the picked envelopes.</p><p>The early feeding group took oral sips of water 6 h after CS, and this was graduated to liquid diet of 100 ml of tea taken under supervision by any member of the research team after 12 h postoperatively and thereafter every 6 h. This was followed by soft diet on the patient's demand after 24 h. Thereafter, regular diet was introduced.</p><p>The delayed feeding group was restricted from oral fluid intake for the first 24 h. Oral sips of water were administered after 24 h postoperatively. This was based on the presence of or absence of bowel sounds. Liquid diet (100 ml) was taken by the patient under supervision of any member of the research team 4 h after oral sips of water and thereafter every 6 h. This was followed by a soft diet on the patient's demand after 48 h. Thereafter, regular diet was introduced.</p><p>Terms used in this study are defined in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Definition of terms used in the study</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="NJS-24-6-g001"/></table-wrap><p>Patients were also asked to note the time they passed the first flatus after the surgery.</p><p>The demographic characteristics, indication for CS, operative and outcome characteristics of the CS were recorded. The participants were interviewed regarding their hospital progress and satisfaction with study protocol, using visual analog scale (VAS 0&#x02013;100). A VAS for satisfaction is a horizontal line of 100-mm long. At the beginning and at the end, there are two descriptors representing extremes of satisfaction (i.e., no satisfaction and extreme satisfaction). The patient rated her satisfaction by making a vertical mark on the 100-mm line. The measurement in millimeters was converted to the same number of points ranging from 0 to 100 points.

These women who were fed early made more rapid recovery and expressed their interest in early discharge. Other authors had observed similar findings.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] However, a study in Uganda[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] reported that there was no significant difference in length of hospital stay between early feeding group and traditional feeding group. This variation could be explained from the point of view that 99% of patients in the above mentioned study received general anaesthesia with return to bowel movement of 67.8 &#x000b1; 22.8 and 75.8 &#x000b1; 22.9 h in the early feeding and delayed feeding groups, respectively, compared to 100% of patients having spinal anaesthesia and 62.6 &#x000b1; 22.9 versus 69.9 &#x000b1; 19.3 h of return to bowel movement in our study.</p><p>Although the economic impact of early feeding was not measured in this study, it can be easily argued that the decreased intravenous fluids and parenteral medications occasioned by early oral intake as well as early discharge from hospital may have benefited the patients economically.</p><p>Important also is the fact that most cultures in Nigeria and other African settings observe the naming ceremony of a newborn on the 8 days. This implies that most women would be happy to be discharged home earlier to enable them prepare for this important cultural activity.</p><p>This study showed a significantly shorter duration of need for retaining a Foley's catheter in the early feeding group. Again, this facilitates early ambulation for the patient and may also reduce the risk of urinary tract infection which is a feared complication of urethral catheterization.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>The postoperative complications, including postoperative fever in the two study groups, were comparable and not statistically significant.

This difference in findings could be attributed to the introduction of regular diets rather than fluids which is much more acceptable after CS by most women as noted by a previous researcher. Another reason for the nonstatistically significant difference in the levels of satisfaction could be the fact that the quoted study did not also detect any difference in hospital stay, time to passage of first flatus, and time to bowel movements between the two groups unlike in this study were significant differences existed between the groups regarding these variables which have likelihood of influencing patients satisfaction.</p><p>Limitations to the findings from this study include the complexity of interpreting satisfaction which may be related to other aspects of care received in the hospital rather than just the early introduction of oral feeds.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>Findings from this study suggests that early initiation of oral feeding after uncomplicated CS under spinal anesthesia is safe and well tolerated as there was no increased incidence of gastrointestinal symptoms or paralytic ileus. It was rather associated with early return of normal bowel function, shorter duration of intravenous fluid administration, early removal of the urethral catheter, faster patient mobilization, reduced duration of hospital stay, and cost of hospital bill as well as higher levels of satisfaction by the patients.</p><p>Thus, there are no obvious advantages in withholding fluid and food after uncomplicated CS under spinal anesthesia. Obstetric units should, therefore, embrace the practice of early feeding after CS.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"
