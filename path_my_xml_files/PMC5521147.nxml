Previous studies have indicated that collaborative care (CC) has a positive effect on symptoms when provided to people with depression, but CC has not yet been applied in a Danish context. We therefore developed a model for CC (the Collabri model) to treat people with depression in general practice in Denmark. Since systematic identification of patients is an &#x0201c;active ingredient&#x0201d; in CC and some literature suggests case finding as the best alternative to standard detection, the two detection methods are examined as part of the study. The aim is to investigate if treatment according to the Collabri model has an effect on depression symptoms when provided to people with depression in general practice in Denmark, and to examine if case finding is a better method to detect depression in general practice than standard detection.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p id="Par2">The trial is a cluster-randomised, clinical superiority trial investigating the effect of treatment according to the Collabri model for CC, compared to treatment as usual for 480 participants diagnosed with depression in general practice in the Capital Region of Denmark. The primary outcome is depression symptoms (Beck&#x02019;s Depression Inventory (BDI-II)) after 6&#x000a0;months. Secondary outcomes include depression symptoms (BDI-II) after 15&#x000a0;months, anxiety symptoms (Beck&#x02019;s Anxiety Inventory (BAI)), level of functioning (Global Assessment of Function (GAF)) and psychological stress (Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R)). In addition, case finding (with the recommended screening tool Major Depression Inventory (MDI)) and standard detection of depression is examined in a cluster-randomized controlled design. Here, the primary outcome is the positive predictive value of referral diagnosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">If the Collabri model is shown to be superior to treatment as usual, the study will contribute with important knowledge on how to improve treatment of depression in general practice, with major benefit to patients and society. If case finding is shown to be superior to standard detection, it will be recommended as the detection method in future treatment according to the Collabri model.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par4">ClinicalTrials.gov. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02678845">NCT02678845</ext-link>.

A Danish survey found a point prevalence of major depression of 3.3% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Based on the Danish National Patient Register [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], including information on all patients in Danish hospitals, the annual number of new cases of depression admitted to a psychiatric hospital is 11,000. It is estimated that 32,000 men and 59,000 women are living with depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The human cost relating to depression is great, but the illness also places a significant burden on the public economy. It is estimated that the cost related to loss of production due to depression in Denmark is approximately 0.5 billion US dollars per annum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The majority of people with depression are treated in general practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], but studies show that many patients with depression go unrecognised or do not receive evidence-based treatment in general practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Some of the obstacles in the current management and organisation of treatment of depression that have been identified are as follows. First, there is a lack of coordination of the management of depression, as there is no organised, coherent treatment regime between general practice and psychiatry. Second, there is a lack of treatment opportunities, as most general practitioners (GPs) are not trained to offer psychotherapy. It is estimated that only around one third of GPs in Denmark are qualified to offer cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, GPs can refer patients with mild and moderate depression to a psychologist, but part of the treatment is paid for by the patient (with the other part being publically funded if the patient meets specific criteria). Third, there is a shortage of independent psychiatrists and psychologists trained in CBT or other evidence-based psychotherapies targeting depression, delaying the specialised treatment of patients referred from general practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par28">National guidelines recommend that optimising depression treatment in general practice could be done through introducing shared-care interventions, such as collaborative care (CC) programmes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. CC stems from the recognition, that patients with depression in general practice may profit from an organisation of care corresponding to the model introduced for other chronic diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Health economics studies indicate that, in spite of extra initial costs when introducing CC, the costs tend to have recovered after 3&#x02013;4 years and with substantial long-term savings, because of reduction in sick leave and disability pensions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par29">A Cochrane review from 2012, investigating the effects of CC for depression, concluded that CC is associated with significant improvements in treatment outcomes for up to 2&#x000a0;years, compared with usual care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Therefore, CC represents a useful addition to clinical pathways for adult patients with depression. The evidence is based on research primarily conducted in the USA and England. Until now, no studies have been conducted in Scandinavia. The current evidence is therefore based on an organisational framework not directly applicable in a Danish context, and it is not possible to know whether CC will have the same effect in a Danish context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Thus, it is necessary to adjust the model to Danish conditions. The development of a Danish model for CC (the Collabri model) for depression was completed in 2014 in cooperation between Danish GPs, psychiatrists and researchers. A protocol for a cluster-randomised trial in patients with depression treated according to the Collabri model, are presented in this article. At the same time models for CC for panic disorder, generalized anxiety and social phobia were developed. The trial protocol for the investigation of CC vs. treatment as usual for these three anxiety disorders are presented in a separate paper.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>The detection of depression study</title><p id="Par30">Bower et al. reports that systematic identification of patients is an &#x0201c;active ingredient&#x0201d; in CC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], so we want to include systematic identification in the Collabri depression study, and to use a method that can be carried out by GPs. Studies indicate that GPs fail to diagnose about half of patients with depression in general practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. There is substantial evidence that routine screening will lead to too many false positives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], because of the modest prevalence of depression in primary care. However, the US Preventive Task Force reports evidence supporting screening for depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. One factor for the opposing conclusions is that the latter includes research where screening is supported by subsequent treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par31">To sum up, screening for depression is recommended in the USA, but not in the UK and in Denmark, where screening is only recommended in high-risk groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Nevertheless, screening of high-risk groups is not supported by subsequent literature. A randomised controlled trial on high-risk screening found no difference in recognition rates between the intervention group and the control group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In a prospective cohort study, as a final result of screening, only 1% (17/1687) started treatment for major depressive disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Finally, in a Danish observational study investigating high-risk screening for depression with the Major Depression Inventory (MDI), compared with screening with MDI on clinical suspicion (called case-finding) and a combination of the two methods, investigators found that screening of patients in high-risk groups had limited effect in addition to the cheaper and less invasive method of case-finding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par32">In the reviewed randomized controlled trials (RCTs), screening was conducted using a variety of other tools including the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-9, Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders (PRIME-MD), and hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS), but we planned to use the MDI, a self-assessment questionnaire that uses the diagnostic criteria from <italic>International Classification of Diseases edition 10</italic> (ICD-10) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and is recommended for screening and diagnostics of depression in Denmark [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. It has shown good agreement with standard methods such as Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (SCAN), [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] for both diagnosis and severity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Based on the aforementioned literature and the available techniques, case-finding is tested against standard detection of depression in a randomised controlled design as part of the Collabri study. Since the study on detection of depression (the detection study) is incorporated with the Collabri studies and shares much of their methods, this article presents both the protocol (version 2) for a cluster randomised trial on treatment according to the Collabri model for patients with depression (the treatment outcome study) and for the study on detection of depression (the detection of depression study).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Aim and design</title><p id="Par33">The aim of the study is to test the null hypothesis that treatment according to the Collabri model (intervention group) and treatment as usual (control group) has the same effect on depression symptoms in people with depression in primary care and to test the null hypothesis that the performance of case-finding and standard detection of depression in primary care is the same. The treatment outcome study is a cluster-randomised, clinical superiority trial in 480 patients diagnosed with depression in general practice. The detection of depression study is a cluster-randomised trial within the Collabri study setting.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Eligibility of study participants</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>Cluster level</title><p id="Par34">GPs with a registered provider number in the Capital Region of Denmark, except for Bornholm, are eligible to participate in the Collabri study of depression. The local branch of the Organisation of General Practitioners in Denmark and the Capital Region of Health Care have negotiated and signed an agreement that allows the GPs to participate in the study and sets out the terms and conditions for it, including financial reimbursement.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Individual level</title><p id="Par35">Patients are eligible for the outcome study and the detection of depression study if their GP participates in the study and the patient complies with the following inclusion and exclusion criteria, assessed either by the GP at recruitment and/or by a research assistant at a baseline eligibility interview. Patients are eligible for the outcome study if they are diagnosed with depression according to the ICD-10. Patients are eligible for the detection of depression study if they are referred to the study either by their GP in the standard detection group with a depression diagnosis or by their GP in the case-finding group with a (positive or negative) MDI score. In both studies, patients must be 18&#x000a0;years of age, Danish speaking and give her/his written informed consent to participate in the trial on the terms described.</p><p id="Par36">Patients cannot participate in the Collabri studies and are excluded at baseline if they have a high risk of suicide, a current psychotic condition, obsessive compulsory disorder (OCD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), bipolar affective disorder, or alcohol or substance misuse that prevents the person from participating in the Collabri intervention. Patients are also excluded at baseline if they are in current therapeutic or medical treatment for anxiety or depression, have a pending disability pension case, or have been treated for anxiety or depression within the last 6&#x000a0;months. Additionally, patients diagnosed with dementia and patients assessed by the GP to be medically unstable, making it impossible to adhere to treatment, cannot participate. Further, patients cannot participate if they are referred to treatment in the secondary psychiatric caresystem not later than at first contact with the GP after inclusion by a research assistant is referred to treatment in the secondary psychiatric care system. Patients in the intervention group are excluded if they want treatment cf. the psychologist scheme and do not want referral to the psychologist to be preceded by treatment according to the Collabri model.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Recruitment and randomisation</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Cluster level</title><p id="Par37">Recruitment of GPs ran from May 2014 to July 2015. GPs in the catchment areas of the Capital Region in Denmark were invited to join the study through letters with information about the project and dates for a total of four information meetings. Additionally, the GPs were recruited through articles in professional newsletters and forums. Information visits and telephone calls to GPs were made on request.</p><p id="Par38">The randomisation was conducted by centralised random computer-generated allocation sequence, carried out externally by the Research Centre for Prevention and Health (RCPH) at practice level, where each cluster corresponds to a provider number consisting of one or more GPs. Cluster randomisation was chosen because of the risk of bias in the form of contamination if the randomisation was on an individual level. The GPs were randomised to give either treatment as usual or CC according to the Collabri model. In both the treatment as usual group and the CC group, the GPs were subsequently randomised according to detection method, which was either standard detection of depression or case-finding. In standard detection the GPs were asked to use the MDI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] as often as they usually did. In case-finding the GPs were asked to systematically use the MDI as a screening tool if they suspected depression. See Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> for an illustration of the randomisation process.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Flow-chart for participants</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2017_2064_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>
</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Individual level</title><p id="Par39">Patients within the clusters are allocated to the same group as their GP. The GPs enrolled in the study detect patients with depression according to randomisation allocation. Only patients who meet the criteria for depression at baseline are included in the depression study. Patients who have not initially been diagnosed with depression by the GP and have only been referred to the detection of depression study, and are subsequently diagnosed with depression through the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI), are asked to participate in the treatment outcome study if the GP agrees with the diagnosis.</p><p id="Par40">The GP obtains verbal consent from the patient that a research assistant can make contact by telephone in order to conduct a diagnostic interview (MINI interview). If the diagnosis according to the MINI interview is inconsistent with the GP&#x02019;s diagnosis, the research assistant consults a psychiatrist in the Collabri group, who contacts the GP to confirm which diagnosis is correct. Patient recruitment was initiated in November 2014 and ended on 31 December 2016.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Blinding</title><p id="Par41">It is not possible to ensure blinding of the patient and GP, but the blinding of GP allocation to intervention group is maintained for researchers in the data collection phase and in the analysis phase. The intervention groups are coded and anonymised (e.g. X and Y) so that researchers are blinded in the entire phase of the analysis and when writing the conclusion. In the detection of depression study, blinding of the patient diagnosis and the MDI result is maintained for the researchers during the MINI interview, in order to ensure that the evaluation of diagnosis is not affected by the GP&#x02019;s referral diagnosis.</p><p id="Par42">Care managers, GPs, psychiatrists, and patients are notified that they cannot reveal to the researchers to which group the patients are allocated. If the blinding is broken and referral diagnosis, or baseline or outcome measures are revealed at the baseline interview or at the follow-up interview, the patient is referred to another blinded researcher.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>The experimental intervention - treatment according to the Collabri model</title><p id="Par43">Four criteria for CC are listed in the Cochrane review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]: a multi-professional approach to treatment, scheduled monitoring and review, enhanced inter-professional communication, and a structured treatment plan. Participants in the intervention group are treated according to the Collabri model, based on the four criteria listed in the Cochrane review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and on the recommendations from a systematic literature reveiw by Eplov et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], and adapted to the Danish health care system by including collaboration with relevant social worker(s) in the municipality and integrating the existing psychologist scheme. On the basis of these and on current guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], the following elements were integrated into the Collabri model: recruitment of staff with mental health care experience, training of GP and care manager, use of instruments for detection and follow up, education and treatment of the patient, supervision from a psychiatric specialist, and a stepped-care approach to treatment where treatment is always commenced on the least invasive and least resource-demanding level. These elements will be described in detail.</p><p id="Par44">The Collabri model is based on a multi-professional approach to treatment. Treatment is provided by care managers, GPs and psychiatrists, all of whom receive a short training following their recruitment. The care manager has a medium-long health professional education, is often a nurse, and has experience in working in mental health together with a certified CBT course (of minimum 1&#x000a0;year). The care manager provides assessment of side effects due to medical treatment, CBT, supportive conversations, diagnosis-specific treatment, psychoeducation and regular contact with social worker(s). The GP has overall responsibility for treatment and takes care of the diagnostic procedure, initiation of treatment, coordination of the treatment intervention with the care manager, supervision of the care manager, and collaboration with the care manager on contact with social caseworker(s).

To our knowledge this is the first randomised trial investigating the effect of a CC model for depression in a Scandinavian context. The strength of the outcome study is the centralised computer-based cluster randomization, which ensures adequate generation of the allocation sequence and adequate allocation concealment. The use of blinded outcome assessors for the secondary outcome, the fact that it is a register-based outcome, and the use of intention-to-treat analysis decreases the risk of biased effect estimates. The strength of the detection of depression study is also the centralised computer-based cluster randomisation and the use of blinded assessors of the outcomes. The trial is registered at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov">http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>, which helps prevent selective and incomplete outcome reporting. The fact that we monitor fidelity to the Collabri model after 6&#x000a0;months is also a strength of the trial. This is intended to ensure that care managers, psychiatrists, and GPs are true to the model. A limitation of this trial is that we are not able to blind participants, care managers, psychiatrists, or GPs to the allocation. Another limitation is that the primary outcome is self-reported and therefore not blinded, which may well lead to overestimation of treatment effects. Some might argue that it is difficult to sustain the blinding of the assessor during follow up, and this certainly leads to risk of bias. Should blinding be broken, a second assessor will complete the follow-up interview.</p><p id="Par76">Although participants are recruited from general practices throughout the Capital Region of Denmark, and should be fairly representative of the population in the region, there may be reduced external validity. As it is the GP who identifies eligible participants, not everybody with depression who is eligible may be asked to participate, as patients are not systematically screened for eligibility. Due to differences in healthcare systems, the results may not be directly comparable with other countries, but together with other trials in the area, it will give a more complete picture of the effects of collaborative care in people with depression.</p><p id="Par77">The results of this trial will add to the knowledge of collaborative care for depression in a Scandinavian context. If the Collabri model is shown to be more effective than treatment as usual in general practice, the results can contribute to improving the care and treatment for patients with depression in general practice with benefits to both patients and society. The results of the detection of depression study add to the knowledge of detection of depression in primary care.

No substantial deviation from the protocol will be implemented without prior review and approval of the regulatory authorities. Personally identifiable information collected in the study is treated according to the Danish Law on Personal Information (Lov om behandling af personoplysninger). Data are stored and kept confidential in secure cupboards and electronic data are stored in entry-restricted files. The study is also carried out in accordance with the applicable guidelines for social science research ethics. When communicating the results, participants and clinics will be anonymised. For every patient there is a case record form (CRF) marked with an identification number. Data on each patient are kept there. An identification list with the civil registration number (cpr. number) and case record numbers is stored in an entry-restricted folder on an internal electronic drive, separately from other patient-related material. The participants&#x02019; consent is voluntary and informed, and given both verbally and in writing. Previous international experience does not indicate that the intervention provided by the Collabri model is associated with side effects for the patients. In order to minimize the possible risks of discomfort, the research interviews are conducted in a flexible manner and interspersed with breaks if necessary. The extent of the interviews is a maximum of 2&#x000a0;hours and questionnaires take a maximum of an hour to complete. It is possible to fill out questionnaires in stages. If the participants experience the interview as stressful or uncomfortable, the interview can be conducted in stages or the participants can without further ado leave the trial, without it affecting their possibility of receiving current or future treatment. Prior to commencement, the project has been approved by the Regional Ethics Committees of the Capital Region of Denmark (identification no: H-3-2013-203) and approved by the Danish Data Protection Agency (ID number: 2007-58-0015, local journal no: RHP-2014-012) and by DSAMs Multi Practices Committee (ID number MPU 29-2013) and registered on ClinicalTrials.gov., identifier: NCT02678845. Results will be published in international journals.
