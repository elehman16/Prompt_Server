This differs from integrated EBM training, in which EBM is trained in a clinical context, and teaching sessions are based on recent patient consultations in the trainees' practice. A review from 2004 reported that EBM knowledge among hospital trainees improved with both stand-alone and integrated EBM training, while skills, attitude and behaviour improved only with integrated EBM training. The authors concluded that &#x0201c; teaching of evidence-based medicine should be moved from classrooms to clinical practice to achieve improvements in substantial outcomes&#x0201d;.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> However, the effectiveness of stand-alone and integrated EBM training was never directly compared in a (randomised) controlled trial; nor were the effects on EBM behaviour of former trainees assessed in daily clinical practice after graduation.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>

Since trainee groups of two consecutive time moments (two groups in March and one in June, and two in September and one in December) have joint educational programmes, we clustered the intervention in time, and randomly allocated the first three groups to the intervention arm and the last three groups to the control arm. Data were collected at baseline (T0), at the end of the third year (T1) and 1&#x02005;year after graduation (T2). Baseline characteristics such as age, sex, medical school, clinical experience and score on the GP knowledge test, a national test that is used to monitor knowledge progress, were collected.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Trainees were also asked to self-assess their EBM attitude and EBM knowledge at baseline on a five-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (very poor) to 5 (very good).</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Intervention</title><p>The EBM training programme in the intervention and control groups is summarised in <xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2015010537TB1">table 1</xref>.

<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> In addition, we changed four components of the (regular) stand-alone EBM training programme and incorporated two new elements in the programme to better link EBM theory to clinical practice (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2015010537TB1">table 1</xref> for details).

It was assessed using the translated version of the McColl questionnaire, consisting of seven questions, that was validated for the Dutch setting.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15&#x02013;17</xref> EBM knowledge was defined as the ability to answer questions on EBM, as taught in the EBM training programme, and was assessed with a newly developed, validated questionnaire (score 0&#x02013;50), based on the content of the EBM training programme (MF Kortekaas <italic>et al</italic>, submitted). To minimise the impact of repeated measurements (ie, repeated use of the same questionnaire), no feedback on performance was reported to trainees after each questionnaire.</p></sec><sec id="s2f3"><title>Evaluation of the intervention</title><p>Implementation of the (new) integrated EBM training programme was assessed by asking trainees to report their compliance to new elements of the EBM training programme anonymously, and by asking them for their opinion about the programme.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Sample size</title><p>The sample size calculation was based on the expected improvement in information-seeking behaviour.

The analyses were based on the intention-to-treat principle. Missing data were not imputed, as multilevel analysis accounts for loss to follow-up. In a sensitivity analysis, we excluded trainees from the analyses when they had logged only a few patients at one or more measurements (the lowest decile, <italic>N</italic>=60 at T0, <italic>N</italic>=17 at T1 and <italic>N</italic>=47 at T2).

Nine trainees (53%) conducted one or more e-learning courses during the year, but almost none (12%) had used online coaching. Trainees rated the integrated EBM training programme with a mean score of 6 (scale 1&#x02013;10). About half of the trainees (53%) considered the overall volume of EBM training as adequate. The integration of EBM into clinical practice was rated as sufficient by two-third (N=11). Half of the trainees (N=9) reported that their supervisors were not enthusiastic about the new EBM training elements in clinical practice, or that they were not aware of it (N=13). In contrast, more than half (N=10) felt supported by their supervisors to integrate the EBM training elements into clinical practice. Responding supervisors (N=15) frequently agreed with trainees' opinions.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our results show that an integrated EBM training programme in the final third year of the GP specialty training does not improve EBM performance as compared with stand-alone EBM training. EBM behaviour, with guideline adherence (RR 0.96 to 1.10) and information-seeking behaviour (RR 0.90 to 1.16), attitude and knowledge, did not differ between trainees in the two groups, neither during the last year of training, nor in the year following graduation. Overall, guideline adherence among trainees was high in all phases of their training, ranging from 69% to 95%, depending on the type of management decision. In more than half of the consultations, trainees adhered to the guideline on all management decisions. GP trainees had on average one clinical query per five patients, and succeeded in retrieving an answer to the vast majority of their questions.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study performing a randomised controlled trial among GP trainees comparing integrated with stand-alone EBM training, and assessing both short-term and long-term effects on EBM behaviour, attitude and knowledge.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28&#x02013;31</xref> Prior studies assessing the effects of EBM training predominantly used non-controlled designs, and did not include a direct comparison between programmes.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>
<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Moreover, integration of EBM is poorly defined in the literature, resulting in a large variety of training programmes included in studies, while these studies were performed in many different settings and populations.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>
<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> The fact that we use clinical examples in our stand-alone EBM training is considered &#x02018;integrated&#x02019; by some already.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Prior studies reporting effects of EBM training showed contradictory results. Outcomes most frequently reported were EBM knowledge, skills and attitude.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>
<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> The few studies assessing effects on EBM behaviour frequently used (retrospective) questionnaires, in contrast to &#x02018;real-time&#x02019; measurements as in our study.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> This may have resulted in an overestimation of the small effects of EBM training observed in these earlier studies. The GP trainees' scores on EBM attitude in our study were low compared with those in earlier studies.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> The number of clinical queries was lower as well, but the GP trainees very frequently performed a (successful) search.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> One year after graduation, the number of clinical queries in the intervention group was higher than at the end of the third year, but still low in comparison to earlier studies. Although the number of searches in the intervention group decreased after graduation, all GP trainees in our study still performed more searches compared with earlier studies.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> The effects of EBM training on adherence of individual GP trainees to multiple guidelines for a wide range of management decisions have not been evaluated before. Moreover, we took motivated deviation in individual patients into account, and our results show that trainees appropriately motivated why they deviated from the guideline in 10% of the patient consultations during training, and in 20% of their consultations after graduating.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34&#x02013;36</xref></p><sec id="s4a"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>We assessed EBM behaviour in daily clinical practice, using a large number and a wide variety of patient consultations, with a long-term follow-up. The choice to perform our study in the third year of the GP specialty training enabled us to assess the effects of the different EBM training programmes until after graduation. However, the high levels of guideline adherence and information-seeking behaviour at the beginning of the third year left little room for improvement, thereby making it very difficult to demonstrate any additional benefit of the intervention. At baseline, groups differed in the score on the national GP knowledge test and the preferred type of logbook. Since allocation to the intervention or control arm was random in our study, differences between the groups at baseline are random and it is not by definition obligatory to adjust for this.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> However, since the national GP knowledge measures knowledge of the professional guidelines and therefore may have been correlated to guideline adherence in clinical practice, we accounted for this in our analyses, but this did not materially change our findings. The differences in the preferred type of logbook at baseline had an important impact on the (quality of the) data reported by GP trainees, and thereby on the assessment of guideline adherence with our instrument. For this reason, we decided to account for the type of logbook as used at baseline in our analyses, and decided to only collect data digitally at the next two follow-up measurements in both groups. For integration in practice, we were dependent on the GP trainees and the GP supervisors, who are important role models. We know that insufficient skills and knowledge of supervisors, together with a negative attitude, are important barriers for them to use and to teach EBM.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> For this reason, we gave them training in EBM as well, and trainees and supervisors performed assignments together.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> An online survey after the intervention (with a response rate of 44%) showed that only half of these trainees thought that their supervisors were enthusiastic about their new EBM training. Large variability in the way some components of the intervention were delivered in the primary care practices may have diluted a potential effect of our intervention. Although such &#x02018;lack of adherence&#x02019; may have reduced the effect of the intervention, such variability is likely to occur in any training programme in daily teaching environments. Furthermore, the contrast between both groups may have been limited because our stand-alone EBM training could be considered as &#x02018;integrated&#x02019; to some extent, because we do use clinical examples.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Comparison with &#x02018;no EBM training&#x02019; could have provided more information about the effect(s) of EBM training. However, since EBM is one of the competencies obligatory in the GP specialty training in the Netherlands, this was no option. The time investment needed for GP trainees to collect data in logbooks was substantial. This may have reduced commitment from GP trainees and this may&#x02014;to save time&#x02014;have resulted in recording (too) little information on consultations (especially in the paper logbooks where they could not copy from the electronic medical record (EMR)), under-reporting, selective reporting of the number of clinical queries (eg, only when trying to pursue an answer), or higher rates of loss to follow-up. Bias due to the high rates of loss to follow-up cannot be fully excluded, although a multilevel analysis like the one we performed is very robust for (randomly) missing follow-up measurements.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Moreover, while accounted for in our analyses, the differences between both groups in logbook preference at baseline may have affected the results. Using (copied) data from the EMRs may not have adequately reflected guideline adherence, and misclassification may have occurred due to lack of relevant information. Although guideline adherence was scored by different raters at the three different measurements, we do not expect this to affect the results as the instrument we used has been proven to be reliable, with inter-rater reliabilities ranging from moderate to excellent. Finally, for practical reasons, we randomly allocated the participating trainees at the group level, and we randomly assigned the integrated and stand-alone EBM intervention to the first and the last blocks of three groups. Although this may theoretically not be the optimal randomisation procedure, we do not think that the starting moment of the group was in any way related to clinical capacity of the trainees&#x02019; EBM behaviour.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Conclusion and implications for future</title><p>In a randomised controlled trial, we found no differences in EBM behaviour, attitude or knowledge between GP trainees who received EBM training through a stand-alone module or those who followed an integrated EBM training. We think that the main explanation is that the stand-alone programme adequately increases EBM skills, leaving little room for improvement. EBM skills generally develop well during both trainings: GP trainees in both groups showed consistently high levels of guideline adherence and frequently performed searches in case of clinical queries, which were usually (considered) successful. If EBM training is not yet incorporated in specialty training, we suggest using the integrated EBM training format, as this links to the clinical development of the trainee. Future studies could focus on better integration of EBM training into clinical practice, for instance by engaging supervisors more, as they are important role models for trainees. Moreover, assessment of EBM behaviour at point of care might be made easier, for example, by automatically extracting patient consultation data from EMRs.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>Yvonne Spoormans (YS), Lisanne Welink (LW), Jeroen van Duijn (JvD).</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> All authors contributed equally to the manuscript.
