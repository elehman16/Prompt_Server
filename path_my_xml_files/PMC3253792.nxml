All municipal workers of the City of Turin, Italy, were invited to participate. Those who agreed were randomly assigned, according to their departments, to the intervention group (IG) or to the control group and were given diaries for the daily recording of pain episodes for 1 month (baseline). Subsequently, only the IG (119 departments, 923 workers) began the physical and educational program, whereas the control group (117 departments, 990 workers) did not receive any intervention. All participants were again given diaries for the daily recording of pain episodes after 6 months of intervention. The primary outcome was the change in the frequency of headache (expressed as the proportion of subjects with a &#x02265;50&#x00025; reduction of frequency; responder rate); among the secondary outcomes there were the absolute reduction of the number of days per month with headache and neck/shoulder pain. Differences between the two groups were evaluated using mixed-effect regression models. The IG showed a higher responder rate [risk ratio, 95&#x00025; confidence interval (CI)] for headache (1.58; 1.28 to 1.92) and for neck/shoulder pain (1.53; 1.27 to 1.82), and a larger reduction of the days per month (95&#x00025; CI) with headache (&#x02212;1.72; &#x02212;2.40 to &#x02212;1.04) and with neck/shoulder pain (&#x02212;2.51; &#x02212;3.56 to &#x02212;1.47).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The program effectively reduced headache and neck/shoulder pain in a large working community and appears to be easily transferable to primary-care settings.

A further problem is that attention is usually concentrated on either headache or neck pain, overlooking the fact that they are frequently associated <xref rid="pone.0029637-Grimmer1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0029637-Sjaastad1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p><p>For some time, we have applied a simple educational and physical program to decrease muscle tension in the head and neck/shoulder area. In our clinical experience, this approach has reduced the frequency and intensity of headache and neck/shoulder pain and the amount of drug intake in a considerable number of patients. In a controlled, non-randomized trial to evaluate the effectiveness of this program administered to a large cohort of public servants, we found that 6 months following treatment, the monthly frequency of headache and neck/shoulder pain was reduced by about 40&#x00025; in the intervention group (IG) compared to controls <xref rid="pone.0029637-Mongini1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. These results were stable at a 12-month follow-up <xref rid="pone.0029637-Mongini2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p><p>We have now performed a cluster-randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of our program in a much larger cohort of public servants after 6 and 12 months of follow-up. As our program included exercises and visual feedback measures in the workplace, individual randomization was not feasible due to the high level of interference and contamination between subjects working in the same environment. In this paper, we report the results in terms of the primary objective of the study, i.e., to evaluate the effectiveness of the program in reducing the frequency of head and neck/shoulder pain after 6 months.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>The protocol for this cluster-randomized trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0029637.s001">Checklist S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0029637.s002">Protocol S1</xref>.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics</title><p>All eligible subjects were asked to provide their written informed consent. The protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the San Giovanni Battista Hospital of the City of Turin. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Participants</title><p>Eligible participants were City of Turin municipal workers (11,780 workers in 444 departments) in May 2007. Workers were contacted by a letter enclosed with the May 2007 pay slip bulletin informing them of the study objectives and requesting their participation. Departments where at least one worker provided informed consent by the end of September 2007 were included as units in the randomization procedure. No exclusion criteria were applied.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Data collection</title><p>In October 2007, all participants were given a one-month diary for the daily recording of the presence and severity of their headache and neck/shoulder pain and their intake of analgesics (by type). The diaries (see the form in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0029637.s003">appendix S1</xref>) were filled out via a web site, either directly or after printing a copy. The staff monitored the compliance of the participants by identifying those who did not begin the recordings via the web. In some departments, where the majority of participants preferred to fill out the diaries on paper, they were given a paper copy, and one participant, usually of higher hierarchical position, reminded and advocated the recording by the staff and collected the diaries in close envelopes at the end of the month. The diaries were then directly collected by the staff members. The following pain severity scores were used: 0, no pain; 1, very mild pain, not perceived if distracted; 2, mild pain, constantly perceived; 3, moderate to severe pain that permits daily activity; 4, severe pain that impedes any activity; 5, excruciating pain. Some general characteristics and detailed data relative to headache and neck/shoulder pain were collected in a standardized fashion by a questionnaire based on the criteria of the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD) <xref rid="pone.0029637-The1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> and the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) <xref rid="pone.0029637-Classification1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. The following diagnoses were made according to the ICHD and the IASP guidelines: Migraine with or without Aura (M), Tension Type Headache (TTH), Myogenous neck/shoulder pain (MP). Two or more diagnoses in the same subject were possible.</p><p>Following the recording of the baseline status in October 2007 (month 1), at the beginning of month 2 the workers were informed of their randomization group, and the IG was shown how to apply the physical and educational program. Both groups filled out the diary again at month 7 (i.e., at month 6 of intervention).</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Intervention</title><p>Before administering the program, it was clearly explained to the IG that its aim was to reduce muscle contraction, especially in the cranio-facial-cervical area, and to increase perception of contraction when too elevated. The program consisted of brief shoulder and neck exercises, a relaxation exercise, and instructions on how to reduce parafunction and hyperfunction of the craniofacial and neck muscles during the day.</p><p>These instructions were as follows. Relaxation exercise (once&#x02013;twice a day): Sit down in a comfortable armchair in a quiet room. Let your lower jaw drop completely for 10&#x02013;15 minutes. Apply warm pads to your cheeks and shoulders. Posture exercises: 1) Stand upright with your heels, hips and nape of the neck against a wall. Without moving the rest of your body, bring your shoulders into contact with the wall and release, rhythmically. 2) With your body and head against the wall, make horizontal movements of the head, forwards and backwards. 3) Cup your hands behind your neck. Stretch your head backwards against counterpressure from your hands. Relax after 2&#x02013;3 seconds. Perform each exercise 8&#x02013;10 times in a session; perform a session every 2&#x02013;3 hours. Visual feedback: Place red labels in strategic sites to remind you to avoid excessive contraction of your head and neck muscles.</p><p>The program was delivered to workers by F.M. (professor, MD) and his collaborators: C.M. (DDS), L.F. (DDS), A.U. (DDS), A.P. (Psy.D), M.S. (MD), E.C. (Psy.D), E.B. (DDS). The program was explained in each IG department with a practical demonstration and training to groups of no more than 40 workers. In addition to the red labels for placement around the workplace, other labels were provided for use at home. A written form was also provided with illustrations of the exercises and their instructions. Participants randomized to the IG also had access to a web site to watch a demonstration video. The instructions were repeated twice, after 2 and 4 months. To evaluate the program compliance, a question on the frequency of exercises was added to the month 7 diary, using the following categories: 1) exercises performed fewer than once a week, 2) exercises performed once or twice a week 3) exercises performed three or more days a week, 4) exercises performed exactly as indicated). Due to the low frequency of workers reporting the highest level of compliance, the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> levels were aggregated in one category in the stratified analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Study outcomes</title><p>All the study outcomes were analyzed on the whole population for which both, the baseline and end of the follow up diaries were available (909 subjects in the IG, 972 subjects in the control group).</p><p>The primary outcome was the between-group difference in the proportion of symptomatic headache subjects (i.e., subjects with 4 or more days per month with headache during the baseline period) who achieved a &#x02265;50&#x00025; reduction in pain frequency by month 7 (responder rate).

In the present study, the eligible workers were informed and contacted using a less direct strategy, i.e., a letter enclosed in the pay slip bulletin. Therefore, we expected a much lower participation rate with respect to our previous work. Out of the 11,780 eligible workers in 444 departments, we expected a participation rate of about 20&#x00025;, with a mean of five workers per department; we also assumed a prevalence of symptomatic headache subjects (&#x02265;4 days with pain during the baseline) of 50&#x00025; (in the previous study it was 49&#x00025; <xref rid="pone.0029637-Mongini1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>).

A previous study <xref rid="pone.0029637-Campbell1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> reported ICCs calculated from datasets of primary- and secondary-care implementation studies, showing that ICCs of process variables in primary care ranged from 0.05 to 0.15, whereas ICCs for patient outcomes are generally lower than 0.05. Moreover, another work <xref rid="pone.0029637-Adams1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> reported the ICCs of 1039 variables evaluated in 31 cluster-based studies, showing that 95&#x00025; of ICCs were lower than 0.095.

Using information collected in the informed consent form, the group of workers who did not fill out the baseline diary showed a higher prevalence among males (18&#x00025; vs. 14&#x00025;) and an higher prevalence among people with a low education level (23&#x00025; vs. 15&#x00025;) with respect to workers who filled out the baseline diary. Thus, it was possible to collect the baseline diaries on the remaining 1913 workers within 236 departments (119 departments and 923 workers in the IG, 117 departments and 990 workers in the control group). Overall, the proportion of subjects who filled out the diary directly via the web site was comparable between the two groups (67.7&#x00025; of IG and 69.8&#x00025; of controls). At month 7 of the study, six months after randomization, 32 workers (14 IG, 18 control group) did not fill out the follow-up diary. <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0029637-t001">Table 1</xref> summarizes the department and worker characteristics of the analyzed population (909 in the IG, 972 in the control group). The median numbers of workers per department were four and five, respectively, in the intervention and the control group. Although the randomization procedure was cluster-based, the groups were quite similar on demographic and baseline characteristics. The analyzed population was predominantly female, with a median age of 47 years at enrollment. Almost two-thirds of workers were diagnosed as having TTH, and M was diagnosed in 1099 workers (58&#x00025;); overall, 1471 (78&#x00025;) workers received a diagnosis of MP.</p><fig

Overall, the benefit of the intervention was consistent for all examined end-points associated with headache and neck/shoulder pain, although it was slightly less pronounced for the reduction of drug consumption. An absolute mean reduction of about 2 days/month of pain was observed in the IG subjects compared to controls. The benefit of the intervention was significantly related to the level of compliance.</p><p>Previous studies have assessed the efficacy of noninvasive physical management in reducing the frequencies of different types of headache and neck pain, with conflicting results <xref rid="pone.0029637-Gross1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0029637-Bronfort1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0029637-Kay1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0029637-Biondi1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0029637-Hurwitz1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0029637-Viljanen1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0029637-Ylinen1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0029637-Sjogren1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0029637-Chiu1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0029637-Hoving1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0029637-Haines1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. In a Cochrane systematic review of trials aimed at quantifying the effects of non-invasive physical treatments for chronic/recurrent headaches, Bronfort et al. <xref rid="pone.0029637-Bronfort1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> found 10 good-quality trials, but they could not pool the results because of the high heterogeneity between the studies. The number of patients included in the trials ranged from 12 to 218, and in only three trials was the follow-up longer than 3 months. In a recent Cochrane systematic review to assess whether patient education strategies benefit adults with neck pain, Haines et al. examined 10 selected trials and concluded that no effectiveness for educational interventions for neck pain had been shown <xref rid="pone.0029637-Haines1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. The authors emphasized that in future research, further attention to methodological quality is necessary.</p><p>Our study has several strengths. We used a pragmatic approach, with a much larger sample size and a longer follow-up than in most previous studies, and assessed clinically relevant outcomes <xref rid="pone.0029637-Bronfort1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0029637-Haines1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0029637-Rains1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Moreover, in our study, head and neck/shoulder pain were investigated jointly. A further strength of the study is the assessment of an association between the level of compliance and the magnitude of the intervention effect.</p><p>In this trial the outcomes were not evaluable for about one-third of the randomized workers who did not fill out the baseline (and end of the follow up) diary, even though they initially gave consent to participation. This major limitation was addressed with sensitivity analyses, applying two hypothetical <italic>scenarios</italic>. Even in the worst (and very unlikely) <italic>scenario</italic>, a significant, albeit reduced, benefit of the intervention on headache and neck/shoulder pain was evident; this indicates that possible attrition bias, if present, cannot explain the observed results. Another weakness of our study is that neither the subjects nor the researchers were blinded to the group allocation. However, in physical and behavioral exercise studies, double-blinding is impossible for most interventions, and effective single-blinding is also difficult to achieve in most cases <xref rid="pone.0029637-Rains1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>.</p><p>The prevalence of subjects suffering from frequent pain episodes at the baseline suggests a selective participation in the trial, since subjects with more frequent episodes might have been more interested in participating than those with no or occasional pain.</p><p>Although we are not able to definitively confirm that information was recorded on a daily basis by all subjects, we think that a retrospective compilation of the diaries was unlikely because of the monitoring of the compliance by the staff and some participants. Furthermore, the method of filling out the diaries (web or paper) did not differ between intervention and control groups. Finally, even in case of a possible retrospective compilation of the diaries by a subgroup of subjects, available evidence from previous validation studies confirm a high degree of accuracy of the patient recall of headache frequency <xref rid="pone.0029637-McKenzie1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0029637-Niere1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0029637-VandenBrink1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>.</p><p>As previously observed <xref rid="pone.0029637-Mongini1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, the improvement in the pain frequency in the control group during the study period, i.e., from October to April, could have been related to seasonal variations and to the subjects' expectations, which were reinforced by keeping a diary. Indeed, the workers of the control group were informed that they would start the program subsequently (at month 8).</p><p>Some explanations of the positive effects of the program may be suggested. In our study, management consisted of a simple, self-administered educational and exercise program performed alone at the workplace and at home. Indeed, the daily time required to perform the program is limited, and easily compatible with most occupations. Although simple, our program, in contrast to the majority of those applied in other studies, may have a positive interaction between educational and exercise components. The educational aspects consist in a clear discussion of the major aspects of the problem; in periodical instruction reinforcement, including reinforcement by the more motivated subjects of the working community; and in the application of visual feedback at the workplace and at home. These aspects probably explain also the lower rate of drop-outs compared to other trials. We found that medium-high compliance was accompanied by a greater effect; however, some efficacy was observed also in those whose compliance was low. This could be explained by the fact that the educational aspects of the program were the same for all the participants. Most subjects with a low level of compliance may have acquired the ability to maintain their craniocervical muscles at a lower contraction level during the day. Beneficial effects may have resulted partly from mechanisms involving expectation and conscious anticipation <xref rid="pone.0029637-Amanzio1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>.</p><p>The results obtained in this study may be of high clinical relevance. Our study shows that a low-cost, low-intensity educational and physical program is effective in reducing head and neck/shoulder pain and possibly analgesic drug consumption in large working populations. This approach seems easily transferable to primary care settings. Further trials are needed to investigate if this program is also effective in a clinical setting, for highly selected patients suffering from specific headache types.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0029637.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>CONSORT Checklist.</p><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0029637.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0029637.s002"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><p>Trial Protocol.</p><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0029637.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0029637.s003"><label>Appendix S1</label><caption><p>Diary form.</p><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0029637.s003.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0029637.s004"><label>Appendix S2</label><caption><p>Distribution of baseline and follow-up frequency of the number of days with pain and drug consumption.</p><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0029637.s004.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Valter Torri (Mario Negri Institute for Pharmacological Research, Milan, Italy) for his helpful comments and suggestions and Michael Mostert for his valuable assistance in revising the final version of the manuscript.
