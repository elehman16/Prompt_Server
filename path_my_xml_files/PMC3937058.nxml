Adolescents in the U.S. are under-immunized. Despite national guidelines for routine administration, coverage for vaccines in the adolescent platform ranges from 85% for tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis (Tdap) to 74% for meningococcal conjugate to just 33% for completion of the three-dose human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine series (females only) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. These coverage levels are dramatically lower than for childhood vaccines, which typically achieve coverage over 90% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. To improve levels of adolescent vaccination, clinic-level interventions may be particularly effective, since underuse appears to stem, in part, from organizational and provider factors. For example, a leading reason that adolescents are not up-to-date is that providers do not recommend adolescent vaccines in a timely manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>The recent widespread adoption of immunization information systems, or vaccine registries, has provided a means to address underuse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. These secure, electronic databases offer access to population-based coverage data needed for clinic-level benchmarking and evaluation. Registries also support patient reminder/recall systems and other strategies for improving vaccine delivery. Thus, a persistent problem and the increasing availability of tools to address that problem combine to make adolescent immunization a compelling target for quality improvement.</p><p>One model used to guide immunization quality improvement for adolescents is the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&#x02019;s (CDC) Assessment, Feedback, Incentives, and eXchange (AFIX) Program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Developed to improve immunization in early childhood, AFIX employs an &#x02018;assessment and feedback&#x02019; approach that involves evaluating clinics&#x02019; vaccine coverage levels and then delivering brief quality improvement consultations to vaccine providers so as to address clinic-specific challenges to immunization. Based on evidence that AFIX raises early childhood immunization coverage by four to seven percentage points above secular trends [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], CDC recommends that state and regional health departments provide AFIX consultations to at least one-quarter of federally-funded vaccine providers each year. To maximize reach, larger clinics are prioritized, and many health departments succeed in not only meeting, but greatly exceeding CDC&#x02019;s 25% goal. More recently, health departments have begun using a modified version of AFIX in an attempt to address the underuse of adolescent vaccines. Research to support this work is limited, and the impact of AFIX on adolescent immunization coverage has not, until present, been rigorously evaluated.</p><p>To address this need, we conducted a randomized controlled trial of adolescent AFIX consultations delivered to high-volume primary care clinics in North Carolina. The purpose of this trial was to evaluate the effectiveness of AFIX with regard to raising adolescent immunization coverage and to explore strategies for delivering consultations via interactive webinar versus in-person office visit. In a three-arm trial with 91 clinics, we found that both webinar and in-person AFIX consultations modestly improved immunization coverage among adolescents, ages 11 to 12, compared to no-consultation control (Gilkey, Dayton, Moss, <italic>et al.</italic>, in preparation). At five-month follow-up, clinics in the in-person and webinar conditions outperformed the control condition by three to five percentage points for Tdap and meningococcal vaccine coverage. Clinics in the intervention conditions achieved small, but statistically significant, improvements over the control clinics for HPV vaccination. Overall, our findings suggest that AFIX holds promise for improving adolescent immunization, but that the program needs further development with regard to HPV vaccination before it should be adopted nationally.</p><p>Our finding that webinar delivery of AFIX raised adolescent immunization coverage at least as much as in-person delivery warrants further exploration. Webinar delivery could substantially increase the reach of AFIX by eliminating the cost and inconvenience associated with traveling to clinics to deliver in-person consultations. However, in addition to cost, reach is also determined by participants&#x02019; willingness to engage in quality improvement efforts. For this reason, webinar delivery must be acceptable to vaccine providers in addition to being low cost. To investigate how delivery mode may impact the reach of adolescent AFIX, we conducted a process evaluation with 61 clinics in this study&#x02019;s intervention arms to compare in-person and webinar consultations on provider participation and satisfaction as well as program cost.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Participants</title><p>We randomly selected 91 of 481 eligible clinics to participate in the study using the North Carolina Immunization Registry (NCIR), the state&#x02019;s immunization information system. Used by over 90% of vaccine providers in the state, NCIR is a secure, web-based database that contains immunization information for 67% of North Carolina&#x02019;s adolescents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Eligible clinics were pediatric or family practice clinics with more than 200 patients, ages 11 to 18, with active records in the registry. Each clinic was randomized to one of three conditions: in-person AFIX consultation (30 clinics); webinar AFIX consultation (31 clinics); or no consultation control (30 clinics). This report focuses solely on the 61 clinics assigned to the in-person and webinar intervention conditions; we did not collect process data from the control clinics. The North Carolina Division of Public Health Institutional Review Board approved the study protocol.</p></sec><sec><title>Intervention</title><p>From April to August 2011, one immunization specialist (AD) from the North Carolina Division of Public Health delivered one adolescent AFIX consultation to each clinic via interactive webinar or in-person office visit. Prior to each meeting, the specialist prepared for the consultation by using the state&#x02019;s immunization registry to generate reports related to the clinic&#x02019;s baseline performance. These reports included: the assessment report, which listed the percentage of the clinic&#x02019;s adolescent patients, ages 11 to 18, who were up-to-date for targeted adolescent and early childhood vaccines; the missing immunization report, which identified patients who were due for one or more vaccines; and the duplicate client report, which identified patients who had duplicate records in the registry.</p><p>The immunization specialist typically delivered the consultation to the nurse who served as the clinic&#x02019;s designated immunization coordinator, although on several occasions other staff members also attended. Consultations centered on several components:</p><sec><title>Assessment and feedback</title><p>The specialist began by sharing findings of the assessment report that detailed the clinic&#x02019;s immunization coverage levels. She helped providers contextualize the assessment findings by showing how the clinic compared to others in the county and state.</p></sec><sec><title>Education and training</title><p>The specialist also provided hands-on training in immunization best practices on three topics. First, using the duplicate client report, the specialist demonstrated how providers could clean up registry records by deleting duplicate or inactive records from the clinic&#x02019;s roster and by updating active records to reflect previously administered, or historical, vaccine doses. Second, using the missing immunization report, the specialist discussed the importance of using reminder/recall systems to contact patients due for vaccines, and she demonstrated how to use the registry&#x02019;s reminder/recall function. Third, the specialist discussed strategies for reducing missed opportunities for vaccination, which occur when patients receive some, but not all, of the vaccines for which they are due.</p></sec><sec><title>Goal setting</title><p>Lastly, the specialist worked with providers to identify goals for addressing clinic-specific challenges so as to improve the clinic&#x02019;s adolescent immunization coverage levels. In-person and webinar consultations did not differ in content. Webinar consultations used Adobe Connect (Adobe Systems Incorporated, San Jose, CA), an interactive conferencing platform that supported real-time communication between the specialist and the provider. This software included a screen sharing function that allowed the specialist to remotely control the providers&#x02019; computer screen to demonstrate how to manipulate the registry as she would during the course of an in-person office visit. Given the need to orient providers to the software, webinar consultations lasted about 90&#x000a0;minutes on average in contrast to the 60&#x000a0;minutes needed to complete an in-person consultation.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Procedure</title><p>Participants completed four written surveys for each clinic over the course of the study.</p><sec><title>Baseline survey</title><p>Participants completed this 19-item internet survey prior to the AFIX consultation. Closed- and open-ended questions assessed clinic policies and practices related to adolescent immunization.</p></sec><sec><title>Best practice assessment survey</title><p>Participants completed this written survey during the AFIX consultation. Closed-ended questions assessed each clinic&#x02019;s current level of activity with regard to 20 immunization best practices in four domains: decreasing missed opportunities; developing reminder/recall systems; establishing staff guidelines for immunizations; and implementing data handling procedures (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Along with the immunization specialist, participants used this survey to select one practice in each domain as a focus for their quality improvement efforts.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Strategies to improve immunization for 61 clinics receiving AFIX consultations</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" border="1"><colgroup><col align="left"/><col align="center"/><col align="center"/></colgroup><thead valign="top"><tr><th rowspan="2" align="left" valign="middle">&#x000a0;</th><th align="center" valign="middle"><bold>Baseline assessment</bold><sup>

This questionnaire assessed participants&#x02019; perceptions of the AFIX consultation in terms of helpfulness, ease of understanding, convenience, and length of consultation. Participants also rated the importance of individual program components, including: reports on immunization coverage, missing immunizations, and duplicate clients; coverage comparisons at the regional, state, and national levels; and reminder/recall training. Finally, participants indicated whether they would have preferred receiving the intervention via in-person or webinar delivery.</p></sec><sec><title>Cost</title><p>Cost data came from expense tracking logs maintained by the immunization specialist (AD). These logs detailed expenses related to delivering the intervention, including: staff time needed for consultation preparation, delivery and travel; mileage reimbursement and lodging for overnight trips; and mailing and webinar-hosting fees. This analysis did not include costs incurred by participating providers, patients, or parents.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinic characteristics</title><p>The North Carolina Immunization Registry provided data on clinic characteristics, including the proportions of adolescent patients who were black, white, or another race and the proportions of vaccines doses administered at the clinic that were either publicly or privately funded. Publicly-funded doses were those for which a patient was eligible for the Vaccines for Children (VFC) program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. VFC is a federally-financed program that provides free vaccines for children and adolescents who are uninsured, Medicaid-insured, or of American Indian or Alaska Native descent; the program also provides vaccines for underinsured youth through federally qualified health centers and rural health clinics. We also assessed clinic specialty (pediatric or family practice) and location. We defined clinics located within a metropolitan statistical area as &#x02018;urban or suburban&#x02019; and others as &#x02018;rural&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>To check randomization, we assessed whether study arms differed on clinic characteristics using chi-square tests and analyses of variance. We used <italic>t</italic>-tests to compare clinics in the in-person and webinar conditions on mean scores related to participation (<italic>i.e.</italic>, reminder/recall confidence, quality improvement effort) and satisfaction. We calculated intervention cost per clinic by dividing the total intervention cost for each condition by the number of clinics in that condition. We analyzed data using Stata Version 12.0 (Statacorp, College Station, TX). Statistical tests were two-tailed with a critical alpha of 0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Clinic characteristics</title><p>Of 61 clinics that received AFIX consultations, about half (56%) specialized in pediatrics, and the rest specialized in family medicine.

We found that AFIX consultations delivered by interactive webinar versus in-person office visit elicited similar levels of participation, and healthcare providers in both groups showed sustained improvement with regard to an important intermediate outcome, confidence in using reminder/recall systems. We were also encouraged to find that participant satisfaction was very high overall and comparable between delivery modes. When it came to program cost, however, webinar delivery clearly outperformed the traditional, in-person approach; we found that webinar consultations cost about one-third less per clinic. Taken together, these findings suggest that webinar delivery deserves serious consideration by state health departments seeking to implement adolescent AFIX.</p><p>Several factors may explain the somewhat surprising success of webinar delivery. First, the novelty of the videoconferencing software we employed may have elicited interest from our participants, who, as healthcare providers, likely had a higher degree of technological sophistication than the general public. At the very least, we can conclude that any technical difficulties participants faced were not burdensome enough to preclude participation or greatly detract from overall satisfaction. Second, we estimated that, despite covering the same content, webinar consultations lasted about thirty minutes longer on average than in-person consultations; increased interaction time may have supported webinar delivery. Finally, we can report anecdotally that providers often rescheduled webinar consultations, but rarely did so for those delivered in-person. Having greater flexibility may have allowed webinar participants to schedule consultations when they could most fully attend to programmatic activities. Whatever the case, this study adds to a small, but growing body of literature that suggests that internet-based approaches such as videoconferencing are at least as effective as&#x02014;and perhaps even more effective than&#x02014;in-person instruction for delivering continuing education to health professionals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>In terms of programmatic implications, webinar delivery offers three main advantages. First, the lower cost of webinar consultations could dramatically extend the reach of AFIX. In our own study, for example, we could have reached an additional 15 clinics, serving about 17,700 adolescents, had we used the funds spent on in-person consultations for webinar consultations instead. Second, in addition to cost, webinar delivery eliminates the inconvenience and disruption state health department personnel experience when traveling to clinics for in-person consultations. Travel can pose an especially difficult obstacle in states, such as North Carolina, that periodically prohibit state employees from traveling as a way to manage their surprisingly frequent fiscal crises. Third, webinar delivery may also expand who can deliver AFIX by making geographic proximity unnecessary for program implementation. For instance, program officers at CDC could deliver webinar consultations nationwide, thereby centralizing program planning and dissemination and reducing the burden on state health departments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Clinics in rural areas may be especially well-served by webinar visits. The potential advantages of webinar delivery are, thus, substantial in terms of flexibility and efficiency, although these benefits must be balanced against disadvantages such as reduced ability to collect observational data about clinic setting and work flow.</p><p>One aspect of our program that warrants special comment is the goal to raise providers&#x02019; use of patient reminder/recall systems. Reminder/recall is prioritized in the AFIX program because the strategy is associated with increased immunization rates for both young children and adolescents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Providers in our study also prioritized reminder/recall use as a focus of their own quality improvement efforts, and we found that our intervention successfully increased participants&#x02019; confidence in using such systems regardless of delivery mode. However, despite goal setting and improved confidence, subsequent use of reminder/recall systems was modest, with only about one-third of participants reporting the activity at five-month follow-up. Lack of staff time was the primary barrier to use. This finding corresponds with existing research, which suggests that conducting reminder/recalls is difficult in the context of primary care because of the burden associated with updating patients&#x02019; contact information and then generating calls or mailings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Given the recent success of centralized versus provider-based programs for reminder/recall [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], state health departments should carefully consider how much to emphasize reminder/recall training during AFIX consultations since conducting reminder/recalls directly at the state level may ultimately be more effective.</p><p>In terms of strengths, this study employed a strong research design, including random allocation of clinics to study conditions, to compare intervention delivery modes among high-volume primary care clinics. Limitations include a modestly-sized, state-specific sample and the use of self-reported measures to assess program participation. Our calculation of program cost per clinic focused narrowly on intervention delivery so as to compare delivery modes; we excluded factors, such as overhead expenses, costs incurred by providers, and quality adjusted life years, that would be needed to determine overall program costs or to conduct a comprehensive cost-effectiveness analysis. One author (AD) delivered all in-person and webinar consultations; this consistency maximized the comparability of the study groups, but other immunization specialists may achieve higher or lower levels of participation and satisfaction. Additional research is needed to understand how our findings generalize to clinics with lower patient volumes, particularly given that small clinics may have reduced access to the technology needed to support webinar delivery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Quality improvement programs are urgently needed to address the underuse of adolescent vaccines, and the CDC&#x02019;s AFIX model offers a strong foundation for these efforts. This study provides evidence to suggest that webinar delivery could substantially increase the reach of AFIX without adversely affecting participant experience. As adolescent AFIX undergoes further development, program planners should continue to pilot consultation materials via webinar. Given that adolescent AFIX will be disseminated nationally, maximizing the program&#x02019;s efficiency is of vital importance for supporting state health departments as they seek to make the best use of increasingly constrained resources.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>AFIX: Assessment, Feedback, Incentives, and Exchange; CDC: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; HPV: Human papillomavirus; NCIR: North Carolina Immunization Registry; Tdap: Tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis; VFC: Vaccines for Children.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>NB has received HPV vaccine-related grants from or been on advisory boards for GlaxoSmithKline, Merck and Sanofi-Pasteur.
