mobilization with movement on knee strength, ankle range of motion, and gait velocity,
compared with weight-bearing exercise in stroke patients. [Subjects and Methods] Thirty
subjects with chronic stroke were divided into three groups: MWM (n = 12), WBE (n = 8),
and control (n = 10). All groups attended physical therapy sessions 3 times a week for 5
weeks. Subjects in the MWM group performed mobilization with movement exercises, whilst
participants in the WBE group performed weight-bearing exercises. Knee peak torque, ankle
range of motion, and spatiotemporal gait parameters were evaluated before and after the
interventions. [Results] Knee extensor peak torque increased significantly in both MWM and
WBE groups. However, only the MWM group showed significant improvement in passive and
active ankle range of motion and gait velocity, among the three groups. [Conclusion] Ankle
joint mobilization with movement intervention is more effective than simple weight-bearing
intervention in improving gait speed in stroke patients with limited ankle motion.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Mobilization with movement</kwd><kwd>Stroke</kwd><kwd>Weight-bearing exercise</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Recovery of gait function is a primary rehabilitation goal, with the majority of stroke
patients suffering from a reduction in gait velocity<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Independent gait is a crucial factor in carrying out activities of
daily living following stroke. According to previous studies on stroke patients,
sensorimotor dysfunction causes limited joint range of motion (ROM) and muscle weakness in
the lower extremities of the affected side, leading to difficulties in performing functional
activities such as sit-to-stand and gait<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Limited ankle joint motion directly and negatively affects functional ability<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. The primary causes of limited ankle joint
motion include plantarflexor spasticity and dorsiflexor weakness. Long-term limited motion,
resulting from a primary cause, alters the mechanical properties of the ankle muscles and
connective tissues, bringing about motion deterioration. This is considered the secondary
cause of limited ankle joint motion<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Appropriate ankle motion and proper muscle contraction are required for functional gait, as
they facilitate the maintenance of stability and efficiency during gait<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. In stroke patients, limited motion of the ankle on the
affected side decreases the individual&#x02019;s ability to shift the center of mass (COM),
resulting in instability during gait<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. In
a recent study, joint mobilization techniques applied to limited-motion ankle joints in
stroke patients were found to be effective in improving ROM<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, joint mobilization techniques focused on improving passive
ROM (PROM) only, and functional gait requires both active ROM (AROM) and PROM. Therefore, an
intervention aimed at improving AROM is required in addition to joint mobilization
techniques.</p><p>Mulligan first proposed mobilization with movement (MWM) as a joint mobilization
technique<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. This intervention proved
effective for the improvement of dorsiflexion motion in healthy adults<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Ankle MWM can be applied in both weight-bearing and
non-weight-bearing positions, with the weight-bearing position being more effective for
improving ankle ROM<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Weight-bearing MWM
allows the individual to weight-bear on the affected side, which is necessary for hemiplegic
patients after stroke, and is expected to improve muscle strength, ankle ROM, and the
ability to shift the COM using the lower extremities of the affected side. However, studies
showing that weight-bearing MWM helps stroke patients improve their functional abilities are
rare.</p><p>In the current study, the effects of ankle MWM on knee strength, ankle ROM, and gait
velocity were investigated in stroke patients. Analyses were also conducted to determine
whether changes observed following intervention in a weight-bearing position were the result
of weight-bearing on the affected side, or the effect of MWM combined with weight-bearing
and joint mobilization. Weight-bearing exercise (WBE) was defined as the weight-bearing
intervention in the MWM position without joint mobilization.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>Subjects were recruited from the National University Hospital in Korea. All of the
subjects read and signed an informed consent form, approved by the institutional review
board of Jeonju University (JJIRB2013001) and in accordance with the Declaration of
Helsinki. This study was a randomized, controlled trial, with three groups. A total of 38
stroke patients participated in this study, including 13 subjects in the MWM group, 12 in
the WBE group, and 13 in the control group. Inclusion criteria included: the presence of
hemiplegia confirmed by physical examination; ability to perform a hemiplegic single-leg
lunge on a stool in a standing position; ability to walk without an assistive device for
more than 10 m; and limited dorsiflexion PROM with contracture on the hemiplegic ankle.
Participants were excluded from the study if they: presented contraindications for joint
mobilization (i.e., ankle joint hypermobility, trauma, or inflammation); had language or
cognitive deficits that would impair their ability to provide informed consent; or were
concurrently receiving similar interventions outside of this study.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>MWM was conducted on the talocrural joint, as described by Mulligan<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. The subject placed the unaffected leg on the floor and
the hemiplegic leg on a stool (height: 30&#x02005;cm), with the back of the subject&#x02019;s distal tibia
and the pelvis of the therapist wrapped using a non-elastic treatment belt. The subjects
actively maintained dorsiflexion with forward shifting of the center of mass (COM); at the
same time, the therapist performed an anterior glide on the tibia using the belt. For
effective gliding, the talus and forefoot were fixed by the therapist using the web space
of the hand closest to the anterior joint line. A grade III glide was sustained for 10
seconds during slow active dorsiflexion to the end of the pain-free range; the treatment
belt was kept perpendicular to the long axis of the tibia throughout the movement, and
released after returning to the start position. Six sets of 10 repetitions were performed,
with a 1-minute break between sets<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. If
the participant felt pain during the treatment, the participant was excluded from the
study immediately. In the WBE intervention, the lower extremity on the affected side was
placed on a stool while standing, with the subject asked to actively bend his/her knees to
shift the COM to the lower extremity on the affected side. The therapist&#x02019;s hand was
positioned in the same place as in the MWM technique, but without the therapist-guided
gliding with a belt. Traditional physical therapy was performed with all participants, 3
times a week for 5 weeks. Patients in the MWM and WBE groups received an additional 30
minutes of MWM or WBE, including warm-up and cool-down for 5 minutes using a stationary
bicycle, 3 times a week for 5 weeks, giving a total of 15 treatment sessions.</p><p>Maximal concentric contraction of knee extensors and flexors was measured with an
isokinetic dynamometer (System 3 Pro; Bio-dex Medical Systems, Shirley, NY, USA). The
subject was seated with the knee joint axis aligned with the mechanical axis of the
dynamometer, and after a few practice trials, the subjects was instructed to push and pull
the attachment as hard and as fast as possible. Five maximum concentric contractions were
performed at 60&#x000b0;/s<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>, with the peak
torque generated over 5 repetitions recorded and normalized to body weight (Nm/kg). To
measure passive ROM of the ankle, the subject was seated in the chair of the isokinetic
dynamometer with the foot pressed firmly against a foot plate attached to the dynamometer
and the knee flexed at 30&#x000b0;. Prior to measurement, the subject&#x02019;s feet and the corresponding
footplates were fixed firmly using a Velcro strap; measurements were taken passively from
maximal plantarflexion to maximal dorsiflexion. Maximal plantarflexion was defined as the
maximum angle before the forefoot lifted from the surface of the foot plate, while maximal
dorsiflexion was defined as the maximum angle before the heel lifted off the surface of
the foot plate<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. The ankle active ROM
test measured the range of active motion from plantarflexion to dorsiflexion.</p><p>Spatiotemporal gait parameters were measured using a GAITRite mat (CIR Systems, Clifton,
NJ, USA). The mat is 366&#x02005;cm long and 81&#x02005;cm wide, containing a grid with 48 by 288 sensors
(13,824 total sensors) arranged 1.27&#x02005;cm apart. Data were sampled at 30&#x02005;Hz. The
participants performed three trials, during which they walked at their preferred speed,
without any gait-assistance device, across a level 10&#x02005;m walkway with a pressure-sensitive
mat in the middle. Before the data collection began, the subjects performed one practice
walking trial to familiarize themselves with the procedure. Velocity and step length were
the primary variables obtained. Three trials were recorded for each participant and the
average used for subsequent analysis.</p><p>The data were analyzed statistically using SPSS 18.0 software (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA).
General characteristics prior to the interventions were analyzed via descriptive
statistics, with knee strength, ankle ROM, and gait parameters analyzed using one-way
analysis of variance (ANOVA). Differences within groups following interventions were
analyzed with paired t-tests, while differences between groups were analyzed using one-way
ANOVA and Tukey&#x02019;s post hoc multiple-comparison test. Statistical significance &#x003b1; was set at
0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Eight subjects dropped out during the study: 1 subject in the MWM group, who moved away; 4

However, gait velocity in stroke patients is approximately half that of healthy individuals
of the same age. In general, proper ankle joint motion plays a critical role in functional
ability, including gait<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, the
ankle joints of stroke patients typically exhibit limited motion, leading to impaired gait
performance<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. A previous study suggested
that it is necessary to improve ankle motion and strengthen muscles to recover gait
ability<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. In order to achieve those
goals, MWM and WBE interventions were applied to stroke patients with an average gait
velocity of 0.6 m/s in this study. The results showed a significant increase in knee
extension strength in both MWM and WBE groups, as well as significant increases in ankle ROM
and gait velocity in the MWM group.</p><p>In the present study, significant improvements in knee extension peak torque were observed
in the MWM (13.4 Nm) and WBE (9.0 Nm) groups. A previous study of stroke patients by
Flansbjer et al.<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that peak
torque of the affected side improved by 13.7 Nm in knee extension, when muscle strength
exercises were performed using an isokinetic device, twice a week for ten weeks. J&#x000f6;nhagen et
al.<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup> observed that single-leg lunges
result in muscle contraction of the quadriceps; eccentric contraction of the quadriceps
occurs when shifting the COM forward, isometric contraction occurs when retaining the
posture following a forward shift, and concentric contraction occurs when shifting the COM
to the original position. Moreover, a study by Shields et al.<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup> demonstrated that single-leg squat exercises improved quadriceps
muscle strength.</p><p>It was also shown in the present study that repeated muscle contraction of knee extensors
while shifting the COM to the lower extremity on the affected side was effective for
enhancing knee extensor strength in both the MWM and WBE interventions. However, peak torque
differences were higher in the MWM group than in the WBE group, due to forward gliding of
the tibia performed by a therapist with a belt, performed simultaneously with MWM exercises.
This maneuver increased the forward shifting of the COM and increased knee flexion and
dorsiflexion, resulting in strength improvements in knee extension.</p><p>According to a previous study, an MWM intervention approach combining a relative anterior
glide of the tibia on the talus with active dorsiflexion movements is effective for
improving dorsiflexion. In particular, ankle ROM improvement is more prominent when MWM is
performed in a weight-bearing position than in a non-weight-bearing position<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this study, PROM (4.7&#x000b0;) and AROM (6.1&#x000b0;)
increased significantly in the MWM group, when compared to the other two groups.</p><p>MWM induced recovery of accessory movement in the joints after therapists performed a
forward gliding of the tibia, accompanied by a shift in the COM, resulting in improved joint
ROM. This finding indicates that WBE results in limited improvements in ankle ROM mediated
by stretch in the plantarflexors. Therefore, gliding should be performed for a given joint
to aid in effective motion improvement.</p><p>Of particular note was the improved AROM in the MWM group. The reason for this result is
considered to be the forward gliding of the tibia by the therapist with a belt, performed
simultaneously with MWM exercises, causing a forward shifting in the COM and increased
contraction of the dorsiflexors and plantarflexors.</p><p>Gait in stroke patients is characterized by a simultaneous decrease in step length and
velocity. In the present study, a significant increase in gait velocity was observed in the
MWM group, compared to that in the other two groups. Further, the step lengths of both the
affected and unaffected sides increased only in the MWM group. The step length of the
bilateral lower extremities increased in the MWM group due to an increase in muscle strength
of the lower extremities, and the improved ankle ROM, compared to the other two groups.</p><p>Many researchers have shown that the strength of affected knee extensors<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>
and ankle plantarflexors<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup> correlates with gait velocity in patients with stroke.
After MWM intervention, improvement in strength of the knee extensors in the lower extremity
of the affected side led to stronger concentric contraction, thereby contributing to stance
stability. Accordingly, during gait, smooth shifting of the COM by the lower extremity on
the affected side leads to increased step length in the lower extremity on the unaffected
side<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Plantarflexors aid in shifting
the COM toward the opposite lower extremity during late mid-stance throughout gait. Further,
plantarflexors are responsible for generating a ground reaction force in the pre-swing
phase, and contributing to swing initiation of the lower extremity, which improves the swing
motion and facilitates increased step length<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. Based on the aforementioned factors, the step lengths of both the
affected and unaffected sides are believed to increase simultaneously.</p><p>In normal gait, a minimum of 10&#x000b0; of dorsiflexion is required for smooth anterior motion of
the tibia on the talus during the stance phase. This movement plays a major role in
absorbing body weight, as well as in forward propulsion of the body<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. In stroke
patients, however, limited ankle dorsiflexion impairs the heel strike, which results in
earlier time-to-heel-off, increased pronation, or increased knee hyperextension. These
compensatory mechanisms restrict the shifting of the COM to the affected side and result in
asymmetry, decreased gait velocity, and greater levels of energy consumption<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>.
In this study, the use of MWM resulted in increased ankle ROM, with this increase in motion
contributing to improved step length and gait velocity on the unaffected side via smooth
shifting of the COM following mid-stance during gait. However, ankle ROM was evaluated
without separating dorsiflexion from plantarflexion; therefore, it is difficult to determine
whether the increased ankle motion was due to increased dorsiflexion or plantarflexion.</p><p>The WBE group, which carried out a weight-bearing exercise similar to that of the MWM
group, showed increased intragroup gait velocity after the intervention. However, this
increase was lower than that of the MWM group. Similarly, the WBE group showed improved
strength in knee extension, achieved through repeated COM shift training in the lower
extremity of the affected side, but this improvement was modest compared to the change in
the MWM group. Moreover, the lack of improvement in AROM and PROM on the affected side meant
that no effect on gait velocity was observed.</p><p>This study has several limitations. First, including a non-standard wooden stool, and
second, the small number of participants, make it difficult to generalize the statistical
results. Further, ankle joint ROM was not classified by dorsiflexion and plantarflexion.</p><p>In conclusion, both the MWM and WBE interventions were effective for increasing knee
extensor strength in stroke patients with limited range of ankle motion. However, the MWM
intervention was more effective than the WBE intervention (i.e., simple weight-bearing
without joint mobilization) in improving ankle ROM and gait velocity. Further research is
needed to investigate the effect of treadmill training combined with ankle MWM in stroke
patients.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>You</surname><given-names>YY</given-names></name><name><surname>Chung</surname><given-names>SH</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>The effects of gait velocity on the gait characteristics
