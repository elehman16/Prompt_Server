Subjects were divided into three groups, and then enrolled in a 6-month, randomized, double-blind clinical trial. Bone formation and resorption markers were measured at 0, 3, and 6 months, while bone mineral density (BMD) in the lumbar spines was measured at 0 and 6 months. Although the bone formation marker levels showed the similarity changes among the groups, bone resorption markers in the test HYP group were significantly decreased after 3 and 6 months in comparison to other groups (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). After 6 months, BMD in the test HYP group maintained at healthy numerical values whereas BMD values were decreased in other groups. Hence HYP would be an antiosteoporotic agent originated from natural food to maintain bone health, especially for women.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Antiosteoporotic</kwd><kwd>bone density</kwd><kwd>bone markers</kwd><kwd>osteoporosis</kwd><kwd>women</kwd><kwd>yolk-derived peptides</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Many factors associated with the variability in total bone mass and bone mineral density (BMD) include hereditary, hormonal status, diet, exercise, and lifestyle. Bone is continuously formed and resorbed throughout the human life cycle, and a reduction in mass results from bone resorption exceeding bone formation (Faine <xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>; Katagiri and Takahashi <xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). Progressive and generalized bone loss occurs in women following menopause, frequently leading to osteoporosis, which is defined as low bone mass and microarchitectural deterioration leading to increase in skeletal fragility and high risk of fractures (Feng et al. <xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Napoli et al. <xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>).</p><p>Although development of more effective treatment strategies continues to investigate new agents for treatment of osteoporosis, none of them is able to completely prevent osteoporotic fractures. All present agents seem to improve the quality of life of osteoporotic patients insufficiently due to their general efficacy, mode of application, or various side effects. Thus, the urge for more effective and safe antiosteoporotic agents remains high (Miyamoto et al. <xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>; Yasuda et al. <xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>).</p><p>Egg is broadly recognized as a very valuable source of proteins for human nutrition and is known to contain many substances with biological functions beyond basic nutrition. The advances in protein separation help in exploring the biological functions of egg proteins. The biologically active egg proteins would provide nutritional and functional ingredients that enhance human health (Anton et al. <xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). The new advances in protein bioengineering help to explore numerous potentials for releasing biologically functional peptides due to degradation of egg proteins by specific enzymes. The resultant peptides could show enhanced or biologically new function with improved stability and/or solubility. This aspect has been studied and some peptides, which exhibit various activities such as antihypertensive, bone growth-promoting, anticancer, or exaggerated antimicrobial activities, have been found (Anton et al. <xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Abdou et al. <xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).</p><p>Some investigations were carried out to explore the biologically active substances in hen egg that would initiate and enhance bone growth. It has been reported that egg yolk phosvitin and their peptides enhanced Ca-binding capacity and significantly increased Ca incorporation into bones (Jiang and Mine <xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Choi et al. <xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). Moreover, in our previous studies, it has been found that a specific yolk water-soluble protein fraction (YP) has bone growth promotion activity both in vitro and in vivo (Leem et al. <xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Kim et al. <xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Abdou et al. <xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). These findings encouraged us to find out the functional peptides that would have bone growth promotion activity. Different enzymes were used to hydrolyze YP and the antiosteoporotic effect of peptide preparations was investigated. A novel yolk-derived peptide preparation (HYP) showed a remarkable activation of the preosteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cell proliferation and it potently suppressed osteoclastogenesis. Moreover, ovariectomized rats fed on HYP showed an osteoprotective effect through increasing the BMD and prevented the cancellous bone loss induced by ovariectomy (Kim et al. <xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>).</p><p>So, to extend the work, the purpose of this study was to verify the effect of HYP on bone markers and BMD in perimenopausal women in a 6-months, double-blind, randomized clinical trial.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Determination of yolk-derived peptide preparation characteristics</title><p>The ingredient (HYP) was provided by Pharma Foods International Co., Ltd.

Chromatography showed that about 85% of the HYP had a molecular weight of less than 3000 Da and about 70% less than 1000 Da. This relatively low molecular weight of HYP would enhance the absorption and bioavailability of the functional peptides in human (Feng et al. <xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Effect of different pH, temperatures, and different digestive enzymes against HYP in vitro has been examined and showed its stability for heat up to 140&#x000b0;C, pH 2.0&#x02013;9.0, and stability to enzymatic digestion (data not shown), therefore, the oral intake of HYP would not undergo further degradation in subjects in this study.</p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Analysis of molecular weight distributions of yolk-derived peptide preparation.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fsn30002-0193-f1"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Biochemical examination</title><p>No differences were observed among three groups in all subjects.

This may be attributed to the formation of OCN in both bone formation and resorption. It has been known that OCN is used as a formation marker; however, it also reflects bone resorption, as during bone resorption it is degraded and up to 70% enters circulation (Delma <xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">1988</xref>). Because OCN in circulation may be both newly synthesized during bone formation and released during resorption, there is some question whether OCN should be considered a marker of bone formation or resorption processes (Christenson <xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>), besides, OCN has a circadian rhythm in peaking at approximately 0400, so care is needed for consistency in the time of sampling which is practically difficult (Delma <xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">1988</xref>; Brown et al. <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="tbl2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Mean values &#x000b1; SEM of bone formation markers at 0, 3, and 6 months (M)</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" colspan="3" rowspan="1">OCN (ng/mL)</th><th align="left" colspan="3" rowspan="1">BAP (<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/L)</th></tr><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" colspan="3" rowspan="1"><hr/></th><th align="left" colspan="3" rowspan="1"><hr/></th></tr><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0 M</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3 M</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6 M</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0 M</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3 M</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6 M</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">WA-1</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.39 &#x000b1; 0.22</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.48 &#x000b1; 0.23</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3.95 &#x000b1; 0.19</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9.30 &#x000b1; 0.62</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9.83 &#x000b1; 0.63</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9.88 &#x000b1; 0.64</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">WA-2</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.94 &#x000b1; 0.28</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.87 &#x000b1; 0.30</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.17 &#x000b1; 0.22</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10.64 &#x000b1; 0.82</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">11.14 &#x000b1; 0.85</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10.41 &#x000b1; 0.82</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">WA-3</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.65 &#x000b1; 0.26</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.65 &#x000b1; 0.22</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.17 &#x000b1; 0.24</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9.60 &#x000b1; 0.52</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10.72 &#x000b1; 0.66</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9.66 &#x000b1; 0.52</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>SEM, standard error of mean; OCN, osteocalcin; BAP, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>BAP is produced in extremely high amounts during the bone formation and is, therefore, an excellent marker of bone formation activity (Christenson <xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>).

TRAP is an enzyme expressed when differentiating to osteoclast cells and also a sole direct-indicator of osteoclast numbers and bone resorption activity.

The results of bone resorption markers suggest that HYP intake would have an antiosteoporotic effect that leads to better bone metabolism.</p><table-wrap id="tbl3" position="float"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Mean values &#x000b1; SEM of bone resorption markers at 0, 3, and 6 months (M)</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" colspan="3" rowspan="1">TRAP (mU/dL)</th><th align="left" colspan="3" rowspan="1">NTx (nmol BCE/L)</th></tr><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" colspan="3" rowspan="1"><hr/></th><th align="left" colspan="3" rowspan="1"><hr/></th></tr><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0 M</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3 M</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6 M</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0 M</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3 M</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6 M</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">WA-1</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">253.76 &#x000b1; 22</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">265.33 &#x000b1; 32</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">262.71 &#x000b1; 34</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10.10 &#x000b1; 0.52</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10.48 &#x000b1; 0.52</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10.95 &#x000b1; 0.52</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">WA-2</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">294.60 &#x000b1; 33</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">292.00 &#x000b1; 44</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">270.05 &#x000b1; 33</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">11.69 &#x000b1; 0.52</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">11.97 &#x000b1; 0.52</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">12.06 &#x000b1; 0.52</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">WA-3</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">247.09 &#x000b1; 34</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">218.32 &#x000b1; 54</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">235.36 &#x000b1; 44</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">12.46 &#x000b1; 0.52</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">11.82 &#x000b1; 0.52</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">11.98 &#x000b1; 0.52</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>SEM, standard error of mean; TRAP, tartarate-resistant acid phosphatase; NTx, N-terminal collagen telopeptide; BCE, bone collagen equivalent.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><fig id="fig03" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Tartarate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) change rate (A) and <italic>N</italic>-telopeptide (NTx) change rate (B) in women (mean &#x000b1; SEM) in WA-1, WA-2, and WA-3 groups after 0, 3, and 6 months.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fsn30002-0193-f3"/></fig><p>As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">3</xref>B, and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">3</xref>, only WA-3 group showed a decreasing trend of NTx level compared to the other two groups, however, there were no significant differences observed in NTx levels among all groups. The bone resorption marker NTx is considered as one of the most widely used in clinical practice and there are studies suggesting that NTx excretion is a significant predictor of fracture risk in postmenopausal women (Delma <xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">1988</xref>; Christenson <xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>; Garnero et al. <xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>).</p><p>It was noticed that formation and resorption markers' levels showed much significant change at third than at sixth month examination. In agreement with these results, it has been reported that clinical trials of various antiresorptive therapies have a rapid decrease in bone resorption markers within few weeks after initiation of therapy, and then plateauing after 6 months (Cremers and Garnero <xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Garnero <xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Bone mineral density</title><p>Moreover, WA-3 group showed inhibition in the loss of bone density and BMD of lumbar spines maintained healthy numerical values, while values in WA-1 and WA-2 groups showed reduction in BMD values at sixth month (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">4</xref>). The measurement of BMD is the most important tool for monitoring response to therapy in osteoporotic patients. This technology provides a sensitive means for diagnosing decreased bone mass and predicting fracture. Measurement of BMD using dual energy X-ray absorptometry (DEXA) is perhaps most useful, having an accuracy exceeding 95%, especially for the femoral and lumbar spines. Thus, BMD is considered the gold standard for diagnosis and treatment monitoring and, therefore, used for most clinical studies (Elliott and Binkley <xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). In this study, HYP exhibited a slight increase in BMD compared to both baseline and other groups at 6 months. It has been reported that after initiation of antiresorptive therapy, either stability or an increase in bone mass is considered as a positive response, in that stable BMD is associated with reduced fracture risk (Hochberg et al. <xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). However, using BMD to determine a response to therapy may take 1&#x02013;2 years. Therefore, BMD findings for HYP intake in this study will need more investigations in a large-scale human trial for a longer period.</p><fig id="fig04" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Bone mineral density (BMD) change rate (percent change from baseline; mean &#x000b1; SEM) in women in WA-1, WA-2, and WA-3 groups after 0 and 6 months.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fsn30002-0193-f4"/></fig><p>Recent studies have provided evidence that egg-derived bioactive peptides play a vital role in human health and nutrition. These evidences suggest that, due to valuable biological functions with health beneficial effects, egg-derived bioactive peptides have potential as active ingredients for preparation of various functional foods or nutraceutical and pharmaceutical products (Anton et al. <xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). HYP has been reported to have antiosteoporotic effects that have been confirmed both in vitro and in vivo. In this study, it is suggested that HYP could be a potential food origin candidate that would have antiosteoporotic effect especially for perimenopausal women. The combination of vitamins, collagen, and isoflavone tended to improve the bone metabolism by suppression of bone absorption (Guillerminet et al. <xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Taku et al. <xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Levis and Lagari <xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Addition of HYP enhanced the beneficial activity of the mixture. Moreover, it has been reported that bioactive peptides produced by enzymatic hydrolysis method is preferred, especially in the food industries because of lack of residual organic solvents or toxic chemicals in the products (Harnedy and FitzGerald <xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Nevertheless, the HYP ingested for this clinical test is a mixture of peptides, and although the biologically active substance and its mechanism are still being investigated, it is of a great interest that we verified the physiological function from the food with the great familiarity in our daily lives.</p><p>We could conclude that supplementation with 100 mg HYP daily has antiresorptive and antifracture effects in perimenopausal women that have been confirmed by bone markers and BMD values. Besides, according to the result of biochemical examination, there were no abnormal findings or side effects reported during the 6-month study. Hence, oral intake of 100 mg HYP daily for 6 months is considered to be safe.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec><title>Conflict of Interest</title><p>None declared.</p></sec><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="b1"><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Abdou</surname><given-names>AM</given-names></name><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Sato</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name></person-group><person-group person-group-type="editor"><name><surname>Hern&#x000e1;ndez-Ledesma</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Hsie</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Functional proteins and peptides of hen's egg origin</article-title><source>Bioactive food peptides in health and disease</source><year>2013</year><publisher-loc>Rijeka, Croatia</publisher-loc><publisher-name>InTech</publisher-name><fpage>115</fpage><lpage>144</lpage><comment>Available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.intechopen.com/books/bioactive-food-peptides-in-health-and-disease/functional-proteins-and-peptides-of-hen-s-egg-origin">http://www.intechopen.com/books/bioactive-food-peptides-in-health-and-disease/functional-proteins-and-peptides-of-hen-s-egg-origin</ext-link></comment></element-citation></ref><ref id="b2"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Anton</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Nan</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Nys</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Bioactive egg components and their potential uses</article-title><source>World Poultry Sci.
