We aimed to identify shorter, safer drug regimens for the treatment of tuberculosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We did a randomised controlled, open-label trial with a multi-arm, multi-stage design. The trial was done in seven sites in South Africa and Tanzania, including hospitals, health centres, and clinical trial centres. Patients with newly diagnosed, rifampicin-sensitive, previously untreated pulmonary tuberculosis were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1:1:2 ratio to receive (all orally) either 35 mg/kg rifampicin per day with 15&#x02013;20 mg/kg ethambutol, 20 mg/kg rifampicin per day with 400 mg moxifloxacin, 20 mg/kg rifampicin per day with 300 mg SQ109, 10 mg/kg rifampicin per day with 300 mg SQ109, or a daily standard control regimen (10 mg/kg rifampicin, 5 mg/kg isoniazid, 25 mg/kg pyrazinamide, and 15&#x02013;20 mg/kg ethambutol). Experimental treatments were given with oral 5 mg/kg isoniazid and 25 mg/kg pyrazinamide per day for 12 weeks, followed by 14 weeks of 5 mg/kg isoniazid and 10 mg/kg rifampicin per day. Because of the orange discoloration of body fluids with higher doses of rifampicin it was not possible to mask patients and clinicians to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was time to culture conversion in liquid media within 12 weeks. Patients without evidence of rifampicin resistance on phenotypic test who took at least one dose of study treatment and had one positive culture on liquid or solid media before or within the first 2 weeks of treatment were included in the primary analysis (modified intention to treat). Time-to-event data were analysed using a Cox proportional-hazards regression model and adjusted for minimisation variables. The proportional hazard assumption was tested using Schoelfeld residuals, with threshold p&#x0003c;0&#x000b7;05 for non-proportionality. The trial is registered with <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov" id="interrefs10">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="ctgov:NCT01785186" id="interrefs20">NCT01785186</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec><title>Findings</title><p>Between May 7, 2013, and March 25, 2014, we enrolled and randomly assigned 365 patients to different treatment arms (63 to rifampicin 35 mg/kg, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol; 59 to rifampicin 10 mg/kg, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, SQ109; 57 to rifampicin 20 mg/kg, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and SQ109; 63 to rifampicin 10 mg/kg, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and moxifloxacin; and 123 to the control arm). Recruitment was stopped early in the arms containing SQ109 since prespecified efficacy thresholds were not met at the planned interim analysis. Time to stable culture conversion in liquid media was faster in the 35 mg/kg rifampicin group than in the control group (median 48 days <italic>vs</italic> 62 days, adjusted hazard ratio 1&#x000b7;78; 95% CI 1&#x000b7;22&#x02013;2&#x000b7;58, p=0&#x000b7;003), but not in other experimental arms. There was no difference in any of the groups in time to culture conversion on solid media. 11 patients had treatment failure or recurrent disease during post-treatment follow-up: one in the 35 mg/kg rifampicin arm and none in the moxifloxacin arm. 45 (12%) of 365 patients reported grade 3&#x02013;5 adverse events, with similar proportions in each arm.</p></sec><sec><title>Interpretation</title><p>A dose of 35 mg/kg rifampicin was safe, reduced the time to culture conversion in liquid media, and could be a promising component of future, shorter regimens.

Publications on pulmonary tuberculosis listed not later than April 30, 2016, in English, German, French, and Italian language were considered.</p><p>Pharmacokinetic studies indicate that standard dose (1 0mg/kg) of rifampicin often did not achieve effective plasma concentrations in patients. Enhanced efficacy of higher doses of rifampicin was reported in a number of animal studies. A systematic review on elevated doses of rifampicin published before 2008 identified 14 studies testing up to 1200 mg of rifampicin. Despite difficulties comparing efficacy outcomes across trials, there was an indication that higher doses were beneficial. Among 339 articles published after 2008, a single 14-day dose-ranging study of up to 35 mg/kg reported a supra-proportional increase in pharmacokinetic parameters and good tolerability, with a suggestion of enhanced early bactericidal activity. 43 publications on SQ109 were identified. A mouse study reported improved efficacy when SQ109 replaced ethambutol, but with a delayed onset of several weeks in reduction of lung and spleen colony-forming units. One 14-day phase 1 and one phase 2a study reported good tolerability, but absence of early bactericidal activity during the 14-day phase 2a study duration. A meta-analysis of moxifloxacin trials concluded that this drug added to the bactericidal activity of the regimen when it replaced ethambutol or isoniazid, but this was not enough to shorten treatment duration from 6 to 4 months.</p><p><bold>Added value of this study</bold></p><p>This study showed that 35 mg/kg rifampicin given over 12 weeks was safe and shortened the time to stable culture conversion from 62 to 48 days, showing the potential for an enhanced regimen. The other experimental arms, including various combinations of 10 mg/kg or 20 mg/kg of rifampicin, moxifloxacin, and SQ109, did not achieve significant improvements over the control arm. Taking all the data into consideration, this study supports that rifampicin given at 35 mg/kg is likely to improve treatment outcome. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a multi-arm adaptive trial design was successfully implemented in a multi-centre study in a high tuberculosis burden setting. This approach might accelerate tuberculosis regimen development at a reduced cost.</p><p><bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold></p><p>Our study substantiated that an increase in rifampicin dose could improve the clearance of bacteria in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis without an increase in associated adverse events. The scale of the improvement shown in this study of 35 mg/kg rifampicin administered orally could translate to improved clinical outcomes. Smaller increases in rifampicin doses did not have this effect and suggest that future pivotal phase 3 studies should be done with at least 35 mg/kg. The combination of moxifloxacin and 20 mg/kg rifampicin had a modest effect on bacterial clearance. This combination could be improved by increasing the dose of moxifloxacin to overcome induction of its metabolism by rifampicin.</p></boxed-text></p><p>To address the challenge of choosing among the many potential drug combinations that should be assessed in phase 3 clinical trials, we adapted a multi-arm, multi-stage trial design<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> that has been used successfully in oncology,<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> and in which multiple regimens are compared with a common standard regimen. Recruitment to insufficiently efficacious regimens is discontinued if prespecified thresholds are not achieved to save time and resources, and to reduce the risk of exposing patients to an ineffective treatment. The objective of this approach is to generate data to select a regimen that might be eligible to progress to a pivotal phase 3 trial. We selected regimens based on literature and on previous studies within our consortium PanACEA (Pan African Consortium for the Evaluation of Antituberculosis Antibiotics). Regimens assessed in our trial also included 300 mg SQ109 (Sequella, Rockville, MD), a well-tolerated drug candidate based on the ethylene diamine pharmacopore.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Moxifloxacin was chosen to be assessed in combination with 20 mg/kg rifampicin.

The modified ITT population was not included in the original trial protocol, but was included as the primary analysis population in the statistical analysis plan before any interim analyses to allow comparison with other tuberculosis trials. Including patients without culture-confirmed disease (ITT) or excluding patients based on post-randomisation data (PP) can introduce bias, and therefore the modified ITT population was preferred.

Log-rank statistics were also calculated for time-to-event data, both unstratified and stratified by minimisation variables.

Three additional patients were randomised in error and were not started on treatment and not continued in follow-up (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>). Recruitment to the RIFQHZ and RIF<sub>20</sub>QHZ arms was terminated following the recommendation from the IDMC after review of results from the first scheduled interim analysis; however, enrolled patients continued on allocated treatment. Recruitment to all other arms continued until the target sample sizes in each arm had been reached. Recruitment was completed before the scheduled second interim analysis, which was therefore not done.</p><p>Baseline characteristics were similar between arms (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>). Two patients were rifampicin resistant on phenotypic tests and were excluded from the modified ITT analysis population.</p><p>Patients achieved faster stable culture conversion in MGIT on the RIF<sub>35</sub>HZE arm than on the control arm, with a median time to stable culture conversion of 48 days compared with 62 days (adjusted HR 1&#x000b7;78, 95% CI 1&#x000b7;22&#x02013;2&#x000b7;58; p=0&#x000b7;003, <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">figure 2</xref>).

None of the arms reported significantly faster time to culture conversion than the control arm on solid media when data were censored at 8 weeks. To understand the differences in results between solid and liquid media, we did a further post-hoc analysis of time to culture conversion by excluding patients without a positive culture on solid media before or within the 2 weeks of randomisation; this analysis gave HRs that were marginally closer than those in liquid media, but differences between solid and liquid media remained (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">table 3</xref>).

The patient received appropriate treatment for multi-drug resistant tuberculosis and was reported cured after follow-up. Acquired drug resistance was not seen in any other patients. Seven patients were diagnosed with recurrent disease at 12 months after randomisation, and three more were identified by non-study health facilities without culture confirmation (one by smear and two by Xpert MTB/RIF; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>). Of these 11 unfavourable outcomes, only one occurred on the RIF<sub>35</sub>HZE arm and none on the RIF<sub>20</sub>MHZ arm, and all had longer time to conversion to negative culture in liquid media (median 97 days <italic>vs</italic> 62 days in those without failure or recurrence, p=0&#x000b7;013), but not on solid media (median 27 days <italic>vs</italic> 27 days, p=0&#x000b7;157).</p><p>45 patients reported at least one grade 3, 4, or 5 adverse event with similar proportions in each arm (<xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">table 4</xref>). There was one death during the trial, a patient on the RIF<sub>35</sub>HZE arm who died 13 weeks after experimental treatment was completed, near the end of the continuation phase, and who complained of sudden onset chest pain hours before death. This death was unlikely to be related to the higher dose of rifampicin. One patient in the control arm completed treatment successfully but later relapsed and died from underlying pneumoconiosis, related to work as a miner in Tanzania. Eight patients with hepatic adverse events fulfilled the criteria for treatment interruption (<xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">table 4</xref>). Investigators opted for treatment interruption in two additional cases of grade 2 elevated transaminases in arm RIF<sub>35</sub>HZE, in whom the protocol toxicity criteria for interruption were not fulfilled. Five patients were restarted on study treatment, which was tolerated by three. No QTcF interval of more than 480 ms was recorded during the study.

No significant differences in isoniazid, pyrazinamide, or ethambutol exposure were found between standard and higher dose rifampicin arms, indicating that higher doses of rifampicin do not affect the exposures to these drugs. Tanzanians had a lower rifampicin AUC<sub>0&#x02013;24h</sub> than South Africans in the RIF<sub>35</sub>HZE arm (geometric means 145 and 206 h&#x02008;&#x000d7;&#x02008;mg/L, 11 <italic>vs</italic> 9 patients, p=0&#x000b7;001).

Culture conversion rates in our study at weeks 12 and 26 were lower than in comparable trials. One patient had treatment failure with persistent positive cultures, but the others did not achieve the endpoint because of the stringent definition used, which requires two negative cultures from successive visits, and is susceptible to missing culture results by contamination or missing sample.</p><p>None of the other arms in our study resulted in faster culture conversion in liquid or on solid culture compared with control. Although RIF<sub>20</sub>MHZ was the best of 20 mg/kg rifampicin regimens, it was not better than moxifloxacin containing regimens with standard dose rifampicin reported previously.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> This could be due to relatively low exposure to moxifloxacin in our cohort, considering that moxifloxacin is metabolised by the phase 2 metabolising enzymes uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase and sulphotransferase. Rifampicin is known to induce such phase 2 metabolic enzymes and it has been shown that rifampicin decreases the AUC of moxifloxacin by approximately 30%.<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> The results in the RIF<sub>20</sub>MHZ arm suggest that 20 mg/kg rifampicin does not result in enhanced efficacy. SQ109 did not reach the prespecified HR in the dose and combinations used. This drug is metabolised by cytochrome P450 iso-enzymes CYP2D6 and CYP2C19, and at least CYP2C19 can be induced by rifampicin. We have previously shown that rifampicin decreases exposure to SQ109 administered in a 150 mg daily dose, but a higher daily dose of 300 mg SQ109, as used in our study, outweighed this inductive effect of rifampicin.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref></p><p>Clinical outcome was assessed at 12 months post randomisation (6 months after completion of treatment) and recurrence rates were similar between regimens.</p><p>Faster conversion in the RIF<sub>35</sub>HZE arm was only seen with liquid but not with solid culture, unlike a large trial assessing moxifloxacin regimens where the culture conversion results were the same on liquid and solid media.<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> Rifampicin is considered to be effective not only on actively replicating but also on persisting, non-replicating bacterial phenotypes that are drug tolerant.<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> Incomplete killing of such bacilli is one of the proposed reasons for relapse after treatment completion<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> as is poor penetration to the site of infection.<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> Higher doses of rifampicin seem to more effectively kill this subpopulation in experimental models<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> and in human beings.<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Since liquid media, unlike solid media, detect such bacilli,<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> we believe that the higher efficacy of RIF<sub>35</sub>HZE seen in liquid media represents increased activity of this regimen on this bacterial phenotype. The relevance of the liquid media endpoint is further supported by the fact that patients with treatment failure or recurrent disease had later culture conversion on liquid media, but not on solid media (although numbers were small).</p><p>Increasing the dose of rifampicin from 10 to 35 mg/kg resulted in a more than proportional increase in exposure to rifampicin, which is in agreement with previous data<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> and with more recent pharmacokinetic results from our rifampicin dose ranging trial.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> The response associated with higher doses and exposures to rifampicin is also in agreement with in-vitro, infected macrophage, and in-vivo murine data that showed an increased bactericidal effect and shortening of treatment duration once the steep part of the rifampicin dose&#x02013;exposure-response curve is reached.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> In this respect, the 35 mg/kg rifampicin regimen is promising but might not yet be optimal.

Higher AUCs were observed in South Africa than in Tanzania in the 35 mg/kg arm, possibly associated with inter-ethnic differences in genetic polymorphisms of genes encoding for drug transporters or enzymes involved in the metabolism of rifampicin.<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref></p><p>The advantage of the concept of high dose rifampicin is that the drug is widely available at low cost and implementation could take place broadly and quickly. A larger pill burden is a potential disadvantage, as available rifampicin formulations are not adapted to the higher doses. After defining the optimal dose of rifampicin new formulations would need to be developed in fixed dose combinations with companion drugs.</p><p>Experimental arms had similar safety profiles to the control arm. Treatment interruptions due to hepatic events were few. Although more interruptions occurred in the RIF<sub>35</sub>HZE arm, in two instances the severity was less than specified by the protocol, and since clinicians were not blinded to treatment allocation this might have influenced the decision to stop treatment.</p><p>Our study was, to our knowledge, the first multi-arm, multi-stage trial in infectious diseases, and showed that this design is feasible in a multicentre African setting, and can be used to assess many novel combinations. We identified a regimen that achieved our target and has promise to progress to phase 3, while discontinuing two regimens that did not show sufficient efficacy, thereby saving on resources.</p><p>This study has some limitations. It was not powered to be able to differentiate between the experimental regimens, only between individual arms and the control regimen. The sample size to achieve such a power would be inappropriately large. Furthermore, it was not powered for assessment of relapse, which is the definitive endpoint of a pivotal trial but for time to culture conversion, which is an intermediate endpoint. Our newly developed phase 2c STEP trial design will address this issue in future trials,<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref> and will improve confidence in a decision to move an arm into phase 3 based on a relapse endpoint.</p><p>Also, our objective was to identify regimens for future phase 3 assessment and thus our study does not provide information on the activity of individual experimental components. The study was only done in Africa and the HIV co-infected population was small. Therefore, future phase 3 trials should include sites from outside Africa and recruit representative proportions of HIV co-infected patients on antiretroviral treatment.</p><p>Another limitation is that because of the time required from sputum collection to determine negative cultures (which was necessary for our primary endpoint) and due to faster than expected recruitment, the interim analysis occurred late in the recruitment period. As a result, the multi-arm, multi-stage design resulted in a reduction in the final sample size of only 2%. A real-time biomarker such as the molecular bacterial load assay could overcome this problem by replacing culture allowing the endpoint results to be available rapidly.<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref> Nevertheless, this was a crucial opportunity to assess the feasibility of this novel design in the context of an African multicentre infectious diseases clinical trial. In the future, larger trials with more arms, and higher patient numbers per arm will achieve more substantial cost savings through a multi-arm, multi-stage design. These would also produce smaller confidence intervals, allowing a more precise estimate of the true HR. The collection of relapse data piloted in this study has been incorporated into our newly developed phase 2c STEP trial design.<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref> Such developments will provide the data to support the decision to move an arm into phase 3.</p><p>We have shown that 35 mg/kg rifampicin is safe and reduces time to culture conversion in liquid media. Importantly, the multi-arm, multi-stage concept has been shown to be feasible in a multicentre tuberculosis high burden setting, generating evidence to make a decision for whether or not to proceed to phase 3, and could greatly speed regimen development at reduced cost. In this phase 3 trial, a regimen with high dose rifampicin can be tested for safety and tolerability, potential to shorten duration of treatment, and ability to prevent the emergence of resistance to rifampicin.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="bibl10"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref10"><person-group
