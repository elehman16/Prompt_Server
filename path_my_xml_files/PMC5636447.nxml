The study was a multi-center, prospective, single arm study designed to confirm the results from the XPAND study, a multi-center, prospective, randomized study for breast reconstruction. In December 2016, the AeroForm device received clearance from the FDA based on the results of the XPAND trial, and adoption of this novel needle-free expansion system is underway in the U.S.</p><p><bold>METHODS:</bold> Fifty (50) women were treated in the XPAND II study and implanted with the AeroForm device (89 devices). Study endpoint was successful completion of the second stage surgery and secondary endpoints were days to complete expansion and reconstruction, and patient/physician satisfaction. Inclusion criteria included age (18&#x02013;70), BMI (&#x0003c;33) and tissue suitability for expansion. Following implantation, women self-administered 10cc doses of CO<sub>2</sub> up to three times daily. When adequate expansion was achieved, the expanders were then exchanged for standard breast implants.</p><p><bold>RESULTS:</bold> The interim result by breast (89) with the primary endpoint (successful exchange to standard breast implant, precluding non-device related failures) is 100%. All-cause interim success is 95% with three subjects (4 breasts) failing primary exchange due to non-device related reasons (cellulitis / intolerance to antibiotics, seroma w/exposure, cellulitis / delayed wound healing). One subject withdrew from the study prior to completion of the second stage. For the 46 subjects completing the second stage surgery, median time to complete reconstruction was 112 days (range 55&#x02013;494).</p><p><bold>CONCLUSION:</bold> Results of the XPAND II continued access study build upon the previous results from the first randomized trial (XPAND) for two-stage breast reconstruction using the AeroForm Tissue Expander System. These results validate that the AeroForm patient-controlled, needle-free CO<sub>2</sub> tissue expander is safe and effective for two-stage breast reconstruction.</p></body></article>
