Children were excluded if they had any contraindication to caudal anesthesia; severe coagulation disorders, severe infection, hydrocephaly, true allergy to local anesthesia, uncorrected hypovolemia and abnormal superficial landmarks at the sacral level.</p><p>All children had intravenous access line before arriving at operating room. Patients were randomly allocated into two groups. Children (&#x0003e;10 kg) were premedicated with midazolam (0.02 mg/kg) intravenously before arriving at operating room.</p><p>All children were monitored by pulse oximetry, electrocardiogram, and noninvasive blood pressure cuff. After induction with lidocaine 1.5 mg/kg and propofol (2.5&#x02013;3 mg/kg), an appropriate sized LMA was inserted. For maintenance of anesthesia isoflurane 1.5-2 % in a 50% N<sub>2</sub>O &#x02013; 50% O<sub>2</sub> was administered during spontaneous breathing.</p><p>After induction of general anesthesia, caudal block was performed in the first group (Leg_ Traction;L-T) in lateral position with upper leg traction (lower leg less flexed, 120&#x000b0; flexion of hip, and upper leg tracted frontward) [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>], and in the second group (Standard Position; S-P) in standard lateral position (legs flexed 90&#x000b0;).

Caudal puncture was performed under aseptic precautions, usually with a pediatric caudal needle number 25 (Epican paed caudal B BRAUN). After sterile preparation and drape, place the needle into the skin in the midline at a 45&#x000b0; angle to the skin aiming cephalad. Loss of resistance, aspiration for blood and cerebrospinal fluid and electrocardiographic monitoring during injection were parts of the overall techniques for all caudal blocks. Systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and heart rate were monitored every 5 minutes during surgery and in the recovery room. Surgery was performed 15 minutes after block. All the caudal blocks were done by the same attending anesthetist who had experience of more than ten years in pediatric anesthesia. All the lower abdominal surgeries were done by the same surgeon without significant difference in during of surgeries. Intraoperative changes in vital signs or lower extremity movement response to surgical stimulus were considered when deciding whether a caudal block was successful.</p><p>The primary outcome measure was caudal block success rate, defined as successful caudal puncture achieved at first attempt without redirection of the needle, stable hemodynamic signs during surgery. Correct placement of the needle was confirmed by loss of resistance and not intradermal injection. We defined unsuccessful caudal punctures as follows: if the needle had to be withdrawn and redirected, if the injection caused intradermal infiltration. Absent of caudal block despite caudal anesthetic administration was defined as failure of technique. Evaluation of success rate of block during surgery and recovery room has been done by an anesthetist who was blinded to the technique of caudal block. Changes in vital signs during recovery room were considered as success rate of block.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Sample size and statistical analysis</title><p>We assumed the power study based on our previous experience. Assuming that our overall success rate of caudal puncture in the first attempt was 65%: a 20% increase in the success rate (from 65% to 78%) was of clinical relevance: &#x003b1;=0.05 and power=90%.The sample size were assumed 220 cases with regard these criteria. Demographic data were expressed as Means&#x000b1;SD and N (%). Mean of quantitative variables were compared using one way ANOVA, ratios between groups were compared using chi-square test or Fishers Exact test and changes during surgery were compared by repeated measurement of ANOVA test.

The landmarks for sacral hiatus are the sacral cornua, the posterior superior iliac spines, and the coccyx.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] Identification of the anatomic landmarks, loss of resistance on piercing the sacrococcygeal membrane, ease of inserting a needle or leading a catheter into the caudal canal, negative aspiration &#x02013; containing solution, are the clinical guides used for successful caudal block placement.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] On the other hand, several previous studies have suggested that epidural anesthesia may be affected by flexion and extension of the spine. One of the studies demonstrated that dorsal epidural pressure increased with extension and decreased with flexion at the lumbar level.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] In another study, neck flexion and extension were found to strongly affect the distribution of contrast medium in the epidural space at the high thoracic level.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>]</p><p>This is the first controlled study that evaluates the influence of upper leg traction on the success rate of caudal block in children undergoing subumbilical abdominal surgeries. Results of this study showed that caudal success rate was higher in children in the lateral position with leg traction than in the standard position, but there was not significant difference between two groups. There are few studies on the effect of position on success rate of lumbar puncture in regional anesthesia of children. Apiliogullari <italic>et al</italic>. found that 45&#x000b0; head-up position in lateral position increased success rate of spinal anesthesia in infants.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] Furthermore, Dalens and Hasnaoui reported that the success rate of single-shot caudal block via the sacral hiatus was relatively high, up to 90%, in children, but multiple puncture rates also reached as high as 25%. Therefore, repeated caudal punctures even after identification of sacral hiatus can occur.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] The depth of caudal space is variably narrow.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] Therefore, accurate identification of the hiatus and appropriate needle insertion angle is necessary to success in puncture through the hiatus.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] In the present study, we thought that upper leg traction could help to identify and widen the hiatus space, to facilitate the insertion and to increase overall success rate of hiatus puncture. However, Raghunathan <italic>et al</italic>. found that ultrasonography was superior to the swoosh test as an objective confirmatory technique during caudal block placement in children.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] This shows that ultrasonography can help identification and increasing of successful caudal puncture rate. Nonetheless, unavailability of sonography is a limitation of our study. We recommend our technique of upper leg traction be applied to caudal puncturing where no ultrasonography devices are available. There are no controlled and randomized studies on the influence of upper leg traction on the success rate of caudal block. To the best our knowledge, the present study is the first investigation to evaluate the effect of upper leg traction on success rate of caudal block in children.</p><p>Our study was limited by several factors. First, ultrasonography modality was not available. Ultrasound imaging can help to clarify the anatomy of injection site, and increase the success rate of caudal block.Second, the drug distribution following the caudal block was not determined. Therefore, the results may be influenced by the anesthesiologist's experience in pediatric anesthesia.</p><p>In conclusion it seems that the success rate of pediatric caudal block in upper leg traction did not differ from that of the standard position. Further studies using ultrasound imaging in this regard are needed.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn
