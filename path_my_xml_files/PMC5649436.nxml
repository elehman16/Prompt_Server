Different antibiotic regimens were evaluated as prophylaxis in wound infection following elective surgical procedures. Prophylactic antibiotics should be given to cover the &#x0201c;decisive period&#x0201d; which is a period after incision to mobilization of host defenses thus preventing an infection from developing.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Objectives:</title><p>The aim is to study the effectiveness of short-term antibiotic coverage during decisive period in the prevention of postoperative wound sepsis in clean surgical cases.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>The prospective randomized comparative study included 50 patients divided into two groups of 25 each. Group A (short-term ceftriaxone prophylaxis) patients received three doses of 1 g intravenous ceftriaxone. First dose 12 h, 2<sup>nd</sup> dose 1 h before operation and the 3<sup>rd</sup> dose was given 10 h after the operation. The Group B (conventional postoperative ceftriaxone prophylaxis) patients received postoperatively 1 g B. D intravenous ceftriaxone for 5 days. We compared the incidence of surgical site infection in two groups.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Study Period:</title><p>November 2014 to September 2016. A predesigned and pretested proforma was used to collect the data. Surgical sites were examined for 30 days. Robertson grading was used to assess the severity of infection.</p></sec><sec id="st5"><title>Results:</title><p>Surgical site infection rate was 4% in Group A and 24% in Group B. The severity of infection was less in short-term prophylaxis group. Anemia, nutritional status, and use of drain were other factors associated with postoperative wound infections.</p></sec><sec id="st6"><title>Conclusion:</title><p>Short course perioperative (three doses) ceftriaxone prophylaxis is sufficient in preventing wound infection. Prophylactic antibiotic should be given to cover the decisive period to prevent an infection from developing. The judicious use of antibiotics can reduce the cost, unnecessary prolonged exposure, side effects, and the emergence of resistant micro-organisms.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>K<sc>EYWORDS</sc></title><kwd><italic>Ceftriaxone</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>clean wound</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>perioperative</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>surgical site infection</italic></kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>I<sc>NTRODUCTION</sc></title><p>Infections remain an important complication of surgical procedures despite increased knowledge about prevention and technological advances in modern surgery. Appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis is directed toward the most likely pathogens encountered during the surgery and should be administered before the skin incision is made.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis must not be continued beyond the day of surgery in clean elective surgical cases, that is, cases in which no inflammation is encountered and the respiratory, alimentary, genital, or uninfected urinary tract is not entered.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>The basic concept in preventive antibiotic use is &#x0201c;decisive period&#x0201d; during which antibiotics will be effective. This decisive period is temporary and lasts only a few hours. Operations begin and end within the decisive period.</p><p>There is a delay before host defenses can become mobilized after a breach in an epithelial surface, whether caused by trauma or surgery. The acute inflammatory, humoral, and cellular defenses take up to 4 h to be mobilized. This is called the &#x0201c;decisive period,&#x0201d; and it is the time when the invading bacteria may become established in the tissues. Strategies aimed at preventing infection from taking a hold become ineffective after this time. It is, therefore, logical that prophylactic antibiotics should be given to cover this period and that they could be decisive in preventing an infection from developing. The tissue levels of antibiotics should be above the minimum inhibitory concentration for the pathogens likely to be encountered.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>The decision to use prophylactic antibiotic therapy must be based on balancing possible benefit against possible adverse effects. Indiscriminate use of antibiotics is discouraged because it may lead to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains of organisms or serious hypersensitivity reactions. In particular, prolonged use of prophylactic antibiotics may also mask the signs of established infections.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Prophylactic antibiotic therapy is no substitute for careful surgical technique using established surgical principles. Antibiotics can be used effectively only as adjuncts to adequate surgery.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] No evidence supports the practice of continuing prophylactic antibiotics until central lines, drains, and chest tubes are removed, and most regimens of prophylaxis are completed within 24 h of the time of incision. However, there is evidence of an increase in the recovery of resistant bacteria by this practice.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>The differentiation between major and minor wound infection is important. There are various classifications to assess the severity of wound infection like Robertson classification in which severity of wound infection is assessed in grades.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] With the fear of developing wound infection after surgery, many surgeons administer antibiotics for prolonged period even in clean surgeries. This practice is not only expensive but also can lead to hospital-acquired infections.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] The purpose of conducting this study was to know whether prophylactic short course (three dose) perioperative administration of ceftriaxone be decisive in preventing an infection from developing. So that, it can decrease postoperative morbidity, shorten hospitalization, reduce the overall cost attributable to infection and prevent unnecessary use of antibiotics for long periods.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Aims and objectives</title><p>To study the effectiveness of short course (three dose) perioperative ceftriaxone antibiotic regimen in the prevention of postoperative wound sepsis in clean surgical cases.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ATERIALS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>The prospective, randomized and comparative study was conducted after approval from the Institutional Ethical Committee on fifty admitted patients who underwent clean elective surgical procedures in Government Medical College, Amritsar from November 2014 to September 2016.</p><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>All cases who underwent clean elective surgical procedures.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Exclusion criteria</title><p>

Infections can be prevented when effective concentrations of the drug are present in the blood and the tissue during and shortly after the procedure that is, during decisive period. Therefore, antibiotic prophylaxis should begin before the operation so that optimum drug concentration be there during decisive period. In spite of the use of prophylactic antibiotics, surgical site infections are still a risk of surgery and represent a substantial burden of disease in terms of morbidity, mortality and economic cost.</p><p>In our study, the overall infection rate was 4% in Group A and 24% in Group B which is comparable to other studies. In developing countries, the surgical site infection rate is much higher than Europe and the US. The incidence of surgical site infection in the reported developing countries is 11.5% in clean cases. The overall global incidence of surgical site infection is 0.4&#x02013;30.9/100 surgical patients and 1.2&#x02013;23.6/100 surgical procedures.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>In our study, there was less incidence of wound infection in cases who received short course (three doses) of ceftriaxone sodium (Group A) as compared to those who received ceftriaxone sodium for 5 days (Group B). These results were statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05).

Decisive period antibiotic coverage is very important to prevent postoperative wound infections. The factors such as Hb, nutritional status, and use of drain all influence the rate of postoperative wound infection. It is therefore recommended that for decreasing the incidence of postoperative wound infections antibiotics should commence preoperatively to cover the decisive period along with the basic principles of surgery such as complete asepsis, gentle tissue handling, prevention of hematoma formation, avoidance of putting unnecessary drains, and clean sharp dissection. A short course (three dose) perioperative ceftriaxone prophylaxis covering the decisive period can be efficacious and cost-effective for prevention of wound postoperative infections. Appropriate and judicious use of antibiotics can reduce the cost, unnecessary antibiotic administration, side effects, and microbial resistance.</p><sec id="sec2-11"><title>Limitation of study</title><p>The sample size was small.
