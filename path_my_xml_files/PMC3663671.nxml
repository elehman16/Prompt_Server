Traditional treatment consists of wearing a patch over their &#x02018;good&#x02019; eye for a number of hours daily, over several months. This treatment is unpopular and compliance is often low. Therefore results can be poor. A novel binocular treatment which uses 3D technology to present specially developed computer games and video footage (I-BiT&#x02122;) has been studied in a small group of patients and has shown positive results over a short period of time. The system is therefore now being examined in a randomised clinical trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>Seventy-five patients aged between 4 and 8 years with a diagnosis of amblyopia will be randomised to one of three treatments with a ratio of 1:1:1 - I-BiT&#x02122; game, non-I-BiT&#x02122; game, and I-BiT&#x02122; DVD. They will be treated for 30 minutes once weekly for 6 weeks. Their visual acuity will be assessed independently at baseline, mid-treatment (week 3), at the end of treatment (week 6) and 4 weeks after completing treatment (week 10). The primary endpoint will be the change in visual acuity from baseline to the end of treatment. Secondary endpoints will be additional visual acuity measures, patient acceptability, compliance and the incidence of adverse events.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This is the first randomised controlled trial using the I-BiT&#x02122; system. The results will determine if the I-BiT&#x02122; system is effective in the treatment of amblyopia and will also determine the optimal treatment for future development.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01702727?term=amblyopia&#x00026;rank=28">NCT01702727</ext-link></p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Amblyopia</kwd><kwd>I-BiT&#x02122;</kwd><kwd>Randomised clinical trial</kwd><kwd>Lazy eye</kwd><kwd>Child</kwd><kwd>Visual acuity</kwd><kwd>Binocular</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Amblyopia occurs when normal visual experience is disrupted during the critical periods for visual development. It most commonly presents in association with strabismus, anisometropia or both. Several forms of treatment for amblyopia exist but occlusion treatment is the gold standard and involves covering the good eye with a patch for a prescribed period of time each day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The length of patching treatment varies and ranges from 10 minutes daily to all waking hours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The child must wear the patch at home or school and typically, 120 hours of patching treatment results in 1 LogMAR line of improvement in visual acuity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Treatment is prolonged and this contributes to poor compliance. Many children refuse to wear their patch for the prescribed time and this is a major cause of failure of treatment. Many children feel they are stigmatised by the wearing of a patch. Dixon-Woods <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] reported patching caused distress and other negative outcomes such as relationship strain. In extreme cases, non-compliance with patching can result in a child having a costly admission to hospital to have supervised patching treatment. In addition, wearing a patch prevents both eyes being used at the same time which eliminates any advantage of binocularity (using the two eyes together as a pair).</p><p>Other forms of amblyopia treatment are used such as atropine eye drops and optical penalisation. These are usually chosen as secondary treatments if patching fails, and act by reducing the vision of the good eye in order that the child uses the amblyopic eye to see. All the existing traditional treatments rely on penalisation of the good eye with either a patch, eye drops or through the use of lenses (optical penalisation).</p><p>As an alternative to this treatment, we have developed a virtual reality-based system to treat amblyopia where children play special video games and watch DVDs. This interactive binocular treatment system (I-BiT&#x02122;) uses specially configured software to preferentially stimulate the amblyopic eye without compromising the vision in the good eye. The treatment activity is designed to be enjoyable and, importantly, the child does not have to suffer the unpleasant experience of having their vision limited by the sole use of their amblyopic eye (as they do with patching). The treatment has so far been delivered in the hospital eye clinic but the I-BiT system has the potential to be further developed for use in the home environment in the future.</p><p>Previous pilot studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] have shown the I-BiT&#x02122; system to be highly effective in improving the visual acuity in amblyopic patients. Since we first began our studies, 3D technology has improved and we have recently conducted a pilot study to assess delivery of I-BiT&#x02122; treatment using the latest generation of shutter glasses technology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. This study showed that all patients who completed their planned treatment (9 of the 10 patients) showed an improvement in visual acuity. These improvements ranged from 0.025 to 0.45 LogMAR units with a mean of 0.18 (sd 0.143) and a median of 0.175.</p><p>While the study did have limitations (it was uncontrolled, unblinded and the sample size was small) the results were promising and warranted further investigation in a randomised controlled study. This study will aim to compare the effect of the I-BiT&#x02122; game with the I-BiT&#x02122; DVD and also to compare the effect of the I-BiT&#x02122; game with a control in which the patient plays the game without the amblyopic eye being preferentially stimulated.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><sec><title>Objectives of the study</title><p>The primary objective of the study is to investigate whether there is any difference in visual acuity in patients treated with I-BiT&#x02122; <italic>versus</italic> non-I-BiT&#x02122; and also if there is any difference between the two treatment stimuli (interactive game <italic>versus</italic> DVD). Therefore two comparisons will be made: differentiation of the type of I-BiT&#x02122; treatment and differentiation of I-BiT&#x02122; from non-I-BiT&#x02122;.</p><p>Secondary objectives include examining visual acuity at additional time points (mid-treatment and 4 weeks after treatment has stopped), investigating the proportion of patients showing a response to treatment (a change from baseline of 0.125 or more [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]), the proportion of change in visual acuity, the change in binocular function, the acceptability of the treatment to the patient, compliance with treatment, and the safety profile of the treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>I-BiT&#x02122; shutter glasses system</title><p>The I-BiT&#x02122; system hardware consists of a desktop PC with two monitors, one for the clinician and one for the patient. As with all previous I-BiT&#x02122; system prototypes, the clinician monitor is used to control the treatment the patient receives and the patient monitor displays the visual stimuli. The system uses 3D shutter glasses and their corresponding infra-red emitter. The patient monitor is a flat-screen 18-inch 3D monitor with a refresh rate of 120 Hz as required for use with the shutter glasses. The shutter glasses lenses lighten and darken in synchrony with the monitor but faster than the user can perceive. The patient sits on a comfortable gaming beanbag for the duration of their treatment.</p><p>This I-BiT&#x02122; system relies on the same principle as previous prototypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Images are presented to both eyes but parts of the image are presented only to the amblyopic eye. The visual scene with the I-BiT&#x02122; system is not presented stereoscopically. Instead the 3D technology is used to present a distinct but visually related image to each eye allowing the perception of a dynamic, two-dimensional visual scene. The I-BiT&#x02122; system can display video footage and interactive games. A gaming control pad is used for the games. The games have been specifically developed to appeal to children aged 8 years and under. The visual stimuli presented in the current study are described below.</p></sec><sec><title>Video stimulus</title><p>The principle employed is that the image is divided into two zones. There is an outer &#x02018;border&#x02019; termed a locking stimulus which is presented to both eyes while the inner part of the screen presents the video footage to the amblyopic eye. Images within the border can be selectively shown to either eye to act as a control to ensure binocular viewing. The DVD transparency settings for the non-amblyopic eye can be adjusted for those with dense suppression if required. This is to encourage continued viewing and fixation with the amblyopic eye. To increase compliance the I-BiT system has a built in DVD player and this allows children to watch a DVD of their own choice.</p></sec><sec><title>Game stimulus</title><p>An interactive game called &#x02018;Nux&#x02019; will be used to provide the game-play. In Nux, a player moves through a colourful two-dimensional space-like environment. Points are rewarded for collecting coins and shooting enemies and deducted for colliding with enemies and obstacles (for example, asteroids). Through the I-BiT&#x02122; system, the player and the background are shown to both eyes but the obstacles, enemies and coins are shown only to the amblyopic eye. Therefore, in order for the child to play the game successfully, they must use their amblyopic eye. If the patient is unable to play due to dense suppression or severely reduced visual acuity in their amblyopic eye then the settings can be adjusted so that a proportion of the objects (coins and so on.) are seen by the non-amblyopic eye. In the non-I-BiT game version (control arm) both eyes receive identical stimulation.</p></sec><sec><title>Design</title><p>The study is a randomised parallel group, double-masked design.

Visual acuity will be assessed by an independent assessor who has no knowledge of the randomised treatment. The orthoptist treating the patient will have no knowledge of the results of the patient&#x02019;s visual acuity assessments.

The treating orthoptist will have no access to assessment results either through the database or through medical notes and indeed controls are in place to ensure that the treating orthoptist cannot treat these patients after they complete the study and thereby gain access to their resultant visual acuity measurement.</p><p>This study looks specifically at patients between the ages of 4 and 8 years. Cleary <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] found improvements in older children in a pilot study with an I-BiT&#x02122; prototype system. Therefore it is possible that improvements could be gained in patients older than 8 years with the current I-BiT&#x02122; system. However, there are no plans formally assess this at present, the priority being to develop an optimal treatment regimen for children.</p><p>The results of this study will inform further development. It will be necessary to determine an optimal treatment regimen which may involve more frequent visits or a larger number of treatments in order to provide a long-term effect. It will also be necessary to follow-up patients in the longer term to ensure maintenance of beneficial effects.</p><p>If I-BiT&#x02122; is shown to be an effective treatment for amblyopia there is great potential for developing this treatment in a number of settings. While making available in hospital orthoptic clinics, there is also the potential that it could be used in high street opticians throughout Europe and even the potential to develop a home-based treatment regimen. There is therefore the opportunity to make improvements in both vision and quality of life for children, but to also decrease treatment costs.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial status</title><p>As of 6 November 2012, 21 patients have been randomised.
