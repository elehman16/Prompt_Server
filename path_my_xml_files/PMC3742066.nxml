Given the lack of efficacy data for the UK comparator regimen compared to the aprepitant regimen, the model assumes that the UK comparator regimen has efficacy equal to that shown by the trial comparator regimen (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-cmar-5-215">Table 1</xref>). We tested this assumption in sensitivity analyses varying the efficacy of the UK comparator regimen. The economic evaluation was conducted from the perspective of the UK National Health Service (NHS), in line with current clinical practice, and valued in British sterling (&#x000a3;).

Enrolled patients were adults with a range of tumor types who were na&#x000ef;ve to emetogenic chemotherapy and scheduled to receive cycle 1 of single-day MEC. In this study, anthracycline and cyclophosphamide-based regimens were considered to be MEC; therefore, patients receiving these combination regimens were included. Of the 949 patients screened, 848 were randomized, with 101 (10.6%) patients excluded during screening (please refer to original publication by Rapoport et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-cmar-5-215">23</xref> for further details). The average age of the 848 randomized patients was 57 years; 77% were female, and 69% were white. The most common malignancies were breast cancer (52%), colorectal cancer (20%), and lung cancer (13%). Patients were randomly assigned to receive either an aprepitant-containing regimen or the control regimen of ondansetron and dexamethasone (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-cmar-5-215">Table 1</xref>). The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with no vomiting during 120 hours (5 days) after receiving chemotherapy, and the key secondary endpoint was the proportion of patients reporting complete response, defined as no emetic episodes and no use of rescue medication during the 5 days after initiation of chemotherapy. Self-completed patient diaries were used to record emetic episodes, use of rescue therapy, and nausea severity on a daily basis for 5 days. More than 98% of the patients completed their medication according to the protocol.</p><p>The trial included 438 patients with breast cancer, of whom 193/218 (88.5%) in the aprepitant group and 189/220 (85.9%) in the control group received anthracycline and cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-cmar-5-215">23</xref> Remaining patients received a variety of MEC regimens.

In patients with breast cancer, the efficacy of both control and aprepitant regimens was lower, while the relative efficacy with aprepitant was greater, than in patients with other tumor types, with respect to the primary and key secondary endpoints. These results could be expected, both due to the higher emetogenicity of anthracycline and cyclophosphamide-based regimens as compared with other MEC regimens and because almost all patients in the breast cancer group were women, who are known to be more susceptible to CINV.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-cmar-5-215">10</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Resource utilization and costs</title><p>Health care resource utilization data, including health care contacts, medication, and rescue antiemetic therapy use, were based on information for patients with breast cancer enrolled in the reference clinical trial (Merck Sharp and Dohme Ltd, data on file, 2011).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-cmar-5-215">23</xref> There were no differences between treatment groups in the incidence or categories of adverse events; therefore, specific adverse events were not incorporated into the model.

The health outcome complete response (CR) was the key secondary endpoint in the reference clinical trial and, for the purpose of the model, was subdivided into 2 mutually exclusive health outcomes: complete protection (CP) and complete response at best (CRB). The health outcome incomplete response (IR) was assigned to patients who did not achieve CR. All outcomes are defined in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-cmar-5-215">Table 2</xref>.

They are reported on a scale from 0 to 1, where 0 represents death and 1 represents perfect health. The utility value for a health state and the time spent in that health state are combined to produce the quality-adjusted lifeday (QALD) or quality-adjusted lifeyear (QALY). QALDs and QALYs are commonly used by health technology appraisal agencies globally as their preferred generic measure of health-related quality of life. For the model base case (ie, the modeled scenario which is expected to most closely reflect actual clinical practice), we assigned utilities to each health state in the model, as per Grunberg et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29-cmar-5-215">29</xref> They elicited QALY scores using a visual analog scale for chemotherapy states, in the absence and presence of nausea and vomiting. We assigned a value of 0.79 to the outcome CP, which corresponds to chemotherapy with no appreciable nausea or emesis, and a value of 0.27 to IR, a state in which emesis or nausea, or both, were present. We assigned a value of 0.594 to CRB, a state including nausea but not requiring rescue therapy, by normalizing the B&#x000f6;rjeson et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-cmar-5-215">30</xref> mild nausea utility of 0.752 to the CP state (0.752 &#x000d7; 0.79). Utility weights, according to health states in the acute and delayed phases, are depicted in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t3-cmar-5-215">Table 3</xref>. Five-day QALY values were calculated by multiplying the full QALY value by 5/365.</p><p>The model was used to explore other CINV-related outcomes, associated costs, and gains in QALDs and QALYs. We calculated the incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) as a measure of the cost-effectiveness of the aprepitant regimen relative to the UK comparator regimen, defined as the incremental cost divided by the incremental health gain in QALYs.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Sensitivity analyses</title><p>Sensitivity analyses are commonly used to assess uncertainty in economic models by evaluating the effect of differing model parameters, such as the utility values, costs, and efficacy, on the results of the economic analysis.

This ICER is well below the willingness-to-pay threshold of &#x000a3;20,000&#x02013;&#x000a3;30,000/QALY that is commonly accepted in the UK.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32-cmar-5-215">32</xref> When the utility values, costs, and efficacy assigned to the regimens were varied in sensitivity analyses, the aprepitant regimen remained cost-effective, with ICERs below or equal to &#x000a3;20,000/QALY, with the exception of increasing the antiemetic regimen drug costs by 20%, which resulted in an ICER of &#x000a3;20,868/QALY.</p><p>Optimizing control of CINV in the first cycle of chemotherapy is already an important goal of cancer supportive care<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-cmar-5-215">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-cmar-5-215">17</xref> and is associated with a reduced incidence of CINV in subsequent chemotherapy cycles.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-cmar-5-215">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-cmar-5-215">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-cmar-5-215">10</xref> Administration of the appropriate antiemetic regimen before cycle 1 of chemotherapy will become increasingly important as the provision of chemotherapy in the UK moves away from the traditional oncologist-led model toward nurse- and pharmacist-led chemotherapy clinics and home delivery.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33-cmar-5-215">33</xref> Use of aprepitant was associated with lower health care resource utilization compared with the comparator regimen, mainly due to fewer hospitalizations in the aprepitant group in the reference trial. Successful prevention of CINV has previously been shown to reduce outpatient health care resource use, including visits to a specialist and the emergency room.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-cmar-5-215">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34-cmar-5-215">34</xref></p><p>When compared with the alternative UK comparator regimen in which ondansetron is continued twice daily on day 2 and day 3 of the regimen, the aprepitant regimen was both more effective and cost-saving. This is likely because the efficacy of the alternative comparator regimen was not increased to account for the addition of ondansetron on day 2 and day 3, whereas the cost of the additional ondansetron was incorporated. This may be a reasonable assumption, however, because ondansetron has limited efficacy in preventing delayed CINV.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35-cmar-5-215">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38-cmar-5-215">38</xref></p><p>One of the strengths of this study is the consistency of results across all outcomes in the model and in the sensitivity analyses. The aprepitant regimen applied in the study model is that used in clinical trials of anthracycline plus cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy and other MEC regimens<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-cmar-5-215">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-cmar-5-215">23</xref> and represents the current standard of care for prevention of CINV associated with anthracycline plus cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy as recommended by evidence-based, consensus guidelines for Europe and the US.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-cmar-5-215">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-cmar-5-215">17</xref> Some patients included in this analysis received MEC regimens and, although the aprepitant regimen is not recommended for these patients in clinical guidelines, aprepitant is licensed for use with all MEC regimens.</p><p>There are some limitations in this economic analysis. The study published by Rapoport et al in 2010<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-cmar-5-215">23</xref> was used as the reference trial, as it contains the most recent data regarding use of aprepitant in patients receiving chemotherapy for breast cancer and because the patient population was not limited to anthracycline and cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy. However, there were no UK centers included in this study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-cmar-5-215">23</xref> while the observed resource utilization was assumed to be applicable to a UK setting. Data from an earlier trial, which included patients with breast cancer restricted to anthracycline and cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-cmar-5-215">21</xref> were not included in this analysis. We assumed for the purpose of the analysis that the efficacies of the trial and UK comparator regimens were the same. However, the UK regimen includes dexamethasone and metoclopramide in the delayed phase and so might be more effective than the trial comparator regimen in which only ondansetron is used in the delayed phase.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-cmar-5-215">15</xref> The efficacy of the UK comparator regimen may have been underestimated; therefore, we varied the efficacy in sensitivity analyses and found that the efficacy would have to increase by 16% for the ICER to reach &#x000a3;30,000/QALY.</p><p>There are other potential limitations to this study. First, our analyses were based on UK list prices while actual prices may differ. Second, the results of the analysis were sensitive to hospitalizations, of which there were none in the aprepitant group and 0.069 hospital days per patient in the trial control group; therefore, if fewer hospitalizations are assumed with standard UK practice, the ICER increases. Third, the selectivity of patient eligibility criteria in the aprepitant clinical trials could also limit applicability to real-life clinical practice; for example, administration of an aprepitant regimen is untested for patients who experienced CINV in previous cycles of chemotherapy. Finally, we examined only one cycle of chemotherapy, and the cost-effectiveness of the aprepitant regimen over multiple chemotherapy cycles is uncertain. However, data from a prior study indicate that the antiemetic efficacy of the aprepitant regimen is maintained over multiple cycles of chemotherapy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-cmar-5-215">22</xref></p><p>Decision-analytic modeling has previously been used to study the cost-effectiveness of aprepitant for CINV prevention with MEC in Belgium.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39-cmar-5-215">39</xref> The aprepitant regimen was compared for patients receiving anthracycline and cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy with the control regimen used in the Rapoport et al trial.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-cmar-5-215">23</xref> The Belgian model, which drew on clinical data from a different trial<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-cmar-5-215">22</xref> and used health state preference measures different from those in the present study, found that the aprepitant regimen was associated with a gain of 0.014 QALYs and was the dominant approach from the perspective of the Belgian health care payer.</p><p>Further study is required to evaluate the use of aprepitant in the UK for preventing CINV associated with MEC over multiple cycles and in patients who experienced CINV in previous chemotherapy cycles. In addition, data are needed on the efficacy of the aprepitant regimen compared with current UK clinical practice. Finally, as our model only included direct medical costs of CINV, it would be of interest to also assess other medical costs and indirect costs, such as costs associated with missed work days for patients and their caregivers.</p><p>Control of CINV remains an important goal for patients receiving chemotherapy. In this time of growing demands on finite health care resources, assessment of the cost-effectiveness of therapies is becoming increasingly necessary. The aprepitant regimen has been shown to improve the control of CINV associated with a variety of MEC regimens, including those used among patients with breast cancer. The results of this study suggest that the use of aprepitant is cost-effective for preventing CINV associated with cycle 1 of single-day chemotherapy for patients with breast cancer in the UK health care setting.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was funded by Merck and Co, Inc, Whitehouse Station, NJ, USA.
