on cognitive function and academic self-efficacy in children. [Subjects and Methods]
Thirty-five children participated in the study. Seventeen children were randomly selected
to undergo taekwondo training for 16 weeks (5 times per week). As controls, 18 children
received no training. Cognitive function and academic self-efficacy were measured using
the Stroop Color and Word Test (Word, Color, and Color-Word) and academic self-efficacy
scale (Self-confidence, Self-regulatory Efficacy, and Task Difficulty Preference),
respectively. [Results] In the taekwondo group, the Color-Word and Self-confidence scores
increased significantly after intervention as compared to those before intervention.
[Conclusion] It is suggested that regular taekwondo training may be effective for
enhancing cognitive function and academic self-efficacy in growing children.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Taekwondo</kwd><kwd>Cognition</kwd><kwd>Academic self-efficacy</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>It has been reported that childhood participation in physical activity, including regular
exercise, could not only promote physical development<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>, but could also prevent various diseases, such as metabolic
syndrome, by improving body composition and enhancing health-related physical fitness<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, there are recent reports that
childhood participation in physical activity might have a positive effect on cognitive
function, on various academic achievements, including academic score, and on psychosocial
function<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Specifically, Lees and Hopkins reported that aerobic physical
activity had a positive correlation with cognition, academic achievement, behavior, and
psychosocial functioning outcomes. Similarly, based on their finding that children with high
aerobic capacity scored higher than average in mathematics, Desai et al. suggested that
proper participation in physical activity at school might have potential benefits for
academic achievement, although the mechanism of this impact was not clear.</p><p>On the other hand, taekwondo (TKD), a globally popular sport, is practiced by about 70
million people in 204 countries, and 380 thousand children apply for a Taekwondo belt test
every year<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Preceding studies have
reported that regular TKD training had a positive effect on the improvement of physical
fitness and on physical growth and development in children<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>; and that childhood TKD training was effective in facilitating
physical, cognitive, emotional, and social development&#x02014;for example, by reducing anxiety,
encouraging independence and leadership, and controlling aggression<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. A recent study by
Kim et al. using functional MRI verified the positive effect of TKD training on brain
development in children. The results showed improvement in brain connectivity from the
cerebellum to the parietal and frontal cortex. This suggests that TKD training may be
effective in improving cognitive function and academic capability in children.</p><p>However, there has been very limited research to verify the effect of TKD training on
academic capability and the development of cognitive function in growing children.
Accordingly, the present study was conducted on children in elementary grades 4&#x02013;6, aiming to
verify the effect of TKD training on their cognitive function and academic
self-efficacy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Thirty-five healthy children aged 10 to 12&#x02005;years volunteered as subjects for this study.
Eighteen children (10 boys and 8 girls, mean age: 11.4 &#x000b1; 0.7&#x02005;years, mean height: 149.2 &#x000b1;
6.7&#x02005;cm, mean weight: 45.8 &#x000b1; 6.7&#x02005;kg, mean BMI: 20.5 &#x000b1; 2.0&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup>) received no
intervention and served as the control group. Seventeen children (11 boys and 6 girls, mean
age: 11.2 &#x000b1; 0.8&#x02005;years, mean height: 148.8 &#x000b1; 7.7&#x02005;cm, mean weight: 46.9 &#x000b1; 8.6&#x02005;kg, mean BMI:
21.2 &#x000b1; 3.9&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup>) received TKD training intervention for 16 weeks (TKD group).
The study protocol was approved by an institutional ethics review board of the Youngsan
University. All subjects and their parents were informed about the research procedure and
possible risks involved, and both parents and subjects signed a written consent form.</p><p>TKD training was conducted 5 times per week, for 16 weeks, each time for 70 minutes, at an
exercise intensity of 50&#x02013;80% of HRmax. Specifically, each TKD training session involved 5
minutes of warm-up stretching, 10 minutes of basic physical fitness training, 40 minutes of
main exercise (consisting of basic TKD movements, Poomsae, kicks, and Taekwon gymnastics),
and 5 minutes of cool-down stretching.</p><p>For measuring cognitive function, the Stroop Color and Word Test was performed twice,
before and after intervention, as previously described<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. The tests comprise Word Reading, Color Reading, and Color-Word
Reading parts. Each part contains 100 items arranged in 5 columns and 20 rows. Academic
self-efficacy was measured using the scale developed by Kim and Park, which consists of 3
subordinate factors: Self-confidence, Self-regulatory Efficacy, and Task Difficulty
Preference.</p><p>Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 21.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc.,
Chicago, IL, USA). Data have been presented as the mean &#x000b1; standard deviation, unless stated
otherwise. For identifying differences in normally distributed results, the two-way repeated
analysis of variance (ANOVA) was employed. When significant group by time interactions
occurred, simple main effects were assessed using the independent and paired t-tests. The
level of significance was set at 0.05 for all the tests.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>A comparison of anthropometric characteristics, Stroop Color and Word Test scores, and

enable the morphometric analysis of the brain&#x02014;such as image analysis technology.
Accordingly, many preceding studies have reported the brain health improvement effect of
exercise. For example, regular exercise has been reported to exert a positive effect on
functional changes in the brain, by not only improving brain volume but by also inducing
angiogenesis and neurogenesis<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. The present study employed the Stroop
Color and Word Test to verify the effect of TKD training on cognitive function in children.
The result showed that the TKD group achieved significantly higher Color-Word scores after
the 16-week TKD training, suggesting that TKD training may be effective in improving
cognitive function. This supports the findings of preceding research that reported
significant increase in Stroop Color and Word Test scores following regular TKD
training<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. The Stroop Color and Word
Test reflects cognitive function<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Using
this test, Kim reported a significant increase in Color and Word scores after an 8-week TKD
training at exercise intensities of RPE 11&#x02013;15. In addition, a study conducted by Lakes et
al.<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>, which involved 60 students in
grades 7&#x02013;8 and the practice of TKD for 9 months during physical education classes, showed
that taekwondo was effective not only in enhancing physical fitness but also in improving
cognitive function. Based on this result, TKD was suggested to be an appropriate exercise
program for physical education at school.</p><p>Academic self-efficacy refers to learner&#x02019;s self-assessment on the ability to confidently
organize and execute an action plan for carrying out an academic task, and it consists of 3
subordinate factors: Self-confidence, Self-Regulatory Efficacy, and Task Difficulty
Preference<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. The present study showed
that TKD training resulted in a significantly high Self-confidence score (which indicates
students&#x02019; confidence or conviction in their own academic capability). According to preceding
research, there is a direct and indirect correlation between academic self-efficacy and
academic achievement, as the learners with higher academic self-efficacy tend to choose more
challenging tasks, invest more efforts in successfully carrying out tasks, and use more
effective learning strategies<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Taken
together, these results suggest that TKD training may also be effective for enhancing
academic capability in growing children. It has also been reported that the increased
expression of neurotrophic factors that occurs with regular exercise plays an important role
in the mechanism of brain function improvement<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, in order to elucidate
the mechanism through which TKD training aids the improvement of cognitive function and
academic self-efficacy, follow-up research would need to include the analysis of
neurotrophic factors. In addition, this study has the limitation that it could not exclude
the effect of regular exercise because there was no other exercise group that can be
compared with TKD group. In future studies, it is necessary to compare TKD training with
other types of exercise programs.</p><p>In conclusion, it is suggested that regular TKD training may be effective for enhancing
cognitive function and academic self-efficacy in growing children.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea and the
