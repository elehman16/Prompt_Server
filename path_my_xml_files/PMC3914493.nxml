relation to their goals, expectations, standards and
concerns (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>).</p><p>Quality of life has been increasingly recognized
as an important outcome measure in both treatment studies and service evaluations (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). The postpartum period is an important time for a mother,
her newborn and family. Women problems may
increase during the mentioned period (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), therefore, these changes may impact on mother&#x02019;s wellbeing (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Additionally, women reports considerable limitations in their abilities to function at work
and at home even up to 6 months postpartum (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).
Antenatal education provides information regarding pregnancy, birth process, infant care, and confidence in taking of the responsibilities of parenthood (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), which is admitted as a positive approach
to prepare the women for child birth (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Antenatal
education reveals numerous effects on women&#x02019;s
quality of life at the postpartum (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Some studies
have found significant beneficial effects of antenatal education and/or support programs on the quality of birth, postpartum experiences and the satisfaction of the parents (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Variety of medical,
psychological, social and obstetric factors could
have impact on the quality of life after the postpartum. Mothers&#x02019; negative perception of their own
health can have a negative impact on their infant
care behaviors. The health of women after childbirth may affect their children&#x02019;s health (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).</p><p>Assessing quality of life in this period will allow a woman to make a self-evaluation of her own
postnatal situation, and will also assist health care
providers for further promotion of women and infants&#x02019; health. Akyn et al. (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) indicated that quality of life of mothers who were able to receive
emotional support from their families and spouses showed much more positive score in quality
of life compared to mothers who did not receive
this support. (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). But Artieta-Pinedo et al. (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>)
showed that antenatal education is not associated
with any benefits for childbirth. The most recent
meta-analysis has concluded that there is insufficient evidence to determine the effects of antenatal
education on psychological, physical and social
adjustment (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to determine the effect of prenatal
education on mother&#x02019;s quality of life during their
first year after childbirth among Iranian women.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This single-blind randomized control trial was
performed between June 2010 and December 2011.
The 160 pregnant women were randomly assigned
into two groups using a random sampling method.
Interventional group included 80 participants (received prenatal education classes), while control
group included 80 participants (not received prenatal education classes). Participants are referred
to Health and Treatment Center of number one,
Dezful, Iran. All participants (intervention group
and control group) were enrolled in the routine
prenatal care classes. First-time pregnant women
with a singleton fetus were invited to participate in
the study if they met the following criteria: i. aged
18 to 35, ii. between 24 and 28 weeks&#x02019; gestation,
iii. without history of medical, psychological, and
infertility diseases, iv. with at least eight prenatal
visits during pregnancy, whilst two visits occurred
before the 20th week of pregnancy, v. reading and
writing in Farsi (Persian), and vi. giving written
informed consent. Women were excluded if they
met the following exclusion criteria: i. neonate
with congenital anomalies, ii. neonatal death, iii.
complicated pregnancy, iv. drug consumption, v.
birth weight &#x0003c;2500 gram, vi. postpartum depression, vii. family difficult during six month after
child birth, and viii. failure to attend 2 sessions
of prenatal education classes. The antenatal education classes were eight daytime sessions for 90
minutes in a period of 3 months (2-4 sessions per
month at 9-10:30 am.), located at the Health and
Treatment Center of number one, Dezful, Iran.
Classes included 8-10 mothers. </p><p>The antenatal education class, presented by an
experienced midwife, consisted of the following
programs: anatomical, physiological, and psychological changes during pregnancy; a proper diet
during pregnancy; stages of natural labor; care
of the mother and newborn following delivery;
breastfeeding; and family planning. Training was
carried out theoretically using educational and audiovisual devices, such as television and computer.
Proper position during labor and delivery, the correct way of breathing during pregnancy, relaxation,
and neuromuscular exercises were introduced, and
also, were practically performed. A counseling
session was also held to answer all questions of
participated mothers. The Ethics Committee of
Dezful University of Medical Sciences approved
the study protocol.</p><p>llection consisted of a demographic questionnaire, as well as the Iranian interview-administered version of the World Health
Organization&#x02019;s Quality of Life Questionnaire
(WHOQOL-BREF). The WHOQOL-BREF is a
26-item instrument including the following four
domains: physical health (7 items), psychological health (6 items), social relationships (3 items),
and environmental health (8 items), as well as two
overall quality of life and general health items. All scores are transformed to reflect 4 to 20 for
each domain with higher scores corresponding
to a better quality of life. There is no overall
score for the WHOQOL-BREF (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Content
validity and test-retest were performed to assess validity and reliability of the questionnaire (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). The questionnaires completed
between 24<sup>th</sup> and 28th weeks&#x02019; gestation (for
your information: 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup>, 4<sup>th</sup>, 5<sup>th</sup>, etc), 6-8
weeks after childbirth, as well as 1 year postpartum. Data was analyzed by SPSS 15 (Chicago, IL, USA) using t test, Chi-square, and
Mann-Withney. Statistical significance was
considered to be p&#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>One hundred sixty women with mean age of

as follows: i. very good (17%), ii. good (58%),

Table 2 presents the mean and standard deviation
for domains of mother&#x02019;s quality of life in the interventional and the control groups (at 6-8 weeks
postpartum). As shown in table 2, the interventional group demonstrates higher scores for different domains of quality of life (p&#x0003c;0.05) compared
to those of the control group.</p><p>The differences were statistically significant for
domains of physical health, psychological health, social relationships and environmental health between
two groups (p&#x0003c;0.05). The domain of physical health
showed the highest score, while the domain of environment health showed the lowest score among the
domains of WHOQOL-BREF (at 6-8 weeks postpartum). The results revealed significant differences
among the mean scores for domains of the physical health, psychological health, and environmental
health between two groups (at 1 year postpartum). In
this study, the interventional group (at 1 year postpartum) was more likely to demonstrate higher scores for
different domains of quality of life, including physical health, psychological health, and environmental
health domains in comparison to the control group
(p&#x0003c;0.05). In the current study, the interventional
group had higher scores on social relationships, but
the difference was not statistically significant. Table
3 depicts the four mean scores belonging to the domains of the quality of life (at 1 year postpartum). In
addition, the interventional group showed a significant increase in the mean scores of three domains belonging to physical health, psychological health, and
environmental health, from 6-8 weeks postpartum to
1 year postpartum (p&#x0003c;0.05). But, the control group
revealed a significant increase in the mean scores of
two domains belonging to physical health and environmental health, from 6-8 weeks postpartum to 1
year postpartum (p&#x0003c;0.05).</p><table-wrap id="T2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p> The comparison of mean and standard deviation (SD) per domains of mother&#x02019;s quality of life in the interventional

large randomized controlled interventional trial of
antenatal group education that includes long-term
follow up of the mother&#x02019;s quality of life between
6-8 weeks postpartum and 1 year postpartum.</p><p>The majority of participants in the interventional
group reported that their overall quality of life and
health were good and satisfactory, respectively, according to the WHOQOL-BREF questionnaire. In
the study by Zubaran et al. (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), they have reported
the women in the interventional group have higher
level of happiness and satisfaction of their overall
quality of life and health compared to the control
group, which was similar to our obtained result. Postpartum women should cope with body changes and
new responsibilities of motherhood (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Hill and
Aldag (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) indicated that happy mothers reported a
higher level of satisfaction in their relationship with
their spouses; in addition, there was a significant
increase in the level of health and general functioning during the study. But Nagpal et al. (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) showed
that the scores of overall quality of life were lower
than that in our study. Therefore, according to our
obtained results, prenatal educations are one of the
reasons for higher level of happiness and satisfaction
in the overall quality of life and health, respectively,
among the participants. Lack of awareness can cause
fear and anxiety during pregnancy and birth, then
these may induce complications during delivery and
postpartum, and also, these may be one of the reasons
that women ask for medical interventions (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). </p><p>In the interventional group, the high mean scores
for domains of the quality of life at 6-8 weeks
postpartum indicated higher level of physical, psychological, social relationships and environmental
health compared to the control group. Results from
the study by Zubaran et al. (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) indicated that a
sample of postpartum mothers showed favorable
scores for domain of the quality of life. However,
other researches indicated that women showed
slightly satisfaction with their lives during the
postpartum period (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). But, IP et al. reported that
the educational intervention is effective in promoting pregnant women&#x02019;s self-efficacy for childbirth,
while reduces their perceived pain and anxiety
in the first two stages of labor. Relief of pain and
anxiety is an important issue for both women and
health-care professionals. The self-efficacy education should be more for mothers during pregnancy
(<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). In a study showed that taking severe exercise
after delivery is more associated with the social
and mental wellbeing (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). In addition, in the interventional group, the high mean scores for domains of the quality of life is the result of having
the knowledge of physiologic and phsychological
changes during pregnancy and the postpartum period, including factors associated with recovering
from the birthing process and caring of newborns.
Further support for this conclusion comes from the
study by Hueston and Kasik-Miller (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) in which
suggested that pregnancy was the cause of the
changes. In a study by Zubaran et al. (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) conducted in order to assess the postpartum period, participated mothers reported a sense of improvement
and high self-esteem, as well as good or improved
relationships with their family members.</p><p>In our study, the interventional group (at 1
year postpartum) demonstrated higher scores for
domains of quality of life (QOL), like physical
health, psychological health, and environmental
health compared with the control group. Quality of
life of mothers receiving support from their families and spouses was much more positive score
compared to whom did not receive this support.
In many studies, a relationship between emotional
support and the health level of the mother has been
detected (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>-<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Other studies showed that recovery of physical and social functioning after delivery requires longer than 6 weeks (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>).</p><p>The significant increase in domains at 1 year postpartum compared with 6-8 weeks postpartum may
indicate additional demands by pregnant women
to receive this prenatal education. In a study by
Hill and Aldag they assessed the quality of life on
184 mothers, and revealed a significant increase in
terms of their health and mental functioning during the study. From weeks 1-3, the mean scores for
domains of the health and functioning have shown
significant increase for mothers of intervention
group. Mothers can be informed that their satisfaction with their health and mental functioning, as
well as overall QOL will likely improve with time.
The overall mean QOL scores for mothers was
higher at the week 3 compared to the first week
postpartum. This finding suggests that this sample
of mothers was more satisfied with their lives in
general as time passed (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). The results showed
that mothers in the interventional group have higher levels for domains of quality of life.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our findings suggest that the mother&#x02019;s knowledge could potentially reduce their levels of anxiety and stress in pregnant women, which in turn,
may improve maternal health and quality of life
during first year postpartum. Further research on
the effect of prenatal education on mother&#x02019;s quality of life during breastfeeding or up to 5 years after childbirth is required in order to enhance our
existing knowledge. </p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are indebted to all women and their families
