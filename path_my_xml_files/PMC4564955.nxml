For a young person, a parent&#x02019;s cancer presents as a unique stressor with the threat of loss implicit in the diagnosis. Even when the prognosis is good, the young person may still be confronted by parental absences due to the need for hospitalisation, the ongoing impact of treatment side-effects upon the parent&#x02019;s functioning, and disruption to normal family roles and routines, including shifts in responsibility for household duties and care of younger children onto the young people themselves (Romer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2002</xref>; Welch et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">1996</xref>; Maynard et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2013</xref>). Further, if the parent's cancer goes into remission, the young person still has to face the changes that the cancer brought, such as threat of recurrence and the possibility that the parent will no longer be able to act as carer (Osborn 2007). A young person&#x02019;s experience of parental cancer is therefore likely to be disruptive and distressing across a number of psychosocial domains, with the added complication that the young person is already in a&#x000a0;developmentally complex&#x000a0;stage of life (Patton and Viner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2007</xref>).</p><p>Research on the psychological impact of having a parent with cancer has focused largely on young people&#x02019;s internalising (e.g., anxiety and depression) and externalising (e.g., behavioural problems at school) symptoms as well as physical complaints (e.g., sleeping difficulties and headaches) and changes in cognitive function (e.g., maintaining concentration at school) (Visser et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2004</xref>). Research suggests that offspring of a parent with cancer exhibit relatively few externalising symptoms but that internalising symptoms are more common and elevated relative to community norms, especially among adolescents (as compared to young adults) (Visser et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2004</xref>; Osborn <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2007</xref>). Furthermore, age and sex-related differences among offspring of parents with cancer generally indicate that adolescents and young adults experience more anxiety and depression than do pre-adolescent children, with the most elevated symptoms appearing in adolescent daughters of ill mothers (Compas et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">1994</xref>; Romer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2002</xref>; Osborn <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2007</xref>; Welch et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">1996</xref>; Visser et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2005</xref>).</p><p>The role of potential moderators of the psychological outcomes of young people who have a parent with cancer has also been examined. Key variables of interest have included: demographics (young person&#x02019;s age and gender, parent&#x02019;s gender, interaction between youth gender and parent gender); family make-up (parental marital status, presence/absence of siblings); disease variables (stage, prognosis, tumour type); treatment variables (no treatment, surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, combination of treatments); treatment outcomes/status (complications, side-effects, completion of treatment, recurrence of disease); time since diagnosis; prognosis; parent psychological functioning; family functioning (responsibilities, strain, roles, communication, cohesion, adaptability); and parenting (consistency, detachment) (Osborn <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2007</xref>). Interestingly, disease and treatment variables do not appear to be associated with youth outcomes, nor do socio-demographic and parental mood variables, with the possible exception of maternal depression. The variables of greatest utility in predicting youth outcomes centre on family variables, especially those relating to family communication (McDonald et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2015</xref>;&#x000a0;Osborn <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2007</xref>).</p><p>Given the number of young people who have a parent with cancer, it is disheartening to note the scarcity of interventions specifically developed to assist this population (Lewis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2007</xref>; Romer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2007</xref>). Recently, Niemela, Hakko and Rasanen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2010</xref>)&#x000a0;conducted a systematic narrative review of interventions for offspring who have a parent with cancer and located only 11 structured child-centred interventions. They concluded that &#x0201c;..children are a forgotten group when families face a life-threatening parental illness.&#x0201d; (p.459). They found that interventions fell into two categories: structured family interventions and structured peer interventions. While results from family interventions were positive overall, the actual preventive effect of the interventions on children (for both the family and peer interventions) could not be evaluated due to the absence of follow-up. In general, the interventions lacked: a) methodological detail and theoretical underpinnings, b) reporting of results and use of valid outcome measures, c) substantial sample size, and d) control groups. All these factors prevent firm conclusions regarding the effectiveness of the interventions and highlight the pressing need for well-designed, controlled studies of interventions designed for the offspring of parents with cancer. The purpose of this paper is to provide researchers and practitioners with&#x000a0;an outline of the development and content of a psychological&#x000a0;intervention for young people who have a parent with cancer, and a rigorous study protocol designed specifically to evaluate the merits of an intervention.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>The Truce program</title><p>In consideration of the burden associated with a parent&#x02019;s cancer diagnosis and the scarcity of programs available to support affected young people, there was a clear need for the development and evaluation of an intervention targeting the psychosocial and informational needs of this group. In response to this need, our research team<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1">1</xref> developed <italic>Truce</italic>: a manualised 7-week, face-to-face group psychological intervention for young people who have a parent with cancer.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Theoretical background &#x02013; Acceptance and Commitment Therapy</title><p><italic>Truce</italic> is part of an increasing movement to provide psychosocial support to people who present with risk, rather than waiting until a pathology is present, with the intention of reducing the likelihood of future psychosocial problems (Coie et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">1993</xref>). This movement incorporates therapeutic paradigms that recognise client strengths and allow for growth (Kashdan and Ciarrochi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2013</xref>). Increasingly, the field of psychology has seen a shift from typical behavioural-only paradigms to cognitive - behavioural paradigms that emphasise changing the content of thoughts (Hollon and Beck <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">1994</xref>) to mindfulness-based therapies that emphasise changing one&#x02019;s relationship with thoughts (e.g. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, ACT). ACT teaches people to let go of destructive attempts to control feelings and to allow unhelpful thoughts to occur without &#x0201c;hooking to them&#x0201d; or believing them (Hayes et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">1999</xref>). Overarching the ACT approach is the broader goal of increasing psychological flexibility, or the ability to adapt to shifting demands and maintain balance through the use of mental resources (Kashdan and Rottenberg <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2010</xref>). In addition, ACT draws on the field of positive psychology, where the goal is to begin &#x0201c;&#x02026; to catalyse a change in focus of psychology from preoccupation only with repairing the worst things in life to also building positive qualities&#x0201d; (Hayes et al. 1999, p. 5).</p><p>There are six core principles of ACT: <italic>acceptance, defusion, being present, self as context, valued living and commitment to action</italic> (Hayes et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">1999</xref>; Bach and Moran <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2008</xref>). <italic>Acceptance</italic> involves opening up in the service of values, and accepting painful internal experiences such as feelings and emotions instead of fighting them. <italic>Defusion</italic> refers to &#x0201c;unhooking&#x0201d; from thoughts; learning to observe them and not react to them, nor treat them as always true. <italic>Being present</italic> means consciously connecting to, and engaging with, the situation the person is currently in. <italic>Self as context</italic> refers to being aware of an internal, &#x0201c;observing self&#x0201d; distinct from the &#x0201c;thinking self&#x0201d;. <italic>Valued living</italic> involves identifying an individual&#x02019;s personal values, that is, what is important to them. Finally, <italic>commitment to action</italic> refers to taking effective actions in a way that is consistent with one&#x02019;s values (Hayes et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">1999</xref>; Harris <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2009</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Previous ACT studies</title><p>Empirical evidence for the efficacy of ACT therapeutic approaches has previously been reviewed (Ruiz <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2010</xref>). The review examined three types of study; namely, (i) correlational studies, (ii) experimental psychopathology and ACT component studies, and (iii) outcome studies. Results from the review highlighted a wide variety of conditions that have shown positive long-term outcomes from ACT treatment, including: depression, anxiety disorders, psychosis, chronic pain, and substance use. ACT therapies have demonstrated efficacy, producing large effect sizes that are typically maintained or increased at follow-up. Murrell and Scherbarth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2006</xref>) reported empirical support for ACT interventions across a variety of child and adolescent populations: adolescents at risk of dropping out of school (Moore et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2003</xref>), paediatric pain patients (McCracken et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2010</xref>), and adolescent girls either engaging in high-risk sexual behaviour (Metzler et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2000</xref>) or experiencing anorexia (Heffner et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2002</xref>). Further, research shows that for adolescents in school, ACT has good long-term effects at 2-year follow-up (Livheim <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2004</xref>). Two randomised controlled trials for adolescents with depression provide further evidence of treatment efficacy (Hayes et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2011</xref>), and further recent evidence has been found for the effectiveness of ACT in helping adolescents with chronic pain (Gauntlett-Gilbert et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2012</xref>) and obsessive compulsive disorder (Armstrong et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2013</xref>). Finally, longitudinal research suggests that awareness and acceptance, both core concepts of ACT, are critical components of positive adolescent development (Ciarrochi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2011</xref>; Marshall et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2015</xref>; Rowsell et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>The Truce facilitator manual, participant workbook and parent booklet</title><p>The working party involved in the development of <italic>Truce</italic> included consumer representatives who were young people impacted by parental cancer and psychologists with expertise in: developmental educational concerns, adolescent development, ACT, clinical work and young people impacted by cancer. A cancer nurse with clinical and research expertise and CanTeen staff with expertise in researching and working with young people and their families living with cancer, also contributed to the project.</p><p>The <italic>Truce</italic> program was developed to include all of the components of ACT (Hayes et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">1999</xref>) and to gradually build and reinforce&#x000a0;ACT skills and knowledge. It is a manualised, seven-session program (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) with the sixth session involving both the young person and their parent. In addition to the facilitator manual, a participant workbook and a parent&#x02019;s booklet have been developed. The facilitator manual contains background information regarding the development and running of <italic>Truce</italic>, detailed content of each session, and all necessary worksheets and tools. The participant workbook contains review material for each session along with home practice activities which participants complete between sessions. Participants are given their workbooks in the first session and are not required to bring them to following sessions.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Content of the seven <italic>Truce</italic> sessions</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Session</th><th>Content</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center">

Parents or caregivers who choose to participate are involved in the evaluation questionnaires and attend session six. A parent does not need to participate in the program in order for his or her child to participate. Likewise, the parent with cancer does not necessarily have to be the parent that attends session six.</p><p>The Parent Booklet will be given to parents prior to the commencement of the <italic>Truce</italic> program. The purpose of this booklet is to provide parents with information about the impact of parental cancer on young people and how they can support their child. Parents are encouraged to read the booklet prior to the commencement of their child&#x02019;s participation in the <italic>Truce</italic> program. The booklet contains information on the <italic>Truce</italic> program and home practice activities, to be completed by the parent after he or she has attended the joint session. Specifically, the parent booklet contains information from research on the needs of young people who have a parent with cancer (Patterson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2011</xref>) and information about what is helpful for young people who have a parent with cancer (Maynard et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2013</xref>). The &#x02018;How you can help your child?&#x02019; section of the booklet has been structured on Olson&#x02019;s Circumplex Model (Olson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2000</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Study aims</title><p>The primary aim of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of <italic>Truce</italic>, a 7-week ACT-based program for young people (aged 14 to 22&#x000a0;years) who have a parent diagnosed with cancer.</p><p>The primary outcome variables are distress and psychosocial well-being of intervention-group participants, relative to control-group participants, across the duration of the study (i.e., from pre-treatment through post-treatment and two - month follow-up assessment).</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Hypotheses</title><p>It is hypothesised that greater reductions in distress and improvements in psychosocial well-being will be observed in <italic>Truce</italic> program participants than in wait-list controls. Secondly, these effects will be maintained at two-month follow-up.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Study design and setting</title><p>The study utilises a 2 (intervention vs control) x 3 (pre-treatment vs post-treatment vs two-month follow-up) repeated measures, within-between participants design. The two-month follow-up time was selected to provide a measure of the sustainability of the <italic>Truce</italic> program post-intervention, while minimising the waiting time before wait-list control participants commenced treatment.</p><p>The CONSORT guidelines for pragmatic trials (Zwarenstein et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2008</xref>) were used in the development of the study protocol, with the exception of randomisation of participants to intervention conditions. Pragmatic trials differ in emphasis from other randomised controlled trials in that they focus on examining effectiveness (i.e., they attempt to maximise the applicability of the trial to usual care settings) rather than efficacy (i.e., examining the impact of the intervention under ideal trial conditions) (Zwarenstein et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2008</xref>). Accordingly, we aimed to maintain methodological rigour within the constraints of working within realistic settings. Assignment of participants to the intervention or wait-list control condition will be determined by whether there are enough participants in an area to run a group (four to eight is the acceptable number for a group); where there are not enough participants, they will be assigned to the wait-list control condition. While not a true randomisation of participants, this approach lends external validity as it is similar to the circumstances around administering group therapy programs in the community.</p><p>The <italic>Truce</italic> program will be offered in a number of locations throughout Australia. The group meetings are to be hosted in private rooms in a range of locations such as CanTeen offices, Cancer Council offices and public spaces such as libraries. The program will be facilitated by both CanTeen staff and external facilitators, all of whom have been trained in ACT methods and who are experienced at working with young people. In addition to ensuring facilitators are appropriately trained and qualified, the <italic>Truce</italic> program is manualised (as described above) and all materials will be provided. Weekly briefing and debriefing sessions will be held with all facilitators to ensure the program is delivered according to the manual.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Participants</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>Young people will be eligible to participate if they are: (i) able to provide informed consent; (ii) able to read English; (iii) aged between 14 and 22&#x000a0;years; and, (iv) have a living parent (or caregiver) who has been diagnosed with cancer within the last 5&#x000a0;years.

Similarly, healthcare professionals who recognise the needs of these young people have few avenues for referral available to them. We hypothesise that <italic>Truce</italic> has the potential to provide considerable benefit to these young people, and that rigorous evaluation of the program will inspire healthcare professionals to refer to the program with confidence.</p><p><italic>Truce</italic> has three clear strengths as a program for young people impacted by parental cancer. The first of these is that it is based on ACT, which has a considerable body of empirical evidence supporting its efficacy. ACT seems particularly suited to this client group for several reasons. ACT teaches young people to accept what can&#x02019;t be changed, such as the threat of cancer, loss and the difficult feelings that arise. It also helps young people to engage in valued action, even in the presence of difficult feelings. Finally, ACT minimises the use of argument and complex problem solving and reasoning processes, which may particularly suit younger people&#x000a0;whose abstract cognitive skills are still developing.</p><p>The second strength of the program is that it involves peer-to-peer interaction, which has been found to be an unmet need of young people who have a parent with cancer (Patterson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2011</xref>). Participants are able to take part in a group where everyone is connected by a life circumstance that is often difficult to discuss on an everyday level with peers. Thirdly, it acknowledges the importance of a family systems approach.</p><p>The measures employed, as well as the use of a wait-list control group, will enable the impact of the program on the key outcome measures to be assessed. The longitudinal design will indicate whether post-intervention gains are maintained at follow-up. The design further allows us to identify factors that are likely to weaken or strengthen the effect of the intervention and the possible ACT processes behind the functioning of the intervention.</p><p>Recruitment is known to involve substantial challenges with studies of this type due to barriers in identifying young peoples' need for help. Raising awareness of the program is also challenging. A longer discussion of the challenges of recruitment for this study is to be presented in future publications. There is also limited potential to analyse the impact of the different elements of the program upon participant outcomes due to their synergistic and cumulative character.</p><p>Young people who have a parent with cancer are at risk of ongoing psychosocial problems and previous research has highlighted these young peoples&#x02019; need for counselling support (Patterson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2011</xref>). The components of ACT presented in <italic>Truce</italic> promote psychological flexibility, skills to cope with difficult thoughts and feelings, mindfulness skills, identification of values and goals, and committed action to living a rich, full and meaningful life. We anticipate that participation in <italic>Truce</italic>&#x000a0;will improve psychological well-being in young people who have a parent with cancer. <italic>Truce</italic> has the potential to mitigate many years of mental health problems by building resilience in young people through the skills learnt to successfully deal with their parent's cancer and other potentially psychologically distressing situations in life.&#x000a0;The creation of an evaluated, manualised program for young people who have a parent with cancer is also expected to fill a gap in providing support to these young people during this difficult time.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ACT</term><def><p>Acceptance and Commitment Therapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AFQ-Y</term><def><p>Avoidance and Fusion Questionnaire - Youth</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CAMM</term><def><p>Child and Adolescent Mindfulness Measure</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FRI</term><def><p>Family Relationship Index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>K10</term><def><p>Kessler 10</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RADS-2</term><def><p>Reynold&#x02019;s Anxiety and Depression</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OCNI</term><def><p>Offspring Cancer Needs Instrument</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn id="Fn1"><label>1</label><p>CanTeen is an Australian charity that provides psychosocial support to 12 to 24&#x000a0;year olds who have cancer, have a close family with cancer, or have had a close family member die from cancer.
