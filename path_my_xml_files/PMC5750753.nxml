Consequently, there is an urgent need to develop evidence&#x02010;based treatments. We conducted a randomized controlled trial of a novel suicide prevention psychological therapy for male prisoners. To promote ecological validity by addressing the &#x0201c;real&#x02010;world&#x0201d; situation of suicidal prisoners, we involved a consultant group of ex&#x02010;offenders with past experience of being suicidal during imprisonment.

Those willing to help were then asked to circulate a poster inviting interested ex&#x02010;offenders to a meeting at the university where information was provided about the study and SURG. Seven people attended the meeting following which they were invited to meet research staff individually to ascertain their possession of the required &#x0201c;lived experience&#x0201d; and ability to attend meetings regularly. This resulted in five people wishing to join the SURG; however, one member dropped out after two years for reasons unknown.</p><p>Throughout the three&#x02010;year study, four SURG members attended monthly research meetings at the university to guide the research team throughout all aspects of the research process.

Questions investigated participants&#x02019; motivations and expectations of joining the SURG, views about how they were involved and how involvement had impacted on them personally. Questions also probed participants&#x02019; views about relationships with fellow SURG members and the research team, along with any challenges or disappointments encountered.

</p><p>Participants reflected how involvement with the study generated recognition that from unwanted negative experiences of imprisonment emerged a knowledge and skill set of value to others.

</p></disp-quote>
</p><p>For Liz, involvement in PROSPeR triggered a process of challenging negative self&#x02010;perception that her past would inevitably define her future. This led to a more optimistic future based on perceptions of herself as someone of value who can make a meaningful contribution to society:<disp-quote content-type="quotation" id="hex12590-blkfxd-0016"><p>Since joining PROSPeR now I don't live in it (<italic>the past)</italic>, I look forward to what I've got to give and my input and my future and where it's going, and that's what PROSPeR has given me&#x02026;.

</p><p>Kim also considered how, paradoxically her past unhappy experiences of imprisonment were now more favourably reconceptualized in recognition of how they led to her involvement in PROSPeR:<disp-quote content-type="quotation" id="hex12590-blkfxd-0017"><p>&#x02026; Wow!

<italic>Changing perceptions of others</italic> emerged in response to recognition that people who had previously known them as criminals appeared now to have changed how they perceived and responded to them. For example, Ted stated that whilst his family at first disbelieved he had genuinely changed, this altered when he showed them his University honorary staff identity card:<disp-quote content-type="quotation" id="hex12590-blkfxd-0018"><p>That honorary badge was like &#x0201c;Woo!&#x0201d; &#x02013; the best thing in the world!&#x02026;.

</p></disp-quote>
</p><p>The &#x0201c;loudness&#x0201d; of Ted's often humorous words portrayed his pride and pleasure of holding a University honorary staff card which he perceived as evidence of his reformed character. The external recognition of being given honorary staff status also had a positive impact on other participants:<disp-quote content-type="quotation" id="hex12590-blkfxd-0019"><p>It <italic>[university]</italic> was scary because I don't have any qualifications&#x02026;.to be in university and to be with other lecturers&#x02026; and to be treated like &#x02013; we have honour passes [<italic>identity card</italic>]&#x02026; it makes you feel special like you&#x02026; are appreciated by the university. <named-content content-type="attribution">(Liz)</named-content>

You know they really have changed. <named-content content-type="attribution">(Sam)</named-content>
</p></disp-quote>
</p><p>Perceptions that others would hold negative beliefs about them, especially officials from police and prison communities, presented a particular challenge to participants when encountering such people in their roles of service user consultants. Liz explained how this compounded her shyness when giving her first PROSPeR seminar presentation:<disp-quote content-type="quotation" id="hex12590-blkfxd-0023"><p>I was that nervous I could do nothing but laugh.

</p><p>Yet, paradoxically, when Liz received praise rather than disapproval from prison staff audiences, it stimulated improved self&#x02010;confidence to undertake training and get involved in further presentations:<disp-quote content-type="quotation" id="hex12590-blkfxd-0024"><p>&#x02026;but then I did a small course on &#x02026; confidence building.

<bold>&#x0201c;</bold>forensic&#x0201d; service user consultants for the PROSPeR study. Our findings have relevance for clinicians, prison and forensic researchers and for criminal justice professionals for two reasons. First, they provide information of successful approaches for engaging and working with potentially disenfranchised ex&#x02010;offender groups per se. Second, they indicate markers of effective ways of utilizing ex&#x02010;offender service users&#x02019; personal experiences to enhance the quality and rigour of research.</p><p>The interview schedule was designed to offer participants an opportunity to discuss their experiences of involvement with the study. During interviews, participants chose to focus on talking about experiences of engaging with the research team and how this positively impacted on their future life direction, even influencing crime desistance behaviour.</p><p>Participants perceived their positive relationship with researchers as paramount to their sustained engagement with the study, with this becoming the linchpin by which they evaluated the success of their involvement. Involvement precipitated a personal journey of change culminating in reappraisal of self&#x02010;perceptions and formation of new self&#x02010;identities. During interviews, it became evident of how strongly the stigma of past imprisonments had infiltrated participants&#x02019; self&#x02010;identity and expectations for themselves and others. Consequently, participants&#x02019; focus on talking about their changed self&#x02010;identity largely concerned movement from offender to non&#x02010;offender status.</p><p>Participants described how involvement in the study precipitated an internal process of reflection whereby they challenged and rejected their criminal identity to assume a new &#x0201c;changed person&#x0201d; identity. This was an unexpected outcome of their involvement with the study both for the researchers and the ex&#x02010;offenders. Goffman's<xref rid="hex12590-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">32</xref> seminal works on stigma postulated how labelling of deviants leads to &#x0201c;spoiled identity.&#x0201d; Subsequently, Lemert<xref rid="hex12590-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">33</xref> described how societal &#x0201c;labelling&#x0201d; of criminals often leads to the labelled individual's acceptance and internalization of self&#x02010;stigma based upon the perceived views of others. Conversely, &#x0201c;delabelling&#x0201d;<xref rid="hex12590-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">34</xref> as a precursor of &#x0201c;changed person&#x0201d; status is professed to carry greater impact when validated by &#x0201c;certification&#x0201d; from respected officials.<xref rid="hex12590-bib-0035" ref-type="ref">35</xref> This may explain the high acclaim with which participants held their university honorary staff contracts.</p><p>Training is recommended to empower service users to make a meaningful contribution to research<xref rid="hex12590-bib-0036" ref-type="ref">36</xref>, <xref rid="hex12590-bib-0037" ref-type="ref">37</xref>. Therefore, SURG members were given honorary contracts to enable access to university educational resources. However beyond providing training, the honorary staff identity card was valued by SURG members as a &#x0201c;badge of honour&#x0201d; marking their acceptance and status by a respected official institution. It was also used as &#x0201c;proof&#x0201d; to convince sceptical others that old criminal lifestyles were redundant.</p><p>People with criminal backgrounds are traditionally considered &#x0201c;hard to engage&#x0201d; in formal processes,<xref rid="hex12590-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">38</xref> yet in our study, high levels of sustained engagement and unrelenting enthusiasm for working with a university&#x02010;based research team were evident. Ex&#x02010;offenders are a recognized, marginalized and stigmatized societal group<xref rid="hex12590-bib-0039" ref-type="ref">39</xref> and as our participants had extensive criminal backgrounds (collectively approximately 50&#x000a0;years of imprisonments), they are likely to have experienced stigma and the &#x0201c;invisible punishments&#x0201d; described by Travis<xref rid="hex12590-bib-0040" ref-type="ref">40</xref> of societal rejection persisting beyond prison sentence completion. Feeling accepted and valued by researchers, without judgement of their past misdemeanours, appeared highly influential to participants&#x02019; sustained engagement in the study. Indeed, engagement in new prosocial roles marked by strong affiliation with an institution has been found to be influential in maintenance of desistance.<xref rid="hex12590-bib-0041" ref-type="ref">41</xref> Being involved with PROSPeR appeared to provide a dynamic change force epitomizing a &#x0201c;turning point&#x0201d;<xref rid="hex12590-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">34</xref> influential to supporting participants&#x02019; desistance.</p><p>Although the value of developing a positive environment to promote service user involvement has been described for forensic<xref rid="hex12590-bib-0042" ref-type="ref">42</xref> and general health populations,<xref rid="hex12590-bib-0037" ref-type="ref">37</xref>, <xref rid="hex12590-bib-0043" ref-type="ref">43</xref> our experiences suggest that this may assume greater importance for ex&#x02010;offender groups.</p><p>Motivation to become a service user consultant in research is often driven by a passion to &#x0201c;make a difference&#x0201d;<xref rid="hex12590-bib-0044" ref-type="ref">44</xref>, <xref rid="hex12590-bib-0045" ref-type="ref">45</xref> or to &#x0201c;give something back&#x0201d;,<xref rid="hex12590-bib-0043" ref-type="ref">43</xref> and these ideals were clearly evident for SURG members.

Positive psychology approaches that foster opportunities for post&#x02010;traumatic growth within offender rehabilitation programmes have been described.<xref rid="hex12590-bib-0047" ref-type="ref">47</xref> Interestingly, whilst the narratives from Ted, Kim and Liz suggest experiences of post&#x02010;traumatic growth, this was not the case for Sam, who as a past university graduate possessed higher levels of self&#x02010;confidence prior to joining the SURG. Other SURG members viewed Sam as an esteemed member of the group although he did appear somewhat set apart from the others. For example whilst other members valued their university honorary contract, Sam was relatively disdainful of its impact for him. Qualitative research aims to elicit rich data across a range of perspectives as opposed to seeking congruence of views and, as such, Sam's comments represent a negative case example.<xref rid="hex12590-bib-0048" ref-type="ref">48</xref>
</p><p>The personal impact of participants&#x02019; involvement in research accords with that of non&#x02010;criminal service user consultants.

</p><p>Delivering complex interventions such as psychosocial therapies to address suicidal thoughts and behaviours involves a range of health professionals, including psychiatrists, clinical psychologists and mental health nurses and requires the greatest rigour in terms of an evidence base.

Their results indicated that, particularly within the field of mental health research, RCT eligibility criteria could exclude up to 50% of &#x0201c;real&#x02010;world&#x0201d; patients. Most often excluded were people with the most severe or complex problems and those considered to be high risk for aggression or suicide.

This proved to be an important determinant for successful implementation of the study throughout the three&#x02010;year duration. SURG members&#x02019; willingness to share their &#x0201c;insider intelligence&#x0201d; with researchers unfamiliar with the prison environment positively influenced many aspects of study. For example, in the training of research assistants to recruit and interview participants; in reinforcing the need for researchers to exercise vigilance to maintain their personal safety when interviewing potentially dangerous prisoners; by helping to design comprehensible participant information sheets; and by guiding the sequencing of various components of the trial therapy.<xref rid="hex12590-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">28</xref>
</p><p>Psychological therapies can only be developed and successfully implemented if communication between the therapist and the client is optimized. Our study has illustrated some generic and transferable mechanisms for optimizing communication with ex&#x02010;offender populations which can be used by all professionals including those from healthcare, prison and criminal justice settings. These include the need to form a &#x0201c;connection&#x0201d; with <italic>word deleted</italic> forensic individuals by establishing shared goals bonded by mutual respect, valuing the individual's perspective by listening, tolerance of views and lifestyles that may be very different to one's own.</p><p>Armstrong and Ludlow<xref rid="hex12590-bib-0055" ref-type="ref">55</xref> elucidate the similarities of the overarching aims of universities and statutory offender management schemes as both seek to invest in people, support inclusivity and aim to enrich communities by social transformation. However as the authors point out, &#x0201c;<italic>social growth is achieved through individual growth</italic>&#x0201d;<xref rid="hex12590-bib-0056" ref-type="ref">56</xref> (p9). It is, therefore, not insignificant that our ex&#x02010;offender SURG members revealed that an unintended outcome of their involvement with PROSPeR involved a move away from crime.</p><p>Finally, a further consideration is the personal benefits to ex&#x02010;offender service users of involvement in studies such as PROSPeR. Ex&#x02010;offenders are likely to experience challenges such as reintegration into conventional society, financial hardship and restrictions on employment opportunities due to being imprisoned. Our work showed that our SURG members perceived a range of benefits from being part of this group which nurtured their enthusiasm and desire for remaining with, and actively contributing to the project.</p><sec id="hex12590-sec-0027"><label>4.1</label><title>Strengths</title><p>This study has contributed to the knowledge base in the underresearched area of service user involvement in prison mental health. Our study offers valuable insights for other researchers of effective ways of involving ex&#x02010;offender service users and other &#x0201c;hard&#x02010;to&#x02010;reach&#x0201d; populations. Our findings suggest that good practice in service user involvement may extend impact beyond the intended outputs of improving the quality of the research to also impacting on the lives of service users that can lead to transformational personal change.</p><p>Considerable attention to ensuring scientific rigour was invested in the current study: (i) interviews were conducted by a researcher who was external from the PROSPeR study thereby minimizing potential social desirability bias; (ii) to ensure high&#x02010;quality interview data, and with reference to Yardley's principles,<xref rid="hex12590-bib-0051" ref-type="ref">51</xref> supervision of the researcher addressed issues of contextual sensitivity,<xref rid="hex12590-bib-0051" ref-type="ref">51</xref> ethical research<xref rid="hex12590-bib-0057" ref-type="ref">57</xref> and reflexivity<xref rid="hex12590-bib-0058" ref-type="ref">58</xref>; and (iii) researcher triangulation involving several levels of independent and multiple coding processes preceded final agreement of themes.<xref rid="hex12590-bib-0056" ref-type="ref">56</xref>
</p></sec><sec id="hex12590-sec-0028"><label>4.2</label><title>Limitations</title><p>Although our sample comprised only four participants, this represented the entire membership of the SURG, who between them had over 50&#x000a0;years experience of imprisonment. A prevailing feature of IPA is a focus on ideography with small homogenous samples.<xref rid="hex12590-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">29</xref> Although our sample was small, the level of rich detail of the experiences of this unique population of ex&#x02010;offenders is striking. In keeping with the aims of qualitative research, we do not make any claims for empirical generalizability<xref rid="hex12590-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">29</xref> of our findings. We do however suggest the potential for &#x0201c;theoretical transferability&#x0201d; of an appropriate level of our findings based on assimilation of readers&#x02019; own professional knowledge and experience.<xref rid="hex12590-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">29</xref>, <xref rid="hex12590-bib-0059" ref-type="ref">59</xref>
</p><p>The organizational constraints pertaining to the PROSPeR study were immense, and we believe the SURG members were highly influential to its success. There are challenges to recruiting ex&#x02010;offender service users who are willing to get involved in research and we believe this may be the first and possibly only such group currently in existence. As such our sample size reflects, the very small pool of ex&#x02010;offenders contributing to research currently. Further studies with ex&#x02010;offender service user consultants are required to elicit a wider range of experiences.</p></sec></sec><sec id="hex12590-sec-0029"><label>5</label><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>This study has shown that it is possible to engage and work effectively with ex&#x02010;offender service user consultants and outlines important indicators of the conditions under which relationships flourish, benefiting both the research process and the service user consultants themselves. Our findings indicate that other prison researchers should be optimistic about successfully involving ex&#x02010;offender service users in research projects.</p></sec><sec id="hex12590-sec-0031"><title>CONFLICT OF INTEREST</title><p>The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="hex12590-sec-0030"><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We would like to acknowledge Kieran Lord (Research Assistant from 2011&#x02010;2012), Chris Wall (Project Administrator) and all members of the Service User Reference Group for their support and assistance with the study.
