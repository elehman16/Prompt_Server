Bevacizumab is approved for treatment of several types of cancer, including colon cancer, lung cancer, glioblastoma, and renal-cell carcinoma, where it has been shown to improve progression-free and overall survival when used alone or in combination with other cancer therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Bevacizumab was approved by the US Food &#x00026; Drug Administration (FDA) (Avastin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>; Genentech, Inc., San Francisco, USA) in 2004 and by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) (Avastin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>; Roche Pharma AG, Grenzach-Wyhlen, Germany) in 2005 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Several proposed bevacizumab biosimilars are in development, some of which have completed or currently are in Phase III development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. ABP 215, a proposed bevacizumab biosimilar, was submitted for approval to the US FDA and EMA in 2016 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">Guidance issued by the US FDA and EMA on the development of biosimilars specifies that biosimilars should be highly similar to the reference product with respect to quality attributes, notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components. In addition, there should be no clinically meaningful differences with respect to safety, purity, and potency. Both agencies recommend &#x0201c;totality-of-evidence&#x0201d; and emphasize a stepwise approach to biosimilar development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. This begins with demonstrating analytical and biofunctional similarity to the reference product. The next step involves demonstrating that the pharmacological profile, including PK and pharmacodynamic activity, is comparable between the proposed biosimilar and the reference product. The final step is demonstrating clinical similarity with respect to efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity in a sensitive population at the same approved dosage and route of administration as the reference product.</p><p id="Par7">In preclinical studies, ABP 215 was shown to be highly similar to both bevacizumab (US) and bevacizumab (EU) with respect to structure and in vitro biological activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. This Phase I randomized, single-blind, single-dose study was conducted to evaluate the PK similarity of ABP 215 to bevacizumab reference product sourced from the US and the EU. The objective of the study was to demonstrate that the PK profile of ABP 215 is similar to that of bevacizumab in healthy adult men after a single intravenous (IV) dose. The secondary objectives were to assess safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Ethical conduct of the study</title><p id="Par8">This study was conducted in accordance with the provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki and in accordance with the US FDA Code of Federal Regulations, the International Conference on Harmonisation E6 Guidelines on Good Clinical Practice, and the provisions of the EU Clinical Trial Directives.

There were no pre-existing ADAs detected in the baseline samples, and no subjects had a positive ADA test at EOS.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par34">Bevacizumab was approved for use in the US in 2004 and in the EU in 2005 for treatment of several types of cancer and has been shown to improve survival either alone or in combination with other cancer therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Biosimilars are expected to have minor structural differences from their reference product resulting from differences in expression systems, cell lines, bioprocess, and purification processes. Demonstrating similarity with respect to structure and in vitro biologic function and clinical PK is the foundation of establishing biosimilarity. Demonstration of clinical equivalence in efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity is an important step in confirming biosimilarity. The totality of evidence along with scientific justification based on a common mechanism of action, PK and clinical considerations in various patient populations is necessary to support extrapolation across indications.</p><p id="Par35">ABP 215 is being developed as a biosimilar for treatment of the same indications as bevacizumab. Like bevacizumab, ABP 215 is produced by recombinant DNA technology in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Results from comprehensive analytical characterization studies have shown that ABP 215 and bevacizumab are physicochemically similar, notwithstanding minor differences that are not expected to affect the PK, safety, efficacy, and quality of the product. In addition, ABP 215 and bevacizumab (EU) have been shown to be functionally similar in an initial preclinical pharmacologic similarity assessment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Establishing similarity with respect to analytical and functional activity and PK parameters support a totality of biosimilarity along with further confirmation of efficacy and safety in patient studies. For biosimilars, Phase II dose-finding studies are neither necessary nor required by regulatory bodies.</p><p id="Par36">This study is the first clinical study with ABP 215. As ABP 215 is being developed for use globally, this study was conducted at CPUs in the US and EU using regionally approved bevacizumab reference product as comparators as required by the biosimilar development pathway in each region. The results of this study demonstrate that the PK profile of ABP 215 is similar to both bevacizumab (US) and bevacizumab (EU). Moreover, bevacizumab (US) and bevacizumab (EU) were found to be bioequivalent to each other. Healthy male subjects were enrolled because healthy subjects provided the most sensitive population for assessing similarity of PK without the potentially confounding effects of disease states and concomitant drugs, which can alter PK profiles. Women were not included in this study of healthy volunteers because bevacizumab increases the risk of ovarian failure and may impair female fertility.</p><p id="Par37">The standard criteria for demonstrating PK bioequivalence are that the two-sided 90% CI for the GMR must be within the prespecified acceptance range of 0.8 and 1.25 for overall exposure (e.g., AUC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. For each primary analysis comparison (AUC<sub>inf</sub>, AUC<sub>last</sub>, and <italic>C</italic>
<sub>max</sub>), the 90% CIs for the adjusted least squares GMRs were fully contained within prespecified bioequivalence range. Bioequivalence between ABP 215 and bevacizumab&#x000a0;(US) and bevacizumab (EU) was demonstrated and was consistent irrespective of the investigational site.</p><p id="Par38">The safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of ABP 215, bevacizumab (US), and bevacizumab (EU) were assessed by monitoring for AEs, clinical laboratory tests, vital signs measurements, ECGs, physical examinations, and by testing for the presence of ADA before administration of study medication and at EOS. All three study medications were safe and well tolerated. There were no deaths or SAEs, and no subjects discontinued the study as a result of AEs. In general, the safety profiles were similar across treatment groups. The majority of AEs were considered mild (grade 1) or moderate (grade 2) in intensity. Moreover, no new safety signals were identified beyond those expected based on previous studies and clinical experience with bevacizumab. In all three treatment arms, the most frequently reported AE considered possibly or probably related to study drug was headache. No clinically relevant changes in clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, ECGs, or physical examination findings were observed in any treatment group.</p><p id="Par39">We further found that the incidence of AEs in the bevacizumab (EU) group (61%) was somewhat higher than in either the ABP 215 group (47%) or the bevacizumab (US) group (33%). In a post hoc summary of AEs, the incidence of any AE for the US site was 37.1% (13 subjects) in the ABP 215 group and 32.8% (22 subjects) in the bevacizumab (US) group; the incidence for the EU site was 57.6% (19 subjects) for ABP 215 and 61.2% (41 subjects) for bevacizumab (EU). Thus, although the frequencies of treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs)s varied between the US and EU sites, the frequencies were similar between the ABP 215 and bevacizumab treatment groups within each individual site, further supporting the similarity between ABP 215 and bevacizumab.</p><p id="Par40">Finally, bevacizumab reference product sourced from the (US) and from the (EU) were shown to be similar with respect to PK profiles, safety, and immunogenicity. Establishing similarity between reference products sourced from different regions is an important step in the developmental process for biosimilars. The US FDA and EMA have taken steps to facilitate global development programs by permitting the use of foreign-sourced comparators in Phase III clinical studies provided a &#x0201c;scientific bridge&#x0201d; between the local and the foreign-sourced reference product is demonstrated in comprehensive analytical similarity studies and PK study of the biosimilar candidate against both comparators. Thus, the scientific bridge between reference products allows for the use of single comparator in the Phase III clinical study. ABP 215 and bevacizumab were assessed in a Phase III study in patients with non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. The results of the Phase III study will be reported in a separate communication that is currently in development.</p><p id="Par41">The results of this Phase I study demonstrate PK bioequivalence of ABP 215, bevacizumab (US), and bevacizumab (EU). ABP 215, bevacizumab (US), and bevacizumab (EU) were safe and well tolerated. No new safety signals with regard to treatment with ABP 215 were identified and no subject tested positive for ADAs. The totality-of-evidence thus far indicates that ABP 215 is biosimilar to bevacizumab.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>The original version of this article was revised due to a retrospective Open Access order.</p></fn><fn><p>A correction to this article is available online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00280-017-3457-8">https://doi.org/10.1007/s00280-017-3457-8</ext-link>.</p></fn><fn><p>An erratum to this article is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00280-017-3457-8">https://doi.org/10.1007/s00280-017-3457-8</ext-link>.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This study was funded by Amgen Inc.
