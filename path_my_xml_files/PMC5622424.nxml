Given the interdependence of weight in couples, weight management outcomes might be improved by targeting joint weight loss and the creation of an interpersonal milieu that supports long-term behavior change. According to Self-Determination Theory (SDT), greater autonomous self-regulation of behaviors, and subsequently better treatment outcomes, are observed in needs supportive environments in which personally meaningful choice is supported and criticism and control are minimized. Correlational analyses confirm these pathways in weight management, with needs support from one&#x02019;s spouse or partner emerging as a distinct predictor of weight loss success. Research is now needed to establish causal links and to develop and test weight loss interventions designed to facilitate the needs supportive behavior of spouses.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Project TEAMS (Talking about Eating, Activity, and Mutual Support) is a randomized controlled trial testing a couples-based intervention, grounded in SDT, designed to change the social context of weight loss by training spouses to provide needs support for each other&#x02019;s eating and physical activity behavior. Sixty-four couples will be randomized to either 6&#x000a0;months of behavioral weight loss treatment informed by SDT (SDT-WL) or to 6&#x000a0;months of standard behavioral weight loss treatment (BWL). Couples will attend weekly sessions for 6&#x000a0;months and will be assessed at 0, 3, 6, and 12&#x000a0;months. By bolstering needs support, SDT-WL is predicted to increase autonomous self-regulation and perceived competence and produce greater weight loss and maintenance than standard behavioral treatment. Exploratory analyses will examine the SDT process model prediction that the influence of needs support on treatment outcomes will be mediated by autonomous self-regulation and perceived competence.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">This study addresses the fundamental importance of interpersonal support in weight management by focusing on couples rather than individuals and using a rich theoretical framework to train spouses in supportive behaviors.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par4">

Individuals enter into marriage with similar weight statuses, mirror each other&#x02019;s weight change trajectories over time, and model dietary habits and physical activity behaviors for their children, creating a home environment that can promote or prevent obesity transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Although ecological models recognize the importance of the social and interpersonal environment in the development of obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], weight management approaches, particularly in adults, remain focused on the individual. Behavioral weight loss treatment (BWL), the treatment of choice for adults with overweight and obesity, provides individuals with knowledge about energy balance and basic self-regulatory skills [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]; however, little attention is given to the home environment and the social context in which behavioral choices are made. Spouses, despite sharing many obesogenic risk factors, are typically not involved in treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. This narrow focus on the individual and the neglect of the larger interpersonal environment may contribute to the failure of current treatment programs to consistently produce long-term weight loss.</p><p id="Par6">A handful of couples weight loss programs have been evaluated and, in general, have produced some additional weight management benefits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Most of these interventions were quite brief (8&#x02013;12&#x000a0;weeks), had modest effect sizes, and produced diminished effects over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In the most common intervention design, only one spouse in a given dyad was targeted for weight loss while the other spouse was enlisted in some manner to enhance support for behavior change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In many studies there was no stated social relational framework to guide treatment nor was there a clear conceptualization of what type of involvement might be most helpful. Support was often not defined or measured, and the focus of assessment, treatment, and analysis was the index participant, not the marital dyad. In light of recent reports of the interdependence of weight and related behaviors within couples, there is a clear need to revisit couples weight loss from a theory-based lens to determine whether spouses can facilitate each other&#x02019;s weight loss and to understand what type of support is most beneficial in the weight loss process.</p><p id="Par7">Self-Determination Theory (SDT) offers a fresh perspective for understanding interpersonal support and motivation for health behavior change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. SDT suggests that need supportive environments, which elicit, acknowledge, and value autonomy and personal choice, establish the context for the development of self-directed, personally meaningful choice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Need supportive interpersonal environments have repeatedly been associated with greater internalized autonomous self-regulation, enhanced perceived competence, higher relationship satisfaction, and greater well-being [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Autonomous self-regulation has also been consistently related to better learning, coping, and health outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. These effects are most apparent for sustained change over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], precisely the shortfall of existing behavioral weight loss programs.</p><p id="Par8">Interventions delivered in a needs supportive fashion are associated with better health outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], yet most studies have examined support from health care providers, not family members. Since much of weight management involves choices that are made at home [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], it is imperative to examine the impact of needs support from spouses. Prior correlational research has demonstrated the importance of receiving needs support from spouses or romantic partners for dietary change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and for weight loss outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], and that needs support operates in distinct ways from other more directive forms of support. However, the effect of needs support has not yet been tested in a randomized controlled trial on couples weight loss, and no intervention studies have attempted to train spouses to support SDT needs. A necessary next step is to develop and test an intervention designed to engender needs support within couples for weight-related behavior change.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Study aims</title><p id="Par9">The primary aim of this study is to examine the impact of a couples weight loss program rooted in SDT on weight loss outcomes and needs support, autonomous self-regulation, and competence for behavior change.

Couples (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;64) will be randomized to 6&#x000a0;months of either SDT-WL or BWL and will be assessed at 0, 3, 6, and 12&#x000a0;months.</p><p id="Par10">The primary hypotheses are that compared to BWL, SDT-WL will result in: 1) greater increases in needs support from spouses, 2) greater increases in autonomous self-regulation and competence for healthy behaviors, and 3) greater weight loss at 6 and 12&#x000a0;months. Secondary aims will compare SDT-WL and BWL on maintenance of weight loss (6&#x02013;12&#x000a0;months), treatment adherence, and treatment satisfaction. Exploratory analyses will compare the influence of needs support on weight loss with more directive forms of support as well as examine whether the effect of needs support on weight loss is mediated by autonomous self-regulation and perceived competence as predicted by SDT.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study design (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>)</title><p id="Par11">Couples will be randomized as a dyad to the enhanced needs support condition (SDT-WL) or to a more traditional model of spouse involvement (i.e., spouses attend groups but receive no training in providing autonomy support; BWL).

Most eating and activity decisions are made in the home [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], therefore it makes intuitive sense to involve other adults from the home in treatment to facilitate healthy behavior change. Converging evidence also suggests that weight is interdependent within dyads &#x02013; spouses are sensitive to both weight gain and weight loss in their partners, often mirroring changes in either direction themselves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. While social factors clearly influence weight and related behaviors, our understanding of how to involve spouses in the weight loss process is in its infancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. To date, most couples weight loss programs have been of limited duration, lack a social relational model to guide treatment development and assessment, and have had minimal impact. Self-Determination Theory (SDT) is a theory of motivation that proposes three psychological needs that are essential to health and well-being &#x02013; relatedness, competence, and autonomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and provides a framework for working with couples to support behavior change. The current study tests a SDT-based couples weight loss program that teaches spouses how to support each others needs and create an interpersonal environment that promotes sustained behavior change.</p><p id="Par40">The study is innovative in several ways. Married couples, not individuals, will be the unit of treatment and analysis. The intervention will be delivered to both spouses and the statistical approach will fully utilize the dyadic nature of the data to provide a nuanced understanding of how couples lose weight together. In contrast to earlier couples interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], a clear social relational framework will guide both the treatment and assessment protocols. Needs support is well defined and is distinguished from other types of support (i.e., directive support) both in how couples are taught to work together to accomplish their goals and in how support is measured in the assessment battery. Several types of support will measured subjectively (self-reports) and objectively (videotaped observations) over the 12-month study allowing for a prospective test of the SDT model and an analysis of the unique contribution of autonomy support to weight loss outcomes.</p><p id="Par41">Project TEAMS provides an important first test of the benefits of approaching weight management as a couples health issue. If couples can achieve weight loss together, the whole family might benefit. Children of parents living with obesity are 12 times more likely to have obesity than children with normal weight parents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. Moving the focus of study from the individual to the married couple has the potential to improve weight loss outcomes and promote a healthier weight status in all family members.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank the couples who participated in TEAMS as well as our research assistants and colleagues: Maja Barnouw; Emma Bee Schwartz; Kate Boudreau; Christina Cardwell; Joan Daniel, MPH; Amanda Denes, PhD; Jaime Foster, MS, RD; Lynn Guibbory; Josh Hardin; Nataliya Korostensky; Elizabeth Lamonte; Nana Marfo; Tabea Muller; Amybre Ponivas, MA; Arielle Sherman-Golembeski; Erin Stolz; Lauren Strainge; Julia Werth; Olivia Wilson; Sanne Wortel; Emily Wyckoff.</p><sec id="FPar11"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par42">This protocol is funded by the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI), grant number R21HL125157 awarded to Dr. Gorin.</p></sec><sec id="FPar12"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p id="Par43">Not applicable.</p></sec></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>AAG and TP designed, planned, and oversaw all scientific aspects of the study; KG coordinated the project; RK consulted on the design of the intervention materials and selection of study assessments; THM oversaw study randomization and consulted on the analytic plan; TC oversaw data management and conducted the data analyses; AM provided input on treatment and assessment issues related to the dietary intervention; LP provided input on treatment and assessment issues related to physical activity and oversaw all medical and safety aspects of the trial.
