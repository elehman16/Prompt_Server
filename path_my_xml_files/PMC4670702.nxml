Using the SWAN-PRS, we were able to demonstrate very high agreement between actual treatment allocation and treatment classification in the SWAN study, with 85.6% of audiotapes being correctly classified by independent raters. Further, SWAN-PRS ratings demonstrated significantly higher mean therapy-specific subscale scores appropriate to the actual allocated treatment modality. We were also able to demonstrate that there were no inter-site differences in therapist adherence with regards to either treatment classification or mean subscale ratings for CBT-E, MANTRA, SSCM or the Non-Specifics subscale. These findings confirm that therapists adhered strongly to treatment protocols; that the three treatment modalities could be reliably distinguished; and that therapist adherence was not influenced by treatment site. This not only provides evidence regarding the relative ease with which treatments can be disseminated across sites, but also provides evidence for the internal validity of the study.</p><p>Limitations of the present study included the use of only two raters to establish inter-rater reliability, the use of data generated by only one rater for the remaining analyses, and the uneven distribution of audiotapes available for each treatment site. In addition, whilst the SWAN-PRS was developed to measure the extent to which therapists demonstrated behaviors consistent with treatment protocols, it did not measure therapist competence, or the extent to which therapists delivered treatments according to an acceptable standard.<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Therapist competence is another important aspect of treatment integrity in outcome research and should form the focus of future research.</p><p>In summary, measuring therapist adherence in the SWAN study was essential to provide evidence of the scientific quality of the trial. The rigorous development and piloting process involved in the development of the SWAN-PRS resulted in a reliable measure of therapist adherence to the three treatment modalities under investigation. The SWAN-PRS can now be used to demonstrate therapist adherence in other contexts involving these treatments. It could also generate useful information to assist with therapist training.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="b1"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Moncher</surname><given-names>FJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Prinz</surname><given-names>RJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Treatment fidelity in outcome studies</article-title><source>Clin Psychol Rev</source><year>1991</year><volume>11</volume><fpage>247</fpage><lpage>266</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="b2"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Perepletchikova</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Kazdin</surname><given-names>AE</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Treatment integrity and therapeutic change: Issues and research recommendations</article-title><source>Clin Psychol Sci Pract</source><year>2005</year><volume>12</volume><fpage>365</fpage><lpage>383</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="b3"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Fairburn</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Cooper</surname><given-names>Z</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Therapist competence, therapy quality, and therapist training</article-title><source>Behav Res Ther</source><year>2011</year><volume>49</volume><fpage>373</fpage><lpage>378</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">21492829</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b4"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Krupnick</surname><given-names>JL</given-names></name><name><surname>Sotsky</surname><given-names>SM</given-names></name><name><surname>Simmens</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Moyer</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Elkin</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name><name><surname>Watkins</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>The role of the therapeutic alliance in psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy outcome: Findings in the National Institute of Mental Health Treatment of Depression Collaborative Research Program</article-title><source>J Consult Clin Psychol</source><year>1996</year><volume>64</volume><fpage>532</fpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">8698947</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b5"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Luborsky</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>DeRubeis</surname><given-names>RJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The use of psychotherapy treatment manuals: A small revolution in psychotherapy research style</article-title><source>Clin Psychol Rev</source><year>1984</year><volume>4</volume><fpage>5</fpage><lpage>14</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="b6"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Elkin</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name><name><surname>Shea</surname><given-names>MT</given-names></name><name><surname>Watkins</surname><given-names>JT</given-names></name><name><surname>Imber</surname><given-names>SD</given-names></name><name><surname>Sotsky</surname><given-names>SM</given-names></name><name><surname>Collins</surname><given-names>JF</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>National Institute of Mental Health Treatment of Depression Collaborative Research Program.

Very high agreement between raters (Kappa&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.81, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001) was established for classification of treatments using the SWAN-PRS. Overall, 87.5% (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;42/48) of audiotapes were classified as the same treatment by both raters with high inter-rater reliability demonstrated for CBT (91.67%), MANTRA (88.23%), and SSCM (84.21%), when considered separately.</p></app><app id="app2"><title>Appendix B Factor Analysis of the SWAN-PRS</title><p>An exploratory factor analysis was used to ascertain the underlying factor structure of the SWAN-PRS. Overlap items and Non-Specific items were excluded from the exploratory factor analysis, in order to obtain a factor structure reflective of the &#x0201c;pure&#x0201d; treatment components. Three factors were initially requested, as the items were specifically designed to measure three treatment-specific subscales. However, given the position of SSCM as an atheoretical treatment with broad underpinnings found in clinical management and supportive psychotherapy, it was expected that the SSCM items may load across all factors.<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p><p>The item inter-correlation matrix was examined and items that correlated weakly (&#x0003c;0.40) with other items on the same subscale were removed. The remaining items were entered into a Principal Axis Factor analysis with oblique rotation, with three factors requested. The three factors explained 60.1% of the variance, although the third factor was weak (Eigenvalues 6.98, 4.94, and 1.23). The first two factors were clearly representative of the CBT-E and MANTRA subscales. As expected, the four SSCM items tended to cross-load across the first two factors rather than loading strongly on a third factor.</p><p>Examination of the item inter-correlation matrix showed that while the four SSCM items were all highly and positively correlated (average correlation&#x02009;=&#x02009;.56), they were negatively and weakly correlated with the CBT-E and MANTRA items (all&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;36). Therefore it was decided to remove the SSCM items and re-run the factor analysis with a two factor solution requested. Fifty-six percent of the variance was explained, with 8 items loading strongly (&#x0003e;.5) onto the CBT-E factor (eigenvalue 3.28), and nine items loading (&#x0003e;.5) onto the MANTRA factor (eigenvalue 3.28). <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table B1</xref> displays the items, factor loadings, and communalities for the rotated factors.
