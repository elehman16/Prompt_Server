To investigate the underlying mechanisms, we applied computational modeling to behavioral data from an economic game in which 16 pairs of volunteers (randomly assigned to &#x0201c;player&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;adviser&#x0201d; roles) interacted. The player performed a probabilistic reinforcement learning task, receiving information about a binary lottery from a visual pie chart. The adviser, who received more predictive information, issued an additional recommendation. Critically, the game was structured such that the adviser's incentives to provide helpful or misleading information varied in time. Using a meta-Bayesian modeling framework, we found that the players' behavior was best explained by the deployment of hierarchical learning: they inferred upon the volatility of the advisers' intentions in order to optimize their predictions about the validity of their advice. Beyond learning, volatility estimates also affected the trial-by-trial variability of decisions: participants were more likely to rely on their estimates of advice accuracy for making choices when they believed that the adviser's intentions were presently stable. Finally, our model of the players' inference predicted the players' interpersonal reactivity index (IRI) scores, explicit ratings of the advisers' helpfulness and the advisers' self-reports on their chosen strategy. Overall, our results suggest that humans (i) employ hierarchical generative models to infer on the changing intentions of others, (ii) use volatility estimates to inform decision-making in social interactions, and (iii) integrate estimates of advice accuracy with non-social sources of information. The Bayesian framework presented here can quantify individual differences in these mechanisms from simple behavioral readouts and may prove useful in future clinical studies of maladaptive social cognition.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>The ability to decode another person's intentions is a critical component of social interactions. This is particularly important when we have to make decisions based on someone else's advice. Our research proposes that this complex cognitive skill (social learning) can be translated into a mathematical model, which prescribes a mechanism for mentally simulating another person's intentions. This study demonstrates that this process can be parsimoniously described as the deployment of hierarchical learning. In other words, participants learn about two quantities: the intentions of the person they interact with and the veracity of the recommendations they offer. As participants become more and more confident about their representation of the other's intentions, they make decisions more in accordance with the advice they receive. Importantly, our modeling framework captures individual differences in the social learning process: The estimated &#x0201c;learning fingerprint&#x0201d; can predict other aspects of participants' behavior, such as their perspective-taking abilities and their explicit ratings of the adviser's level of trustworthiness. The present modeling approach can be further applied in the context of psychiatry to identify maladaptive learning processes in disorders where social learning processes are particularly impaired, such as schizophrenia.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>We would like to acknowledge support by the Marie Curie International Fellowship and the UZH Forschungskredit awarded to AOD and the Ren&#x000e9; and Susanne Braginsky Foundation (KES).

This inferential process becomes even more crucial when we need to rely on other people's advice regarding a course of action. Credibility can be inferred from another's reputation, which is in turn developed through recursive social interactions <xref rid="pcbi.1003810-KingCasas1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1003810-Yoshida1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. But since advice is motivated by unknown goals, which may also change in time, we are constantly challenged by the question of how accurately we represent others' intentions.</p><p>As agents' intentions are hidden from observers, they have to be inferred from their actions. The monitoring of other agents' intentions represents a particular aspect of &#x0201c;theory of mind&#x0201d; <xref rid="pcbi.1003810-Amodio1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1003810-Keysers1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Different cognitive frameworks for understanding this process have been suggested, e.g. action understanding vs. mentalizing (attribution of mental states) <xref rid="pcbi.1003810-Canessa1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1003810-VanOverwalle1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Bayesian models in particular provide a formal account of how observers build models of other agents and use them to predict their desires or intentions. One important approach is to formulate social cognition in terms of a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) that describes the relations between environmental states (accessible to the observer) and another agent's (unobservable) mental states <xref rid="pcbi.1003810-Baker1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1003810-Ullman1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. This conceptualization, however, tends to be normative and does not usually emphasize individual variability in social inference. Another framework proposes that theory of mind can be understood in terms of recursive thinking, and focuses on identifying the depth of reasoning that leads to optimal inference <xref rid="pcbi.1003810-Yoshida1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1003810-Devaine1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1003810-Xiang1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Importantly, so far both types of approaches have been applied to situations where the other agents' intentions are stable over time.</p><p>In the present study we build on these previous computational treatments of how humans infer on the intentions of others by considering the additional challenge of detecting how quickly they change in time, i.e. volatility. To this end, we propose novel generative models of how humans may infer on volatile intentions of others and apply these models to behavioral data from a new experimental paradigm. The models we employ are conceptually similar to previous POMDP models, but emphasize individual approximations to Bayes-optimality, as described below.</p><p>Specifically, we addressed the following two questions by comparing the explanatory power of alternative computational models that were fitted to the observed behavior: (i) Are humans able to deploy hierarchically structured learning during social interactions and simultaneously predict the accuracy of advice and the stability of the adviser's intentions? (ii) Would humans rely more on social advice (with potentially high information but also unknown degree of uncertainty) or on non-social information that is potentially less accurate but had a known outcome distribution (i.e., risk)?</p><p>To address these questions, we designed an interactive and deception-free economic game that involved situations of both aligned and conflicting interests between participants (all male) who were randomly assigned to a &#x0201c;player&#x0201d; or an &#x0201c;adviser&#x0201d; role. In this social exchange paradigm, which builds on a previous task by Behrens et al. (2008), participants received distinct information about the probability of two possible outcomes. The player had to predict the outcome of a binary lottery whose true probability distribution was displayed as a pie chart. The adviser issued an additional recommendation (advice) to the player. The information available to the adviser was still probabilistic, but with a larger and constant probability (80%) as it was generated after the outcome had been drawn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003810-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="pcbi-1003810-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003810.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Experimental paradigm.</title><p>Sixteen pairs of healthy male volunteers randomly assigned to the &#x0201c;adviser&#x0201d; role (A) or the &#x0201c;player&#x0201d; role (B) interacted in an economic game. The player had to predict the outcome of a binary lottery for which the odds were shown as a pie chart (cue). The player saw a progress bar, which increased with every correct prediction (and decreased with every incorrect/missed prediction). If the player reached the silver range, he received an extra bonus of CHF 10 (Swiss Francs); if he reached gold, he received an extra CHF 20. The adviser, however, received more information about the outcome (constant probability of 80%), and based on this information, advised the player on which option to choose. Critically, the adviser's motivation to provide valid or misleading information varied across the game. In addition to the player's progress bar, the adviser was shown his own gold and silver ranges (which the player did not see). If the player's score landed within the adviser's silver range at the end of the game, the adviser received an extra CHF 10; if the player's score landed in the adviser's golden range, the adviser earned an extra CHF 20. Importantly, before the experiment the player was informed (truthfully) that the adviser had his own undisclosed incentives and that his intentions might change during the game.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1003810.g001"/></fig><p>Importantly, the adviser's payment was structured such that his incentive to provide valid or misleading advice varied during the game and introduced temporal variations in aligned and conflicting interests between player and adviser. This required the player to detect changes in the adviser's intentions and adapt his own decision-making accordingly. It is not clear, however, what exact mechanism underlies adaptive behavior in this scenario: would players only track trial-wise changes in advice accuracy, or would they invoke a more complex hierarchical model, which also assumes that players track the volatility of the advisers' intentions (see <xref rid="pcbi.1003810-Behrens1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>)? Furthermore, even if the latter was the case, would volatility estimates only serve to optimize inference and learning, or would they directly impact on trial-by-trial variability of decisions?</p><p>To address these questions, we considered different explanations (hypotheses) for the behavior displayed by our participants, each of which was formalized as a two-component model. The first component of each model represented the player's belief updating about the causes of the advisor's behavior; we refer to this component as the &#x0201c;perceptual model&#x0201d;. The second component is the &#x0201c;response model&#x0201d;, which maps the current belief to the player's actual decision (see <xref rid="pcbi.1003810-Daunizeau1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1003810-Daunizeau2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>). We constructed a factorially-structured set of 12 different models (model space) by systematically combining different perceptual and response models (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003810-g002">Figure 2</xref>), as described in detail in the Methods section. We then fitted these models to the trial-by-trial responses of each subject using Bayesian model inversion and formally compared the plausibility of all 12 models by random effects Bayesian model selection (BMS). Altogether, this corresponds to a &#x0201c;meta-Bayesian&#x0201d; approach <xref rid="pcbi.1003810-Daunizeau1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, i.e., a Bayesian treatment of Bayesian models of cognition, also known as a &#x0201c;doubly Bayesian&#x0201d; <xref rid="pcbi.1003810-Huszr1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> or &#x0201c;ecumenical Bayes&#x0201d; <xref rid="pcbi.1003810-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> approach. This enabled us to identify a hierarchical generative model, which may underlie social inference in our paradigm, and whose parameter estimates predicted independent behavioral data, such as explicit ratings of the players, self-reports on strategy used by the advisers and questionnaire scores.</p><fig id="pcbi-1003810-g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003810.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Hierarchical structure of the model space: Perceptual models, response models, specific models.</title><p>The models considered in this study have a 3&#x000d7;2&#x000d7;2 factorial structure and can be displayed as a tree. The leaves at the bottom represent individual models of social learning in which both social and non-social sources of information are considered. The nodes at the first level represent the perceptual model families (three-level HGF, reduced two-level HGF, and RW). Two response models were formalized under the HGF model: decision noise in the mapping of beliefs to decisions either (1) depended dynamically on the estimated volatility of the adviser's intentions (&#x0201c;Volatility&#x0201d; model) or (2) was a fixed entity over trials (&#x0201c;Decision noise&#x0201d; model). At the third level, the response model parameters can be divided further according to the weight of social versus non-social information &#x02013; these models propose that participants' beliefs are based on (1) both cue and advice information and (2) advice only.

(2008), we developed a deception-free and interactive economic game for monetary rewards. This paradigm involved pairs of volunteers (randomly assigned to a &#x0201c;player&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;adviser&#x0201d; role) who met each other for the first time on the day of the experiment. The player had to perform a standard probabilistic reinforcement learning task and was provided with truthful information about the <italic>a priori</italic> probabilities of trial-wise outcomes by a visual pie chart. The outcome was either green or blue, and all trials contained one of 6 cue types (blue:green pie charts: 75&#x02236;25, 65&#x02236;35, 55&#x02236;45, 45&#x02236;55, 35&#x02236;65, and 25&#x02236;75) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003810-g001">Figure 1a</xref>). The adviser, however, received more accurate information: once the outcome was determined (according to the probabilities of the visual pie chart), he was informed about the result with a constant accuracy of 80%. Based on this information, the adviser issued a recommendation to the player on which option to choose. To signal his suggestion, the adviser held up a blue or a green card (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003810-g001">Figure 1b</xref>); these recommendations were recorded, using a video camera, for use as stimuli in future experiments. Throughout the experiment, both the player and the adviser sat across from each other and were not allowed to interact in any other way than the adviser holding up a card to indicate his suggestion.</p><p>Notably, as detailed below, the adviser's pay-off was structured such that his motivation to provide valid or misleading information varied across the game. The player therefore needed to learn about the time-varying intentions of the adviser in order to decide whether to trust him or not on any given trial. In addition to computational modeling of trial-wise choices, we obtained an explicit readout of the player's estimates by requiring him, on 8 out of the total of 200 trials, to characterize the advisers' intentions as &#x0201c;helpful&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;misleading&#x0201d;, or &#x0201c;uninformative&#x0201d;. The timing of these questions and the order of the options was randomized, but they were presented at the same times across subjects.</p><p>The player's final payment was proportional to his total score, plus a potential bonus if his score ended in a predefined silver or gold range (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003810-g001">Figure 1</xref>). He could track the accuracy of his predictions by monitoring a progress bar at the bottom of the screen, which increased with every correct prediction and decreased with every missed or incorrect response by 1 point. By reaching the silver or the gold target, he could win CHF 10 or CHF 20, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003810-g001">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003810-t001">Table 1</xref>).

Critically, the targets of the player and the adviser were arranged to create situations of shared and conflicting interests: the gold range of the adviser preceded the silver target of the player, and the silver range of the adviser also ended before the onset of the gold target of the player (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003810-g001">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003810-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>A typical interaction between the two participants during this game unfolded in the following manner (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003810-g001">Figure 1</xref>): the adviser initially had an incentive to assist the player until the latter reached the adviser's gold range. Once the players' score was within the adviser's gold range, the advisers' incentive to provide misleading advice increased. Once the player recognized this hidden change in intention and either ignored the advice or decided to bet on the opposite color, the player's progress bar was likely to exceed the adviser's gold range. Consequently, if the adviser was unable to confine the player to his (the adviser's) gold range, the next-best strategy for the adviser was to help the player with correct advice again and aim to push him into his (the adviser's) silver range. Once the player reached the adviser's silver range, the adviser had an additional incentive to mislead the player again to prevent the player from moving out of his (the adviser's) silver range.</p><p>To distinguish general inference processes under volatility from inference specific to intentionality, each pair of participants also performed a control task. To exclude temporal order effects, the sequence of the two tasks was counterbalanced across participants. In the control task, the adviser was blindfolded and issued his recommendation by picking a card from 6 separate decks placed before him by the experimenter. The blindfolding removed any intentionality by preventing that the adviser could influence what advice he was giving the player; furthermore, the adviser was unable to witness trial outcomes. The predictive accuracy of the six decks of cards was either 80% or 20%. The players were informed in advance that the card decks varied in their predictive accuracy, but not what the probabilities were nor that they were constant per each deck. However, the players could observe from which deck the card was sampled. This control condition thus closely corresponded to the main task, except for the role of intentionality: the player was required to track advice accuracy under volatility (induced by the adviser blindly switching between decks with different accuracy) and had to make trial-wise decisions how to combine the veridical information from the visual pie chart with the more informative (but volatile) advice.</p><p>Both tasks included 192 trials (plus the 8 rating trials) with an equal number of 6 cue target types (75&#x02236;25, 65&#x02236;35, 55&#x02236;45, 45&#x02236;55, 35&#x02236;65, and 25&#x02236;75 blue: green pie charts). The trial outcome was randomly drawn from these probability distributions.

As mentioned above, the form of these update equations is similar to those of RW learning, providing a Bayesian perspective on reinforcement learning theory <xref rid="pcbi.1003810-Preuschoff1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Under our scheme, the general structure of these belief updates can be summarized as:<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003810.e086"><graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1003810.e086.jpg" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/><label>(8)</label></disp-formula>
</p><p>This structure is reflected by <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003810.e078">Eq. 6</xref>.</p><p>A key difference to the RW model is that the HGF uses a dynamic learning rate that is represented as a ratio of precision estimates, where at any hierarchical level <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1003810.e087.jpg"/></inline-formula>, the numerator represents the (likelihood) precision of the prediction at the level below <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1003810.e088.jpg"/></inline-formula>, while the denominator contains the precision of the current belief, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1003810.e089.jpg"/></inline-formula>. What follows from this expression is that prediction errors are given a larger weight (and thus belief updates are more pronounced) when the precision of the data (input from the lower level) is high or when the precision of the prior belief is low.

We defined the priors based on the experimental design and pilot data. For parameters that were strictly bounded between 0 and 1, we chose the prior mean to be 0.5. For real-valued parameters, we chose prior means that represented values under which an ideal Bayesian agent would experience the least surprise about its sensory inputs (see the functions tapas_fitModel.m and tapas_bayes_optimal_binary_config.m in the HGF toolbox). The priors were chosen to be relatively uninformative (with large variances) to allow for substantial individual differences in learning and advice weighting.</p><p>In the HGF models, we also estimated participants' initial beliefs about the advice accuracy and the adviser's volatility, as well as their uncertainty about these two quantities. Parameters and states are estimated in spaces where they are unbounded. For example, parameters confined to the [0,1] interval are log-transformed and thus also estimated in an unbounded space. Given the priors over parameters and the input sequence, maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) estimates of model parameters were calculated using the HGF toolbox version 2.1.

We combined three alternative perceptual models with four potential response models, constituting a total of 12 models, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1003810.e115.jpg"/></inline-formula>, which are described in more detail below.</p><p>Although the assumptions of hierarchically coupled-learning were well founded, we also considered that participants' decisions could be explained by simpler non-hierarchical models. To examine this hypothesis, we included two model classes, which were both non-hierarchical. The first was a simplified version of the HGF (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1003810.e116.jpg"/></inline-formula>), in which the volatility at the third level was fixed to its prior mean and did not evolve over time (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003810-t002">Table 2</xref> for the prior values used). This model assumed that participants ignored the instructions that the advisers' intentions might change in time, expecting negligible changes in log-volatility at the third level. The second model class was the classical RW model (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1003810.e117.jpg"/></inline-formula>), which assumed a fixed learning rate.</p><p>Concerning the response models, the key question was whether participants integrated social and non-social sources of information or relied exclusively on one of the two sources of information. Herein, we included two (reduced) response models, which proposed that participants considered either the advice alone or the cue alone when predicting the outcome. The first model was defined by setting <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1003810.e118.jpg"/></inline-formula> to 1 (see <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003810.e120">Eq. (15)</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003810-t002">Table 2</xref>), whereas the second only included the displayed winning probabilities with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1003810.e119.jpg"/></inline-formula> fixed to 0 (see <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003810.e121">Eq.

</p><p>Notice that the latter response model is not coupled to any of the perceptual models, because it suggests that participants do not learn about the validity of the advice and intentions of the adviser: on the contrary, they base their decisions only on the displayed winning probabilities.</p><p>Furthermore, we assessed two potential mechanisms of belief-to-response mapping (see <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003810.e110">Eq. 14</xref>), by including models which either assumed that (i) participants responded in accordance to their belief about advice accuracy but tainted by decision noise (&#x0201c;Decision noise&#x0201d; model family for models <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1003810.e122.jpg"/></inline-formula>), or that (ii) participants' decisions were based on their estimates of the volatility of the adviser's intentions (&#x0201c;Volatility&#x0201d; model family for models <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1003810.e123.jpg"/></inline-formula>).</p><p>The &#x0201c;Decision noise&#x0201d; model refers to parameter <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1003810.e124.jpg"/></inline-formula> in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003810.e110">Eq. (14)</xref>, which represents the inverse of the decision temperature: as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1003810.e125.jpg"/></inline-formula>, the sigmoid function becomes steeper, approaching a step function (no decision noise) at <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1003810.e126.jpg"/></inline-formula>. By contrast, the &#x0201c;Volatility&#x0201d; model family contains a time varying mapping of beliefs onto decisions. In this model set, the decision temperature parameter <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1003810.e127.jpg"/></inline-formula> varies with the estimate of adviser volatility or <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1003810.e128.jpg"/></inline-formula>. Hence, as the estimated volatility of the adviser's intentions decreases, the sigmoid function becomes steeper. This predicts that on trials when the player infers that the adviser's intentions are stable, he responds in accordance to his beliefs. As the volatility increases, the player becomes more uncertain of the adviser's intentions, and thus behaves in a more exploratory manner, resulting in a noisier mapping of belief-to-response probabilities. It is important to note that the mapping of beliefs onto actions is updated trial-wise, unlike in the case of the &#x0201c;Decision noise&#x0201d; response models, in which the link from beliefs to decisions is determined by a fixed, subject-specific parameter <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1003810.e129.jpg"/></inline-formula>.

<xref rid="pcbi.1003810-MacKay1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. The model evidence is the integral of the log-joint over the entire parameter space, which cannot be evaluated analytically. However, one can approximate the log model evidence with a lower-bound, the so-called (negative) free energy <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1003810.e132.jpg"/></inline-formula>.</p><p>Alternative models can then be compared via the ratio of their respective evidences, i.e. their Bayes factor or equivalently, the difference in their log-evidences. At the group level, a group Bayes factor (GBF) can be computed by multiplying Bayes factors across subjects. The disadvantage of this procedure, however, is that it rests on the fixed-effects assumption that all participants' data are generated by the same model and variation is simply due to measurement noise <xref rid="pcbi.1003810-Stephan1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. This is not appropriate for our paradigm, as it emphasizes individual differences in social learning (e.g., by letting advisers choose their own strategy). This requires a random-effects BMS approach, where the model becomes a random variable in the population.</p><p>The random-effects BMS approach we use here rests on a hierarchical scheme introduced by Stephan et al. (2009), which estimates the parameters <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1003810.e133.jpg"/></inline-formula> of a Dirichlet distribution of the probabilities <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1003810.e134.jpg"/></inline-formula> of all models considered; in turn, these probabilities inform a multinomial distribution over model space. This makes it straightforward to compute the posterior probability that a given model generated the data for any randomly selected participant, relative to all other models considered (for details see <xref rid="pcbi.1003810-Stephan1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>). Similarly, one can compute the &#x0201c;exceedance probability&#x0201d; that a particular model is more likely than any other model in the comparison set. In other words, the exceedance probability represents the amount of evidence that, in the population studied, a given model is more frequent than the others.</p><p>In case no model really stands out as a &#x0201c;winner&#x0201d; (i.e., no high exceedance probability), we can partition the model space, pool evidence over subsets of models that share a common feature (e.g., with and without a hierarchical level) and thus compare model subspaces or families, instead of single models (see <xref rid="pcbi.1003810-Penny1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref> for details). This idea is essentially similar to factorial experimental designs in psychology where data from all cells are used to assess the strength of main effects and interactions. It amounts to specifying a partition <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1003810.e135.jpg"/></inline-formula>, which splits the entire model set into <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1003810.e136.jpg"/></inline-formula> subsets (model families). The subset <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1003810.e137.jpg"/></inline-formula> contains all models belonging to family <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1003810.e138.jpg"/></inline-formula> where there are <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1003810.e139.jpg"/></inline-formula> models in the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1003810.e140.jpg"/></inline-formula>
<sup>th</sup> subset. Due to the agglomerative property of the Dirichlet distribution, for any partition of model space into families, it is straightforward to define a new Dirichlet density reflecting this split (see Eq. 18 in <xref rid="pcbi.1003810-Stephan1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>). The family probabilities are then given by:<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003810.e141"><graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1003810.e141.jpg" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/><label>(17)</label></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1003810.e142.jpg"/></inline-formula> is the probability of each family occurring in the population. Exceedance probabilities <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1003810.e143.jpg"/></inline-formula> can then be computed for each family, in the same way as for single models. They correspond to the probability that family <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1003810.e144.jpg"/></inline-formula> is more frequent than any other family (of all <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1003810.e145.jpg"/></inline-formula> families considered), given the data <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1003810.e146.jpg"/></inline-formula> from all subjects:<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003810.e147"><graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1003810.e147.jpg" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/><label>(18)</label></disp-formula>
</p><p>Because the conditional model probabilities <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1003810.e148.jpg"/></inline-formula> sum to one over all models considered, this equation becomes particularly intuitive when model space is split into 2 families:<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003810.e149"><graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1003810.e149.jpg" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/><label>(19)</label></disp-formula>

A standard approach is to use a sigmoidal function (softmax or exponentiated Luce choice rule; see <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003810.e110">Eq. 14</xref>), which conveys decision noise whose amount is fixed across trials.

This suggests that there was a more pronounced coupling between the two learning levels (advice accuracy and adviser volatility) during interactions with advisers whose intentions were changing.</p><p>To demonstrate the interpretability of our model parameter estimates, we asked each player eight times at random points during the game to explicitly rate the advisers as &#x0201c;helpful&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;uninformative&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;misleading&#x0201d;. These ratings were coded such that &#x0201c;helpful&#x0201d; corresponded to a probability of accurate advice of 1, &#x0201c;uninformative&#x0201d; to a probability of 0.5, and &#x0201c;misleading&#x0201d; to a probability of 0. To relate the participants' ratings to the estimates of advice reliability as inferred from the model, we used each player's ratings as the outcome variable in a general linear model with the explanatory variable being the prediction about the advice reliability (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1003810.e215.jpg"/></inline-formula>. This proved to be highly significant (t&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;5.92, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1003810.e216.jpg"/></inline-formula>) in a second level random effects regression analysis (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003810.s004">Figure S4</xref>). In brief, the state estimates of our model correspond well to the players' overtly expressed beliefs about the adviser's intentions during the game. Notably, the same analysis using the value of the advice as estimated by the RW model did not yield significant results (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1003810.e217.jpg"/></inline-formula>).

Upon debriefing, they reported that they aimed for the silver range from the beginning, as they deemed it fair for both participants to reach the silver target. The players who interacted with this subset of advisers perceived their intentions to be stable over time and weighted the advice more, as indexed by larger <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1003810.e262.jpg"/></inline-formula> values (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003810-g006">Figure 6d</xref>). An example of such a player is given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003810-g007">Figure 7a</xref> (subject SL_010), where the trajectory of estimated advice reliability <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1003810.e238.jpg"/></inline-formula> indicates that this player's estimate of advice accuracy stayed close to 90% throughout the game. For this subject, the estimate of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1003810.e239.jpg"/></inline-formula> was 0.54, indicating that he relied more on the advice than the non-social cue when making his predictions.</p><p>By contrast, another 3 of the 16 advisers were consistently uninformative, exhibiting an average of only 56%&#x000b1;6.6% advice reliability. Indeed, when they were debriefed, they described that in order to reach the gold range, they attempted to confuse the player from the beginning, preventing his progress bar to increase significantly throughout the game and maximising their own chances to reach gold. This turned out to be a successful strategy, as the advisers who used this strategy were the only ones who reached the gold target. The players who interacted with this subset of advisers showed a very distinct trajectory of learning from those discussed above. First, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1003810.e240.jpg"/></inline-formula> was low in all these players averaging at 0.19, indicating that they (rightfully) assigned little weight to the advice and relied exclusively on the pie chart. A representative subject is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003810-g007">Figure 7b</xref> (subject SL_005), for whom the estimate of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1003810.e241.jpg"/></inline-formula> was 0.12. Furthermore, a high value of meta-volatility <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1003810.e242.jpg"/></inline-formula> indicated that this participant perceived the adviser's intentions as becoming more and more volatile over the course of the interaction. Additionally, high levels of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1003810.e243.jpg"/></inline-formula> indicated fast updating of beliefs about advice correctness over trials and independently of estimates of adviser volatility. Again, this is a sign of adaptive behavior: because the adviser is consistently uninformative (random) in his advice, a high tonic learning rate for updating estimates about advice validity in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1003810.e244.jpg"/></inline-formula> is appropriate. In other words, this scenario describes an agent who perceives the adviser's intentions as stochastic because the advice is uninformative. In this scenario, the participant necessarily performs poorly because he must base his decisions almost exclusively on the non-social cue.</p><p>The largest subset of advisers (9 out of 16) used a strategy, which reflected the change in incentives induced by the payoff scheme: advisers were helpful at the beginning of the game until the players' progress bar reached their gold range. From this point on, advisers began to mislead the players, preventing them from moving beyond the gold range. Once the players detected this change in intentionality, their score began increasing again. This elicited another switch in the advisers' strategy, who now resumed a helpful attitude in order to at least reach the silver range. On average, the recommendations of these advisers were 74%&#x000b1;1.6% accurate. Players who interacted with these advisers exhibited a learning trajectory that reflected the advisers' dynamic incentives (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003810-g007">Figure 7c</xref>). For example, for the representative subject shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003810-g007">Figure 7c</xref> (subject SL_013), <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1003810.e245.jpg"/></inline-formula> steadily reached 0.9 after the first 80 trials, with a concomitant decrease in estimates of the adviser's volatility <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1003810.e246.jpg"/></inline-formula>. Once the adviser's intentions changed, the player updated his beliefs accordingly, as reflected by an increase in the learning rate in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1003810.e247.jpg"/></inline-formula> and larger updates of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1003810.e248.jpg"/></inline-formula>. In this scenario, the player's adaptive behavior takes into account both the volatility of the adviser's intentions and the accuracy of his advice. This is reflected by high values of the estimates for &#x003ba;, <italic>&#x003c9;</italic>, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1003810.e249.jpg"/></inline-formula>.</p><p>Finally, to illustrate the capacity of our model-based approach for characterizing individual differences, we show an unusual subject in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003810-g007">Figure 7d</xref> (subject SL_015). This player did recognize a change in the adviser's intentions halfway through the game but was much slower in updating his estimates of advice accuracy and adviser's volatility than the subject discussed above. This is because his prior beliefs were close to how the adviser actually behaved for the first half of the game and because low estimates of meta-volatility prevented a rapid response to the change in the adviser's intentions. In other words, this participant remained relatively confident about his prior estimate of the adviser's volatility and expected to see little change over the course of the social interaction.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>The question of how we infer on others' intentions is a fundamental computational problem during social transactions. To examine this process, we extended a paradigm introduced by <xref rid="pcbi.1003810-Behrens1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, turning it into an interactive social decision-making game in which each participant was assigned to a &#x0201c;player&#x0201d; or an &#x0201c;adviser&#x0201d; role. Critically, the game was designed to ensure that the adviser's incentives to cooperate or deceive the player varied, thus making his intentions volatile.</p><p>While our paradigm was inspired by the previous work of Behrens and colleagues <xref rid="pcbi.1003810-Behrens1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1003810-Behrens2" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, it introduced two important advances. First, whereas Behrens et al. made subjects believe that the computer-generated advice was provided by a human being, our paradigm used real participants without any deception. This provides ecological validity and eschews potential ethical concerns, which makes the recorded trials from this paradigm more widely applicable, e.g., for future patient studies. Secondly, our paradigm allows for a wide range of interactions between agents, as both the adviser and the player are not restricted to employ specific strategies during their interaction. The player can rely on the binary lottery information (the non-social cue), the advice, or both when selecting his choices. Furthermore, on every trial, the adviser can also choose to provide either helpful or misleading advice, depending on whatever strategy he may be employing; in turn, these differences in strategy across advisers elicit differences in the adaptive behavior of the players.</p><p>To explain the ensuing variability in adaptive behavior across subjects, we modeled the players' learning using a systematic set of alternative models that factorially combined different models of learning behavior (&#x0201c;perceptual models&#x0201d;) and decision-making (&#x0201c;response models&#x0201d;). Using Bayesian model selection, we demonstrated that a hierarchical Bayesian model (the hierarchical Gaussian filter, HGF) with three levels best described the players' learning in the task. This suggests that participants updated their beliefs about advice reliability depending on an ongoing estimate of the volatility of the adviser's intentions, and that this estimate of volatility directly informed the trial-wise decisions. This three-level HGF outperformed simpler non-hierarchical models (such as Rescorla-Wagner), indicating that during social exchanges, participants employ a multilevel model of their environment and are capable of learning how others' intentions to be helpful or misleading fluctuate over time. These higher-order expectations are in turn exploited to update trial-by-trial predictions about advice reliability.</p><p>An important contribution of this paper is the translation of a recent Bayesian framework for comparing alternative cognitive models <xref rid="pcbi.1003810-Daunizeau1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1003810-Daunizeau2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1003810-Mathys1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> to the domain of social interactions. The implementation of this framework in the present study, however, has one significant limitation: The present models aimed to explain only the players' learning during the game, and not the advisers'. That is, they neglected the recursive process of perspective-taking (in other words, the player's belief about the adviser's belief about the player's belief etc.), which occurs in many social situations. Recent studies (see <xref rid="pcbi.1003810-Yoshida1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1003810-Devaine1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1003810-Xiang1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1003810-Yoshida2" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>) used recursive theory-of-mind models to explain social inference in cooperative or multi-round trust games. These models propose that the expected value of a given action (e.g., to cooperate or to compete and to choose equitable or unfair offers) is a function of the other agent's strategy. Thus, players optimize their strategies or their depth of recursive reasoning by taking into account their opponents' future actions. For example, Yoshida and colleagues (2010a) showed that players who employ higher-order strategies, which take into account the opponents' future actions, forgo immediate rewards for options that lead to higher pay-off but require multi-player cooperation.</p><p>One important future direction of our work is to extend the modeling of hierarchically coupled beliefs to take the depth of recursive perspective-taking into account. Having said this, the recursive depth of social inferences is typically limited <xref rid="pcbi.1003810-Yoshida1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1003810-Xiang1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. For example, Xiang et al. (2012) classified the depth of subjects' reasoning during an investor-trustee game. Approximately half of 195 investors were classified as strategic level 0 players, suggesting that they do not simulate their partner's play, while the other half employed either level 1 or level 2 depth-of-reasoning. Yoshida et al., 2010a also reported significant variability in recursive depth across individuals. In the present study, as described in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Results</xref> section, more than half (9/16) of the advisers reported to have adopted a fixed strategy (either consistently helpful or consistently random throughout the game) and are thus unlikely to have engaged in recursive perspective-taking. For the remaining advisers, it is possible that modeling their belief updating processes (in addition to those of the players) would lead to an even better prediction of the players' behavior. We will test this possibility in future work, contrasting models with and without the representation of recursive interactions.</p><p>As it did not incorporate recursive perspective-taking, our study focused on modeling the downstream consequences of the differential strategies that advisers employed. The players' belief-updating process reflected the advisers' policy and determined how much they were willing to take the advisers' suggestions into account during decision-making. We found that players who interacted with consistently helpful advisers perceived their intentions to be stable over time and thus weighted their advice more when predicting the outcome, as reflected by reduced values in the meta-volatility parameter <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1003810.e250.jpg"/></inline-formula> and larger <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1003810.e261.jpg"/></inline-formula> values, respectively. Furthermore, players who interacted with advisers, whose intentions were changing to maximize their own winnings, showed more pronounced <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1003810.e251.jpg"/></inline-formula> values. This result suggests that the two hierarchical learning levels were more strongly coupled in this subset of participants, and that the volatility estimate was used to update the beliefs about advice accuracy. Unlike in the case of consistently misleading advisers, in this particular social exchange, the volatility of the advisers' intentions was more traceable. Thus, players could benefit from inferring on the volatility of the advisers' intentions to predict the advice accuracy.</p><p>Beyond reflecting the adviser's policy in the parameter estimates, our model exhibited construct validity in two ways: First, its posterior parameter estimates predicted participants' scores on the IRI, a questionnaire, which they completed prior to participation in the study. Players, who described themselves as proficient perspective-takers, exhibited a more stable model of the adviser as reflected by the less pronounced tonic component of the learning rate. Second, the model's posterior parameter estimates also predicted the participants' explicit ratings of the advisers' helpfulness throughout the game. Notably, this relationship was specific for the hierarchical Bayesian model while the parameter estimates from the competing RW model did not show this predictive capacity.</p><p>As described above, model comparison indicated that the participants' behavior was best explained by a hierarchical model in which estimates of volatility (of the adviser's intentions) played a key role for belief updating. Furthermore, beyond inference and with respect to the translation of beliefs to decisions, we found that a response model in which participants' estimates of the volatility of the advisers' intentions determined their trial-wise decisions explained participants' choice behavior best. That is, the mapping from beliefs to choices was increasingly deterministic the more the player considered the adviser's intentions to be currently stable. By contrast, when the player's estimates of the adviser's volatility increased, the relation between beliefs and decisions became more stochastic and the player exhibited a more exploratory behavior. This result demonstrates the direct relevance of volatility estimates for determining trial-by-trial variability of decisions; note that this is distinct from (and complementary to) our findings on the role of volatility for learning and inference, described in the context of comparing different perceptual models above. The finding that volatility is an important factor determining trial-by-trial choice variability goes beyond previous studies, which examined the impact of volatility with respect to inference only (e.g., <xref rid="pcbi.1003810-Behrens1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1003810-Mathys1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1003810-Iglesias1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1003810-Behrens3" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>). Moreover, in the context of social learning, these results stress the deployment of a hierarchical model and a key role of volatility estimates for both inference and decision-making. These are important in that they complement concepts of social learning, which emphasize the role of simple heuristics (e.g., <xref rid="pcbi.1003810-Hertwig1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>) or refer to non-hierarchical reinforcement learning (e.g., <xref rid="pcbi.1003810-Biele1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>).</p><p>Similar to what Behrens and colleagues (2008) observed, we found that participants did not base their decision on a single source of information, but integrated the advice with information from the visual pie chart, which was also probabilistic but had a known outcome distribution. That is, the uncertainty of the information provided by the pie chart was directly given on each trial, whereas the uncertainty of the advice had to be estimated online. This can be related, to some degree, to the distinction between risk and ambiguity <xref rid="pcbi.1003810-Charness1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1003810-Ellsberg1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>.</p><p>Our modeling results show that participants were able to trade-off between these different forms of uncertainty depending on the type of adviser they faced (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003810-g006">Figures 6d&#x02013;e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003810-g007">7</xref>): when interacting with generally helpful advisers, most players considered the advice strongly because, on average, it was more accurate than the visual pie chart. However, when they interacted with advisers who deliberately showed consistently uninformative (random) behavior, participants tended to discount their recommendation and relied more strongly on the visual pie chart. This is remarkable since it means that players did not display a uniform tendency to avoid ambiguity; instead, ambiguity aversion was restricted to interactions with an unhelpful adviser.</p><p>Additionally, we found that the different sources of information (cue and advice) did not receive equal weight during decision-making. Consistent with previous findings <xref rid="pcbi.1003810-Soll1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>, we observed that participants relied more on the non-ambiguous information (i.e., the non-social cue) compared to the advice. Previous models <xref rid="pcbi.1003810-Collins1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1003810-VanOverwalle2" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref> describing how people integrate social and non-social sources emphasized the importance of ambiguity that is intrinsic to social exchange: We are uncertain about how uncertain our appraisal of the other agent's intentions is.</p><p>Previous work on uncertainty in repeated advice taking showed that, surprisingly, decision-makers do not become more confident in their choices with increasing advice accuracy <xref rid="pcbi.1003810-Lee2" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. Although we did not explicitly ask subjects to rate confidence or uncertainty, our modeling results did take into account how their inferred estimates of uncertainty (about the adviser's intentions) informed their trial-wise decisions.</p><p>Furthermore, analysis of a control condition in which trial-wise advice was randomly sampled (by a blindfolded adviser) from several decks of cards with either 80% or 20% accuracy suggested that participants relied more on the advice when it was intentional, as opposed to unintentional. This behavior was observed even though it was perfectly possible to extract predictive information from the card decks with the same accuracy as from a helpful adviser. Since players based their decisions more on the visual pie chart and did not take advantage of the advice, their performance was significantly lower than in the social condition.</p><p>Beyond the results per se and their implications for concepts of social learning, the modeling approach in this paper, with its emphasis on inter-individual variability in inference and decision-making, may serve useful for future studies of social learning. To facilitate this, the HGF and the BMS routines are freely available as open source MATLAB code (the HGF can be found at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.translationalneuromodeling.org/tapas">www.translationalneuromodeling.org/tapas</ext-link>; the BMS routines are part of the SPM software package: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm">www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm</ext-link>).</p><p>Finally, we believe that the approach presented here has potential for characterizing mechanisms of maladaptive behavior in individual patients. The present study in healthy volunteers provides a proof of concept how individual mechanisms can be elucidated in the context of social interactions, a domain where many psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, are characterized by particularly salient deficiencies <xref rid="pcbi.1003810-Kishida1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. For example, many patients with schizophrenia exhibit a negative attribution bias about others' intentions, which reflects the finding that negative information is perceived as more diagnostic of another person's true character than positive information <xref rid="pcbi.1003810-Bentall1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1003810-Langdon1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>. One attractive option is to use models as the one described in this study for computational phenotyping of patients from heterogeneous disorders <xref rid="pcbi.1003810-KingCasas2" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1003810-Yoshida3" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>. For example, patients may show a diminished ability to dynamically infer on the intentions of others for different reasons: they may have overly tight prior beliefs about others' motivations, or they may suffer from an abnormality in belief updating mechanisms, which in turn could be due to aberrant computations of prediction error, precision or both (see <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003810.e078">Eq. 6</xref> above). In other words, models of cognition such as the one introduced here and in previous studies may prove useful to propose potential nosological dimensions with mechanistic interpretability and disambiguate alternative mechanisms in individual patients through model selection <xref rid="pcbi.1003810-Stephan2" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>. This study serves as a precursor for future neuroimaging studies, in which we hope to investigate neuronal mechanisms of social learning and tracking the volatility of another agent's intentions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pcbi.1003810.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>The performance of BMS was evaluated and the results are summarized in confusion matrices.
