No statistically significant differences were seen for respiratory distress syndrome, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, severe IVH, preventricular leukemia, perinatal death or mean birth weight. The results for biophysical parameters have been inconsistent,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] but most studies have reported no clinically important differences. The two most serious side effects of corticosteroid therapy are suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and predisposition to infection. Neither has been fully evaluated with specific reference to preterm labor. Nonetheless, the evidence of effects of dexamethasone and betamethasone on maternal indicators of infection is not sufficient to support dexamethasone or betamethasone, so the drug of choice for antenatal corticosteroid therapy is currently a topic of debate.</p><p>In the present trial, we compared the effects of the betamethasone and dexamethasone on maternal white blood cell (WBC) and differential count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), maternal and fetal plasma glucose (PG), Apgar score, and length of gestation in women at risk of preterm birth with or without intact membranes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>A randomized trial was conducted to evaluate the effects of betamethasone and dexamethasone on maternal WBC and differential count, ESR, Apgar score, maternal and fetal PG and length of gestation in women at risk for preterm birth with or without intact membranes.

Women were randomized with a list of computer-generated numbers, and the group assignments were concealed in an opaque sealed envelope until just before entry into the study. The first treatment group received two intramuscular injections of 12 mg betamethasone at 24-h intervals as betamethasone sodium (produced by local pharmaceutical company Exir Pharmaceutical Lab., Tehran, Iran). The second group received four intramuscular injections of 6 mg dexamethasone at 12-h intervals as dexamethasone phosphate (produced by local pharmaceutical company Iranhormone Pharmaceutical Lab., Tehran, Iran).

The dexamethasone treatment increased length of gestation, length of admission to delivery and Apgar score in women at risk for preterm delivery with intact membranes. In the PPROM group, none of the outcomes showed significant differences between the two treatment groups except WBC count, which was slightly higher in the dexamethasone group. No unusual or unexpected safety risks were found with dexamethasone or betamethasone therapy in these pregnant women. The spectrum of most frequent adverse events was similar to that reported in previous research with dexamethasone or betamethasone, which has shown both drugs to be fairly safe.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>]</p><p>Our findings are consistent with those of others[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] who found increases in total WBC count in women who received corticosteroids during pregnancy. Ferguson <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] claimed that the changes in WBC count were related to PTL, and found no additional increase in WBC count in women with PTL who were treated with betamethasone. We found a significant increase in WBC count in women at risk for PTL either with intact membranes or PPROM. Awareness of the possibility of post-corticosteroid leukocytosis is important in order to avoid misinterpreting leukocytosis as a sign of infection in women with PPROM or PTL with intact membranes. In most of our patients, WBC count and ESR returned to baseline on day three following betamethasone or dexamethasone treatment. Therefore, we suggest that if WBC count or ESR remains elevated beyond day three, the women should be monitored carefully for other signs of infection.</p><p>ESR is a limited blood test during pregnancy because it is variably affected by physiologic changes in fibrinogen and erythrocyte count occurring often in pregnancy. Although it is specific for infection, it has low sensitivity (65%) when normal results were considered as ESR &#x0003c;60 mm/h.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] ESR is not affected by dexamethasone or betamethasone administration. However, it remains to be elucidated whether a day-to-day change in ESR can be a sensitive predictor of chorioamnionitis.</p><p>In the present study, dexamethasone prolonged the average duration of pregnancy compared to betamethasone in women with preterm delivery with intact membranes, but not in women with PPROM. Similar increases in length of gestation after dexamethasone treatment have been reported in other studies, but these differences failed to reach statistical significance because of the limited statistical power.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>] The longer treatment period for dexamethasone might to some extent explain the higher gestational age at birth found in dexamethasone group. The finding of an increase in mean duration of pregnancy in our dexamethasone group warrants further investigation.</p><p>We found that the mean duration of stay in the NICU was reduced in the dexamethasone group, but this difference was not statistically significant. In contrast, one trial, which included 105 infants, found that significantly more infants were admitted to the NICU in the dexamethasone group compared to the betamethasone group.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>] The finding of a nonsignificant reduction in the duration of stay in the NICU for infants born to women in the dexamethasone group who were at risk for preterm delivery and had intact membranes warrants further investigation in a larger sample.</p><p>Another finding that requires elaboration is the higher 1- and 5-min Apgar score in our dexamethasone treatment group. No statistically significant differences between neonates exposed to betamethasone or dexamethasone were seen for Apgar score at 5 min in one trial,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>] or in 5-min Apgar scores less than 7 in other two trials.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>] Further studies are needed to solve this issue.</p><p>The mechanisms by which corticosteroids might predispose to infection are not clear. Several studies have shown little or no increase in the incidence of infection among corticosteroid treated patients compared with control.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>]</p><p>The mechanisms that may account for the more favorable pregnancy outcomes after dexamethasone treatment compared to betamethasone also are not clear. Both, corticosteroids are similar in their binding with blood proteins, half-life in the maternal circulation, metabolic clearance and placental crossing. The chemical composition of betamethasone and dexamethasone is virtually identical except for the configuration of a methyl group in position 16.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>] Therefore, the physiological basis for the difference in their effect on pregnancy outcomes remains an enigma. One possible explanation is the preservative used with dexamethasone but not with betamethasone. The dexamethasone regimen may lead to a lower peak level but a longer time to biological activity, and more rapid passage through the blood-brain barrier, compared to the betamethasone regimen.</p><p>This trial could draw criticism because of the un-blind design and the short follow-up. Albeit the value of the double blind, controlled trial is widely recognized, this design is not always appropriate or indicated. Because of the different injection frequency and treatment period of dexamethasone and betamethasone, it would have been impossible to keep patients blinded in a study of this nature. Similarly, the treating physicians dealing with clinical and laboratory adverse events can easily become un-blinded. However, Schultz and co-workers reported that, to avoid bias in clinical trials, careful randomization is more important than a double-blind design.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref>] Trials with inadequate randomization yield an assessment of treatment effects exaggerated by 30&#x02013;41% when compared with trials that use adequate concealment of treatment allocation. By contrast, trials without double blinding yield an assessment of treatment effects exaggerated, on average, by only 17% compared with double-blinded trials. In this study, selection bias was controlled for by randomization, with concealed treatment allocation, and observation bias was probably marginal because clinical results were un-blinded analysis. The WBC count and ESR differed between the two treatment groups in women with PPROM. These measures were more favorable in the dexamethasone treatment group, and it could be argued that the slightly higher WBC in this group was related to the higher WBC count at baseline. Another limitation could be small number of women studied for evaluating the impact of such drugs as dexamethasone and betamethasone, but the effect was robust. The present results clearly need to be replicated and extended across multiple centers and investigators in long-term follow-up studies.</p><p>In conclusion, the results showed that dexamethasone increased gestational age at delivery and Apgar score significantly more than betamethasone did in women at risk for PTL with intact membranes. Dexamethasone might therefore be preferred for the induction of lung maturity in women at risk for PTL with intact membranes. However, in women with PPROM the pregnancy outcome measures were similar in our betamethasone and dexamethasone groups.
