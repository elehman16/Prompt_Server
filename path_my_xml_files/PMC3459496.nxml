This matrix protects the microbes by inhibiting the penetration of harmful chemicals and antibiotics into the biofilm.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] Thus, the only effective way to get rid of plaque is to mechanically disrupt it, a process which has become the mainstay of periodontal therapy.</p><p>But mechanical debridement may have certain limitations. These include difficult to reach areas like root concavities, narrow furcations,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] and other extradental sites which may serve as reservoirs of bacteria leading to early recolonization of tooth surfaces after instrumentation. Thus, adjunctive use of chemotherapeutic agents like antibiotics has been advocated along with mechanical instrumentation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] Among the most widely used agents to treat periodontal disease are the tetracycline group of drugs. These are used both systemically and in the form of local drug delivery agents. Local drug delivery systems have the advantage of avoiding the harmful effects of systemic administration including development of resistant flora, suppression of normal flora, poor patient compliance etc.</p><p>Minocycline is a semisynthetic derivative of tetracycline. For local use, it is available in the form of two drug delivery systems: a gel form and a microencapsulated microsphere form.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] Dentomycin is a bioabsorbable system which contains 2% minocycline HCl in a matrix of hydroxyl-ethyl cellulose, aminoalkyl methacrylate, triacetine and glycerine in the form of a gel. Magnesium chloride is added to modify the drug release properties. It is categorized as a sustained release system and the drug concentration decreases exponentially following a first order kinetics. The drug is delivered into the pocket with the help of a polypropylene applicator and provides high drug concentration, subgingivally, for 24 hrs. A meta-analysis published in 2005 showed improvement in clinical parameters including attachment level with adjunctive minocycline use along with mechanical therapy when compared to mechanical therapy alone.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>]</p><p>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the long term efficacy of a 2% minocycline gel as an adjunct to scaling and root planing in managing moderate to severe chronic periodontitis.</p><p>Objectives of the study: To evaluate the efficacy of 2% minocycline gel in the treatment of chronic periodontitis by estimating the alterations in bleeding index, probing pocket depth, and clinical attachment level.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Participants</title><p>The participants of this study were chosen from the patients attending the out-patient services of Dept. of Periodontia, M. R. Ambedkar Dental College, Bangalore. Patients suffering from moderate to severe chronic periodontitis, without any other medical or smoking history and not hypersensitive to minocycline were included in the study. Pregnant ladies, lactating mothers, patients on antibiotics, anti-inflammatory, and steroid therapy within last three months were excluded from the trial. Written informed consents were taken from patients after explaining the protocol of the study. </p><p>Moderate chronic periodontitis was defined as an attachment loss of 4mm on atleast two teeth and severe chronic periodontitis was defined as attachment loss of &#x0003e;5 mm on atleast two teeth. The study used a split mouth design, contralateral sites with deep pockets in similar teeth were chosen and randomly assigned to control or test groups using a coin-flip method.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Interventions</title><p>In the first visit, patients received full mouth supragingival scaling and were recalled after a week when baseline parameters were recorded. This was followed by subgingival scaling and root planing and placement of minocycline gel in The test sites as seen in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>. After root planning, the sites were thoroughly dried to get rid of blood and debris. The applicator tip was gently advanced to the deepest point of the pocket till resistance was felt and the gel was expelled by gently pressing the plunger till some material overflowed. The sites were then covered with a thin layer of cynoacrylate glue to restrict the effect of drug to the particular site. Control sites received only subgingival scaling and Root planning as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>. Patients were advised to postpone brushing for 12 hr period. Gel application was repeated at two and four weeks after scaling and root planing in test sites, according to the manufacturers&#x02019; instructions (three to four applications, once in every 15 days).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Root planing at test site</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JISP-16-179-g001"/></fig><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Placement of minocycline gel at the test site</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JISP-16-179-g002"/></fig><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Root planing at control site</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JISP-16-179-g003"/></fig></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Outcomes</title><p>Clinical parameters evaluated were probing depth, relative attachment level, and bleeding index.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] In addition, the overall plaque index[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] was also measured. Readings were taken at baseline, 3, 6, and 9 months. Probing depth and relative attachment level was measured with the help of an endodontic spreader, An acrylic stent as seen in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] and a vernier caliper to standardize measurements and take readings as precisely as possible. Apart from the clinical parameters, microbiological evaluation of subgingival plaque samples was done using a dark field microscope. At recall visits, only supragingival scaling was done, in orders to avoid contamination of subgingival plaque by the supragingival plaque. Subgingival plaque was collected using a sterile after-five curet. The sample was mixed with two to three drops of saline, and immediately taken to lab for assessment of different morphotypes of bacteria. The number of cocci, motile and non-motile rods, branching filaments, and small, medium and large spirochetes were assessed.</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Measuring the relative attachment level with plastic stent and endodontic spreader at test site</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JISP-16-179-g004"/></fig><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Measuring the relative attachment level at the control site</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JISP-16-179-g005"/></fig></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The unit of measurement in this study was the site, rather than the subject.

Mechanical debridement is effective in both disturbing the biofilm and reducing the bacterial load. However, sometimes mechanical instrumentation may not be sufficient to control the disease due to tissue invasive pathogens, or other tooth related anatomic factors. In such conditions, adjunctive use of a chemotherapeutic agent provides an additional benefit in controlling the disease.</p><p>The systemic use of antibiotics along with mechanotherapy dramatically improves clinical results,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] but at the same time is not free from its inherent adverse effects and disadvantages. To overcome these undesirable effects, several local drug delivery systems have been developed. Local delivery of antibiotics into the pocket achieves a greater concentration of the drug locally, proving bactericidal for most periopathogens, and at the same time, exhibits negligible impact on the microflora residing in other parts of the body.</p><p>Minocycline is a semisynthetic derivative of tetracycline which is more active and has a wider spectrum of action. Systemic administration of minocycline adjunctive to mechanical debridement in the management of chronic periodontitis has been reported.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] Minocycline is also available as a local drug delivery system. Our study evaluated the efficacy of a 2% minocycline gel in a sustained release drug delivery system in the management of moderate to severe chronic periodontitis.</p><p>The results of this investigation demonstrated an overall improvement in all parameters at various time intervals both in test and control groups [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>]. The overall bleeding index score improved from baseline to three months and this improvement was maintained till the end of the study period. Our results are similar to another study by Graca <italic>et al</italic>. who also used minocycline gel, however, their observations were limited to 6 and 12 weeks, post-treatment.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] Pocket depth is an important variable and has an impact on the type of subgingival flora and the treatment outcome. Our study demonstrated significant reductions in probing depths in both groups from baseline to three months. At the end of six and nine months, probing depth values in the test group were significantly lower than those in control group. Graca <italic>et al</italic>. also observed marked reductions in probing depth in both groups from baseline to 6 and 12 weeks, but unlike our study, their results did not show significant difference between the test and control groups.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] The important point to be noticed in these observations is that their study lasted for 12 weeks, whereas ours lasted for 9 months. Relative attachment levels also showed significant improvement in both test and control groups from baseline to three and six months. But between groups, the values did not reach statistical significance at any time. This maybe because chronic periodontitis is a chronic disease which progresses in an episodic manner and the rate of progression of disease is very slow, so a 9-month period may not be sufficient to record noticeable differences in attachment loss. Our results are in accordance with a recent meta-analysis published in 2005, which found a marginal improvement in attachment level with adjunctive use of minocycline as compared to SRP alone which did not reach statistical significance.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>]</p><p>A new dimension was added to this investigation by microbiological examination of bacterial morphotypes using dark-field microscopy. It was thought appropriate to evaluate the effect of minocycline gel on subgingival microbial population, the primary etiological factor for periodontitis. Our results demonstrated a marked reduction in total number of organisms in both test and control groups from baseline to three months. A significant reduction was seen in the number of spirochetes, cocci, and motile bacilli at three months in both the groups. Between treatment groups, no significant differences were observed with respect to different morphotypes except at nine months when control group showed significantly higher number of non-motile bacilli as compared to test group. This maybe a chance finding, due to small sample size of our study or maybe attributed to the re-growth of plaque over time.</p><p>The overall view of results of our investigation cast a shadow of uncertainity on the efficacy and efficiency of 2% minocycline containing gel as an effective local drug delivery system, and it calls for further clinical trials to objectively evaluate the adjunctive use of locally delivered minocycline in periodontal therapy.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Darveau</surname><given-names>P.R.</given-names></name><name><surname>Tanner</surname><given-names>A.</given-names></name><name><surname>Page</surname><given-names>R.C.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The microbial challenge in periodontitis</article-title><source>Periodontol</source><year>2000</year><volume>1997</volume><issue>14</issue><fpage>12</fpage><lpage>32</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Loos</surname><given-names>B.</given-names></name><name><surname>Nylund</surname><given-names>K.</given-names></name><name><surname>Claffey</surname><given-names>N.</given-names></name><name><surname>Egelberg</surname><given-names>J.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Clinical effects of root debridement in molar and non-molar teeth.
