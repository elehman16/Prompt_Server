In this regard, numerous studies have surveyed the colonic microbiota to determine its relationship to the host and how perturbations of it affect or are affected by diseases such as antibiotic associated colitis, inflammatory bowel disease, pouchitis, and obesity <xref rid="pone.0032545-Ott1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0032545-Young1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. While these studies have provided a wealth of information, almost all studies of the mucosal-associated gut microbiota have sampled the colonic microbiota of the cleansed (purged) bowel following laxation, which is routinely used to prepare the colon for colonoscopic examination. Few of these studies have taken into consideration the potential confounding effect of bowel cleansing preparation on the gut microbiota that could bias results and provide misleading or artifactual information regarding the natural state of the colonic microbiota.</p><p>Mai and colleagues <xref rid="pone.0032545-Mai1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> were the first to address the effect of bowel preparation and colonoscopy on the intestinal microbiota. These investigators examined changes in the fecal microbiota in five individuals undergoing screening colonoscopy. In three of the five subjects, the microbial profiles by denaturing gradient gel electophoresis (DGGE) were different in stool samples collected after colonoscopy compared to stool collected prior to colonoscopy. This observation suggested that bowel preparations have a significant effect on the luminal (fecal) gut bacteria.</p><p>It is now recognized that the gut microbiota is a unique ecosystem consisting of numerous microbial populations working together to carry out important physiological functions. Microbial species present in the colon lumen and adherent to the colonic mucosa are most often considered for studies of the human gut microbiota <xref rid="pone.0032545-Eckburg1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. The luminal microbiota fluctuate with changes in diet and luminal content, whereas the mucosa-associated microbiota is believed to be relatively stable in individuals over the course of a lifetime <xref rid="pone.0032545-Zoetendal1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Stability is achieved in part through the ability of these microbes to attach to the mucosa and establish a niche through formation of biofilms and creation of selection pressures that prevent expansion of other microbial communities. From their intimate and stable association with the host, mucosa-associated microbes are likely to contribute important influences on host physiology in health and the development of disease <xref rid="pone.0032545-Backhed1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Therefore, proper sampling of mucosal-associated microbial communities, in their natural state, is essential for better understanding of the enteric microbiota and host-microbial relationships in health and disease. For this study, we tested the hypothesis that standard colonic lavage affects the natural state of mucosal-associated microbes in the human colon.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Human subjects and ethics statement</title><p>Twelve healthy individuals between the ages of 25&#x02013;48 years were recruited at the University of Chicago Medical Center for this study.

The second phase was designed to control for external factors (such as time and diet) which might alter the microbiota. In the second phase, seven healthy individuals were randomly assigned into three groups. All subjects underwent an un-prepped flexible sigmoidoscopy with mucosal biopsies (pre-prep). In order to minimize any potential variation of enteric microbial communities over time, a second flexible sigmoidoscopy was performed in all subjects within 1 week. In the first sub-group, three subjects were given a 24-hour clear liquid diet and a standard polyethylene glycol-based bowel cleansing preparation prior to the second sigmoidoscopy (post-prep). In the second sub-group, two subjects underwent a second un-prepped flexible sigmoidoscopy and were instructed to make no changes to their diet prior to the second sigmoidoscopy. In the third group another two subjects underwent a second un-prepped flexible sigmoidoscopy and were instructed to follow a clear liquid diet for 24 hours prior to the second sigmoidoscopy.

Potential chimeric sequences were identified and excluded using the SimRank 2.7 package available through the RDP and Pintail. The RDP Classifier (available via RDP-II) was used to assign 16S rRNA sequences to the taxonomical hierarchy at different levels. The program DOTUR, utilizing the furthest neighbor algorithm, was used to group sequences into operational taxonomical units (OTUs) and perform a variety of diversity analyses. OTUs were defined in this study as sequences with greater than 97&#x00025; similarity. The Chao1 richness estimator adapted from mark-release-recapture statistics was used to estimate the total number of OTUs within each sample. For principal coordinate analysis (PCA), all 16S rRNA gene sequences were imported into the ARB software package and aligned into a phylogenetic tree by Neighbour Joining which was used to perform clustering analysis using online UniFrac without abundance weighting <xref rid="pone.0032545-Ludwig1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0032545-Lozupone1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. A p-test was performed in UniFrac to determine whether each sample was significantly different from others. All sequences will be deposited in the GenBank nucleotide sequence databases under the accession numbers JN609650 - JN612805.

In four out of five subjects, microbial communities from biopsies collected before bowel preparation separated from communities from biopsies taken after bowel preparation. To further quantify the differences of bacterial populations between samples, the number of distinct terminal restriction fragments of the bacterial communities was used to calculate the Shannon diversity index.

After quality control and sequence assembly, 3158 clones yielded approximately 650 base pairs of partial 16S rRNA gene sequences that were used for analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0032545.s003">Table S1</xref>). 16S rRNA gene sequences were assigned into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) or phylotypes at a similarity cutoff value of 97&#x00025; using the DOTUR program. Rarefaction curves were used to compare the observed richness of OTUs between samples collected from the first and second flexible sigmoidoscopies in both control and experimental groups. In the experimental group, there was a separation between the two rarefaction curves.

The majority of organisms in all samples were classified into two phyla Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, which is consistent with other studies using biopsies from prepped human colon. Organisms from the phyla Proteobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, Fusobacteria, Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria, and Deferribacteres were minor populations in these samples. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0032545-g006">Figure 6</xref>, bowel preparation did not significantly change the phylogenetic structure at the phylum level. However, at the genus level, changes were more prominent between samples from prepped and un-prepped colons but not in the control samples (p&#x0003c;0.05 in the experimental group using classification tool in RDP, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0032545.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Despite significant variations of mucosa-associated microbiota among individuals, we did not find consistent changes in microbiota as a result of bowel preparation. For example, <italic>Blautia</italic> was decreased by bowel preparation in subjects 1 and 2, but not changed in subject 3. <italic>Butyricicoccus</italic> was decreased in subjects 1 and 3, but not detected in subject 2. However, <italic>Mucispirillum</italic>, a group of bacteria present in low abundance in the un-prepped colon, consistently disappeared completely after bowel preparation in all three subjects.</p><fig id="pone-0032545-g006" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0032545.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>16S rRNA gene clone library sequence analysis of microbial communities in samples.</title><p>Relative bacterial composition in mucosal sample from all three groups is shown at the phylum level. 16S rRNA gene sequences are grouped into different phyla using the RDP classifier tool at a default confidence threshold.

Despite these advances, many challenges remain. Among these challenges, include obtaining undistorted and representative samples from the human gut. While many researchers have suspected that colonic lavage distorts the enteric microbiota, there are many challenges in obtaining samples from an un-prepped colon. Our study demonstrates that colonic lavage may distort both the diversity and structure of the enteric microbiota and these findings question the reliability of sampling by luminal fluid aspiration and mucosal biopsy after colonic lavage.</p><p>We observed a reduction in overall diversity after colonic lavage in the mucosal samples obtained from three of the five subjects in the first phase of our study. Microbial diversity appeared to increase after colonic lavage in the other two subjects. This observed increase in diversity in the latter two subjects likely accounts for the similar Shannon diversity scores in the prepped and un-prepped samples. These initial observations prompted us to repeat our study and include control groups to determine if there are normal fluctuations in an individual's colonic microbiota and to determine if a clear liquid diet alone alters the enteric microbiota. In the second phase of our study, we shortened the time interval between flexible sigmoidoscopies to minimize any potential fluctuations in an individual's colonic microbiota over time. In order to achieve greater resolution than that achieved with T-RFLP analysis, 16S rRNA gene clone library and sequencing analysis were performed on samples collected from subjects enrolled in the second phase of the study. There was a decrease in richness and microbial structure similarity after colonic lavage. These changes were not observed in the two control groups, confirming that the trend towards a decrease in microbial diversity observed in patients taking a bowel prep is not due to clear liquid diet alone or normal fluctuations in the colonic microbiota.</p><p>Although our sample size is small, it appears that colonic lavage does affect the enteric microbiota, albeit this effect is not consistent among individuals. The variation in response to colonic lavage observed in our study may be attributable to large differences between individual's enteric microbiota, effectiveness and completeness of colonic lavage, and inter-individual differences in factors that may influence the enteric microbiota such as diet, medications, and lifestyle.</p><p>Previous studies of the human microbiota demonstrated a modest diversity of colonic microorganisms relative to other microbial communities, 62&#x00025; of which appeared to be unique based on 16S rRNA gene sequence <xref rid="pone.0032545-RajilicStojanovic1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. In the study by Eckburg and colleagues, the fecal microbiota was significantly different from the mucosa-associated microbiota in all three subjects <xref rid="pone.0032545-Eckburg1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. The differences among mucosal samples from proximal to distal colon were not readily apparent, although a few subtle differences were noted. Overall diversity appeared to be similar. These results are somewhat surprising in light of the differences in properties and function of the proximal and distal colon <xref rid="pone.0032545-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0032545-Hu1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. These regional differences might be expected to define &#x0201c;assembly rules&#x0201d; that would participate in selection and niche stability of certain microbial species <xref rid="pone.0032545-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Our group characterized the structure of the colonic mucosal-associated microbiota and the metagenomic profiles of the microbiota in the various regions of the colon in a healthy individual who underwent an un-prepped colonoscopy. We noted significant regional differences of the colonic microbiota <xref rid="pone.0032545-Hu1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. We also noted axial variation of the microbiota; the microbial communities adherent to the mucosal surface differed from those in the lumen of the colon. Two recently published mouse studies have described differences in the community structure and diversity of the mucosal-associated microbiota present in the proximal murine colon compared to the distal murine colon <xref rid="pone.0032545-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0032545-Hu1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Based on the observations of these recent studies, we believe that the findings of Eckburg et al. may be the result of dilutional skewing and reduction of diversity introduced by colonic lavage. The vigorous actions of the lavage solution appear not only to affect overlying mucosa-associated microbes, but might also affect the integrity and abundance of overlying mucus of the colonic epithelium. Histological analysis of the colons of mice lavaged with polyethylene glycol solution have shown a dramatic loss of mucosal-associated microbes and a destruction of the associated biofilm, (L. Lichtenstein, Y. Wang, E. B. Chang, unpublished observation. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0032545.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Alteration of mucus can dramatically affect the diversity and structure of associated microbial ecosystems that depend on it for attachment, stability, and nutrient source. It should however be noted that the mucosa-associated communities are not as distinct in the human distal colon compared to the mouse colon.</p><p>Our study demonstrates a variable treatment effect of colonic lavage on the mucosa-associated enteric microbiota independent of the clear liquid diet or normal variation of the enteric microbiota with time. Based on our findings, we believe that future studies of the enteric microbiota should take into consideration the confounding effects of colonic lavage. Studies that had previously acquired microbiota samples under these circumstances may have to be revisited under less perturbing conditions. We recommend that future investigations of the human enteric microbiota include un-prepped subjects in whom the natural state of the colonic microbiota can be preserved and observed. Acquisition of left sided colon samples should not be a major problem, but obtaining right side colonic samples will be more technically demanding; potentially requiring conscious sedation and increasing risk and duration of colonoscopic procedures. Nonetheless, in the hands of an experienced endoscopist, full colonoscopy in un-prepped individuals is feasible. Our group has an 80&#x00025; success rate reaching the cecum in un-prepped patients.</p><p>In summary, we report that the routine practice of colonic lavage may significantly alter the mucosa-associated microbiota of the distal human colon. While the effects are obvious in some individuals, the effects of colonic lavage can be unpredictable. Given that colonic lavage has the potential to distort the enteric microbiota, we recommend that future studies of the human enteric microbiota be performed on the un-prepped colon where the natural state of both luminal and mucosa-associated microbiota is most likely to be retained.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0032545.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Relative abundance of bacterial genus in all samples.
