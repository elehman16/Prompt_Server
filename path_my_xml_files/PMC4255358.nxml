We report on barriers unique to 2-yr institutions that preclude the success of an early course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE). Using a randomized study design, we evaluated a CURE in equivalent introductory biology courses at a 4-yr institution and a 2-yr institution within the same geographic region. We found that these student populations developed dramatically different impressions of the experience. Students at the 4-yr institution enjoyed the CURE significantly more than the traditional labs. However, students at the 2-yr institution enjoyed the traditional labs significantly more, even though the CURE successfully produced targeted learning gains. On the basis of course evaluations, we enhanced instructor, student, and support staff training and reevaluated this CURE at a different campus of the same 2-yr institution. This time, the students reported that they enjoyed the research experience significantly more than the traditional labs. We conclude that early research experiences can succeed at 2-yr institutions, provided that a comprehensive implementation strategy targeting instructor, student, and support staff training is in place.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>December 1, 2014</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Early undergraduate research experiences fuel interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) careers and pursuit of postgraduate education (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Russell <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, 2012</xref>) and decrease attrition of minority, first-generation, and low-income students (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Nagda <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Ishiyama, 2001</xref>). Widespread adaptation of this educational practice must occur in all undergraduate institutions (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">American Association for the Advancement of Science [AAAS], 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Alberts, 2013</xref>). However, STEM-related educational transformations can be challenging (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Henderson <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Brownell and Tanner, 2012</xref>). This is especially true for 2-yr institutions (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Cejda and Hensel, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Packard, 2011</xref>), which enroll &#x0223c;50% of America's college student population (<xref rid="B58a" ref-type="bibr">Wei and Berkner, 2009</xref>) and represent 50% of all undergraduate students of color and more than 40% of those students living in poverty (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">American Association of Community Colleges, 2012</xref>). Hence, innovations targeting traditionally underserved populations must engage 2-yr institutions to be maximally effective.</p><p>While a few 2-yr institutions have successfully integrated research experiences using the student&#x02013;faculty mentorship model common in 4-yr institutions (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Cejda and Hensel, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B59a" ref-type="bibr">Wei and Woodin, 2011</xref>), this strategy can neither expand nor thrive without substantial physical and structural reorganization of 2-yr institutions (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Cejda and Hensel, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Fletcher and Carter, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Packard, 2011</xref>). An alternative strategy for integrating early research experiences is to replace the traditional lab exercises found in introductory courses with research experiences that can provide benefits similar to the mentorship model (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Healey and Jenkins, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Lopatto, 2009</xref>). While there is evidence indicating that course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) correlate with student gains in knowledge and enjoyment in 2-yr institutions (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Lunsford, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B59a" ref-type="bibr">Wei and Woodin, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Beagley, 2013</xref>), very few institutions have successfully implemented CUREs. Perceived barriers of transformation at 2-yr institutions include heavier teaching responsibilities, resource and financial limitations, and higher representation of students who are at greater risk of failure (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Horn and Nevill, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Fischer, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Bueschel and Venezia, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Jaschik, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Keller, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Spell <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). To address these barriers at 2-yr institutions, we developed and implemented a 6-wk research experience: Soakin&#x02019; Up the Rays with <italic>S. pombe</italic> (SUR). During SUR, students perform a yeast UV-mutagenesis screen and isolate DNA damage response (DDR) mutants and assign them to sensor, transducer, or effector branches of this signal transduction pathway. In doing so, students may discover mutations in early DDR processes (e.g., Rad22<sup>Rad52</sup> relocalization; <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Meister <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2003</xref>) that advance understanding of this important tumor-suppressor pathway (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Ciccia and Elledge, 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>The SUR Research Module</title><p>During the SUR research experience, students perform a yeast UV-mutagenesis screen in search of DDR genes that support genome maintenance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). During part 1, students use UV radiation to randomly mutate the <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> haploid genome. During parts 2 through 4, they use replica plating to screen for mutations in DDR genes and bioinformatics to identify potential gene candidates. They finish with parts 5 and 6, using bright-field and fluorescence microscopy to position their mutants within the DDR signal transduction pathway. Throughout the module, students collect, graph, and evaluate data and may discover mutations that lead to novel insight regarding genome maintenance pathways in eukaryotes. After each lab session, students perform assignments that allow them to apply the introduced concepts and techniques in a different context.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>An overview of the SUR research experience.

(A&#x02013;C) Selection of HU-sensitive mutants. (A) UV mutagenesis. Cells expressing Rad22-GFP were plated onto complete medium and irradiated with UV (left is negative control). (B) Mutant screen. UV-irradiated colonies were replica plated onto medium with and without HU. The arrow shows a potential mutant that grew on media without HU but not on media with HU. The pink indicator dye (phloxine B) helps to identify dead cells, which fail to export the dye and become dark red as a result. (C) Mutant verification. Potential mutants were patched to medium with and without HU. In this class, eight of these mutants were confirmed to be HU-sensitive mutants. The arrow points to one of these eight mutants that failed to grow on HU and stained dark red. (D&#x02013;F) Students identify checkpoint and DNA repair mutants. (D) Checkpoint mutants divide in the presence of HU. A wild-type (<italic>rad22-gfp</italic>) and mutant strain were grown in complete medium before adding HU for 5 h. This is a checkpoint mutant because it fails to elongate during HU treatment. Repair mutants elongate like wild-type in the presence of HU (images not shown). (E) Students measure cell length. The students graph these measurements (in centimeters) and use the data to conclude whether the mutant is checkpoint or repair deficient. (F) Students graph cell length data. Mutant 6 is a checkpoint mutant that failed to elongate in HU, and mutant 2 is a repair mutant that elongated like wild-type in HU. (G&#x02013;I) Rad22-GFP relocalization is not affected in this mutant. (G) Untreated <italic>rad22-gfp</italic> cells have one or two nuclei and lack Rad22-GFP foci. (H) HU-treated <italic>rad22-gfp</italic> cells are long, arrest with one nucleus, and have bright Rad22-GFP foci. (I) This is a checkpoint mutant, because it divided in the presence of HU and produced daughter cells without DNA (arrows). The mutation in this strain does not affect activities upstream of Rad22, because Rad22-GFP foci formed normally during HU treatment.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="724fig2"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Student Populations and Institutions</title><p>The University of Colorado Colorado Springs (UCCS) is a public 4-yr institution with &#x0223c;10,000 students. The Department of Biology has more than 660 majors with 10 full-time, tenure-track faculty members and 3.5 full-time instructors. Data collected from the biology senior survey administered in Fall 2009 indicate that the demographics of biology majors reflect the UCCS student population as a whole, with 19.5% minorities (Hispanic, Native American, or African American), 37.2% first generation, and 63% receiving external financial assistance to pay for college. More than 40% of new undergraduates at UCCS were transfer students, and biology was the most commonly declared major among these students. In 2010, the freshman retention rate (i.e., percentage of first-year students who return for the next academic year) among declared biology majors was 63%, which is slightly lower than the overall UCCS freshman retention rate (67%).</p><p>Pikes Peak Community College (PPCC) is the largest postsecondary educational institution in Colorado Springs and offers more than 125 programs of study in the liberal arts and sciences and areas of career and technical training. It encompasses four different campuses located in the Colorado Springs region: Centennial, Rampart, Downtown Studio, and Falcon. In Fall 2009, a total of 13,095 students were enrolled (&#x0223c;40% full-time). PPCC has a large underrepresented student population composed of 23% racial/ethnic minorities (Native American, Hispanic, or African American), 45% first generation, 44% low income, and 4% disabled. In total (unduplicated counts), 63% of the student population is eligible for special assistance programs that serve first-generation, low-income, or disabled students. Among all 2-yr institutions in Colorado, PPCC ranks second with respect to the number of students that transfer to 4-yr institutions. UCCS is the top choice of transfer schools for PPCC students. Among the 703 students who transferred to 4-yr colleges from PPCC in 2009, approximately two-thirds went to UCCS.</p></sec><sec><title>Course Descriptions</title><p>The SUR research experience was integrated into the laboratory component of General Biology II: Introduction to the Cell (BIOL 1210) at UCCS and General College Biology I with Lab (BIO 111) at PPCC. The state of Colorado has a guaranteed transfer program for approved lower-division community college courses to all public 4-yr institutions, which is known as gtPATHWAYS. The introductory-level biology laboratory course at PPCC (BIO 111) is part of this transfer agreement, which allows PPCC BIO 111 students to receive credit for the UCCS introductory-level biology laboratory course (BIOL 1210). The motivation to implement this CURE evolved from a few interested faculty members at both institutions. These faculty members had support from their department chairs, yet neither chair was the driving force for this curricular transformation.</p><p>At the 4-yr institution, this is a four-credit course that consists of two 1.25-h lecture sessions and one 2.5-h laboratory session per week for the entire semester. This course is required for biology majors, who generally take it during freshman year. Approximately 65% of enrolled students are declared biology majors, and the remaining 35% include chemistry, health sciences, and non&#x02013;science majors. Approximately 150&#x02013;200 students enroll in this course during the Spring semester, with typically eight to 10 sections of lab being offered. Each lab section is taught by one instructor and can accommodate 24 students. There are multiple lecture and lab sections taught by different instructors, so students generally do not have the same instructor for both lecture and lab, and students in the same lab are not necessarily enrolled in the same lecture section.</p><p>At the 2-yr institution, more than 22 lecture sections of BIO 111 are offered across the four different PPCC campuses during an academic year, with a total enrollment of &#x0223c;900 students per year. For each lecture section, students enroll in one of the two corresponding lab sections. A lab section is taught by one instructor and can accommodate 24 students. For this study, we implemented the research experience at the Centennial Campus during Fall 2012&#x02013;2013 and at the Rampart Campus during Spring 2012&#x02013;2013. The curricula and requirements are consistent across the different campuses. BIO 111 is a 4-credit course that consists of two 1.83-h lecture sessions and one 1.83-h laboratory session per week for the semester. It is a gatekeeper course, meaning that students must pass this course in order to pursue additional biology course work.</p></sec><sec><title>Study Design</title><p>During the implementation stage, biology instructors without prior SUR-related experience were trained to perform the SUR experiments and were then assigned to teach one experimental and one comparison section (Supplemental Figure S1). The SUR research experience was integrated into a subset of lab sections at both the 4-yr (Spring 2011&#x02013;2012) and 2-yr institutions (Fall and Spring 2012&#x02013;2013). Unaware of the different section formats, students enrolled into laboratory sections that were randomly assigned to the traditional format (comparison section) or the SUR format (experimental section). Students had to commit to a laboratory section by the second week of the semester, and they were not allowed to switch sections after this point. All students (comparison and experimental groups) attended similar lecture sections.

(<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Morgan and Carter, 2011</xref>). Students in the experimental sections performed nine of these 11 traditional labs (they did not perform traditional lab 4 [Enzymes] or lab 8 [Mitosis and Meiosis]) in addition to the 6-wk SUR research experience (Figure S2). The information required to understand the SUR experience was not aligned with lecture material, so the experimental sections received prelaboratory lectures that introduced topics relevant to the SUR module.</p><p>Briefly, labs 1 and 2 of the comparison and experimental sections were the same (Cells and Organelles, Biological Molecules). After completing a shortened version of lab 3 (Osmosis and Diffusion), students in the experimental sections were introduced to the concept of genome integrity by connecting it to the carcinogenic effects of UV light. During lab 4, students in the experimental sections performed the first experiment of SUR (SUR part 1), while students in the comparison sections performed the traditional Enzymes lab. During labs 5&#x02013;7, students in the experimental sections performed SUR parts 2&#x02013;4 in addition to condensed versions of traditional lab exercises (Paper Reading, Fermentation and Respiration, Photosynthesis). During lab 8, students in the experimental sections only performed SUR part 5, while students in the traditional sections performed the Mitosis/Meiosis lab. The remaining traditional labs 9&#x02013;11 were performed in both the experimental and comparison sections (Molecular Biology, Bacterial Transformation, Mendelian Genetics). In summary, the experimental sections performed the same traditional labs as the comparison sections at the beginning and end of the semester. To accommodate the research experience, students in the experimental sections did not perform Enzymes (lab 4) and Mitosis/Meiosis (lab 8) and performed shortened versions for four of the traditional labs. Pre&#x02013;post knowledge and perception assessments were administered to all sections and were given before lab 1 (Cells and Organelles) and after lab 11 (Mendelian Genetics).</p><p>At the 2-yr institution, the SUR research experience was first implemented on one campus of the 2-yr institution during Fall 2012 and at a different campus during Spring 2013. At both campuses, the SUR labs of experimental sections completely replaced the corresponding traditional labs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Two-year students in the experimental sections therefore did not perform seven traditional labs (Diffusion and Osmosis, Enzymes and Spectrophotometry, Cellular Respiration, Photosynthesis, Mitosis and Meiosis, Mendelian Genetics, DNA and Genetic Transformation). The overall format of the module was similar to that of the 4-yr institution, with the following exceptions: 1) a bioinformatics unit was added to the SUR research experience, and 2) an additional microscopy lab was included (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Based on the assessment results from Fall 2012, a revised implementation strategy was evaluated during the Spring 2013 semester at a different campus (see <italic>Results</italic> section and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">5</xref>).</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>The laboratory and assessment schedule for the 2-yr institution (Spring 2013).

Two pre&#x02013;post knowledge assessments were administered at the beginning and end of the semester. The SUR knowledge assessment was a 10-question multiple-choice survey designed by us to assess understanding of the material taught in the SUR research experience (e.g., cell cycle, mutation, cancer, green fluorescent protein; Figure S3). The second knowledge assessment was a validated 24-question multiple-choice tool called the Introductory Molecular &#x00026; Cell Biology Assessment (IMCA), which we used to assess a broader understanding of the fundamental topics covered during the lecture portion of a typical introductory biology course (e.g., chemical composition of cells, enzymes and chemical reactions, metabolism, cell structure, mutation and natural selection, DNA replication and transcription; <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Shi <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). Paired <italic>t</italic> tests were used to assess significant pre&#x02013;post knowledge gains for both assessments within experimental and comparison sections separately, and two sample <italic>t</italic> tests were used to compare differences between the experimental and comparison groups. Significance was based on two-sided tests at &#x003b1; = 0.05.</p><p>Perception of enjoyment was measured after lab 11 using a Likert-item survey designed by us, in which students rated each weekly lab activity with respect to 1) how well the lab helped them understand course concepts and 2) how much they enjoyed the lab (Figure S4).</p><p>At the 4-yr institution, students in the experimental sections performed both SUR parts 2 and 4 and shortened versions of the corresponding traditional labs (Paper Reading, Fermentation and Respiration, Photosynthesis) and rated each separately. SUR parts 2&#x02013;4 were shorter labs that were conceptually similar (replica plating in search of DDR mutants), so these three were evaluated as one activity. Microscopy was performed during SUR part 5. During the weeks when experimental sections did both traditional and SUR research labs, students rated these activities separately. Likert-item ratings at the 4-yr institution were assigned as follows: 1 = strongly disagree, 2 = disagree, 3 = neutral, 4 = agree, 5 = strongly agree. Wilcoxon rank-sum tests (two-sided tests at &#x003b1; = 0.05) were used to determine significant differences between the experimental and comparison groups when comparing Likert item ratings for the individual coinciding labs (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Lovelace and Brickman, 2013</xref>). To account for lab-to-lab variability, we computed an overall average of each student's mean rating and compared: 1) the same non-SUR labs completed by the experimental and comparison groups and 2) the SUR labs for the experimental sections and the traditional labs for both the experimental and comparison groups. Because Likert-item ratings were combined to compute each student's average, we used parametric methods to compare the overall averages. Specifically, two-sample <italic>t</italic> tests were used to determine significant differences between the experimental and comparison groups, and paired <italic>t</italic> tests were used to determine significant differences within the experimental group (two-sided tests at &#x003b1; = 0.05). Nonparametric tests were also conducted and provided similar results (unpublished data).</p><p>Likert-item ratings were adjusted to allow 2-yr students to indicate nonparticipation in a particular lab activity, because attendance in this course is historically problematic (L. Hollis-Brown, personal communication). Our automated scoring system is limited to five responses per question, so the response options for 2-yr students were modified as follows: &#x0201c;did not participate,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;disagree,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;neutral,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;agree,&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;strongly agree.&#x0201d; Numerical values (1&#x02013;5 for the 4-yr institution and 1&#x02013;4 for the 2-yr institution) were assigned to the ordinal responses in order to provide summary measures (means) for these data. The &#x0201c;did not participate&#x0201d; responses were excluded from the analysis. Because the 4-yr and 2-yr data have different scales, cross-institutional comparisons were not made.</p><p>To account for lab-to-lab variability, we computed an overall average of each student's mean rating and made the following comparisons: 1) the same non-SUR labs completed by the experimental and comparison sections, 2) the SUR labs for the experimental group and the coinciding traditional labs for the comparison group, 3) the SUR labs and non-SUR labs among experimental group, and 4) the traditional labs that do and do not coincide with the SUR labs among comparison group. Because Likert-item ratings were combined to compute each student's average, we used parametric methods to compare the overall averages (two-sided tests at &#x003b1; = 0.05). For 1 and 2, two-sample <italic>t</italic> tests were used to determine significant differences between the experimental and comparison group. For 3 and 4, paired <italic>t</italic> tests were used to determine significant differences within the experimental or comparison group. Nonparametric tests were also conducted and provided similar results (unpublished data).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Four-Year Institution</title><p>At the 4-yr institution, basic academic demographics and performance on both knowledge pretests were similar between groups (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05), indicating that the randomization strategy produced comparable experimental and comparison groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Tables 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>).

The first implementation strategy (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>) was used to train two experienced introductory biology instructors who both taught one of each format (experimental and comparison). Again, basic academic demographics (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1B</xref>) and performance on both knowledge pretests were similar between the comparison and experimental groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05), indicating that our randomization strategy was successful.</p><p>Similar to what we observed at the 4-yr institution, the experience produced significant gains in targeted knowledge at the 2-yr institution without compromising comprehension of the fundamental concepts taught during lecture (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>). In addition, the IMCA results showed that these learning gains did not compromise comprehension of the fundamental concepts taught during lecture (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>).</p><p>Enjoyment was rated similarly among the experimental and comparison groups for the six traditional labs that were common to both groups during the first half of the semester (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05 for all individual lab comparisons based on the Wilcoxon rank-sum test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>).

During the second half of the semester, the coinciding traditional lab activities were ranked significantly higher than the weekly SUR research activities, with the exception of SUR part 4 versus the Mitosis lab (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 for all individual lab comparisons based on the Wilcoxon rank-sum test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>).

Furthermore, students within the experimental sections rated the SUR labs lower than the first six traditional labs by a nearly significant level (2.77 vs. 2.95, respectively, <italic>p</italic> = 0.06). <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref> includes a sample of qualitative student statements.

In response, we revised our original implementation strategy to specifically include additional educational resources for students, instructors, and lab support coordinators (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>).</p><p>The following semester, this revised implementation strategy was used to integrate the SUR experience into the same course at a different campus of this 2-yr institution. Again, two novice instructors both taught one experimental and one comparison section. Basic academic characteristics were similar between students at both campuses of the 2-yr institution (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1B</xref>). Significant gains on both the SUR knowledge survey and the IMCA were observed for the experimental sections only (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>). However, the IMCA knowledge gains were a result of smaller gains among the comparison group, as opposed to larger gains among the experimental group, and thus cannot be attributed to the SUR research experience.</p><p>As anticipated, enjoyment was rated similarly among the experimental and comparison groups for the six traditional labs conducted by both groups during the first half of the semester (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05 for all individual lab comparisons based on Wilcoxon rank-sum test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). In agreement, there was no significant difference when comparing the overall average of the mean enjoyment ratings for these labs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>; experimental = 2.73 and comparison = 2.96, respectively, <italic>p</italic> = 0.21). However, the overall average of the mean enjoyment ratings for the SUR labs was significantly higher than that of the traditional labs among the experimental group (3.18 vs. 2.73, respectively, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). This difference was not observed in the comparison group, in which the overall average ratings for the first six traditional labs and the traditional labs replaced by SUR were comparable (2.96 vs. 3.03, respectively, <italic>p</italic> = 0.29). <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref> includes a sample of qualitative student statements. These data indicate the students preferred the research experience to the traditional lab exercises. There were no significant differences in enjoyment ratings for the same labs (first six traditional labs) when comparing the first and second implementations (2.95 vs. 2.73, <italic>p</italic> = 0.16 for comparison groups; 3.09 vs. 2.96, <italic>p</italic> = 0.42 for experimental groups). This suggests that instructor differences (e.g., personality, teaching experience, teaching background, effectiveness at teaching biology, etc.) did not account for the observed increase in enjoyment after the second implementation. We conclude that a comprehensive training strategy was essential for the successful integration of a research module into the biology curriculum of a 2-yr campus.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In his final days as editor in chief of <italic>Science</italic>, Bruce Alberts challenged academics to &#x0201c;incorporate active science inquiry into all introductory college science classes&#x0201d; (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Alberts, 2013</xref>), while the 2011 <italic>Vision and Change</italic> report recommended that we begin doing so in biology courses (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">AAAS, 2011</xref>). This call to action is predominantly supported by research-based transformations in select biology courses of 4-yr institutions that accompanied learning and enjoyment gains (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Morcillo <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 1996</xref>; <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">DiBartolomeis and Mone, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Honts, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Myers and Burgess, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Bednarski <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Howard and Miskowski, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Casem, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Halme <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Call <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Sleister, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Casotti <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Hurd, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Lu <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Spiro and Knisely, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Healey and Jenkins, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Marcus and Hughes, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Gardner <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Gasper and Gardner, 2013</xref>). However, these examples are restricted to the 4-yr student population, which comprises less than one-fourth of America's college students (<xref rid="B58a" ref-type="bibr">Wei and Berkner, 2009</xref>). Furthermore, these transformations occurred in exclusive courses serving upper-level or honors students, courses with small student numbers, or institutions with selective admission criteria that do not cater to all students.</p><p>Early research experiences must also be included in the introductory science courses at community colleges, whose graduates qualify for more than half of available STEM jobs (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Rothwell, 2013</xref>) and are essential to our nation's competitiveness in the global STEM economy (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Boggs, 2010</xref>). Unfortunately, change has been less apparent in this educational setting, likely due to barriers including heavier teaching responsibilities, resource and financial limitations, and higher representation of students who are at greater risk of failure (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Horn and Nevill, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Fischer, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Bueschel and Venezia, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Jaschik, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Keller, 2009</xref>). In this study, we attempted to develop a research experience that follows recommendations for successful integration of teaching and research in that it requires minimal technical expertise to perform and is forgiving when students make mistakes (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Kloser <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Fukami, 2013</xref>). This module was integrated into equivalent introductory biology courses at a 4-yr institution and a 2-yr institution using a methodologically sound, randomized-study design (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Crowe and Brakke, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Cejda and Hensel, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Ruiz-Primo <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Pre&#x02013;post knowledge assessment results from the 2-yr institution demonstrate that this CURE effectively transferred the knowledge it targeted (e.g., cell cycle, mutation, cancer, green fluorescent protein; Figure S3) without compromising knowledge of other fundamental biological processes (chemical composition of cells, enzymes, metabolism, cell structure and function) assessed by the IMCA. Similar findings were reported by <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Hester <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic> (2014)</xref>, who integrated quantitative reasoning lessons into experimental sections of an introductory biology course at a research-intensive 4-yr institution. Using pre&#x02013;post assessments, they observed that students in experimental sections answered biologically related mathematical questions more accurately then control sections, while experimental and control sections made comparable gains on fundamental biology items of the IMCA. This shows that replacement of traditional lab material with research-based experiences in introductory biology courses does not negatively impact student learning of fundamental lecture material. Importantly, instructors are supportive of replacing content coverage and breadth with classroom research experiences (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Spell <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2014</xref>).</p><p>With respect to enjoyment, students at the 4-yr institution formed a very favorable opinion of the research experience, while students at the 2-yr institution preferred the traditional labs. Feedback on surveys administered to the 2-yr instructors, students, and support staff reflected a need for additional training during implementation. Student comments reflected discontent with the module due to confusion, which seemed to be at least partially attributed to the disconnect between lecture and lab topics. For example, one student reported that he/she &#x0201c;enjoyed the first portion of labs when we didn&#x02019;t do <italic>S. pombe</italic> because it had nothing to do with the lectures. I feel as if I missed a lot of useful information.&#x0201d; Another student stated: &#x0201c;Those &#x02018;soaking up the sun's rays&#x02019; labs confused me on why we were doing what &#x02026; but the day to day labs I understood and could always follow why it was important or why we were doing &#x02018;this&#x02019; experiment.&#x0201d; One 2-yr instructor suggested &#x0201c;a training lab before the 1st lab so students can become more comfortable using some of the equipment.&#x0201d;</p><p>These comments reflected a need to better prepare these students. Instructor feedback reflected that instructors also desired more preparation. When instructors were asked what would improve their confidence if they were to run this module again, one 2-yr instructor stated: &#x0201c;Increased training if I had to operate the fluorescence microscope by myself.&#x0201d; A 4-yr instructor who observed one of the 2-yr instructors stated: &#x0201c;If we add instructor notes to the PowerPoints so s/he can read them before class s/he would feel more comfortable with the PowerPoints.&#x0201d; A 2-yr faculty member stated: &#x0201c;Lab assistants would have to be very well trained.&#x0201d;</p><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">Table 5</xref> summarizes how we revised the implementation strategy to address these perceived barriers. For example, we added more detailed solutions and commentary to instructor lecture slides and manuals for both students and instructors. A preparatory lab session was also developed and incorporated before lab 1 of the module to allow students to learn basic lab skills and operate equipment, and additional microscopy training sessions were provided to instructors. Specifically, laboratory support coordinators attended a training workshop and were provided with preparative techniques videos and worksheets containing preprogrammed calculations to facilitate accurate media and reagent preparation.</p><table-wrap id="T5" position="float"><label>Table 5.</label><caption><p>Summary of perceived barriers and modifications made with the revised implementation</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead valign="bottom"><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Perceived barrier</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Implementation modification</th></tr></thead><tbody valign="top"><tr><td align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Students</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Disconnect between lecture and lab content</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02022; &#x02002;A prelab was included in experimental sections</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Did not always understand the rationale for each experiment</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02022; &#x02002;Added more detail to the student manual (included suggestions/edits from community college faculty)<sup>a</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02022; &#x02002;Worksheets were graded and factored into the course grade (rather than encompassed into participation points)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Did not feel comfortable using equipment</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02022; &#x02002;Prelab allowed students to spend more time with equipment</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02022; &#x02002;Reduced the number of slides to prepare to allow more time with the fluorescence microscope (labs 5 and 6)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Faculty</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Felt too rushed, particularly during the first and last (microscopy) labs</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02022; &#x02002;Added a prelab before lab 1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02022; &#x02002;Reduced the number of slides to prepare to allow more time with the fluorescence microscope (labs 5 and 6)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Did not feel comfortable with material</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02022; &#x02002;Added more commentary to slides and instructor manual<sup>a</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Required more training with the fluorescence microscope</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02022; &#x02002;Provided an additional 2-h training session with fluorescence microscope</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02022; &#x02002;Developed a microscope &#x0201c;cheat sheet&#x0201d; (Quick Reference: Fluorescence Microscopy in Figure S5) that included step-by-step operating procedures</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Support staff</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Required more training for lab set-up and preparation (faculty members are typically not involved with this)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02022; &#x02002;Provided three 2-h training sessions specifically for laboratory staff</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02022; &#x02002;Developed material-preparation worksheets (SUR Prep Spreadsheet in Figure S6)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02022; &#x02002;Developed a detailed lab-by-lab supply list (SUR Supply List in Figure S7)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02022; &#x02002;Developed preparation videos (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.uccs.edu/biology-educational-resources/labs/sur-techniques-videos.html">www.uccs.edu/biology-educational-resources/labs/sur-techniques-videos.html</ext-link>)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02022; &#x02002;Added more detail to the preparations manual<sup>a</sup></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p><sup>a</sup>Materials available upon request from the corresponding author.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>Using a revised implementation strategy containing these modifications (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">5</xref>), we re-evaluated the experience at another campus of the same 2-yr institution with a different group of instructors and support staff. This time, the students enjoyed the research experience more than the traditional labs. Although it is possible that this difference could be attributed to differences in instruction or the student population, there are several reasons we believe that this is not the case. First, all instructors at the 2-yr institution were experienced community college educators who had previously taught the introductory biology course at this institution but did not have previous experience performing SUR-related experiments. Second, participating students at both 2-yr campuses shared similar academic characteristics; for example, &#x0223c;27% of the students at both campuses were science degree majors (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1B</xref>). Based on campus-level data, the first campus of the 2-yr institution has a higher representation of minority students (36% vs. 22%, respectively; Supplemental Table S1), a group that tends to report the perceived benefits of a research experience more strongly than other groups (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Lopatto, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Russell <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). However, this did not appear to affect the results of this study, because it was the students at the second campus who rated the CURE more favorably. Finally, similar enjoyment ratings were observed for the traditional labs when comparing comparison groups across the semesters (i.e., first vs. second implementation; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5, C and D</xref>).</p><p>We cannot determine whether all or only a subset of the training-related modifications were critical for the observed increase in student enjoyment at the second campus of the 2-yr institution, because we made these modifications simultaneously. We speculate that the need for additional training during implementation could at least be partially attributed to previously described barriers (i.e., heavier teaching responsibilities, resource and financial limitations, and higher representation of students who are at greater risk of failure), although we did not directly evaluate this in our study. Results of a recent national survey administered across institutional types suggest that instructor and lab support staff preparation is not standing in the way of transformation at 2-yr institutions (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Spell <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2014</xref>), although 2-yr faculty members did indicate that underprepared students are barriers to laboratory course improvement. This suggests that successful introductory laboratory course improvements at a 2-yr institution may only require expanded educational resources for students and not for faculty or staff. However, our qualitative data do not support this. Our findings indicate that instructor and lab support staff preparation were also barriers to success for this CURE.</p><p>The goal of attaining widespread adoption of research experiences in STEM education is contingent upon addressing barriers unique to the environments of different educational settings. In this paper, we demonstrate that the integration of a successful research experience in a 2-yr institution can be accomplished with a comprehensive training strategy targeting instructors, lab coordinators/staff, and students.</p><sec><title/><sec><title>Accessing Materials.</title><p>We are happy to share any of the materials we have developed with interested instructors.
