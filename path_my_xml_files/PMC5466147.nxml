The CN-NINM protocol consisted of two stages: first an in-lab training program during which therapists developed subject-specific regimens appropriate to ability levels. In this stage, individuals completed twice-daily training sessions at the study center under the supervision of a CN-NINM certified trainer for two weeks (excluding weekends). The morning and afternoon sessions consisted of 90-minute physical therapy sessions and were separated by a three- to four-hour break. Therapy included: warm-up, balance, gait, motor control exercises, and breathing and awareness techniques (BAT). In addition, participants were asked to perform a BAT session using the PoNS at least one hour before bedtime. Subject exercise programs were reviewed daily during the in-lab training phase.</p><p>Stage 2 was 12 weeks of at-home training where individuals performed the same exercises as those learned during the in-lab phase. During both stages, participants completed three sessions per day: morning, afternoon and evening. Working-Memory retraining employed the COGMED package<sup><xref rid="bibr26-2055217317690561" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> administered on a computer screen.

</p><p>Statistical analyses of behavioral measures were completed with Systat version 23.0 (SPSS Inc). The observed differences between pre- and post-training in both groups were compared using two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with group (active or sham) as the between-subject factor and time (pre-training and post-training) as the repeated measure. The dependent variables were the scores on the neuropsychological tests and the self-report questionnaires (Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)-II, Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Modified Fatigue Scale, MS Impact Scale, and Cognitive Function). DGI and SOT were assessed at baseline and after each two-week interval and these scores were analyzed.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec13-2055217317690561"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec14-2055217317690561"><title>Behavioral measures</title><p>On the MFIS, MSIS-29, and Cognitive Function questionnaires there were no significant changes in either group over time nor were there on the BDI-11 or BAI.

This general improvement could be, at least in part, attributable to practice effects but are more likely the effects of the working-memory retraining in combination with intensive physical therapy.</p><p>We employed COGMED retraining to try to drive neuroplasticity in working-memory-related brain regions. Consistent with our hypothesis, post-PoNS training fMRI showed a significant increase in BOLD signal in the left DLPFC and rACC and a trend for significance in the right, whereas the sham group showed sub-threshold peaks in these regions. Notwithstanding these imaging findings, corresponding improvements in formal testing of working memory were not evidenced between groups.</p><p>For the active group, functional imaging analyses for the Gait Imagery task revealed that baseline and post 14-weeks&#x02019; training showed task-related activations in bilateral premotor and motor regions, and the BOLD signal in the left motor cortex was significantly higher, as we had hypothesized. We had predicted a reduction in the magnitude of activation in the premotor regions, but this was not apparent, though a non-significant reduction in BOLD signal in the right premotor cortex was observed. In the sham group, significant BOLD changes were documented only in the premotor regions, bilaterally. The functional significance of these findings could be related to improved motor output for the active group, especially in light of the fact that the left hemisphere is considered to be more important for skilled motor performance.<sup><xref rid="bibr29-2055217317690561" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> As was the case for working memory, formal tests of motor ability including DGI, pegboards, and movement sequencing did not show differences between groups.</p><p>For exploratory purposes, we compared fMRI BOLD data from the four motor regions of interest (ROIs) to the imaging data of healthy control participants. At baseline, the active group showed task-related activations comparable to that of healthy controls in all ROIs except the left motor cortex. The magnitude of the activation in the latter became comparable to that of the healthy controls after PoNS training, and this is an interesting finding that may indicate causality. The sham group&#x02019;s baseline fMRI showed significantly weaker task-related activations compared to the controls in all ROIs except the left premotor cortex. After PoNS training, activation in the left and right premotor cortex was comparable to that of controls, while activation in the left and right motor cortex remained significantly weaker. We speculate that this could be related to the presence of poor motor skills in the sham group. We went on to compare the fMRI BOLD data from the three prefrontal ROIs to our imaging data from 16 healthy controls in another study on TBI.<sup><xref rid="bibr24-2055217317690561" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> We observed that at baseline, the active group had significantly weaker task-related activations compared to that of these healthy controls in all three prefrontal ROIs. The magnitude of the BOLD signal in all three ROIs became comparable to that of the healthy controls following PoNS training. In contrast, the Sham Group showed significantly weaker task-related activation in all three ROIs at baseline and it remained unchanged following PoNS training.</p><p>On the SOT, we demonstrated an improvement over time following PoNS training for both the active and for the rollover group suggesting that this training can have a positive effect on balance in patients with MS. The improvement that we document in balance associated with PoNS stimulation probably has ramifications for improved and safer locomotion. A major shortcoming of this study is the low number of participants (however, this fact is mitigated by the repeated design) in each group, and the findings suggest the need for a larger study that balances disease duration across groups.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Supplementary material</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="SupplementaryInformation.pdf" orientation="portrait" id="d35e732" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are very appreciative of the effort that the patients put into this pilot study and we are gratified that they felt they benefited.
