The null hypothesis stated that the intermittent application of these two bleaching agents has no effect on surface mercury levels of amalgam restorations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-dent04_p0023">Table 1</xref> shows the particulars of the materials used. Sixty specimens of amalgam (GS-80, SDI- Australia) were prepared. Trituration was carried out by a dental amalgamator (Duomat 2, Degussa, Germany) according to manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. The freshly prepared mix was then condensed vertically and laterally into molds 2 mm deep and 5 mm in diameter with the use of flat-faced round hand condenser. The thickness of each increment was 1 mm to ensure maximum condensation effectiveness. All the steps were carried out by one operator. After burnishing the specimens were left in the mold for 60 minutes for initial setting. Then one surface from each specimen was coated with nail varnish. Subsequently, the specimens were removed from the molds and stored in 37&#x000b0;C distilled water. Forty-eight hours later, the uncoated surfaces of the specimens were smoothed with polishing rubber disks (Polisher, RA Kendu, Liechtenstein) that mounted on a slow-speed contra-angle handpiece under water coolant. Then the specimens were rinsed with 20 ml of distilled water and randomly divided into three groups of 20 specimens each. In the control group the specimens were stored in 37&#x000b0;C distilled water for three weeks. The other two experimental groups (home and in-office bleaching) were prepared as follows:</p><p>For home bleaching group the specimens were treated with 0.1 ml of 15% carbamide peroxide (Opalescence PF, Ultradent, South Jordan, USA) applied six hours a day for three weeks, during which the specimens were placed in a wet incubator at 37&#x000b0;C. At each time interval, the amalgam specimens were rinsed with 20 ml of distilled water and restored in 37&#x000b0;C distilled water.</p><p>The specimens in the in-office group were treated in the same manner as in the home bleaching group but in this group, 35% carbamide peroxide gel (Opalescence Quick, Ultradent, South Jordan, USA) was used. The specimens were treated with 0.1 ml of the gel 30 minutes a day for three weeks. After three weeks all the specimens were rinsed with distilled water and dried. Each specimen was then prepared for scanning electron microscopy and surface mercury level measurement. The treated specimens were mounted on aluminum stubs and coated with 200&#x000c5; layers of gold in a coating device (E 5200 Auto sputter, England). The level of surface mercury in each specimen was measured with SEM (Cam Scan, MV2300, USA) and EDX (Link, Oxford, U.K). Each specimen was irradiated at two additional equidistant areas at the center at a voltage of 25 KV for 120 seconds. The quantitative analysis of the percentage of weight concentration of the surface mercury was performed by applying the computerized Z.A.F (Z = atomic number, A = absorption, F = fluorescence) correction method.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-dent04_p0023">1</xref> For each specimen the mean value of two areas was obtained. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare surface levels of mercury between the groups. A post hoc Tukey test was used for the two-by-two comparison of the groups (P&#x0003c;.05). The specimens were also observed for surface morphologic changes with the MV 2300 scanning electron microscope.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The levels of surface mercury in study groups are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-dent04_p0023">Table 2</xref>. The control group had the lowest level of surface mercury and the home bleaching group demonstrated the highest values. Results of one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed that there were significant differences in the mean values of mercury weight percentages between the groups (P&#x0003c;.001). Post hoc Tukey test did not demonstrate any significant differences between the home bleaching and in-office bleaching groups (P=0.71), but according to this test the levels of mercury detected in the home bleaching and in-office bleaching groups were significantly higher than those in the control group (P&#x0003c;.001). In scanning electron micrographs morphologic changes were observed on the surface of the specimens in the 15% and 35% carbamide peroxide groups in comparison with the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-dent04_p0023">Figure 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Recently, attention has been focused on mercury release from amalgam in the oral cavity and its potential detrimental effects.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-dent04_p0023">13</xref> Dental amalgam is a complex metallic biomaterial consisting of as many as 8 to 10 distinct phases with different micro structural features.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-dent04_p0023">1</xref> Amalgam may be susceptible to strong oxidative action of bleaching agents.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-dent04_p0023">13</xref> Contrary to the results of a study by Al Salehi et al,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-dent04_p0023">14</xref> results of the present study demonstrated that intermittent treatment of amalgam specimens with both home and in-office bleaching agents increases the surface levels of mercury. Hydrogen peroxide is the active ingredient in bleaching agents.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-dent04_p0023">15</xref> Carbamide peroxide can be decomposed; yielding one-third of hydrogen peroxide and two-thirds of urea.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-dent04_p0023">15</xref> Hydrogen peroxide decomposes and produces free radicals OH<sup>&#x02212;</sup> and O<sup>&#x02212;</sup>. Perhydroxil (OH<sup>&#x02212;</sup>) is a strong oxidizing agent,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-dent04_p0023">15</xref> which can cause changes in the surface levels of the amalgam metallic components, and expose the silver-mercury matrix which is a potential source for mercury release.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-dent04_p0023">1</xref> Certosimo et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-dent04_p0023">13</xref> and Rotstein et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-dent04_p0023">2</xref> demonstrated that the level of mercury release is related to the concentration of peroxide agent, i.e. as peroxide concentration increases so does the potential for oxidation, corrosion, and dissolution of the amalgam.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-dent04_p0023">13</xref> Therefore, it is expected that surface mercury levels of amalgam treated with 35% carbamide peroxide will be high. It should be noted that there was a significant increase in the levels of surface mercury in 15% carbamide peroxide group compared to the control group and a slight increase compared to that in the 35% carbamide peroxide group. Longer exposure time of specimens treated with 15% carbamide peroxide (six hours a day for three weeks) compared to that of 35% carbamide peroxide (30 minutes a day for three weeks) may compensate for lower peroxide concentrations. This is consistent with the results of studies carried out by Robertello et al,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-dent04_p0023">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-dent04_p0023">16</xref> Rotstein et al,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-dent04_p0023">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-dent04_p0023">12</xref> Ahn et al,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-dent04_p0023">17</xref> and Okabe et al,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-dent04_p0023">11</xref> who demonstrated that the extent of oxidation, corrosion, micro structural changes, and dissolution of the amalgam surface are dependent upon the duration of amalgam surface exposure to peroxide.</p><p>Our results demonstrated higher levels of surface mercury in amalgam specimens treated intermittently with both home and in-office bleaching gels in comparison to the control group; however, considering the dental biofilm effect on reducing mercury release into the surrounding environments<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-dent04_p0023">18</xref> it should be noted that the higher mercury levels found with SEM-EDX technique do not necessarily indicate their presence in saliva or absorption by the oral tissues. Nonetheless, the cause-and-effect relationship between different bleaching agents and amalgam tissue toxicity, and the effect of concentration and exposure duration of oxidizing agents require further investigations in vivo.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Within the limitations of this study it can be concluded that surface levels of mercury are higher in intermittently bleached amalgam compared with untreated amalgam.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="b1-dent04_p0023"><label>1</label><mixed-citation
