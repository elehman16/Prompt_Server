Introduction</title><p>The prevalence of neuropathic pain refractory to the current standard of care has been estimated to be 1.5% of the general population.<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> Spinal cord stimulation (SCS), for which electrodes are placed into the dorsal epidural space, is an available treatment of a variety of chronic neuropathic pain conditions such as failed back surgery syndrome and complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS).<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup></p><p>Specific challenges for SCS remain, especially for pain conditions such as CRPS I and causalgia that differ by etiology and symptom profile from other chronic pain syndromes. An estimated 40% to 50% of CRPS subjects achieved clinically meaningful pain relief with SCS.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Similar rates of successful pain relief are reported for heterogeneous populations that contain a significant CRPS population.<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Less than optimal results for some patients may be due to limitations of the selective targeting capabilities of SCS, unpleasant paresthesia, or from different mechanisms of action.</p><p>Lack of precision with SCS is attributed to shunting of energy by the cerebral spinal fluid, positional variations in stimulation, segmentation of spinal sensory input, and lead migrations postimplantation.<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> In some cases, these challenges can be addressed with improved surgical techniques and device programming, but pain related to CRPS and causalgia remains difficult to treat; many SCS patients do not achieve high-level pain relief, despite efforts to improve techniques and programming.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup></p><p>The dorsal root ganglion (DRG) plays a key role in the development and maintenance of neuropathic pain.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> The DRG, located between every spinal nerve and the spinal cord on the posterior root, houses the somas of the primary sensory neurons. These somas process and transmit sensory information from the periphery to the central nervous system. Animal models of chronic pain have shown that pathophysiologic changes occur in the DRG, including altered electrophysiological membrane properties, altered expression of integral membrane proteins, and altered expression of various genes that contribute to the hyperexcitability of neurons.<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> The combination of the DRG's sensory function and accessibility through familiar epidural approaches make it an ideal target for neurostimulation. Pain therapies targeting the DRG included radiofrequency frequency ablation, steroid injections, and ganglionectomy.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup></p><p>Initial evidence with 8 CRPS patients suggested that DRG stimulation may be successful in a larger proportion of subjects than SCS (71% vs 50%).<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> Thus, the ACCURATE study, a randomized, controlled, multicenter trial, evaluated DRG stimulation compared to SCS stimulation for the treatment of chronic, intractable pain of the lower limbs attributed to CRPS or causalgia.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>2. Methods</title><p>Under an Investigational Device Exemption, the ACCURATE study was designed as a prospective, randomized, controlled, multicenter study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the DRG stimulation compared to traditional SCS for subjects with CRPS or causalgia (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link>: NCT01923285). The study was conducted in 22 US sites. Prior to any study initiation, all sites obtained approval from the institutional review board, and subjects were enrolled only after informed consent was obtained.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>2.1. Patient selection</title><p>Subjects who had chronic, intractable neuropathic pain of the lower limbs associated with a diagnosis of CRPS or causalgia were screened and determined to be eligible according to the inclusion or exclusion criteria of the study (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Patients were diagnosed with CRPS type 1 based on the Budapest criteria.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Causalgia was defined as a painful condition arising from damage to a nerve resulting in chronic pain, generally restricted to the innervation pattern of the damaged nerve or nerves, which may or may not have secondary symptoms.<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> The diagnosis, in every case, was confirmed by an experienced medical monitor (N.M.) for strict adherence to these diagnostic criteria. Briefly, eligible subjects were naive to stimulation, had chronic, intractable pain for at least 6 months, tried and failed at least 2 prior pharmacologic treatments from 2 different drug classes, had stable neurologic function 30 days prior to screening, and were free from psychological pathology that contraindicated an implantable device. Subjects with changing or escalating pain condition or unstable use of pain medication 30 days prior to enrollment were not considered eligible to participate in the study. All subjects' medical, psychological, and imaging records were evaluated by an independent medical monitor to ensure appropriate patient selection.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Inclusion or exclusion criteria.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jop-158-669-g001"/></table-wrap></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>2.2. Study design</title><p>After signing informed consent, subjects underwent a baseline evaluation to determine enrollment eligibility. After enrollment, subjects were randomized to either DRG stimulation (DRG group) or traditional SCS (SCS group) in a 1:1 ratio. Randomization was based on random, permuted blocks and stratified by study center. The study's centralized electronic data collection system provided the subjects' randomized group assignments after subjects were enrolled. Subjects, investigators, and study site staff were not blinded to subjects' assigned therapy. Subjects proceeded to a temporary trial stimulation phase (ranging from 3 to 30 days based on each site's standard of care), using the device type stipulated by their randomization. The average trial stimulation phase in the DRG group was 5.8 (SD 2.8) days and 5.8 (SD 5.1) days for the SCS group (<italic>P</italic> = 0.206, Wilcoxon test).</p><p>Successful trial stimulation was determined by the subject achieving at least a 50% lower limb pain relief during the trial phase and expressing a desire to go on to a permanent implant. Subjects who were successful during the trial phase were eligible to continue on to permanent implantation. Subjects who failed the trial stimulation phase were exited from the study. However, data from the trial failures were included as treatment failures for the composite treatment success end point at 3 months and at subsequent time points through 12 months. Subjects in both arms, who achieved a successful outcome during the trial phase, were implanted with a permanent device and were followed for 12 months, with follow-ups at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months postimplant. Subjects were not allowed to change the maximum daily dose of their prescribed chronic lower limb pain medications from baseline to the 3-month follow-up visit at which time the primary and secondary end points were ascertained. Postoperative reprogramming to optimize therapy was allowed for both groups at any time during the study, per standard of care for neuromodulation devices. Programming occurred by respective companies (Medtronic and Spinal Modulation) under the guidance of appropriate clinical and technical industry personnel.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>2.3. Description of devices and implant procedures</title><p>Dorsal root ganglion stimulation was delivered by the AXIUM Neurostimulator System (Spinal Modulation; LLC, Menlo Park, CA, a wholly owned subsidiary of St Jude Medical), which was recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for spinal column stimulation via epidural and intraspinal lead access to the DRG as an aid in the management of moderate to severe chronic intractable pain of the lower limbs in adult patients with CRPS type I and causalgia. The system is composed of percutaneous leads designed to stimulate the DRG, an external trial pulse generator, and an implantable pulse generator.</p><p>Traditional SCS was delivered with a commercially available system (RestoreUltra and RestoreSensor; Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN) indicated for a number of chronic pain conditions including CRPS I and causalgia. Both devices were programmed by separate technicians for each arm such that the programming was performed by experienced personnel for the specific device to achieve optimal analgesia. See Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref> for a summary of programming parameters used during the study for both devices.</p><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Programming settings.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jop-158-669-g002"/></table-wrap><p>Standard procedures for trial and permanent implantations were used in the study. Dorsal root ganglion leads were placed in the lateral epidural space near the target DRG at levels from T10 to S2, depending on the dermatomal target corresponding to the subject's primary region of pain. Spinal cord stimulation leads were placed in the medial or paramedial epidural space such that the caudal-most electrical contact was not caudal to the top of the L1 vertebral body on an anterior&#x02013;posterior fluoroscopic view. Depending on the anatomical target, up to 16 contacts were placed for both study arms.

Sample size calculation and analysis populations</title><p>Sample size was determined based on the planned noninferiority test for the composite safety and effectiveness primary end point of treatment success. Treatment success was defined as &#x02265;50% reduction in the visual analog scale (VAS) score in the primary area of pain during both trial and the 3-month visits with no incidence of stimulation-induced neurological deficits. Pilot data with 8 CRPS subjects and 22 causalgia subjects indicated that the success rate of DRG, defined as a 50% reduction in pain intensity, was 87% for CRPS subjects and 77% for causalgia subjects. Thus, an observed success rate at of least 15% above the 50% rate reported for SCS subjects was expected.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> Accounting for 15% attrition, an estimated 152 subjects (76 subjects in each arm) would provide greater than 85% power to test the primary end point hypothesis with a noninferiority margin of 10%.</p><p>The primary, secondary, and tertiary effectiveness analyses were based on the modified intention-to-treat (MITT) population including all randomized subjects who participated in the trial procedure (73 in each group). The MITT population was based on standard intention-to-treat principles, wherein subjects were analyzed based on their initial randomized treatments. The binary composite end points for success included subjects who failed the trial evaluation and exited the study as treatment failures. Safety data tabulations are based on the intention-to-treat analysis set including all randomized subjects (76 in each group).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>2.5. Data collection and general statistical methods</title><p>Patient demographics and medical history were collected at baseline. At baseline and at each study visit, physical and neurological examinations, along with medication utilization, were recorded by study staff. Pain intensity was measured at baseline and at each study visit using the 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS), ranging from 0 (no pain) to 100 (worst imaginable pain) where higher scores represent greater pain severity. At baseline and each study visit, assessments of quality of life, psychological disposition, and experiential factors (measures described in detail below) were completed. All adverse events (AEs) through 12 months were reported and the occurrence of any stimulation-related neurological deficits was documented.</p><p>Descriptive statistics are presented as number of subjects, mean, SD, median, and range for all continuous variables and the number and percentage of subjects for categorical variables. As stipulated by the protocol and with the exception of the primary end point analysis, DRG stimulation and SCS were compared using a 2-sample <italic>t</italic> test (or Wilcoxon rank-sum test) for continuous outcomes and Pearson &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test (or Fisher exact test) for categorical outcomes. Choice of parametric or alternative tests was based on the data distributions for each measure, and the test used is reported in the results. Two-sided confidence intervals are also provided for certain outcome measures of interest to assess differences between the treatment arm and the control arm.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>2.6. Primary composite end point</title><p>The predefined primary composite end point of the study was treatment success rates for the DRG subjects compared to the SCS subjects. To be considered a treatment success (1) a subject had a successful trial reporting &#x02265;50% reduction in VAS score from baseline to the end of the trial phase, (2) reported a VAS score at 3 months that was reduced from preimplant baseline by &#x02265;50%, and (3) did not experience a stimulation-related neurological deficit during either the trial phase or after permanent implant. A stimulation neurological deficit, different from AEs, was defined as a measurable 2-point worsening on the in-clinic sensory and motor neurological examination, within the appropriate concordant anatomy, that was induced by stimulation and subsided in the absence of stimulation for at least 24 hours. Sensory and motor examinations were conducted by the physician and rated as 2 (normal function), 1 (decreased function), or 0 (abnormal function); a score of 0 would indicate neurological deficit. No neurological deficits, as defined, were recorded for any subjects in either arm of the study. In addition, if a subject withdrew from the study due to a device-, procedure-, or stimulation-related AE, the subject was treated as a failure in the primary end point analysis.</p><p>As prespecified, the primary end point analyzed the success rate between the two treatment arms using Blackwelder methods for testing noninferiority between 2 proportions at a one-sided significance of 0.05.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> The noninferiority margin was set at 10%.

Discussion</title><p>This study represents the largest randomized controlled trial assessing DRG stimulation for the treatment of chronic, intractable pain associated with the diagnoses of CRPS or causalgia. Analysis of the primary end point revealed that subjects using DRG stimulation had a higher rate of treatment success (81.2%) compared with the treatment success rate for traditional SCS (56.7%). Furthermore, pain relief persisted through 12 months of follow-up and remained significantly lower for DRG subjects than for those using SCS. Subjects using DRG reported significantly less postural-related changes in paresthesia and showed larger improvements on measures of quality of life, functional status, and psychological disposition than subjects using SCS. The safety profile of the DRG stimulation device was similar to traditional SCS devices, with the exception of the rate of procedural events.</p><p>These results for DRG stimulation as a treatment of chronic neuropathic pain associated with CRPS and causalgia must be interpreted within the context of previous neurostimulation studies for this population. Treatment of chronic reflex sympathetic dystrophy with SCS, in combination with physical therapy, reduced pain to a greater degree than physical therapy alone<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>; mean VAS scores for implanted patients reduced to 3.5 cm on a 10-cm VAS scale after 6 months of SCS. A retrospective analysis of SCS for the treatment of CRPS reported a mean VAS of 5.6 cm over a mean follow-up time of 88 months.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Mean VAS scores during SCS therapy in both these previous studies were higher, by a clinically meaningful margin<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> than the VAS score of 13.1 mm and 15 mm reported by subjects treated with DRG stimulation in our study at 3 and 12 months. Similarly, Geurts et al.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> reported only a 50% pain reduction in an observational trial of SCS for CRPS.</p><p>A study using a heterogeneous population, including subjects with CRPS, reported that 68.4% of subjects were able to achieve &#x02265;50% leg pain relief, and 60% of subjects achieved &#x02265;50% pain relief for overall pain.<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> A published case series of CRPS subjects reported that 71.4% of subjects achieved &#x02265;50% pain relief after 6 months of DRG stimulation.<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> In addition, a randomized trial comparing SCS to physical therapy for subjects with CRPS reported that 50% of subjects achieved at least 50% reduction in pain intensity.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Here, we report an 84% reduction in pain for patients treated with DRG stimulation and that 81% of subjects achieved &#x02265;50% pain relief. Furthermore, the optimal programming for DRG stimulation is still being developed; Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref> shows that SCS and DRG parameters were quite different. Additional developments in optimized programming for DRG should improve clinical outcomes over time for this therapy. Taken together, we conclude that DRG stimulation provides better pain relief than traditional SCS.</p><p>Patients with CRPS and causalgia are difficult to treat with symptoms for 20% to 80% of CRPS I patients persisting for 1 year, even when treatment was considered successful.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Surgical interventions such as joint denervation or neurolysis also have variable outcomes; approximately 20% of patients failed to report low pain intensity and improved activities of daily living 2 years after surgery.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> For patients with CRPS I or causalgia who do not achieve adequate pain management with conservative therapies, SCS provides an additional and reversible treatment option. Furthermore, DRG stimulation augments the patient experience by providing a therapy that is adaptable to each patient's individual pain profile through more precise anatomical targeting.</p><p>The pathways for sensory afferents into the central nervous system via the DRG are well documented.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Anatomically, peripheral inputs associated with pain symptoms can be traced to relevant DRG at one or more spinal levels. Stimulation of the relevant DRG modifies pain signaling from the periphery for only the affected dermatomes. By contrast, SCS targets large dermatomal areas through stimulation of the dorsal column at anatomically defined spinal levels, and, as such, modifies ascending pathways for pain while also modulating collateral afferents in or near the medial lemniscus. Modulating pain signals from distal appendages with SCS typically requires that multiple dermatomes be captured&#x02013;with paresthesias in the entire region. Our results showed that subjects treated with DRG stimulation had significantly less perceived stimulation sensation in nonpainful areas than subjects using SCS, while reporting better pain relief. This may indicate more precision targeting by virtue of the greater anatomical specificity with DRG stimulation.</p><p>The differences in collateral paresthesia may also be influenced by differences in programming parameters. Programming parameters were individualized for each subject's optimal experience. The resulting parameters were quite different between the 2 therapies (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>) with much lower amplitudes for DRG programming. This was expected from pilot work<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> and because diffusion of energy by the cerebrospinal fluid is less influential at the DRG. The between-subjects design of this study prohibits a real comparison of the relationship between targeting, programming, and pain relief; more research is needed.</p><p>Chronic pain conditions, in general, are associated with disturbances in mood and physical and social functioning.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> The targeted pain relief provided by DRG stimulation in the ACCURATE study was also associated with additional benefits. After 3 months, subjects using DRG stimulation reported significantly greater improvements in total mood disturbance, as measured by the POMS, as well as larger improvements pain interference, affective disruption, and activity, as measured by the BPI. Moreover, by 12 months, subjects treated with DRG stimulation reported significantly larger improvements than SCS subjects for physical function, general health, and social function, as measured by the SF-36.</p><p>Despite the differences reported for treatment success, pain relief, and affective or functional outcomes, the majority of subjects were satisfied with their respective therapy, regardless of treatment group. While subjects using DRG stimulation reported a larger magnitude of change and there was a greater proportion of successful subjects with DRG stimulation, SCS subjects, as a group, did report significant improvements from baseline in all measured domains. The satisfaction results reported here reflect the improvements from preimplant baseline experienced by subjects.</p><p>The rate of AEs for DRG stimulation, through 12 months postimplant, was similar to that seen for the SCS-treated subjects in this study and in previous reports.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> Only 2 subjects had procedure-related SAEs; 2 infections in the SCS group that required explant. It is notable that the rate of nonserious procedure-related events was higher for the DRG stimulation group (46%) compared with the SCS group (26%). The higher rate of procedure-related events may be attributed to the differences in average procedure time and a greater number of leads placed for DRG some subjects, which may increase exposure to risk. It is expected that additional experience with DRG implantation will result in shorter procedure times and fewer procedure-related events.</p><p>There are limitations to this study that may affect the interpretation of the results. The calculated success rate was contingent upon subjects not only achieving 50% pain relief but also continuing in the study (dropouts were counted as failures). Therefore, the success rate could be influenced by factors associated with the lack of blinded treatments (eg, SCS subjects were less motivated to stay in the trial, uncontrolled differences in health care provider interactions). In addition, subjects were required to maintain a stable regimen of pain medications through 3 months only, and the long-term results after 3 months may be affected by medication changes. The SCS device also had limitations placed on the programming of the device so that the comparison between the devices was not confounded by unique SCS device programming features. In particular, the accelerometer function in the SCS device was disabled. If the accelerometer was enabled, the SCS group may have had less postural changes in perceived paresthesia intensity. In addition, the analysis of subjects who did and did not experience paresthesia when stimulation was on was confounded by the fact that the SCS device instruction for use requires the device to be programmed for subjects to receive paresthesia. In addition, the number of subjects who did not have paresthesia is very small, and this end point was not adequately powered to detect the difference in pain relief for subjects who reported feeling vs not feeling paresthesia.</p><p>In conclusion, CRPS I and causalgia, in their chronic forms, are difficult to treat with variable outcomes with conservative symptom management. Neuromodulation techniques, like SCS, may benefit many patients who have exhausted other therapy options. SCS, however, often has a limited ability to target discrete focal anatomical regions of pain, as is common in CRPS and causalgia. Dorsal root ganglion stimulation provides an effective alternative that provides precision stimulation targeting and improved patient outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conflict of interest statement</title><p>All authors were paid by Spinal Modulation &#x00026; St Jude Medical as investigators for the clinical trial.
