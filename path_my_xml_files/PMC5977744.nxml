Data show that adolescent and young women in these places are also more likely to become pregnant. If a woman is undernourished when she becomes pregnant, it can have a negative effect on her health, pregnancy, and infant. One way to improve adolescent and young women&#x02019;s health before they become pregnant is to provide a program that aims to help them make healthy decisions and improve their nutrition. This is often called preconception care. In this study in rural Pakistan, we have designed a culturally-appropriate preconception care package that includes life skills building education, to help study participants make better decisions about their health and educate them about their rights, and multiple micronutrient supplements, since they have limited access to foods with the micronutrients that they need. Study participants (15&#x02013;24&#x000a0;years) are enrolled for 2&#x000a0;years, and we will assess several factors about their nutrition, health, and well-being over this time. The main effect we aim to determine is how many participants have anemia among those who receive the preconception care package compared to those who do not receive it. Ultimately, we hope that what we learn in this study will lead us to make recommendations about policies around preconception care for adolescent and young women so that they can live healthier lives and make healthier decisions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Background</title><p id="Par15">Within the Sustainable Development Goals, promoting strategies to ensure the survival, health, and well-being of adolescent girls, women, and their offspring has been recognized as an essential component to ending poverty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Adolescence, in particular, is considered a neglected yet critical period for physical and psychological growth and development, given the transition from childhood to reproductive adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Pregnancies to adolescents are associated with a higher risk of complications and maternal and child mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], and contribute to 23% of the burden of disease arising from pregnancy and childbirth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. When an adolescent becomes pregnant in a resource-limited setting, her access to education generally stops as a result; yet, educating girls is very effective in raising overall economic productivity, lowering infant and maternal mortality, improving nutrition, and promoting health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Collectively, this makes determining interventions to improve health outcomes from adolescence of public health importance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par16">Nutritional deficiencies are risk factors known to exist from adolescence, and have important consequences for future maternal and newborn health. During adolescence, vitamin and mineral requirements are incrementally increased to support one&#x02019;s ongoing physical development and the nutritional strain of menstruation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Given the limited intake of animal products, fruits, vegetables, and fortified foods in low- and middle-income countries, undernutrition can be widely prevalent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Deficiencies in multiple micronutrients (MMN) are of particular concern given their direct effects, such as iron deficiency anemia and iodine deficiency disorders, and their indirect effects, like increased risk of serious infectious disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The burden of undernutrition and its downstream consequences could be prevented throughout the life course by using appropriate nutrition-specific and nutrition-sensitive interventions, such as MMN supplementation and the empowerment of women to make informed decisions, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">Since health and health behaviours correspond strongly from adolescence to adulthood, habits acquired during adolescence could have significant implications later in life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. As such, developing a preconception care package for adolescent and young women could serve to empower them to make informed decisions about their health and well-being [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], and function as a platform for the delivery of basic nutrition-related interventions to address undernutrition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Incorporating a life skills building education (LSBE) element will be important to sustainable and proficient uptake in improving their own general health, pregnancy outcomes, and future health of their children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, at this time there is limited understanding as to what health information should be provided and how within preconception care.</p><p id="Par18">We hypothesize that the programmatic provision of LSBE and MMN supplements to non-pregnant adolescent and young women 15&#x02013;24&#x000a0;years of age in a population-based setting in rural Pakistan will improve selected nutrition, health, and empowerment-related outcomes compared to those who receive the standard of care. For those who receive the intervention, we expect that there will be a decrease in the prevalence of anemia. Conducting this trial within the context of the existing public health setting will allow us to assess the <italic>effectiveness</italic> of the intervention, and offer important insight around how to achieve coverage in the trial setting.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par19">The Matiari emPowerment and Preconception Supplementation (MaPPS) Trial is a two-arm, cluster-randomized, controlled trial of LSBE and MMN supplementation provided in a programmatic context to evaluate the impact on pre-identified nutrition and health outcomes among adolescent and young women, and their infants born within the context of the trial. Depending on whether participants become pregnant or not, there are three phases: preconception (maximum 24&#x000a0;months in duration); pregnancy (approximately 9&#x000a0;months in duration); and postpartum (maximum 12&#x000a0;months in duration). A detailed trial protocol has been developed in accordance with the SPIRIT guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] in a collaboration between the Aga Khan University (AKU; Karachi, Pakistan) and the Hospital for Sick Children (Toronto, Ontario, Canada). This paper addresses the methods for ongoing data collection during the preconception phase of the trial among participants who do not become pregnant, with the methods for the parent trial detailing the pregnancy and postpartum phases appearing elsewhere ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] unpublished).</p><p id="Par20">The first participant was enrolled on 30 June 2017; enrollment is expected to be ongoing until July 2018; and planned data collection will continue until 2021.</p><sec id="Sec4"><title>Objectives</title><p id="Par21">The primary aim of the preconception phase of the MaPPS Trial is to evaluate the impact of LSBE (provided bi-monthly) and supplementation with MMN (provided twice-weekly) versus the standard of care (non-regulated community-based health sessions and no supplements) on anemia (hemoglobin concentration&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;12&#x000a0;g/dL) after 2&#x000a0;years among non-pregnant adolescents 15&#x02013;18.9&#x000a0;years of age at enrolment. There are several secondary objectives to further determine the effect of LSBE and MMN supplementation compared to the standard of care. These relate to nutrition (anthropometry [height, weight, middle upper arm circumference (MUAC)], nutritional status [iron, vitamin A, vitamin D]); general health (e.g., morbidity, mortality); and empowerment (age at marriage, completion of the 10th grade, and use of personal hygienic materials during menstruation).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Setting and participants</title><p id="Par22">This trial will be conducted in rural settings within Matiari district in Sindh province, Pakistan. Briefly, the nutritional status of adolescent girls in Pakistan is poor, with 51 and 20% experiencing anemia and iron deficiency anemia, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. An urban/rural divide is suggested to impact adolescent nutritional status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], with adolescents living in rural settings having particularly limited dietary diversity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The intervention is situated within Pakistan&#x02019;s existing Lady Health Worker (LHW) Programme. Each LHW is affiliated with a health facility and visit the homes in her catchment area monthly to carry out community support sessions and disseminate health education messages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. LHW-led community sessions have the potential to serve as an important communication channel for adolescents, especially those out of school. However, the content of existing LHW educational materials primarily focuses on priority groups, including children &#x0003c;&#x02009;5&#x000a0;years, pregnant women, and couples eligible for family planning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Although the LHW curriculum includes some material on topics important to the health of adolescent girls (e.g., dietary practices, anemia), these materials are not widely implemented and not included in community sessions regularly. More detail about the trial setting is described in the parent trial protocol publication ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] unpublished).</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Eligibility criteria</title><p id="Par23">As the MaPPS Trial is a population-based effectiveness study of LSBE and MMN supplementation from preconception, broad eligibility criteria for participation in the preconception phase were established. These include that the minimum age at enrolment is 15&#x000a0;years and the maximum age is 23&#x000a0;years; adolescent and young women must also report to be physically able to comply with the trial intervention. Adolescent and young women are not eligible to enrol if they are pregnant, participating in a different nutrition trial, or intend to leave the study area. They can be of any marital status. If a participant becomes pregnant, she proceeds to the pregnancy phase of the MaPPS Trial, as detailed in the parent study publication ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] unpublished).</p><p id="Par24">The micronutrient status and dietary intake of a sub-sample of adolescent participants 15&#x02013;18.9&#x000a0;years of age at enrolment will also be monitored within the MaPPS Trial.

This equates to 858 anemic adolescents per arm. To achieve this reduction in anemia, 1716 adolescents per arm will be required (3432 total). Given the number of adolescent and young women required to be powered to see a reduction in the primary outcome of the parent trial (low birth weight), we aim to enrol 12,712 participants 15&#x02013;24&#x000a0;years per arm (25,424 total).</p><p id="Par27">To monitor the micronutrient status of a subgroup of participants 15&#x02013;18.9&#x000a0;years of age at enrolment, the sample size calculated for the reduction in anemia prevalence will be used (i.e., 1716 adolescents per arm).

All MMN supplements are maintained and stored by the study manager in a locked study office that is temperature controlled. MMN supplements are provided to LHWs monthly by a study monitoring team, which is unblinded to the allocation of the intervention and not involved in data collection. Participants&#x02019; personal supply of MMN supplements are monitored and replenished every month by their respective LHWs. Once provided to participants, MMN supplements are stored in marked, opaque containers labelled with the participant&#x02019;s ID and supplement batch number and expiry date.</p><p id="Par31">Upon enrolment in the trial, intervention arm LHWs will visit new participants within 1 month to provide MMN supplements. Participants are asked to consume 1 MMN tablet 2&#x000a0;days/week. To make the incorporation MMN supplementation into their routine easier, participants are requested to choose a consistent time on 2&#x000a0;days in the week that are separate from each other (e.g., Monday and Thursday, or Wednesday and Saturday) on which to take 1 MMN tablet with a glass of water and a meal. Each participant is provided with a 1&#x000a0;month supply of MMN supplements, plus a spare week in case of unscheduled missed visits.

They are asked to ensure that the lid of the supplement bottle is tightly closed when not in use and stored away from light and humidity. It is also explained that some people experience mild side effects when they start taking the MMN supplements (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach pains), but that taking it with food should make side effects less likely to happen. If they miss a dose, participants are instructed to take 1 MMN tablet the next time that they remember, but never to consume more than 1 tablet/day. If a participant has any side effects, is concerned, or has questions, she is instructed to contact her LHW and not study personnel since study personnel are blinded to whether participants are in the control or intervention arm.

The per-protocol analysis will consider those women who complied with the recommend MMN supplementation frequency. Because the prevalence of anemia is high in the trial population, an individual-level analysis using generalized estimating equations (GEE) will be employed to determine the estimate of the population average. Clustering will be accounted for within the GEE analysis. There are several potential determinants which will be considered as covariates, such as age, parity, adherence, and SES. Relevant information will be collected at enrolment and throughout follow-up. Summary estimates (e.g., means, proportions, counts) will be reported with 95% confidence intervals. Dichotomous outcomes will be compared using risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals, and the difference in continuous variables will be determined by comparing means. <italic>P</italic> values less than 0.05 will be considered statistically significant.

The intervention will be implemented within the existing public health system, which is anticipated to lend to the interpretability of the trial findings and offer important insight around how to achieve coverage within the existing public health program context. This trial is distinctive in that it recruits both married and unmarried adolescent and young women, regardless of their intent to become pregnant, and collects measures on several domains of health and nutrition throughout participation.</p><p id="Par48">The existing WHO guidelines on iron supplementation for non-pregnant adolescent and menstruating women can be confusing, particularly with respect to dosing frequency (weekly versus daily) and duration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. At this time, we know of no guidelines that address preconception MMN supplementation. For adolescents, in particular, preconception care that includes MMN supplementation could be of benefit given that they are still developing and anemia can be caused by multiple different micronutrient deficiencies beyond iron [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Including a culturally-tailored educational piece aimed at empowering the ability of participants to make informed decisions about their health, well-being, and nutrition will be key to sustained behavioural change throughout the life-course. Similarly, guidelines on pre-pregnancy nutritional counselling specific to adolescents are not known to exist, even though attending to adolescents&#x02019; nutritional needs will be important in addressing intergenerational malnutrition, chronic disease, and poverty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Appropriate preconception care could allow that adolescents enter reproductive adulthood with improved health and nutrition status prior to conception.</p><p id="Par49">Overall, the MaPPS Trial is expected to offer insight into providing an intervention that includes both LSBE and MMN supplementation to adolescent and young women from preconception and for a prolonged duration of time. We anticipate that there would be future follow up of the adolescent and young women in this cohort, so as to understand their long-term reproductive and empowerment outcomes, as well as development and disease outcomes. We also intend to investigate the cost-effectiveness of the provision of the described intervention.</p><sec id="Sec25"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par50">As of May 2018, participants are still being enrolled to the trial.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional file</title><sec id="Sec26"><p>
