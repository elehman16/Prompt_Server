Symptoms include fatigue, joint pain and swelling and morning stiffness of the joints (MS), reducing quality of life and the ability to remain gainfully employed.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></p><p>Although accepted classification and remission criteria for RA include MS,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref> this symptom remains neglected in clinical studies. MS was found to be strongly associated with pain and functional incapacity and, to a lesser degree, with swollen and tender joint counts and acute phase responses.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref> Severe MS in the early course of RA was identified as having a high impact on patients' early retirement from working life and, therefore, greater attention should be paid to effective treatments of MS.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></p><p>The symptoms of RA show pronounced circadian rhythms with the highest severity in the early morning. The redistribution of interstitial fluids while asleep and circadian changes in synovial fluid composition may contribute to stiffness, because oedema of the synovium and the periarticular structures interferes with joint biomechanics.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref> Many studies on circadian rhythms in RA have reported the temporal relationship between raised levels of proinflammatory cytokines, insufficient anti-inflammatory protection and RA symptoms.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref> A recent study investigating overnight variations in cytokine and cortisol concentrations in 16 patients with RA reported that nocturnal interleukin 6 (IL-6) levels start to increase approximately 3 h before increases in cortisol and peak at approximately 08:00 h, 40 min before cortisol.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref> From all these data, it was concluded that there must be a link between the overnight rise in IL-6 and the circadian variation in RA symptoms.</p><p>This conclusion could have important consequences for dose and timing of oral glucocorticoid (GC) treatments. Indeed, it has previously been suggested that GC administration between 06:00 and 08:00 h could be just too late as night-time pathophysiological processes have already initiated inflammation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref> Preventing the rise in proinflammatory cytokines should therefore be more efficacious than treating the symptoms. In line with this thought, a modified-release (MR) prednisone tablet was developed to optimise GC therapy of RA in a novel chronotherapy approach. If taken at bedtime, the new tablet releases prednisone 4 h after ingestion&#x02014;that is, at approximately 02:00 h (Comparative bioavailability study of one new timed-release formulation of prednisone (5 mg tablet) dosed in the evening with or without food and a reference immediate-release formulation (Decortin&#x000ae; 5 mg tablet) dosed in the night without food, after single oral dose administration in healthy male subjects. Clinical Study Report, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, 12 December 2003, EMR 62 215-005). The efficacy and safety of this medication was investigated in a controlled clinical study in 288 patients with active RA who were previously treated with GCs, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref> During the initial double-blind treatment phase, all patients either continued on immediate-release (IR) prednisone or were switched to prednisone chronotherapy with the novel MR formulation, both at their individual prestudy doses. The primary end point was the relative change in duration of MS after 12 weeks of treatment, which showed significantly greater improvements in the prednisone chronotherapy group. The safety profile did not show differences between the two treatments.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref> The additional benefit of the new tablet was considered important for daily clinical practice.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></p><p>In this paper we report the results of using low-dose prednisone chronotherapy for up to 12 months.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s3"><title>Patients</title><p>All patients who completed the double-blind study and did not develop any exclusion criteria were eligible to continue treatment with MR prednisone.

Before the study all patients had been treated with stable doses of GCs, DMARDs and NSAIDs. During the 3-month double-blind phase, patients received either IR prednisone in the morning and MR prednisone placebo in the evening, or IR prednisone placebo in the morning and MR prednisone in the evening. During the open-label extension all patients received MR prednisone in the evening.

The starting doses for individual patients were equivalent to doses during the double-blind phase. Daily doses were composed of the appropriate number of 1 mg and 5 mg tablets. In contrast to the requirement of stable doses for prednisone and DMARDs during the double-blind phase, dose changes were permitted during the open-label extension. During the double-blind phase, patients completed the appropriate pages in their diaries every morning and every evening before going to bed. During the open phase, completion of the diary pages was required every morning and every evening for at least 7 days immediately before each scheduled study visit. Requested entries included waking-up time, stiffness (yes/no), time of resolution of stiffness and intensity of pain during the day (100 mm visual analogue scale, VAS).</p><p>Additional procedures included documentation of adverse events (AEs), blood sampling for erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C reactive protein, assessment of the disease activity score (DAS28, including 28 joints checked for swelling and tenderness), patient's assessment of disease activity on a 100 mm VAS (end points 0=not active and 100=extremely active) and physicians' global assessment of disease activity (5-point scale: asymptomatic, mild, moderate, severe, very severe). At each visit investigators recorded all AEs following accepted clinical trial guidelines and definitions. No checklists with predefined AEs were used.</p><p>Procedures performed at the end of the study included a physical examination, blood sampling for laboratory investigations and determination of IL-6 plasma concentrations. Local biochemistry laboratories performed ESR measurements, haematology and urinalysis; all other biochemistry analyses were performed by Bio Analytical Research (BARC), Gent, Belgium.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Target variables</title><p>Efficacy end points were absolute and relative reductions in MS duration, changes in IL-6 plasma levels, DAS28, pain intensity and American College of Rheumatology (ACR20) improvement. The safety of MR prednisone was analysed from AE reports, clinical biochemistry investigations and physical examinations.</p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>MS duration was calculated from the diaries as 7-day means before each visit and defined as the difference between the time of resolution of stiffness and the time of awakening. This was expressed as absolute and relative changes from baseline corresponding to the start of the double-blind phase (xbase). Thus, MS duration was expressed as absolute changes defined as postbaseline value minus baseline value (ie, xvisit &#x02013; xbase). Relative changes from baseline are given as 100 times the absolute change under treatment divided by the baseline value (ie, 100% &#x000d7; (xvisit &#x02212; xbase)/xbase).</p><p>Data of the open-label phase were evaluated using descriptive statistics.</p><p>Although all patients were treated with MR prednisone during the open-label extension, we describe the groups separately as randomised.

Of the 288 randomised patients, 272 (94.4%) received concomitant therapy with DMARDs at baseline (MR group: n=133, 92.4%; IR group: n=139, 96.5%). These DMARDs were (in the MR and IR groups, respectively): methotrexate in 74% and 73% of patients; sulfasalazine in 13% in both groups; leflunomide in 11% and 18%; and &#x0003c;10% of patients in both groups had a combination of two DMARDs. Of the 249 patients in the open phase of the study, 238 (95.6%) received DMARDs at baseline. During the open-label extension three more patients (n=241) added a DMARD, increasing the percentage to 96.8%; 76.3% of these 241 patients were receiving methotrexate, 11.9% were receiving sulfasalazine, 14% were receiving leflunomide and &#x0003c;10% were receiving combination therapy.

In the double-blind phase of the study, MR prednisone was found to produce a significantly greater reduction in the duration of MS than IR prednisone and a significant reduction in IL-6 levels.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref> The reduction in MS duration and IL-6 levels established during the double-blind phase in the MR group (MR/MR) was found to be sustained during treatment with MR prednisone for up to 12 months. Similar improvements were also evident in patients switched to MR prednisone in the open-label extension. Clinically relevant improvements in disease activity (DAS28) and pain intensity (VAS) were also observed over the 12 months. The results of our study thus demonstrate that the efficacy of GC therapy can be improved by administration as chronotherapy&#x02014;that is, targeting drug release to the circadian rhythm of the underlying inflammation and resulting symptoms. This is an important observation given the widespread clinical use of GCs in the treatment of RA and other rheumatic diseases.</p><p>It is encouraging to see that 37% of the patients reached an ACR20 improvement at the end of the study despite long-term GC pretreatment and longstanding disease. This is of special importance because, with a disease history of &#x02265;10 years as seen in our patients, pain and other symptoms are not only caused by inflammation but also, at least in part, by irreversible damage to the synovium, cartilage and bone. Nevertheless, MR prednisone with its convenient night-time administration regimen successfully reduces the inflammatory component in a unique way.</p><p>The results of this study also further confirm the low level of clinically relevant AEs associated with low-dose GC therapy and are in agreement with published reviews.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref> MR prednisone was found to have a similar safety profile to IR prednisone given at the same dosages. In particular, no signs or symptoms were noted that might indicate aggravation of suppression of the HPA axis. Indeed, a study of HPA axis function in a subgroup of patients from this study reported elsewhere<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref> found that: (1) cortisol levels immediately before and after stimulation were comparable between treatments and (2) there was no evidence of greater suppression of the HPA axis during treatment with MR prednisone for up to 12 months. Given the superior efficacy reported from the double-blind study for MR prednisone over IR prednisone and the similar safety profile, MR prednisone can thus be expected to have an improved benefit to risk ratio over IR prednisone.</p><p>A potential limitation of the study is that it involved two differently designed phases: an initial blinded active controlled phase followed by an uncontrolled open-label extension. Therefore, only descriptive statistical methods could be employed to analyse data from the open-label extension. However, the IR prednisone group showed comparable effects when switched to MR prednisone chronotherapy, thereby confirming the robustness of the observed treatment effects.</p><p>In conclusion, the results of the completed CAPRA1 study reported here suggest that low-dose MR prednisone chronotherapy offers significant benefits over IR prednisone for the treatment of RA which are maintained for up to 12 months. Further studies are warranted to investigate the benefit of low-dose MR prednisone chronotherapy in both GC-na&#x000ef;ve patients with early RA and those with other inflammatory conditions. Indeed, chronotherapy may well offer significant advantages over standard therapies in diseases such as polymyalgia rheumatica<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref> and asthma.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Biostatistician Ursula Tilp, Premier Research Group, performed the statistical analyses.
