We analyzed three independent clinical trials with homogeneous design on patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). After 2 weeks receiving placebo, patients were randomized to receive OB (3 &#x000d7; 40 mg daily) or placebo for 15 weeks. We aimed to perform a pooled analysis of the data from these homogeneous clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy of OB treatment on symptoms and global response of patients.</p></sec><sec id="section2-1756283X16681708"><title>Methods:</title><p>A total of 883 patients with IBS (69.8% women, mean age 46.2 years, 43.8% mixed type) were included, 442 treated with OB and 441 with placebo.

It affects up to 11.5% of the general population in Europe and developing countries [<xref rid="bibr23-1756283X16681708" ref-type="bibr">Hungin <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>]. In addition to the impact on patient&#x02019;s health, IBS is also associated with impaired quality of life, diminished work productivity and increased health and economic costs [<xref rid="bibr1-1756283X16681708" ref-type="bibr">Agarwal and Spiegel, 2011</xref>]. Although there is consensus on the application of clinical Rome Criteria to diagnose IBS and its subtypes [<xref rid="bibr28-1756283X16681708" ref-type="bibr">Longstreth <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>], up to 50% of patients still remain undiagnosed [<xref rid="bibr23-1756283X16681708" ref-type="bibr">Hungin <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>]. In addition, there is a lack of consensus on IBS treatment in terms of optimal pharmacological treatment, most useful drugs, specific indications for spasmolytic agents, timing of clinical response and duration of treatment.</p><p>Otilonium Bromide (OB) is a musculotropic spasmolytic agent belonging to the family of quaternary ammonium derivatives and successfully used in the treatment of patients affected by IBS due to its specific pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. The positive polarity of the head of the OB molecule determines the main pharmacokinetic property of this drug: a minimal systemic absorption and the consequently high safety profile. Studies on animal models revealed a specific OB accumulation in colonic circular muscle at therapeutic &#x000b5;m concentrations, while its plasma levels were 1000 times lower, together with a poor penetration of the drug in the central nervous system [<xref rid="bibr16-1756283X16681708" ref-type="bibr">Evangelista <italic>et al.</italic> 2000</xref>]. Consistently, after oral administration to healthy volunteers, the OB plasmatic concentration was very low, &#x0003c;1% of the drug was eliminated by urine, and 97% was eliminated by feces [<xref rid="bibr15-1756283X16681708" ref-type="bibr">Evangelista, 2004</xref>].</p><p>Recent clinical studies showed comparable safety and tolerability for OB and placebo [<xref rid="bibr10-1756283X16681708" ref-type="bibr">Clave <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>]. OB was shown to inhibit the main patterns of human sigmoid motility <italic>in vitro</italic>, including: the tone of smooth muscle cells (SMCs); the rhythmic phasic contractions induced by the interstitial cells of Cajal; and the strong contractions induced by stimulation of enteric motor neurons mainly by blocking the calcium influx through L-type calcium channels on SMCs [<xref rid="bibr20-1756283X16681708" ref-type="bibr">Gallego <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>]. Recent <italic>in vitro</italic> studies using cultured human colonic SMCs to further assess the musculotropic spasmolytic properties of OB confirmed that this drug causes smooth muscle relaxation through the inhibition of voltage-gated calcium channels (L-type &#x0003e; T-type) and the inhibition of muscarinic and tachykinergic effects [<xref rid="bibr30-1756283X16681708" ref-type="bibr">Martinez-Cutillas <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>]. All the above described pharmacodynamic properties mediate the musculotropic spasmolytic effects of OB. In addition, its interaction with the NK1/NK2 tachykinergic receptors in sensory afferent nerves may also improve the visceral hypersensitivity that affects patients with IBS [<xref rid="bibr37-1756283X16681708" ref-type="bibr">Rychter <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>].</p><p>We included in the present analysis three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies with a homogeneous treatment schedule of 3 &#x000d7; 40 mg OB daily for 15 weeks to measure the clinical efficacy of OB in patients with IBS. The first study was conducted in 23 Italian centers, and enrolled 325 patients with IBS [<xref rid="bibr4-1756283X16681708" ref-type="bibr">Battaglia <italic>et al.</italic> 1998</xref>]; the second study was conducted in 34 centers in eight European countries and enrolled 355 patients with IBS [<xref rid="bibr10-1756283X16681708" ref-type="bibr">Clave <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>]; the third study was conducted in Greece and enrolled 203 patients with IBS [<xref rid="bibr31-1756283X16681708" ref-type="bibr">Menarini IFR, 2012</xref>]. In all these studies, OB improved the main symptoms of patients with IBS, mostly related to abdominal pain. Drawbacks included the difficult translation of results to clinical practice for both patients and physicians due to the long-term primary endpoints (15 weeks), the need to define a global treatment response on the basis of improvements in the most frequent symptoms reported by patients and a strict intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, and the relevant placebo effect [<xref rid="bibr18-1756283X16681708" ref-type="bibr">Ford <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bibr10-1756283X16681708" ref-type="bibr">Clave <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bibr12-1756283X16681708" ref-type="bibr">Desborough and Ford, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bibr24-1756283X16681708" ref-type="bibr">Hungin, 2011</xref>].</p><p>In the current analysis, we collected the individual data from the three homogeneous randomized controlled trials (RCTs) described above [<xref rid="bibr4-1756283X16681708" ref-type="bibr">Battaglia <italic>et al.</italic> 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bibr10-1756283X16681708" ref-type="bibr">Clave <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bibr31-1756283X16681708" ref-type="bibr">Menarini IFR, 2012</xref>] and performed a pooled analysis, with the aim of evaluating the efficacy of OB treatment on the main IBS symptoms (including intensity and frequency of abdominal pain, severity of bloating, stool frequency and consistency), and the global treatment response assessed by patients and by their physicians.

The worst score recorded during the 2 weeks was used as the baseline score for further analysis. During the follow up, the scores were recorded in the diary every week.

Responders with regards to intensity, frequency, global evaluation of pain as a composite index of intensity and frequency, or severity of distention, were defined as patients having a reduction of score &#x02a7e;1 after 5, 10, and 15 weeks of treatment.

First, an analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used for the direct comparison between treatment groups, and then a general linear model (GLM) was used for the comparisons in which an impact of covariates was expected. Data were statistically analyzed using the analysis of covariance, including baseline intensity, sex, age, body mass index (BMI) as covariates and treatment as factor. The GLM was used to compare the efficacy parameters between the treatment groups considering the model baseline values of each parameter, age, sex and BMI as covariates. The GLM procedure provides regression analysis and ANOVA for one dependent variable (efficacy parameter) by more factors (treatment group and sex) and covariates (baseline values, age and BMI).</p><p>The same method used for the analysis of the end-of-treatment data (week 15) was applied to the data obtained at the intermediate visits (weeks 5 and 10).</p><p>Severity of pain assessed by VAS was analyzed using ANOVA performed on changes from baseline to the end of treatment.</p><p>Frequency tables were completed at each relevant time point for the rate of responders.

The vertical line in a forest plot corresponds to lack of effect. If the confidence intervals (CIs) for individual studies do not overlap with this line, it demonstrates that, at the given level of confidence (95%), their effect sizes differ from no effect. The same applies for the pooled measure of effect (pooled dataset): if the CI for the pooled dataset does not overlap with the vertical line corresponding to lack of effect, the overall result of pooled analysis differs from no effect at the 95% level of confidence.

The OBIS study included in this pooled analysis found an effect of OB in the reduction of episodes of abdominal pain, reduction of abdominal bloating, global efficacy by patient assessment and protection from IBS symptom relapse significantly greater than placebo at the end of the 15-week treatment period (primary endpoint) [<xref rid="bibr10-1756283X16681708" ref-type="bibr">Clave <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>]. In addition, safety and tolerability of OB was very high and similar to placebo, a result consistent with Poynard and colleagues&#x02019; meta-analysis [<xref rid="bibr34-1756283X16681708" ref-type="bibr">Poynard <italic>et al.</italic> 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bibr10-1756283X16681708" ref-type="bibr">Clave <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>]. A study conducted on Asian patients confirmed the effectiveness of OB in alleviating IBS symptoms [<xref rid="bibr6-1756283X16681708" ref-type="bibr">Chang <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>]. A recent literature review of the efficacy and tolerability of OB in the long-term management of patients with IBS confirmed that this drug reduces abdominal pain and discomfort in patients with IBS, exhibiting greater efficacy and tolerability than placebo or other similar drugs [<xref rid="bibr41-1756283X16681708" ref-type="bibr">Triantafillidis and Malgarinos, 2014</xref>]. Finally, a very recent study aiming at evaluating the dose-response relationship of 20 mg, 40 mg, 80 mg of OB or placebo administered three times daily for 4 weeks on functional or clinical efficacy IBS variables demonstrated that 40 mg and 80 mg of OB can improve individual and global clinical symptoms of IBS compared with placebo over a 4-week period [<xref rid="bibr8-1756283X16681708" ref-type="bibr">Chmielewska-Wilkon <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>]. Another recent literature review found OB was effective also in comparison with other drugs, such as pinaverium bromide and mebeverine, with a favorable tolerability profile [<xref rid="bibr19-1756283X16681708" ref-type="bibr">Forte <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>].</p><p>Overall, all these studies clearly prove that OB is well tolerated and is able to improve the symptoms of IBS.</p><p>Recently, the recommendation on primary endpoints to be used in trials for IBS has been changed from a co-primary endpoint of global assessment and pain to the separate evaluation of efficacy on stool-related abnormalities and on pain [<xref rid="bibr14-1756283X16681708" ref-type="bibr">European Medicines Agency, 2014</xref>]. In our pooled analysis, we found that OB improved both the intensity and the frequency of abdominal pain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1756283X16681708">Figure 2</xref>). The weak effect of OB administration on stool frequency and consistency we revealed could be attributed to an over-simplistic dichotomic analysis (normal/abnormal consistency instead of the specific Bristol scale) as well as to the relevant placebo effect, as the OBIS study showed a slight but significant reduction of stool frequency at the end of the OB treatment [<xref rid="bibr10-1756283X16681708" ref-type="bibr">Clave <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>].</p><p>IBS is a chronic and relapsing disease with cyclic periods of symptoms and frequent relapses to short [<xref rid="bibr25-1756283X16681708" ref-type="bibr">Jones <italic>et al.</italic> 1999</xref>] and long-term treatments [<xref rid="bibr7-1756283X16681708" ref-type="bibr">Chey <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>]. Antispasmodics are recommended as first line treatment for IBS patients with pain and bloating as dominant symptoms, but there is no agreement on the type of protocol to be selected for treatment (continuous, cyclic or intermittent, or &#x02018;on demand&#x02019;). Recently, an initial approach of 2&#x02013;3 months&#x02019; treatment has been shown to be effective in most patients [<xref rid="bibr17-1756283X16681708" ref-type="bibr">Evangelista, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bibr5-1756283X16681708" ref-type="bibr">Boeckxstaens <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>], as also supported by the relevant therapeutic effect observed at 10 and 15 weeks in this pooled analysis. However, symptom relapse occurs in up to 50% of IBS patients, making cyclic treatment necessary. Consequently, only well-tolerated drugs with proved effects on the specific relapsing symptoms should be used [<xref rid="bibr5-1756283X16681708" ref-type="bibr">Boeckxstaens <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>]. The OBIS study revealed that the therapeutic effect of OB during the 10-week follow-up period subsequent to the 15-week treatment period remained greater than the effect of placebo in terms of relapse-free probability and withdrawal rate due to symptom relapse [<xref rid="bibr10-1756283X16681708" ref-type="bibr">Clave <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>].</p><p>Considering the results from this pooled analysis together with the outcomes from previous studies, we can conclude that OB is well tolerated, has a strong therapeutic effect on abdominal pain, bloating and rate of responders as assessed by patients and by physicians, and prevents symptom relapse. OB has been on the market for over 30 years in over 40 countries in Europe, Central America, Asia (China, India, Pakistan, Korea and Philippines), the Middle East, and Africa (Egypt, French African countries). Our findings further support the therapeutic utility of OB in clinical practice.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Authors contribution: Pere Clav&#x000e9; and Jan Tack designed the study, acquired and analyzed and interpreted the data and drafted the manuscript.</p><p>We are grateful to Giorgio Reggiardo, Valentina Mirisola and Mateu Serra-Prat for statistical analysis, Jane Lewis for reviewing the manuscript and Drs Stefano Evangelista and Massimo Notari from Menarini International (Florence, Italy) for critical review of the manuscript.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> P.
