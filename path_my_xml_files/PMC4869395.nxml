Most haemorrhage deaths occur soon after childbirth. Severe post-partum bleeding is sometimes managed by the surgical removal of the uterus (hysterectomy). Death and hysterectomy are important health consequences of post-partum haemorrhage, and clinical trials of interventions aimed at preventing these outcomes are needed.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The World Maternal Antifibrinolytic trial aims to determine the effect of tranexamic acid on death, hysterectomy and other health outcomes in women with post-partum haemorrhage. It is an international, multicentre, randomised trial. Approximately 20,000 women with post-partum haemorrhage will be randomly allocated to receive an intravenous injection of either tranexamic acid or matching placebo in addition to usual care. The primary outcome measure is a composite of death in hospital or hysterectomy within 42&#x000a0;days of delivery. The cause of death will be described. Secondary outcomes include death, death due to bleeding, hysterectomy, thromboembolic events, blood transfusion, surgical and radiological interventions, complications, adverse events and quality of life. The health status and occurrence of thromboembolic events in breastfed babies will also be reported. We will conduct subgroup analyses for the primary outcome by time to treatment, type of delivery and cause of haemorrhage. We will conduct an analysis of treatment effect adjusted for baseline risk.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The World Maternal Antifibrinolytic trial should provide reliable evidence for the efficacy of tranexamic acid in the prevention of death, hysterectomy and other outcomes that are important to patients.

Most of these deaths occur soon after childbirth. Other leading causes of maternal death are pre-existing medical conditions, high blood pressure and sepsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Severe post-partum bleeding is sometimes managed by the surgical removal of the uterus (hysterectomy). As well as the morbidity from the surgery, hysterectomy can cause psychological distress, particularly in women who want to have more children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Death and hysterectomy are important health consequences of post-partum haemorrhage (PPH), and clinical trials of interventions aimed at preventing these outcomes are needed.</p><p>Tranexamic acid (TXA) reduces bleeding by inhibiting the enzymatic breakdown of the blood-clotting proteins fibrinogen and fibrin. A systematic review of clinical trials of TXA in surgery showed that TXA reduces blood loss by approximately one-third [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. TXA also reduces mortality in bleeding trauma patients. When given soon after injury, TXA reduces the risk of death due to bleeding by approximately one-third [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. A randomised, controlled, open-label trial of TXA in women with PPH showed that TXA reduced blood loss but recommended that a larger international study is needed to investigate whether TA can decrease the need for invasive procedures and reduce maternal morbidity in women with PPH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Also, a systematic review of TXA for the prevention and treatment of PPH concluded that insufficient evidence exists to support its use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Taken together, reason exists to believe that TXA might reduce deaths due to bleeding following childbirth.</p><p>The World Maternal Antifibrinolytic (WOMAN) trial aims to determine the effect of TXA on death, hysterectomy and other health outcomes in women with post-partum haemorrhage. The trial protocol was published before the start of the trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The planned sample size was increased from 15,000 to 20,000 participants in May 2014. This paper gives the reason for this increase and presents the statistical analysis plan. Recruitment of 20,000 women should be complete by the summer of 2016. The statistical analysis plan was completed before the treatment allocation was un-blinded.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design and patients</title><p>The WOMAN trial is an international, multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled trial. Adult women with post-partum haemorrhage following vaginal or caesarean section delivery who have a clinical diagnosis of post-partum haemorrhage are eligible for enrolment. The clinical diagnosis of PPH may be based on blood loss of over 500&#x000a0;mL after vaginal delivery or 1,000&#x000a0;mL after caesarean section or blood loss sufficient to compromise the haemodynamic stability. The fundamental eligibility criterion is the responsible clinician&#x02019;s &#x02018;uncertainty&#x02019; as to whether or not to use TXA in a particular woman with post-partum haemorrhage. Where TXA is indicated or was administered, or where it is contra-indicated, patients are not included in the trial. No pre-specified exclusion criteria exist. Patients receive all routine clinically indicated medical care and additionally are randomised to receive TXA or placebo. Hospitals where TXA is in routine use for PPH are not included in the trial. As the eligibility criteria automatically excluded patients who had received TXA, specific data on whether it was used before enrolment was not collected.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Randomisation and masking</title><p>Randomisation codes were generated and secured by an independent statistical consultant from Sealed Envelope Ltd (London, UK). Trial treatment packs are prepared in accordance with the randomisation list. Women eligible for inclusion are randomised to receive either active (TXA) or placebo (sodium chloride 0.9&#x000a0;%) intravenously. Baseline information is collected on the trial entry form, and the next lowest consecutively numbered pack is taken from a box of eight treatment packs. Once the treatment ampoule is confirmed as intact, the patient is considered to be randomised. Once a patient has been randomised, the outcome for the woman is obtained even if the trial treatment is interrupted or not given. Both participants and study staff (site investigators and trial coordinating centre staff) are masked to treatment allocation. An emergency un-blinding service is available.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Trial procedures</title><p>After eligibility is confirmed and the appropriate consent procedure followed, each patient is assigned a uniquely numbered treatment pack. In this way they are randomly allocated to receive 1 gram of TXA or placebo by intravenous injection. If bleeding continues after 30&#x000a0;minutes, or if bleeding stops and restarts within 24&#x000a0;h, a second dose of 1&#x000a0;g of TXA or placebo may be given. No pre-established maximum time between the start of PPH and administration of the study treatment exists. After a patient has been randomised, the outcome in hospital is collected even if the trial treatment is interrupted or is not actually given. Outcome is collected at 6&#x000a0;weeks (42&#x000a0;days, as this usually defines the post-partum period) after randomisation, at discharge from the randomising hospital or at death (whichever occurs first). Adverse events are reported in-hospital and after discharge up to day 42.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Ethics approval</title><p>Before the trial can start at a site, all relevant regulatory and ethics approvals are obtained. An additional file presents the current list of ethics approval for participating countries and sites (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Consent</title><p>The trial is being conducted in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use&#x02013;Good Clinical Practice (ICH-GCP), and participant consent is obtained in accordance with the approved protocol. The consent procedure used in the WOMAN Trial is detailed in the published protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The informed consent procedure used at each site is approved by the relevant ethics and regulatory agencies. In summary, consent is obtained from patients if physical and mental capacity allows consent. If a patient cannot give consent, proxy consent is obtained from a relative or representative. If a proxy was unavailable, then if permitted by local regulation, consent is deferred or waived. When consent is deferred or given by a proxy, the patient is informed about the trial as soon as possible, and consent obtained for use of the data collected, if needed.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Sample size</title><p>Before the trial started, we anticipated a baseline event rate of 2.5&#x000a0;% for death and 2.5&#x000a0;% for hysterectomy. Assuming a control group event rate of 2.5&#x000a0;% for death and 2.5&#x000a0;% for hysterectomy and that 1&#x000a0;% of women die after hysterectomy, a study with 15,000 women should have more than 90&#x000a0;% power to detect a 25&#x000a0;% reduction from 4&#x000a0;% to 3&#x000a0;% in the primary endpoint of death or hysterectomy at the 5&#x000a0;% significance level. Expected loss to follow-up (less than 1&#x000a0;%) should not impact importantly on the power (at the time of writing this Statistical Analysis Plan, we had achieved 99&#x000a0;% follow-up at 42&#x000a0;days after randomisation, at discharge from hospital or death).</p><p>However, because the case fatality observed in the trial (by December 2013) was higher (3&#x000a0;%) than expected, a modest increase in the sample size from 15,000 to 20,000 women would mean that the trial may have sufficient (90&#x000a0;%) power to detect a 25&#x000a0;% reduction in maternal mortality alone at the 5&#x000a0;% significance level. This increase also provided additional power to detect an effect on the composite endpoint of death or hysterectomy, whilst providing protection against the possibility that the effect of TXA on death and hysterectomy is different. Increasing the sample size to 20,000 women involved an extra 15&#x000a0;months of recruitment.</p><p>The primary outcome remains the same (i.e. a composite of death and hysterectomy) with death alone as a secondary outcome. The independent Data Monitoring Committee was aware of the higher case fatality, as these data were presented as part of their routine review. The independent Trial Steering Committee also reviewed and approved the sample size increase.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Statistical analysis</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Trial profile</title><p>The flow of study participants will be displayed in a CONSORT diagram [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], as shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.

Death and hysterectomy are important outcomes for women, are easily measured and could potentially be prevented by TXA. We use this composite endpoint to increase the number of outcome events, thereby increasing the statistical power to detect a treatment effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Although the increase in power comes at a cost of greater uncertainty in interpretation of the results, the use of a composite endpoint is justified if the components are of similar importance, occur with similar frequency and are likely to be affected to a similar degree by the treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Whilst hysterectomy cannot be considered as important as death, the composite may be justified on the basis that hysterectomy is conducted as a last resort to prevent death from bleeding, in which case this less serious outcome may be a reasonable surrogate for maternal death.</p><p>We anticipated that death and hysterectomy would occur with similar frequency. Whether death and hysterectomy will be affected to a similar degree by TXA is unknown, but to the extent that death and hysterectomy are direct consequences of bleeding, we should expect effects in the same direction, if not of a similar magnitude.</p><p>During the trial, site monitoring showed that some hysterectomies are conducted before randomisation. For example, in response to the onset of severe life-threatening bleeding during caesarean section, an obstetrician may decide to conduct a hysterectomy, and while the hysterectomy is underway, the woman is enrolled into the trial. Similarly, in some cases of uterine rupture, a hysterectomy is sometimes done prior to randomisation. In other cases, a hysterectomy was conducted in a peripheral hospital, and the woman is enrolled into the WOMAN trial after having been transferred for the management of ongoing bleeding. Although TXA might reduce the risk of death in these cases, it could not affect the risk of hysterectomy because the hysterectomy was carried out prior to randomisation. Including such patients in the analysis will dilute the treatment effect towards the null. Therefore, only hysterectomies carried out after randomisation will be included. All hysterectomies will be monitored before database lock using the Primary Outcome Monitoring Form to confirm which ones were done after randomisation (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>).</p><p>Pearson&#x02019;s chi-squared test will be used as the primary test of statistical significance of the effect of treatment allocation on the composite of death or hysterectomy by 42&#x000a0;days.

The CRASH-2 trial, which recruited 20,210 adults with significant traumatic bleeding, showed that TXA reduces death due to bleeding (RR&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.85, 95&#x000a0;% CI 0.76&#x02013;0.96) and all-cause mortality (RR&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.91, 95&#x000a0;% CI 0.85&#x02013;0.97), with no increase in vascular occlusive events. The CRASH-2 trial investigators hypothesised that TXA would be most effective when given soon after injury, when bleeding is profuse, but less effective later, when the acute phase response to trauma increases the risk of thrombosis. They tested this hypothesis by conducting a pre-specified subgroup analysis of the effect of TXA by time from injury to the start of treatment (&#x02264;&#x02009;1, 1&#x02013;&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;3, 3&#x02013;8&#x000a0;h) and found strong evidence in support of their hypothesis (test of homogeneity <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001). In patients treated within 3&#x000a0;h of injury, TXA substantially reduced the risk of death due to bleeding, but when given after 3&#x000a0;h, TXA appeared to increase the risk of death due to bleeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>Early activation of fibrinolysis is common after trauma and is associated with increased mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Tissue plasminogen activator (TPA), the enzyme that converts plasminogen to the active fibrinolytic enzyme plasmin, is stored within the vascular endothelium in secretory organelles called Weibel Palade bodies. Trauma triggers the rapid release of tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) from the vascular endothelium resulting in fibrinolysis and increased bleeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. By inhibiting early fibrinolysis, TXA reduces the risk of exsanguination. The apparent increase in death due to bleeding with late TXA administration may reflect PAI-1-induced suppression of fibrinolysis and the onset of thrombotic disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The latter is characterised by intravascular activation of coagulation with widespread fibrin deposition. By inhibiting fibrinolysis, TXA could worsen thrombotic DIC. Although the underlying pathology is thrombotic, due to the consumption of coagulation factors, thrombotic DIC usually manifests as bleeding.</p><p>Similar temporal changes in fibrinolysis have been observed after childbirth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Within 1&#x000a0;h of delivery, the serum concentration of TPA doubles, possibly due to the trauma of childbirth. Thereafter, the TPA concentration falls steeply. On the other hand, levels of the plasminogen activator inhibitors (PAI-1 and PAI-2) are increased around the time of delivery and remain so for several days. We might therefore expect TXA would be most effective when given soon after delivery, when TPA levels are highest, and less effective (possibly even harmful) when given several hours after delivery, when the risk of thrombotic DIC may be increased. We will examine this hypothesis by conducting a sub-group analysis of the effect of TXA according to the time interval between delivery and TXA treatment (&#x02264;1, &#x0003e; 1 to&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;3, &#x0003e; 3&#x000a0;h). The outcome measure for this subgroup analysis will be death due to bleeding. The results of this analysis will be considered in the context of the relevant biological and clinical data on the time to treatment interaction.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Type of delivery</title><p>Because a substantial proportion of all deliveries are by caesarean section and caesarean section is an established risk factor for post-partum haemorrhage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], it is important to examine whether the effect of TXA on the risk of death and hysterectomy varies by type of delivery. We do not anticipate substantial heterogeneity by type of delivery.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Primary cause of post-partum haemorrhage</title><p>For post-partum haemorrhage due to uterine atony, uterotonics are recommended as the first line treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. It is believed that uterine contraction will compress the spiral arteries and reduce bleeding. When planning the WOMAN trial, some reviewers expressed concern that administration of the WOMAN trial treatment might lead to fewer women receiving prophylactic uterotonics. For this reason, we collected information on uterotonic use and planned a sub-group analysis on the basis of whether or not uterotonics were administered. It was suggested that TXA would be less effective in women who receive uterotonics, particularly when uterine atony is the cause of bleeding. However, because 99&#x000a0;% of women recruited to May 2014 received uterotonics, the planned subgroup analysis would be uninformative. Instead, we will examine the effect of TXA by cause of the bleeding (uterine atony versus all other causes) as determined at baseline. We do not anticipate substantial heterogeneity by cause of haemorrhage.</p><p>The main analysis for the pre-specified subgroups will be an unadjusted test of interaction in a logistic regression model to assess evidence for whether the effect of treatment differs across subgroup categories. Unless there is strong evidence against the null hypothesis of homogeneity of effects (i.e. <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001), the overall relative risk will be considered the most reliable guide to the approximate relative risks in all subgroups. For each subgroup, we will report frequencies and percentages per arm with the RR and 99&#x000a0;% CI as estimates of stratum-specific treatment effects, with the <italic>p</italic> value for the test of interaction.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Secondary outcomes</title><sec id="Sec21"><title>Death</title><p>Death will be analysed (separately from hysterectomy) as a secondary outcome. As outlined above, although the use of a composite endpoint increases the statistical power, if the effect of TXA on death and hysterectomy are not similar, it could make interpretation of the primary results difficult. The causes of death will be analysed as shown in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. Also, there is no reason to believe that TXA can prevent deaths from causes such as eclampsia or sepsis, unless death from these other causes is made more likely by bleeding. Therefore, we will assess the effect of TXA on all-cause mortality and cause-specific mortality (death due to bleeding, pulmonary embolism and other causes (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).

However, it is still possible that a chance imbalance in important prognostic factors could influence the results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. To investigate this possibility, we will conduct an analysis of the effect of treatment that is adjusted for baseline risk. We will build a prognostic model based on pre-specified baseline variables and use it to estimate the predicted risk of the outcome at baseline.</p><p>The primary outcome is death or hysterectomy; death due to bleeding is an important secondary outcome. The most important prognostic factors for these outcomes that are measured at baseline are maternal age, estimated blood loss, systolic blood pressure and haemodynamic instability. These variables will be included in a multivariable prognostic model based on the final trial dataset. Although there are almost complete data on these variables, in the case of missing data, the missing values will be replaced by the mean of the observed data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p>The trial data will then be stratified into risk deciles as shown in Tables&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab8" ref-type="table">8</xref> and <xref rid="Tab9" ref-type="table">9</xref> based on the predicted risk of the outcomes at baseline. We will report frequencies and percentages within each risk decile, and calculate a risk ratio (with 95&#x000a0;% CI) for each risk decile. The pooled risk ratio (with a 95&#x000a0;% CI) will be estimated as an inverse variance weighted average of the stratum-specific risk ratios. The pooled risk ratio should provide an estimate of the treatment effect that is un-confounded by baseline risk. The advantage of this approach is that the effect of baseline risk on the treatment effect is more explicit than when covariate-adjusted odds ratios are calculated using logistic regression. Furthermore, risk ratios are easier to interpret and apply to individual patients than are odds ratios [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].<table-wrap id="Tab8"><label>Table 8</label><caption><p>Death or hysterectomy by predicted risk at baseline</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Risk decile<sup>a</sup>

We will use a chi-squared test to assess any heterogeneity in the treatment effect across the risk groups, and we will calculate the I-squared statistic to quantify the percentage of variability in effect estimates that is due to heterogeneity rather than chance. To reduce the likelihood of making inappropriate inferences, we pre-specify that unless there is strong evidence against the null hypothesis of homogeneity of effects (i.e. <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001), the pooled relative risk will be considered the most reliable guide to the approximate treatment effects in all risk strata. We do not anticipate substantial heterogeneity by baseline risk. However, we hypothesise that the risk reduction with TXA would be greatest in patients at low risk of death since a smaller proportion of these women will have un-survivable bleeding.</p></sec><sec id="Sec32"><title>Analysis 2: Cost-effectiveness</title><p>An economic analysis will be relevant if TXA clearly demonstrates efficacy in achieving its clinical aims. In this case, the study will be undertaken in the form of a cost-effectiveness analysis with the aim of estimating the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio comparing the use of TXA with normal clinical practice. Analysis will be based on adjusted life years gained. A further analysis will explore the use of the EQ-5D data to quality-adjusted survival. In this study, the economic analysis is clearly bounded as virtually all significant resource use will occur in the initial period of hospitalisation. As such, neither a long-term resource analysis nor an analysis of out-of-hospital costs will be required. The trial use of TXA is likely to mirror its use in normal clinical practice, hence the cost-effectiveness estimated in the trial (adjusted for protocol driven costs) will closely approximate cost-effectiveness in actual clinical practice. Data on physical resource consumption (e.g. the length and nature of hospital stay) will be collected for each patient and a common unit cost at a country level will be applied. A sensitivity analysis will be undertaken to assess the robustness of the economic analysis in response to variations in key variables such as drug prices. In all cases, the economic analysis will be integrated with the clinical trial procedures to optimise efficiency and minimise inconvenience to patients.</p><p>Mechanical ventilation and intensive care unit (ICU) admission are resource consumption measures and are not required for all patients. Mechanical ventilation will be summarised as number and percentage of patients per arm who received such a therapy. Where mechanical ventilation is used exclusively for general anaesthetic for surgery, this data is excluded. Length of stay in the ICU and the hospital will be censored due to early deaths or by a stay in the ICU or hospital longer than 42&#x000a0;days. Summary statistics will include the median and the interquartile range computed separately for each treatment arm.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec33"><title>Data monitoring and interim analyses</title><p>An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) is responsible for reviewing the progress of the trial, including recruitment, data quality and main outcomes and safety data. The DMC has the responsibility for deciding whether, while randomisation is in progress, the un-blinded results (or the un-blinded results for a particular subgroup), should be revealed to the TSC. They will do this if, and only if, two conditions are satisfied: (1) the results provide proof beyond reasonable doubt that treatment is on balance either definitely harmful or definitely favourable for all, or for a particular category of, participants in terms of the major outcome, and (2) the results, if revealed, would be expected to substantially change the prescribing patterns of clinicians who are already familiar with other trial results that exist. Exact criteria for &#x02018;proof beyond reasonable doubt&#x02019; are not, and cannot be, specified by a purely mathematical stopping rule, but they are strongly influenced by such rules. This is in agreement with the Haybittle-Peto stopping rule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], whereby an interim analysis of major endpoint would generally need to involve a difference between treatment and control of at least three standard errors to justify premature disclosure. An interim subgroup analysis would have to be even more extreme to justify disclosure. This rule has the advantage that the exact number and timing of interim analyses need not be pre-specified. In summary, the stopping rules require extreme differences to justify premature disclosure and involve an appropriate combination of mathematical stopping rules and scientific judgment. To date, seven interim analyses by the DMC have been conducted with no recommendation for early stopping.</p></sec><sec id="Sec34"><title>Data management and analysis software</title><p>The clinical database management system for WOMAN Trial was built to comply with ICH-GCP and uses MySQL and its accompanying manuals.
