Infections in Intensive Care are associated with a 2&#x02013;3 times increased risk of death. It is thought that under conditions of severe metabolic stress glutamine becomes "conditionally essential". Selenium is an essential trace element that has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Approximately 23% of patients in Intensive Care require parenteral nutrition and glutamine and selenium are either absent or present in low amounts. Both glutamine and selenium have the potential to influence the immune system through independent biochemical pathways. Systematic reviews suggest that supplementing parenteral nutrition in critical illness with glutamine or selenium may reduce infections and mortality. Pilot data has shown that more than 50% of participants developed infections, typically resistant organisms. We are powered to show definitively whether supplementation of PN with either glutamine or selenium is effective at reducing new infections in critically ill patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>2 &#x000d7; 2 factorial, pragmatic, multicentre, double-blind, randomised controlled trial. The trial has an enrolment target of 500 patients. Inclusion criteria include: expected to be in critical care for at least 48 hours, aged 16 years or over, patients who require parenteral nutrition and are expected to have at least half their daily nutritional requirements given by that route.</p><p>Allocation is to one of four iso-caloric, iso-nitrogenous groups: glutamine, selenium, both glutamine &#x00026; selenium or no additional glutamine or selenium. Trial supplementation is given for up to seven days on the Intensive Care Unit and subsequent wards if practicable. The primary outcomes are episodes of infection in the 14 days after starting trial nutrition and mortality. Secondary outcomes include antibiotic usage, length of hospital stay, quality of life and cost-effectiveness.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>To date more than 285 patients have been recruited to the trial from 10 sites in Scotland. Recruitment is due to finish in August 2008 with a further six months follow up. We expect to report the results of the trial in summer 2009.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>This trial is registered with the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number system. <bold>ISRCTN87144826</bold></p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Intensive care unit (ICU) and subsequent hospital mortality in the UK remains high, with figures of 15&#x02013;20% and 30% respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The cost per ICU bed-day exceeds &#x000a3;1,100 based on a mean from all trusts in England and Wales [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In many countries, including the UK, provision of intensive care is inadequate to meet demand. Infections acquired on the ICU have been associated with a two to three fold increased risk of death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], this is associated with both illness and drug related impairment of the patient's immune system. Multiple portals for infection include: tracheal tubes, nasogastric tubes, chest and abdominal drains, central venous, pulmonary arterial and urinary catheters, wounds, and infective loci present before admission to ICU. These infections increase mortality, morbidity, length-of-stay, antibiotic usage and costs of care. As a result 40&#x02013;50% of patients on ICU are prescribed antibiotics at any one time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Such concentrated antibiotic usage may contribute to ICU, hospital and even community antibiotic resistance, which is a major health care issue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>A European point prevalence study in ICUs showed that 66% of patients were receiving artificial nutritional support, 42% of whom were receiving either parenteral nutrition alone (23%) or parenteral combined with enteral nutrition (19%). [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Although the enteral feeding route is preferred to parenteral (reduced costs of administration and reduced risk of infective complications from the intravenous line), parenteral nutrition (PN) retains an important supportive role in the management of ICU patients, many of whom cannot be fed effectively by the enteral route because of gastro-intestinal dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><sec><title>Glutamine</title><p>Standard amino acid formulations do not contain any of the amino acid glutamine, due to pharmaceutical stability problems. In the past glutamine was considered a non-essential amino acid therefore its omission from parenteral nutrition preparations was not considered to be a problem, as it was thought that the body would synthesise its own. Glutamine has essential roles in acid-base balance, nitrogen transport and maintaining muscle mass and function, and is an energy source for rapidly dividing cells, particularly those of the immune system and gut. As the most abundant amino acid in the body, it is now recognised that glutamine synthesis and release is insufficient to meet demands under severe metabolic stress. Glutamine must therefore be supplied from nutritional sources if levels are to be maintained. Several studies have shown that glutamine levels decrease markedly after major surgery and during critical illness. Decreased serum glutamine has been associated with immune dysfunction in animal models and death or infectious complications in septic patients. In randomised controlled trials (RCTs) amongst patients, glutamine-supplemented PN has been associated with improved nitrogen balance, higher intra-muscular glutamine levels, improved mood, enhanced immune cell function and no elevation of proinflammatory cytokine profile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In animal models glutamine enhances intracellular glutathione (which combats free radical tissue damage) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Such effects of glutamine support on the stressed immune system in the patient receiving critical care could lead to '<italic>successful inflammation'</italic>, i.e. the ability to combat infection, and decrease the systemic inflammatory response syndrome, where excessive free radical induced damage occurs.</p><p>Thus provision of glutamine could be of considerable benefit in metabolically stressed critically ill patients. Although the proposed benefits are biologically plausible it is unclear whether they will be obtained in practice and there is a danger that glutamine-containing PN solutions will be incorporated into practice without adequate evaluation, thus our evaluation is timely.</p></sec><sec><title>Selenium</title><p>Selenium is an essential trace element found in a group of proteins known as selenoproteins and which is present in only modest amounts within standard PN solutions. Selenium, through glutathione peroxidases and thioredoxin reductase is involved in anti-oxidant defences, and also has anti-inflammatory properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] mediated by inhibition of lipid peroxidation. Selenium is also essential to the production of thyroid hormones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. It is noteworthy that populations in many areas of Europe, including Scotland, are relatively selenium deficient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Given the widely documented immunosuppression of critical illness, and its correlation with mortality and the purported roles of reactive oxygen species in sepsis, pancreatitis, organ dysfunction and other inflammatory conditions, it is biologically plausible that enhanced selenium supplementation could also be of benefit to the critically ill ICU patient requiring parenteral nutrition.</p><p>It can be seen from the above background that both glutamine and selenium have the potential to influence the immune system, through different sites in biochemical pathways. Thus a factorial design for the proposed RCT is appropriate to test the two hypotheses.</p></sec><sec><title>Systematic reviews</title><p>A systematic review of glutamine supplementation in critically ill (including following major surgery) adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] found 14 small RCTs reporting data from 737 patients on mortality, infectious complications, and length of hospital stay. When both parenteral and enteral routes of supplementation are combined, complications were lower in the glutamine group (risk ratio 0.81, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.99). There was also a trend towards a reduction in mortality (risk ratio 0.79, 95% CI .59 to 1.04) and reduced length of hospital stay, especially for surgical patients.</p><p>A more recent systematic review using random effects methods of meta-analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] found that parenteral glutamine in critical illness was associated with a relative risk for mortality of 0.75 (95% CI 0.52 to 1.07) and for infection of 0.71 (95% CI 0.49 to 1.05). There was however, evidence of publication bias in the reporting of participants' infections. The existing evidence is suggestive of a positive role for glutamine supplementation but a further large trial is required to determine whether any differences are statistically and clinically important.</p><p>A Cochrane systematic review of selenium supplementation in critical illness, has identified seven randomised controlled trials of sodium selenite supplementation in critical illness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Five trials examined the effect of additional selenium supplementation on mortality at 28 days, and showed a reduction trend in those supplemented with selenium (relative risk 0.71, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.17, random effects model). The relative risk for mortality, whenever determined, for general intensive care patients was 0.75 (95% CI 0.59 to 0.96, random effects model). Based on reported information, these were poor quality trials. Indeed, only one clearly reported concealment of allocation and a further three trials undertook intention to treat analysis.</p><p>In a systematic review of antioxidant nutrients in critical illness, Heyland and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] found that selenium supplementation (alone and in combination with other antioxidants) may be associated with reduced mortality (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.08). Clearly, a larger trial to examine the clinical effects of additional selenium supplementation in this patient group is required.,</p><sec><title>Pilot Study</title><p>The purpose of the pilot study was to test the full protocol with the aim of assessing feasibility and refining PN stock management. It was carried out in two Scottish centres; Aberdeen and Edinburgh. Patients enrolled to the pilot study were recruited and processed in the same manner as the full trial and we plan to analyse these data in the final data set.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec><title>Methods and Design</title><sec><title>The questions which this protocol will address</title><sec><title>The questions which this trial will address</title><p>&#x02022; Does the inclusion of glutamine, additional selenium or the two in combination, in a standard preparation of PN improve the outcome for critically ill patients particularly in terms of participants with infections, mortality, ICU and acute hospital stay?</p><p>&#x02022; Is supplementation of PN with glutamine, additional selenium, or the two in combination cost-effective?</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Trial recruitment</title><p>The trial will involve people expected to be on intensive care and high dependency units (levels 2 and 3 care) under the care of the intensive care unit consultants for at least 48 hours, aged 16 years or over, who require parenteral nutrition and are expected to have at least half of daily nutritional requirements given by that route. Pregnant women and people whose expected stay in the UK is less than six months will not be considered for the study. Patients with severe renal failure (creatinine clearance &#x0003c; 10 ml/min and not on renal replacement therapy) will also be excluded.</p><p>In the case of hepatic failure, metabolism by the liver is the main route of elimination for many drugs and nutrients, but the hepatic reserve appears to be large and liver disease has to be severe before important changes occur. Routine liver function tests (LFTs) are a poor guide to the capacity of the liver to metabolise drugs, and it is not possible to predict the extent to which the metabolism of a particular drug or nutrient may be impaired. Enrolment will depend on the decision of the local physician. However, caution will be advised when:</p><p>1. A 3-fold increase in LFTs above baseline for the patient is seen.</p><p>2. Any derangement in liver synthetic function is noted.</p><p>Intensive care unit staff (doctors or nurses) based in each clinical centre will identify potential participants. A log will be kept of patients meeting the inclusion criteria, describing the reasons if they are not subsequently recruited to the trial. The recruitment procedure to be followed is detailed in the SIGNET trial handbook (version 4 15-03-06).</p></sec><sec><title>Informing potential participants about the trial</title><p>If the patient is able to give consent, ICU staff (doctors or nurses) will describe the study, backing oral information with the standard study information leaflet. If, as is more likely, the patient will be unable to give consent, intensive care unit staff will describe the study to relatives of the patient, backing oral information with the standard study information leaflet.</p></sec><sec><title>Consent to participate</title><p>Once eligibility has been confirmed, authorised personnel will ask if the potential participant is ready to decide whether or not to join the trial. If so, she/he will give the participant a consent form. After the doctor or nurse has checked that the consent form is understood, the nurse or doctor will invite the participant to sign the form, then will add their own name and countersign it. In the case of relatives giving assent, the same procedure will be followed using the consent form. Copies of the signed consent form and information sheet will be placed in the hospital notes. If the participant subsequently becomes able to give consent, after assent has been obtained from the relative, the study will be described to the participant using the information sheet and consent form.</p><p>If the relative is not present and cannot attend the ICU to sign the written assent within 24 hours of the patient requiring PN, but is prepared to grant assent based on the information read out to them over the phone and subsequent discussion, verbal assent will be recorded. Written record of assent at a later time will be obtained if feasible. In all cases a written information sheet will be provided when they attend or a copy sent to them by post if they are unable to attend. Separate consent forms for verbal consent have been prepared.</p><p>In the unlikely event that there is no personal legal representative (next of kin) it is possible to recruit the patient to the study, provided a professional legal representative (or equivalent in England, Wales or Ireland) has been appointed by the hospital for that person.</p></sec><sec><title>Information collected at trial entry</title><p>Once a participant has agreed to join the trial, ICU staff will record on a standard form:</p><sec><title>1.

Potential trial sites listed in the ethics application are: Aberdeen Royal Infirmary, Western General Edinburgh, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, Western Infirmary Glasgow, Ninewells Hospital Dundee, Stirling Royal Infirmary, Dumfries and Galloway Royal Infirmary, Monklands Hospital Coatbridge, Southern General Hospital Glasgow, Victoria Infirmary Glasgow, Royal Alexandra Hospital Paisley, St John's Hospital Livingston, Queen Margaret Hospital Dunfermline, Raigmore Hospital Inverness. The SIGNET trial will start initially in the pilot sites, Aberdeen Royal Infirmary and the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh along with Ninewells Hospital, Dundee. The study may be extended to include sites outside Scotland if this is considered necessary in which case, possible sites include Cardiff Royal Infirmary, Belfast Royal Infirmary, and Newcastle Royal Infirmary.</p><p>The study nurse will ensure that data are fully collected for participants.

Data on costs to the NHS including treatments, investigations and consultations will be collected as part of the economic evaluation. The type of economic evaluation performed will depend upon the findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Both deterministic and stochastic sensitivity analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] will be used to explore the importance of the uncertainty surrounding estimates of effectiveness, cost, and cost-effectiveness/utility. NHS resource use will be costed using appropriate unit costs. These will be taken from published sources (e.g. drug costs from the British National Formulary and GP cost from published estimates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], manufacturers' list prices (e.g. consumables, equipment)) or using study-specific estimates. QALYs will be calculated using the EQ5D scores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The EQ5D has been successfully used to measure changes in quality of life in patients discharged from ICU [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Power calculation</title><p>The primary endpoint for the trial is the proportion of patients acquiring infection(s) after starting trial PN. Systematic reviews indicate that the reduction in proportion of patients acquiring infections in previous trials ranged from approximately 50% in the control arm to 40% in the intervention arm. Removing Griffiths' glutamine trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] &#x02013; which only reported infections in a post-hoc analysis &#x02013; shows the effect may indeed be greater (from 50% in the control arm to 30% in the intervention arm). A plausible reduction to detect would be the midpoint of these two estimates (i.e. a reduction from 50% to 35%), hence 340 participants would be required to detect this size of difference (with 80% power and 2p &#x0003c; 0.05) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>Given the high mortality rates in critical care patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], we have allowed for potential loss of patients to follow-up over the six months (see below &#x02013; this would primarily affect secondary outcomes such as quality of life measures). We have consequently inflated the sample size requirement by approximately 20%, thus plan to recruit 500 patients to the trial.</p><p>Based on routine data available from the Scottish Intensive Care Society (SICS) audit database, the average length of ICU stay for patients receiving PN is approximately 9 (SD 7) days. For a 2 day reduction in ICU stay to be detected, with 80% power and 2p &#x0003c; 0.05, a trial of approximately 400 patients would be required. As we do not expect any dropout from the trial prior to discharge, we are adequately powered to detect this level of change.</p><p>A trial with 500 patients would allow us to detect a quarter of a standard deviation (0.25SD) change in hospital length of stay with 80% power and 5% significance (assuming all data for length of stay are available).</p><p>A trial of 340 patients would have 80% power and 5% significance to detect differences in Quality of Life measures of approximately 0.33SD (a third of a standard deviation change) or 90% power to detect a 0.5SD change. Previous research in the behavioural field suggests that a 0.5SD change is the level of change that should be associated with a moderate change in quality of life measures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. As such we are well powered to detect meaningful changes in quality of life measures.</p><sec><title>Recruitment rates</title><p>Approximately 900 patients per annum receive PN in Scottish Intensive Care Units (source: SICS audit database). Assuming a conservative recruitment rate &#x02013; that we recruit a third of eligible patients &#x02013; we expect to recruit the 500 patients required within a two-year recruitment phase.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Data analysis</title><p>Analysis of dichotomous outcomes will be analysed using statistical tests such the Chi-squared test. Continuous measures will be analysed using t-tests (with transformation of data to Normality if appropriate), or non-parametric equivalents. A further analysis accounting for the inter-relationship between deaths and length of stay will be undertaken, akin to that described for ventilator-free days by Rubenfield [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] mentioned earlier. This, for example, would allow the apparently short length of stays associated with early deaths to be accounted for appropriately. A significance level of 2p &#x0003c; 0.05 will be considered as evidence of statistical significance for the primary outcomes. Confidence intervals will also be presented where appropriate. The economic analysis will incorporate sensitivity analysis, and confidence intervals will be constructed around stochastic cost data using techniques such as bootstrapping [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Organisation</title><sec><title>Local organisation</title><p>Each collaborating centre will identify a principal investigator.

The final version will be agreed by the Trial Steering Committee before submission for publication, on behalf of the Collaboration. In this case the authorship will be presented by the collective title &#x02013; The SIGNET Trial Group &#x02013; and the article will carry a footnote of the names of the people (and their institutions) represented by the corporate title.

Prior to the implementation of the EU Directive in 2004, the MHRA confirmed that the exemptions would be rolled over to a Clinical Trial Authorisation.</p><p>The development of the protocol, ethical, research and development approvals had to negotiate the administrative constraints of the European Directive on Clinical Trials when applied to non-commercial trials.</p><p>Efficient and economical provision of parenteral nutrition at recruiting centres required collaboration with a pharmacy holding a license to compound the investigational medicinal product. We are grateful to Tayside Pharmaceuticals for their continued support and provision of 2 "base" bags of blinded parenteral nutrition, one with glutamine and one without. The two PN base bags have a 90 day stability. Thus, transportation and stock management are vital to the trial success and in particular, minimisation of wastage. Participating pharmacy departments and the central supplier have access to a custom designed website that has information on stock inventory, its shelf life and site PN usage. When this is combined with a comprehensive, refrigerated delivery service and an emergency contract with a national courier, PN supply has become more efficient.</p><p>Addition of selenium and electrolytes by the individual participating pharmacies allows SIGNET centres to recruit patients with only a 5 day stock of 2 "base" bags of PN. Debate exists as to whether the addition of selenium at each centre constitutes a licensable action. Notably, selenium is one of the 2 Investigational Medicinal Products (IMPs) for this trial. A final decision is expected from competent authority in due course.</p><p>Trial management is divided between Edinburgh where the Chief Investigator and Trial Coordinator are based and Aberdeen University where the trial office is based (as described above). The University of Edinburgh is administering the MRC Grant. SIGNET is a multicentre trial and the use of teleconferencing and the willingness of the current TrialCo-ordinator to travel has made the arrangement successful.</p><p>The EU clinical trials directive requests that each trial must have an identified sponsor. NHS Lothian is the lead NHS organisation and the Sponsor of the SIGNET trial with collaboration from the Centre for Healthcare Randomised Trials (CHaRT), within the University of Aberdeen. Increasing investment in trial supporting infrastructure has facilitated trial monitoring and documentation for site monitoring and source document verification. Pharmacovigilance is managed by Aberdeen University as the trial office has infrastructure and procedures in place for reporting Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSARs).</p><p>The study is being conducted throughout Scotland and involves patients in intensive care and high dependency units. The collaboration and support of the staff in the Critical Care areas is essential in running this study. There are currently 10 sites in Scotland recruiting patients and to date over 285 patients have been recruited.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>SIGNET <underline>S</underline>cottish <underline>I</underline>ntensive care <underline>G</underline>lutamine or sele<underline>N</underline>ium <underline>E</underline>valuative <underline>T</underline>rial</p><p>PN Parenteral Nutrition</p><p>EN Enteral Nutrition</p><p>EU European Union</p><p>ICU Intensive Care Unit</p><p>CCU Critical Care Unit</p><p>UK United Kingdom</p><p>Dept Department</p><p>RCT Randomised Controlled Trial</p><p>CI Confidence Interval</p><p>RR Relative Risk</p><p>LFTs Liver Function Tests</p><p>NHS National Health Service</p><p>APACHE Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation</p><p>SOFA Sequential Organ failure Assessment</p><p>g gram</p><p>&#x003bc;g microgram</p><p>kcal kilocalorie</p><p>ml millilitres</p><p>Kg kilogram</p><p>SF-12 Short Form 12</p><p>EQ-5D Euoquol 5D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]</p><p>ISD Information and Statistics Division (Scotland)</p><p>ONS National Office of Statistics</p><p>GP General Practitioner</p><p>SSAR Suspected Serious Adverse Reaction</p><p>SUSAR Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions</p><p>QALYs quality adjusted life years</p><p>SICS Scottish Intensive Care Society</p><p>ChaRT Centre for Healthcare Randomised Trial</p><p>GCP Good clinical practise</p><p>LREC Local research ethics committee</p><p>REC Research ethics committee</p><p>CRF Case report form</p><p>SOP Standard operating procedure</p><p>MHRA Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency</p><p>DMC Data monitoring committee</p><p>TSC Trial steering committee</p><p>MRC Medical Research Council</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>Peter JD Andrews (Chief Investigator), Alison Avenell, Claire Battison, Marion K Campbell, Bernard L Croal, Anne C Milne, David Noble, John Norrie, William G Simpson, Luke D Vale, Jonathon Cook &#x00026; Robyn de Verteuil &#x02013; The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>DN, AA, PJDA, MC, LV, BC, WS conceived the study, participated in its design and drafted the manuscript.
