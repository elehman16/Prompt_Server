TiF<sub>4</sub> is a topical fluoride agent that forms a titanium-rich glaze/coating following its application. Attributed to this coating is the anticaries effect observed in enamel treated with this agent in de- and re-mineralization studies. This layer offers a diffusion barrier and retains fluoride, leading to slow release onto the tooth and into its environment.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] The hydrolysis of TiF<sub>4</sub> has been known since 1967,[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and in light of these data, a huge effort has been made to create new compounds to establish and realize its clinical use.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>The ability of &#x003b2;-CD to improve the pH of TiF<sub>4</sub> has already been examined in the literature.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] The remineralizing pH-cycling study was chosen because its potential to penetrate the demineralized enamel had not yet been studied. This is the first study to analyze the effect of TiF<sub>4</sub> associated with &#x003b2;-CD incorporated into solution in a remineralization study design.</p><p>As described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, the inclusion complex tested here was capable of rehardening the enamel subsurface after pH cycling. According to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, the TiF<sub>4</sub>: &#x003b2;-CD inclusion complex solution was capable of remineralizing the predemineralized enamel subsurface up to a depth of 40 &#x003bc;m as mentioned previously. An <italic>in situ</italic> study evaluating the effect of sodium fluoride and TiF<sub>4</sub> varnish and solution on carious demineralization of enamel demonstrated that TiF<sub>4</sub> was not able to reharden the enamel subsurface.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] We can hypothesize that the <italic>in situ</italic> conditions utilized in that study (presence of biofilm) did not allow the penetration of the titanium to the subsurface.</p><p>Some researchers agree with our results with respect to the enhancement of subsurface hardness. When conducting an <italic>in vitro</italic> study on demineralization and remineralization of bovine enamel by 4% TiF<sub>4</sub> varnish, it was observed that 4% TiF<sub>4</sub> varnish significantly enhanced the mineral content compared with the other treatments (Duraphat<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> and Duofluorid<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) up to a depth of 30 &#x003bc;m.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] The inclusion complex tested here was able to improve the mineral content up to a depth of 40 &#x003bc;m, according to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>. A difference concerning these two studies refers to the adopted concentration, which was 1% and the solution of a nanoinclusion complex of TiF<sub>4</sub>: &#x003b2;-CD instead of a TiF<sub>4</sub> varnish. It is important to point out that that study[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and the present paper adopted a single application of TiF<sub>4</sub> over the enamel blocks.</p><p>The SEM study of the predemineralized enamel blocks showed the formation of an acid-resistant TiO<sub>2</sub> coating changing the resistance of this surface to acid attack[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] as can be observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>. From this coating, we can speculate that titanium could penetrate the enamel layers, resulting in increased mineral hardness. However, in spite of the presence of elements such as oxygen, chlorine, potassium, carbon, phosphorus and sodium, which were available in surface and subsurface enamel, according to Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, the presence of titanium was only observed on the enamel surface in the TiF<sub>4</sub> and TiF<sub>4</sub>: &#x003b2;-CD groups. Although the depth of titanium penetration could not be observed at subsurface cross-sectional slabs using an EDS analysis method, one can conclude that the titanium released from TiF<sub>4</sub>: &#x003b2;-CD induced the rehardening of the enamel subsurface. We can suppose that a small amount of this compound was able to be incorporated into the enamel, favoring its mineral content. Another possibility that can explain the absence of titanium in the inner enamel is that its penetration seems to be greater in sound enamel than in predemineralized enamel.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] This difference could be related to a larger quantity of water, carbonate, and oxygen, improving the reactivity between titanium and the oxygen available in the dental structure.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>It is well known that fluoride uptake is higher in decalcified enamel when compared with sound enamel[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] due to the porosity of the decayed enamel.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] However, titanium penetration occurred more deeply into sound enamel compared with artificially demineralized enamel.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] This can be explained by the decrease in water and carbonate in the carious enamel, which decreased the titanium connection with oxygen in the dental structure. It is reasonable to suggest that the titanium applied to the predemineralized enamel blocked the surface used in this study, contributing to the enhancement of inner enamel microhardness by modifying the underlying enamel; however, this amount of titanium was not sufficient to be detected in the EDS analysis.</p><p>The cavity of the CD molecule is lipophilic (lined with skeletal carbons and ethereal oxygens of the glucose residues), resulting in a microenviroment into which suitably sized drug molecules may enter and be included, bestowing a useful property of these excipients, such as retarding or accelerating degradation. The CD molecule shields the drug molecule from attack by various reactive molecules. In others words, the CD can insulate a labile compound from a potentially corrosive environment, thereby reducing drug hydrolysis, oxidation, steric rearrangement, racemization, polymerization, and enzymatic decomposition.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</p><p>Among all natural CDs, &#x003b2;-CD is the most accessible, the lowest-priced and generally the most useful.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] The advantages to using &#x003b2;-CD as employed here have already been illuminated.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] The use of &#x003b2;-CD can improve on the methods by increasing the pH of the TiF<sub>4</sub> nanosystems in solution, allowing professional use and increasing thermal stability. Further studies are necessary to assess the rehardening of other inclusion complexes to investigate if this phenomenon is similar to the findings presented in this paper.</p><p>Several studies were limited in scope to the potential of TiF<sub>4</sub> to reduce the demineralization of dental hard tissue.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] The fact that remineralization is inhibited by TiF was explained by assessing the effect of a new TiF on enamel remineralization. It was observed that treatment with a TiF derivative resulted in strongly reduced calcium loss, but calcium uptake was also inhibited.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] This finding highlights that this compound may not be capable of improving lesion repair.</p><p>A previous <italic>in vivo</italic> study showed that a single application of 4% TiF<sub>4</sub> solution for 1 min produced an unexpected pigmented layer over the enamel surface.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] This phenomenon may have occurred probably because the interaction between TiF<sub>4</sub> and the proteins of the tooth that provoked changes in the glaze-like layer. The solutions reported in the current study are not 4% but 1%, and over the bovine enamel slabs, this undesirable pigmented layer was not observed <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p><p>In this <italic>in vitro</italic> study, the TiF<sub>4</sub>: &#x003b2;-CD inclusion complex was effective in rehardening artificially predemineralized bovine enamel blocks. TiF<sub>4</sub> is also advantageous in protecting enamel from demineralization.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Lesion arrest seemed to be the maximum achievable result because TiF<sub>4</sub> provides long-lasting fluoride delivery and leaves large amounts of titanium on the surface glaze layer.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>A single application of the solution containing the inclusion nanocomplex formed of TiF<sub>4</sub> and &#x003b2;-CD over the enamel blocks was able to reharden the enamel subsurface. This paper highlights a new inclusion nanocomplex used for the treatment of demineralized enamel. Future studies should be carried out before the clinical application of this compound.</p><sec id="sec2-12"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>This study was supported by FAPERJ (No. E-26/201.316/2014) and National Council for Scientific and Technological Development-CNPq.
