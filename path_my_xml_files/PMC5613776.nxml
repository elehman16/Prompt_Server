The study was approved by the North West 1 Research Ethics Committee, Cheshire (REC reference: 10/H1017/76) and monitored by an Independent Trial Steering Committee and Data Monitoring Committee.</p><p>Cluster randomisation at the practice level was used to prevent contamination by clinicians as it was expected GPs would be unable to manage patients allocated to the control arm differently to those allocated to the intervention arm. It may also better develop a community of practice for OA care within a cluster. The evaluation of the intervention used anonymised medical records to allow the analysis of the management and care of a large number of patients without recruitment bias and the attrition and non-consent issues of self-reported patient evaluation. By using medical record information for measuring the outcomes, all eligible patients in the practices were included.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><title>Participants</title><p>Practices which were members of the Central England Primary Care Research Network or a Keele Research Network Practice, and used the EMIS computerised system were approached sequentially until eight agreed to take part.

Training of health care professionals in the trial intervention occurred after randomisation.</p><p>Patients eligible for inclusion were aged &#x02265;45 years and had at least one consultation recorded as clinical OA defined as an OA diagnostic Read code or a code for joint pain (hand/wrist, hip, knee, foot/ankle) during the study period. In UK primary care, morbidities are generally entered using Read Codes, a hierarchical coding system structured into chapters. For example, codes under Chapter N represent &#x02018;Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Diseases&#x02019;.

The model OA consultation produced higher levels of prescribing of simple analgesia (paracetamol) and physiotherapy referral. There was a reduction in referral for X-ray in the intervention practices (although not statistically significant) and little evidence that the model OA consultation was associated with a higher number of adverse events. However, wide variation in recorded management was identified and evidence of improvement in recorded achievement was not consistent across all indicators.</p><p>A novelty of our study was use of anonymised practice-level data to study the effect of the intervention on all patients consulting with OA or joint pain. Uptake of recommended NICE management of OA were measured using previously identified quality indicators of OA care<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> captured via an e-template, and routinely recorded information. To enhance the uptake of NICE OA recommendations we used theory-derived interventions, clinical champions, outreach visits, theory-informed training, funded practice nurse clinics, supply of high quality patient information, and a model OA consultation to deliver evidence-based recommendations. The extent to which each of these approaches contributed independently cannot be determined. The model OA consultation had a strong theoretical underpinning using the WISE model to define self-management and patient information and the Theoretical Domains Framework to develop training to deliver the consultation<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>.</p><p>Our earlier work had shown that the template was a feasible way for GPs to record care, and that the introduction of the template alone had positive effects on quality care such as prescribing<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref>. Introducing the model OA consultation had no discernible additional influence on the level of recording of items on the e-template beyond baseline. However, despite the limited number of practices in the trial and wide variation across practices, there was an important and statistically significant improvement in a key component of NICE guidance, namely the provision of written information about OA and written advice about exercise and weight control, in the intervention compared with control practices.</p><p>A strength was introduction of the e-template and familiarisation six months prior to randomisation to capture for the first time information on recommended indicators of quality of care not routinely captured in the EHR. The e-template alone increased the use of topical NSAIDS<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref> which reduced the likelihood of detecting further increases as a result of the model OA consultation. Use of paracetamol also showed a trend in favour of increased use in the baseline period, however there was a further statistically significant increase in use following implementation of the model OA consultation. The template failed to fire for a small group of patients. Whilst the reason for this is unknown, it is unlikely to have introduced any bias. The baseline level of achievement in various domains pre-randomisation was already high when compared with other published estimates of recorded quality of care<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>. Levels of achievement of OA quality indicators as measured through the e-template fell generally from baseline levels, possibly due to initiative fatigue in use of the template. On completion of the research however seven of the eight practices chose to continue with the e-template. We also, in a sensitivity analysis, restricted analysis to patients with at least one e-template entry to try and overcome some of the influence of the fall in overall recording. However, the higher baseline levels of quality achievement compared to previous estimates, general fall in recording, and baseline variation between practices and health care professionals limited investigation of the potential effect of the intervention. There was an imbalance in the number of patients between arms due to the inclusion of one much larger practice. We included patients with consultations coded as knee, hip, hand/wrist and foot/ankle pain, as non-specific pain at these sites in older adults is most likely to be underlying OA. Recorded joint pain in other sites which may present as OA (shoulder and elbow) were not included, however these sites made up just 2% of OA diagnosed consultations during the trial period. In the analysis, we clustered patients within clinicians rather than practices. We performed a sensitivity analysis (data not shown) with practice as an extra level in the multilevel models. This showed the majority of variation was at clinician level and did not change the findings. The extent to which the recorded quality of care reflects the actual delivery of care is not known. Given quality of care is necessarily measured across several indicators, the testing of multiple comparisons could not be avoided and increased the possibility that identified differences between arms were due to chance.</p><p>Only 21% of patients in the intervention arm attended the practice nurse clinics. Referral by the GP and attendance by the patient were optional. Patients with an OA diagnosis were more likely to attend and had increased uptake of core treatments suggesting that making a formal OA diagnosis was linked to management. It is possible those given an OA diagnosis have more severe pain or functional limitation although other work suggests that known risk factors (older age, obesity) are more strongly linked to OA diagnosis than severity<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref>.</p><p>The provision of OA guidebooks in the intervention arm was captured by the increased uptake of written information on OA. This is an important outcome for the trial given the recent NICE Quality Standards for OA which highlights the importance of providing written information about OA and its management<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref>. Access to weight loss advice and support is recommended in the NICE guidance and is regarded as a care quality indicator<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref>. The increased use of written weight loss advice is another strength of the intervention. Previous studies have shown reliance by GPs on pharmacological management of OA<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref>, so the increase in these non-pharmacological core interventions is encouraging. Further work is required to understand the extent to which provision of written information and advice affects patient outcomes. X-ray use declined in the intervention arm which is in line with NICE recommendations.</p><p>There was an increased incidence of heart failure in the intervention arm. As only two of the 17 patients with heart failure had been prescribed paracetamol or oral NSAIDs, it seems unlikely that this is due to a pharmacological effect, and it seems clinically implausible that the noted statistically significant difference is caused by the intervention.</p><p>In our novel practice-level analysis of anonymised data from all consulters with OA and joint pain, we have shown that a model OA consultation intervention which provides additional resources for a primary care-based OA service, notably a patient guidebook and practice nurse referral clinics, did not lead to improvements on all indicators of quality of OA care. However there was improved achievement of NICE guidance targets for written information and advice, and some small but additional beneficial effects on prescribing and referrals.</p><sec id="sec5.1"><title>Patient and public involvement (PPI)</title><p>The Arthritis Research UK Primary Care Centre at Keele University is committed to taking an explicit and systematic approach to involving patients and the public in research.
