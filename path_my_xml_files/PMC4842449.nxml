treatment, cranial rhythmic impulse treatment, a manual therapy, and McKenzie exercise, a
dynamic strengthening exercise, on patients who have the neck muscle stiffness of the
infrequent episodic tension-type (IETTH) headache and frequent episodic tension-type
headache(FETTH), as well as to provide the basic materials for clinical interventions.
[Subjects] Twenty-seven subjects (males: 15, females: 12) who were diagnosed with IETTH
and FETTH after treatment by a neurologist were divided into three groups: (a cervical
traction group (CTG, n=9), a cranial rhythmic contractiongroup (CRIG, n=9), and a McKenzie
exercise group (MEG, n=9). An intervention was conducted for each group and the
differences in their degrees of neck pain and changes in muscle tone were observed.
[Results] In the within-group comparison of each group, headache significantly decreased
in CTG. According to the results of the analysis of the muscle tone of the upper
trapezius, there was a statistically significant difference in MEG on the right side and
in CRIG on the left side. According to the results of the analysis of the muscle tone of
the sternocleidomastoid muscle, there was a statistically significant difference in MEG on
the right side and in CRIG on the left side. [Conclusion] In the comparison of the
splenius capitis muscle between the groups, there was a statistically significant
difference on the right side. Hence, compared to the other methods, cervical traction is
concluded to be more effective at reducing headaches in IETTH and FETTH patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Cervical traction</kwd><kwd>Cranial rhythmic impulse</kwd><kwd>McKenzie exercise</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Recently, thanks to the popularization of computers and changes in work environments that
include an increased use of computers, work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WRMSDs) have
surged among computer users<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>WRMSDs cause continuous damage to parts of the body, such as the muscles, joints, and
nerves, due to continuous repetitive work, such as computer use, and result in occupational
lesions, through the accumulation of continuous damage. The symptoms occur in the upper limb
articular area, the head, the neck, and the shoulders, and as a result, there has been a
rapid increase in the number of patients who visit hospitals<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, the use of small mobile visual display cellular phones
affects users&#x02019; neck and shoulder muscles more than existing imaging terminals, such as
desktop computers<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Small mobile visual
display terminals damage neck and shoulder muscles and trigger headaches. Headache is a very
common disease that is experienced by about 96.7% of the total population during their
lifetime, and the prevalence of tension-type headache, one of the most common types of
headache for a year, is 86%<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Headache is
a very common clinical symptom, and it has been reported that in local communities, 65 to
80% of women and 57 to 75% of men experience headache<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. The types of headache are divided differently according to the era,
standards, and symptoms. According to the classification by the International Headache
Society, the frequency of tension-type headache is next to that of migraine<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Here, tension refers to tension in the head
and neck and mental tension<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. All pain in
the head is called headache, but its aspects are divided into a few types. Tension-type
headache has been expressed differently based on its symptoms: muscle contraction headache,
tension headache, pyschogenic headache, psychomyogenic headache, stress headache, essential
headache, and nonmigrainous headache<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.
While the major mechanism in infrequent episodic tension-type headache (IETTH) and frequent
episodic tension-type headache (FETTH) is considered to be a peripheral pain mechanism, a
central pain mechanism is regarded as more important in chronic tension-type headache
(CTTH)<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. FETTH is classified into idiopathic and chronic types. It has been
reported that idiopathic tension-type headache refers to headache that occurs at least once
per month and 10 times per year, and has a pain frequency of less than 15 days a month, and
that chronic tension-type headache has a frequency of at least 15 days a month or more than
180 days per year<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. In research on fascial
pain trigger points, the distribution of referred pain by the trigger points of the head,
neck, and shoulder areas has been reported to be almost the same as that of the areas where
pain occurs in tension-type headache patients, and clinical characteristics of postural
abnormality such as forward head posture and decreases in the cervical spinal range of
motion have also been reported<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Physical therapies for headache patients include manipulation, joint range of motion,
massage, cold packs, home exercise programs, advice on posture, muscle stretching
techniques, retraining, razor, and acupuncture, and such treatment methods are said to
stabilize a patient&#x02019;s psychological condition<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Hoving et al. noted that active treatment, in which tension-type headache patients
participated, was helpful for symptom management and may improve physical symptoms<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, Jordan et al. observed that in
the treatment and management of cervical pain, the effects of active treatment (such as
therapeutic exercise) appeared largely for a short time period, and this was similar to the
effects of the passive pain alleviation treatment methods<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, Vilijanen et al. noted that dynamic muscular training
and relaxation training were not effective for the cervical pain of headache patients<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. Regarding the association between
headache and the cervical spine, Antonaci and Bogduk illuminated the anatomical basis and
mechanism of cervical spine triggering headache, but this has a mechanism of cervical pain,
and research on the association between tension-type headache and the cervical spine is
lacking<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, domestic research on morphological changes in the
cervical spine in tension-type headache patients is insufficient, and the scientific grounds
for treatment effects have not been sufficiently demonstrated. Nevertheless, based on the
advantages of treatments and the appropriateness of many theories, diverse exercise
treatments such as mobility exercise, extension exercise, isometric exercise, and dynamic
strengthening exercise are being performed according to clinical therapists&#x02019; decisions<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. Accordingly, this study examined the
effects of cranial rhythmic impulse (CRI) treatment, McKenzie exercise, a dynamic
strengthening exercise, and mechanical cervical traction treatment, a manual therapy on
headache and cervical area muscle stiffness of IETTH and FETTH patients, thereby intending
to provide evidence for these therapeutic approaches and their effects for clinical
therapists.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>In research by Gracia the average age of tension-type headache patients was 47.4&#x02005;years old.
Therefore, this study recruited subjects with ages between 40 and 49&#x02005;years old<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. The participants were 27 patients (males:
15, females: 12) who visited C hospital located in Seongnam City, complained of headache and
tenderness in the cervical muscle, and were diagnosed with IETTH or FETTH after treatment by
a neurologist. The criteria for exclusion were CTTH patients, patients with headache
resulting from traumatic injuries, patients with headache caused by a terminal stage disease
(such as meningitis or brain cancer), and pregnant women. All participants were instructed
about the potential risks and experimental design and provided their informed consent to
participation, with the knowledge that they could withdraw at any time. The Ethics Committee
of Namseoul University in Korea also approved this study. The IRB approval number is
Research-NSU-1041479-201510-HR-003.</p><p>The subjects comprised three groups: the cervical traction group (CRG), the cranial
rhythmic impulse group (CRIG), and the McKenzie exercise group (MEG). For the first group,
the posterior area of the cervical spine was extended using cervical traction. At present,
the generally used treatment is sustained traction<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>, because continuous traction triggers pain in the patients;
therefore, it is difficult to maintain sufficient traction force for a long time. Hence, it
was decided to apply sustained traction. For the purpose of extending the posterior area of
the cervical spine, while maintaining a comfortable posture, the patients lay in a supine
position, flexed the neck at 20 to 30 degrees, and pulled a rope horizontally at 60 degrees.
The traction force was generated with 8 to 14&#x02005;kg of weight and the pulling was conducted for
a total of 20 minutes using sustained traction, with a traction time of 10 seconds and a
resting time of 10 seconds<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>. The second
group received CRI treatment. This treatment separats cervical vertebra 1 and the occipital
bone and relaxs the stiffness of the larynx bone<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup>. The fingers of both hands (excluding the thumbs) were put together
vertically and held up high and the fingers were held erect like the blade of a knife in the
forward direction. Treatment was applied for three minutes followed by with a one minute
break, for a total of five times, for a total of 20 minutes. The third group performed
exercise by themselves using repetitive exercise as a treatment strategy of McKenzie,
mobilization exercise, manipulation, and patient education. The Mackenzie exercises
performed in this experiment consisted of seven motions: four motions of extension, two
motions of lateral flexion and rotation, and one motion of flexion<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>This experiment employed a visual analogue scale (VAS) in order to evalute the degree of
tenderness in the subjects&#x02019; neck muscles and the degree of headache before and after the
treatment. On a 10&#x02005;cm line without markings, the subjects marked the degree of headache and
tenderness of their neck muscles. Then the distance from the start point to the subjects&#x02019;
marks was measured and scored. This scale is a pain measurement scale with high
reproducibility in the evaluation of subjects&#x02019; expression of their degree of pain. It is the
most widely used method for evaluating the intensity of pain, and it has a reported
reliability of ranging from r=0.76 to 0.84<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Myoton PRO (Myoton AS, Estonia), a muscle tone measurer, was used in this experiment to
measure the degree of stiffness of the neck muscles. Eight areas were measured: the anterior
temporal muscle, sternocleidomastoid muscle, upper trapezius muscle, and the splenius
capitis muscle on both the left and right sides. Before and after the five-day treatment,
the left and right sides of the muscles were measured. The muscle belly areas of the
anterior temporal muscle, sternocleidomastoid muscle, and upper trapezius muscle were
measured three times in a supine position, and the average values were used as the measured
values. The muscle belly areas of the left and right sides of the splenius capitis muscle
were measured three times in a prone position, and the average values were used as the
measured values. The interval between the measurement time points was 10 seconds. The skin
was pushed with 0.18 N of force and after this pre-load, a force of 0.58 N was momentarily
applied to the skin at intervals of 15&#x02005;ms. Thereafter, the vibration on the skin surface was
triggered by Myoton PRO (Myoton AS, Estonia), a muscle tone measurer, which was used to
examine the biomechanic indices. The reported Inter-rater reliability ranges from r=0.97 to
0.99, and that of the intra-rater reliability ranges from r=0.98 to 0.99<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><sup>)</sup>. In previous research, normal subjects&#x02019;
muscle characteristics changed after stretching<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><sup>)</sup>, and company workers who used computers for a long time showed
differences in muscle characteristics between before and after noon<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>To analyze the data in this study, the statistics program, SPSS 18.0, was used. The general

contribute much to the alleviation of headache, and the treatment effects in CTG were also
insufficient. This is consistent with the report by Vilijanen et al. that dynamic muscle
training and relaxation training are not effective for tension-type headache patients&#x02019;
cervical pain<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, this result is
not consistent the resultsthat of a study by Kim<xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref><sup>)</sup>, who found that there were a differences in range of motion (ROM),
VAS, and pressure pain thresholds in an active relaxation therapy group, but not in a range
of motion exercise group. In previous research, as characteristics related to headache, the
most frequently expressed symptom accompanying headache was pain in the neck and shoulders,
and stress and fatigue were the factors that triggered headache most often<xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref><sup>)</sup>. The pathological physiological mechanism
of tension-type headache has not been firmly established, but muscle contraction and
psychological factors are thought to act in a complex manner<xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref><sup>)</sup>. In other previous research, a digital algometer,
Commander<sup>TM</sup> was used to measure the pressure pain thresholds of the anterior
temporal muscle, sternocleidomastoid muscle, splenius capitis muscle, and trapezius muscle
with a method devised by Fracton et al.<xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref><sup>)</sup>, and in the tension-type headache patient group, significant changes,

instead of the Commander<sup>TM</sup> algometer and measured the changes in the left and
right stiffness of the upper trapezius muscle, sternocleidomastoid muscle, anterior temporal
muscle, and splenius capitis muscle after the treatments. According to the results of the
analysis of the muscle tone changes of the upper trapezius, there were a statistically
significants difference in the right side of MEG and the left side of CRIG. According to the
results of the analysis of the muscle tone changes of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, there
was a statistically significant difference on the right side of MEG and the left side of
CRIG. According to the results of the analysis the muscle tone changes of the splenius
capitis muscle, there was a statistically significant difference on the left side of CTG,
and according to the comparison of the muscle tone changes of the splenius capitis muscle
among the three groups, there was a statistically significant difference in the right side
of CTG (<xref rid="tbl_004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_004" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 4.</label><caption><title>Comparison of the scores of stiffness

increased<xref rid="r43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, Hall and

methods had better therapeutic effects on which muscles. The number of subjects in each
group was small and the study period was short ; therefore, it was not possible to conclude
whether contraction of the cervical muscles was the cause of headache, and it is difficult
to generalize the results of this study. Future research on the correlation between headache
and the stiffness of cervical muscles should be conducted.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The funding for this study was provided by Namseoul University.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Tepper</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Vollenbroek-Hutten</surname><given-names>MM</given-names></name><name><surname>Hermens</surname><given-names>HJ</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>The effect of an ergonomic computer device on muscle
