The main stay of treatment is supportive care with supplemental oxygen, adequate hydration and mechanical ventilation as needed.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Bronchodilators and corticosteroids are widely used but not routinely recommended.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] While a meta-analysis of the effects of nebulized selective beta2-agonists failed to show any consistent benefit,[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] a meta-analysis of the effect of nebulized epinephrine suggested a decrease in clinical symptoms compared with either placebo or albuterol.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Several published study on dexamethasone failed to show any difference in hospital admission rate or respiratory clinical score compared with placebo.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] However, combination therapy using dexamethasone and epinephrine has been reported to produce an improvement in respiratory clinical score within the first hour and may significantly reduce hospital admissions.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Additionally, two small studies have reported beneficial outcomes by combining epinephrine with dexamethasone[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] or albuterol with dexamethasone.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] In a similar population, there has been no benefit reported from the administration of dexamethasone alone, epinephrine alone or albuterol alone.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>Furthermore, although the mechanism of action is not known, synergism between corticosteroids and beta-agonists in the treatment of chronic asthma is well documented.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] A small number of reports have demonstrated a possible synergistic effect for this combination in infants with bronchiolitis, resulting in clinical improvement.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>Because of the potential benefits of this combined therapy, this randomized double-blind controlled study was conducted to examine the clinical benefit of combining dexamethasone with either nebulized epinephrine or salbutamol compared to bronchodilators alone, in children younger than 12 months admitted to the emergency department (ED) with acute bronchiolitis. The clinical benefit was measured by assessing the rate of hospital admission within 7 days of illness (the natural course of the disease and the maximum time within which admission is expected to occur) and by monitoring changes in respiratory distress assessment instrument (RDAI) score, heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), and oxygen saturation (O<sub>2</sub> Sat) from baseline during the first 4 hours of treatment following enrollment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was a randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial.

The three doses of nebulized treatments were administered at 0, 30 and 90 minutes apart by means of a Salter Labs nebulizer (REF 8900) with an oxygen flow rate of 8 liters per minute and 0.25 ml racemic epinephrine at 2.25% concentration or an equivalent volume of saline. Oral treatments were based on a study by Schuh <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and consisted of 1.0 mg of dexamethasone per kilogram of body weight (maximum dose, 12 mg) or placebo given after the first nebulized treatment in the ED and were subsequently followed by two once-daily doses of dexamethasone (0.6 mg per kilogram; maximum daily dose, 12 mg) or placebo, to be taken at home. The dexamethasone suspension consisted of generic dexamethasone phosphate injection solution mixed with Ora-Plus and Ora-Sweet (Paddock Laboratories). The placebo consisted of Ora-Plus and Ora-Sweet. The research nurse administered all drugs in the ED and instructed parents in the administration of the oral drugs at home. The treating physician in the ED was allowed to provide co-interventions only after 90 minutes and independently determined whether to admit or discharge the infant. The study was terminated and the patient was excluded if mandated at any time by the clinical condition or if clinical deterioration occurred.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Randomization</title><p>Computer-generated, random sequences were used for randomization. Following enrollment, each subject was provided with a four-digit identification code, and this code was used as a label to identify the patient's group during and after completion of the study.</p><p>Patient code numbers were provided to the pharmacy department, where they were matched with study groups (A, B, C, and D) using a random list prepared prior to the start of the study. The pharmacist then provided study medications in envelopes labeled with patient code numbers such that the nurse, physician and participants were unaware of group assignments. The research pharmacy prepared the study drugs in sequentially numbered, visually identical envelopes. The active drugs and placebos were identical in appearance, volume, weight, odor, and taste.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Participant assessments and follow-up</title><p>Eligible participants were randomly allocated to one of four groups. The research coordinator was provided with the patient's code numbers, and the coordinator then submitted the medication order to the pharmacy. Following administration of the medication by the ED nurse and respiratory therapist, the research nurse assessed the patient at 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, and 240 minutes for HR, RR, O<sub>2</sub> Sat, and RDAI score (based on two respiratory variables: Wheezing and retractions). The patient's temperature was recorded at 0, 120, and 240 minutes. Blood pressure was measured at 0 and 240 minutes.</p><p>Follow up telephone calls and chart reviews were performed at day 3 and day 7 following enrollment. Using a standard telephone follow-up form, a research coordinator obtained data about compliance with study medication following discharge; any additional visits to health care services; and details about the infant's feeding, sleeping, breathing, and coughing.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-7"><title>Outcome measures</title><p>The primary outcome was the rate of hospital admission attributable to bronchiolitis within seven days of the first dose of treatment. Outcome was determined through telephone follow-up and confirmed by chart review. The secondary outcomes were changes in RDAI score, HR, RR, and O<sub>2</sub> Sat from baseline within four hours of treatment and were determined by direct measurement by the research nurse.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-8"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>To attain 80% power with a 5% type I error rate, the required sample size was 600 infants: 300 infants in the dexamethasone groups, including nebulized epinephrine plus oral dexamethasone (group A) and nebulized salbutamol plus oral dexamethasone (group C), and 300 infants in the placebo groups, including nebulized epinephrine plus oral placebo (group B) and nebulized salbutamol plus oral placebo (group D). This allowed the detection of a 9-10% absolute reduction in admission rates, equating to an approximately 33% relative reduction in admission rate. An interim analysis was planned and conducted at the end of the first season. All analyses were conducted and reported using SAS V9.2, SAS Institute, NC.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>A total of 604 infants were screened for eligibility, and 162 were enrolled (45 failed to provide consent, and 394 did not meet eligibility criteria) [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>].

A total of 45 patients were randomly assigned to the (dexamethasone + epinephrine) group, 40 patients were assigned to the (dexamethasone + salbutamol) group, 39 patients were assigned to the (placebo + epinephrine) group, and 38 patients were assigned to the (placebo + salbutamol) group.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Flow diagram</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AJM-4-58-g001"/></fig><p>There were 17 patients removed from the study: Six from the (dexamethasone + epinephrine) group, three from the (dexamethasone + salbutamol) group, five from the (placebo + epinephrine) group and three from the (placebo + salbutamol) group. Seven patients were removed by emergency department physicians due to deteriorations in their clinical conditions and increased oxygen requirement, while ten patients were removed by their families for social reasons. The stated reason was that the patient had improved and the family no longer wanted to remain in the ED to complete study observation [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>].

The lack of effect on admission rate was observable after four hours and persisted for follow up at 3 days and 7 days. Furthermore, treatment had no positive effect on any of the secondary outcomes studied: RDAI score, HR, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. To the contrary, placebo was favored over dexamethasone in the epinephrine group after four hours, but this difference did not reach significance. Because of the concern that variations in the treatment of bronchiolitis might impact the outcome of the study, the use of B2 agonists and epinephrine was controlled in the first 90 minutes between the study arms. Similarly, in the subgroup analysis, dexamethasone had no positive effect when either nebulized salbutamol or epinephrine was used in the initial management. After the 90-minute mark, physicians were permitted to manage infants according to their clinical judgment. The use of and need for various nebulization therapies was monitored, and a trend towards a decreased need for nebulization therapy was observed in the dexamethasone group compared to placebo when combined with epinephrine (4.4% versus 7.6%) and when combined with salbutamol (10% versus 23.6%); however, this trend did not reach significance. To overcome the possible impact of atopy, all infants older than 12 months or who had any history of prior wheezing or previous use of inhalers/nebulizers were excluded from the study.</p><p>Many studies have examined the use of dexamethasone in bronchiolitis; however, despite a review of the evidence by the 2006 American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) subcommittee on the diagnosis and management of bronchiolitis that recommended that corticosteroids shall not be used in the management of bronchiolitis, controversy remains.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Our study aimed to add to the body of evidence and to control the two most commonly used therapies for bronchiolitis. Controversy over the use of corticosteroids in bronchiolitis persists as a result of conflicting reports on the effect of corticosteroids on outcome, particularly with regard to hospital admissions and severity scores.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] The results of our study are consistent with those that have failed to find a positive effect.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] A large multi-center placebo controlled study found no reduction in hospital admission or clinical status upon administration of a single dose of dexamethasone, independent of a history of atopy. Although the authors of that study did not control for bronchodilator use, it was found to be utilized equally in both groups, and nebulized epinephrine was not reported to be a part of their therapy protocol. A 2003 Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) report that reviewed several placebo controlled trials of corticosteroid use, including both oral and parenteral administration, identified only one study reporting a positive association.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] In a meta-analysis by Garrison <italic>et al</italic>., that included six controlled clinical trials of systemic corticosteroid use, a small but significant positive effect was identified; however, this effect was lost upon secondary analysis excluding those patients with a history of asthma.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] In 2010, the Cochrane Collaboration performed a comprehensive review of 17 randomized, controlled trials comparing short-term systemic or inhaled glucocorticoids versus placebo or an alternate intervention in children &#x0003c;24 months of age with acute bronchiolitis. That review found that corticosteroids did not significantly reduce outpatient admissions by day 1 or day 7 when compared to placebo.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] A bronchiolitis study by Schuh <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] identified a significant reduction in hospitalization and clinical scores within four hours of therapy when dexamethasone was compared to placebo in children up to two years of age who experienced symptoms for a brief duration. However, there was a high rate of family history of atopy favoring the dexamethasone group.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] In a placebo controlled follow-up study on the efficacy of dexamethasone given at discharge from the ED to children up to two years of age with bronchiolitis, Shuh <italic>et al</italic>., found no positive effect on admission rates or the need for bronchodilator or corticosteroid therapy after six days. The authors therefore concluded that there is no benefit of corticosteroids beyond the first dose.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Plint <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] found, in a randomized placebo controlled trial, that dexamethasone combined with nebulized epinephrine led to a reduction in hospitalizations due to bronchiolitis within seven days of enrollment compared to nebulized epinephrine alone, dexamethasone alone or placebo.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] It has been proposed that dexamethasone and epinephrine have a synergistic effect. The mechanism of action remains unclear, although the effect appears to be different from that observed for children with asthma. The positive effects reported in a number of studies are lost or diminished when children with asthma are excluded.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] An alternative hypothesis suggested that dexamethasone has an anti-inflammatory effect. However, Somers <italic>et al</italic>., found no effect for systemic steroids on the concentration of inflammatory cytokines in tracheal aspirates.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] These conflicting outcomes regarding the efficacy of dexamethasone for the treatment of infants with bronchiolitis have led to confusion and variations in treatment regimens and protocols. These differences may be due to differences between the populations studied, differences in the timing of intervention, and differences in patient population such as age, history of bronchiolitis, or history of asthma.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] A study by Plint <italic>et al</italic>., in which the data were adjusted for multiple comparisons found no significant associations. The authors reported a reduction in admission by 9 percentage points: From 26% in the placebo group to 17% in the epinephrine-dexamethasone group. As such, 11 infants would have needed to be treated to prevent one hospital admission.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Our study was limited by its small sample size and access to a single academic center. However, we did observe a trend towards positive effects. Because physicians were allowed to use therapies at their judgment after the 90 min mark, we were able to observe a trend toward a decreased need for nebulization therapy in the dexamethasone group compared to the placebo group for epinephrine (4.4% versus 7.6%) and for salbutamol (10% versus 23.6%). It is possible that additional power in the study may have identified a significant difference. In addition, we were unable to study the impact of positive respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) status on outcome, as the majority of our patients did not provide nasopharyngeal aspirates for viral studies.</p><p>In conclusion, our study adds to the body of data demonstrating that corticosteroids have no role in the management of bronchiolitis. This is particularly clear for younger infants who are first time wheezers with no risk of atopy. It is possible that a subpopulation of older children with a history of atopy who are presenting with a first episode of wheezing and who fit the clinical picture of bronchiolitis may benefit from corticosteroids; however the data presented here emphasize the overall need to minimize the use of these agents in this disorder.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>The authors would like to thank the participating children and their parents.
