In addition, the loss of the cough reflex can cause malpositioning of the tube in the trachea. The frequency of malpositioning of gastric tubes in the trachea has been reported to be 0.3&#x02013;15%
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], which may result in serious complications, such as pneumonia

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. However, even if the gastric tube is malpositioned in the trachea, the sound may still be heard, or when a small amount of transparent fluid is drawn back, it may not be distinguishable from tracheal secretions
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Thus, neither method is absolutely reliable.If a gastric tube can be guided into the esophagus under direct vision using a video laryngoscope, misplacement of the gastric tube in the trachea can be avoided. The King Vision&#x02122; (KV) video laryngoscope (King Systems, Indianapolis, IN, USA) is a type of video laryngoscope that is mainly used when it is anticipated that endotracheal intubation will be difficult, and comprises a reusable color display and a disposable blade: a standard blade without a tube-guiding channel, a channel blade with a tube-guiding channel (Figure&#x000a0;
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).

We enrolled 60 patients (aged 42&#x02013;84 years) in whom transnasal insertion of a gastric tube was required before elective abdominal surgery under general anesthesia (31 underwent colectomy, 15 gastrectomy, six pancreaticoduodenectomy, three cholecystectomy and five underwent other procedures). All participants provided written informed consent. They were recruited consecutively into one of two groups: a group of 30 patients that underwent gastric tube insertion using the King Vision video laryngoscope (KV group), and a group of 30 patients that underwent conventional blind nasal insertion of the gastric tube (Blind group) (Figure&#x000a0;
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Patients with a history of coagulopathy, esophageal varix, loose teeth, trismus, esophageal hiatus hernia or base of skull fracture were excluded from the study.In all patients, general anesthesia was induced with propofol and remifentanil, followed by endotracheal intubation facilitated by rocuronium. Subsequent anesthesia was maintained with propofol and remifentanil. In the KV group, the gastric tube was inserted as follows:(1) The King Vision video laryngoscope was inserted intraorally. The standard blade is narrower than the channel blade (13&#x000a0;mm compared with 18&#x000a0;mm), allowing easier insertion and maneuverability within the mouth, making it particularly suitable for transnasal gastric tube insertion (Figure&#x000a0;

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. There are many ways to confirm the successful placement of a gastric tube, such as injecting air into the tube while auscultating over the epigastrium, and aspiration of gastric contents and measurement of their pH. The use of a capnograph connected to the end of the gastric tube to detect tracheal malpositioning has also been suggested
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], but none of these methods is completely reliable. The gold standard for confirmation of correct placement remains X-ray, which may not be an entirely feasible choice in the operating room
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Malpositioning of the gastric tube in the trachea will certainly be detected under direct visualization using a video laryngoscope, especially if it is used during insertion. Ikeno and colleagues reported that use of the Pentax-AWS system&#x02122; (Air Way Scope, AWS; Hoya, Tokyo, Japan) helped to prevent misplacement of the gastric tube into the trachea
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Kitagawa and colleagues also found that the AWS device reduced the incidence of oral damage caused by blind insertion, and recommended that a pediatric AWS blade be used to allow better maneuverability around the endotracheal tube in the oropharynx
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The standard AWS blade is 48&#x000a0;mm wide, compared with 44&#x000a0;mm for the thinner blade and 33&#x000a0;mm for the pediatric blade. These blades are all substantially wider than the 13&#x000a0;mm wide standard King Vision video laryngoscope blade, allowing easier insertion and maneuverability within the mouth, making it particularly suitable for transnasal gastric tube insertion (Figure&#x000a0;
