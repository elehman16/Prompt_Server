Antiviral therapy is used in CHB to minimize liver damage and limit disease progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. The most significant risk factor for the development of cirrhosis or HCC is serum HBV DNA level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>], and it appears that the sustained suppression of serum HBV DNA replication is essential for impeding or reversing disease progression. Nucleoside and nucleotide analogs can function as antiviral agents by inhibiting HBV replication and competing with the natural nucleotide substrate of DNA polymerase, thereby terminating the synthesis of viral DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>].In the last decade, 4 nucleoside and nucleotide analogs (lamivudine, adefovir (ADV), entecavir (ETV), and telbivudine) were approved for the treatment of CHB in China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. These agents vary with respect to antiviral and clinical efficacy, resistance profiles, tolerability, and safety. With the introduction of the concept of long-term management for CHB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>], the clinical challenge is to determine how to use available agents most effectively to obtain consistent, profound, and long-lasting HBV suppression with good safety and convenience in a variety of health care settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. According to a World Health Organization (WHO) estimate, one-third of CHB patients reside in China. Recently, some studies have reported that the race or ethnicity of patients affects the efficacy of anti-HBV treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. Unfortunately, few studies have been performed in Chinese CHB patients. It is unknown whether treatment with nucleoside analogs in Chinese CHB patients differs compared with patients from other regions.ADV is an oral acyclic nucleotide analog with potent and specific effects against HBV infection. With the availability of tenofovir [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>], ADV has begun to be withdrawn from certain regions. Due to its lengthy time to market and high cost, however, the likelihood of obtaining tenofovir remains distant for the majority of CHB patients. In China, ADV remains widely used as a first-line antiviral agent. Recently, HBeAg-negative status and low baseline serum HBV DNA levels have been reported to be associated with virological response in ADV-treated CHB patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Objectives</title><p>This study compared the efficacy and safety of long-term treatment with ADV and ETV in HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative CHB patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s3"><title>Patients and Methods</title><sec id="s3sub1"><title>Patients</title><p>Outpatients from West China Hospital with chronic hepatitis B, aged 18 years or older, were screened and included in this study, per the following criteria: positive reading for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) for at least 6 months; serum HBV DNA load above 1000 copies/ml at baseline; and meeting the general indications for antiviral therapy, as recommended by the Chinese Society of Hepatology.The exclusion criteria were: presence of serum antibodies against hepatitis C virus (HCV) or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); a course of preantiviral agent therapy (nucleoside analogs or interferon) for more than 3 months; breastfeeding, pregnancy, or inadequate contraceptive measures; substance abuse in the previous 2 years; other acquired or inherited causes of liver disease; serious concomitant disease; and advanced liver disease (including decompensated cirrhosis with ascites, severe hepatitis, and hepatic carcinoma).</p></sec><sec id="s3sub2"><title>Study design</title><p>This prospective, controlled study evaluated and compared the efficacy of ADV and ETV in Chinese CHB patients.

The principal goals of anti-HBV treatment are to suppress HBV DNA, normalize ALT levels, and reduce liver necroinflammation. In this study, both ADV and ETV were efficacious in among positive- and negative-HBeAg CHB patients with regard to biochemical and virological responses. In HBeAg-positive patients, ETV was significantly superior to ADV in terms of virological response, which is consistent with other studies of ETV that have demonstrated reduced HBV DNA levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>], attributed to its suppression of HBV replication.Based on the nephrotoxicity, the dose of ADV was adjusted from 30 mg to 10 mg for CHB patients, but Vitro, this dose adjustment weakened the antiviral activity of ADV, and clinical studies have reported that the virological response of ADV is less robust than that of other anti-HBV agents. In this study, the virological response of ADV in HBeAg-positive patients was significantly lower than that of ETV, but in HBeAg-negative patients, ADV had similar biochemical and virological responses as ETV.In a separate analysis, the percentage of ADV-treated HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative patients with HBV &#x0003c;300 copies/mL was 54.5% and 84.2%, respectively. This result suggests that the efficacy of ADV differs in HBeAg-negative and HBeAg-positive patients. Further, other nucleoside analogs have had high therapeutic efficacy in HBeAg-negative patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>].But, the exact mechanism that underlies the effect of baseline negative HBeAg status on virological response remains unknown. In the ADV group, the mean baseline HBV DNA level was 6.44 and 7.91 log10 copies/mL in HBeAg-negative and HBeAg-positive patients, respectively; thus, lower baseline HBV DNA levels may contribute to a more robust virological response for ADV in HBeAg-negative patients. Some studies have suggested that baseline HBV DNA level is an independent predictor of long-term virological response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>].In this study, genotypic substitutions in polymerase-reverse transcriptase were detected only in patients with viral breakthrough. During the limited 2-year observation period, no viral breakthrough was observe in ADV- or ETV-treated patients; thus, the rates of viral breakthrough and resistance with ADV that we observed are better than those of other reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]. However, resistance patterns with long-term treatment were not determined in this study, and the resistance rate to ADV might increase significantly during subsequent treatments. Thus, we will continue to monitor all of our patients closely.HBeAg loss or seroconversion indicates durable immune control of hepatitis B virus. But, in this study, the percentage of patients who experienced seroconversion of HBeAg was less than 30% in both groups. Due to the absence of HBeAg loss or seroconversion, long-term treatment is often required to maintain viral suppression, and the treatment strategy for such patients should be optimized. Substituting or adding an antiviral agent that effects higher seroconversion rates is a warranted option. The data on adverse events are consistent with previous findings. Severe renal impairment was not observed in patients who received ADV. Further, 4 of the 52 ADV recipients had slightly increased serum creatinine levels from baseline; they were monitored closely, and the levels normalized without any additional treatment. In this study, flares of ALT were more frequent in patients who consumed alcohol. Health education must be stressed for patients with poor compliance. After reviewing the family history of a patient who developed HCC in the ETV group, we noted that his father and brother died from HBV-associated HCC. Thus, patients with a family history of HCC should be monitored closely.In this study, many observations were difficult to explain. For example, why were the dynamics of the viral response similar in only some ADV-treated and ETV-treated patients? Alterations in drug absorption and metabolism of ADV in patients should be considered. One could argue that these patients, with HBV DNA&#x0003e; 103 copies/mL, simply need an adjustment of treatment strategies to overcome the weakened responsiveness, such as switching to or adding another potent anti-HBV agent that does not have crossresistance to ADV. Our study complements the antiviral data on nucleoside and nucleotide analogs. ETV should be recommended for both HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative patients. However, for na&#x000ef;ve chronic hepatitis B patients who are HBeAg-negative and have lower HBV DNA levels at baseline, ADV should also be considered. Adefovir and entecavir were effective as CHB treatments. In HBeAg-positive patients, the efficacy of ETV was significantly superior to that of ADV, but similar biochemical and virological responses were observed with both agents in HBeAg-negative patients. Thus, adefovir can be considered for HBeAg-negative patients with lower HBV DNA levels at baseline.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported financially by the National Key Technologies Research and Development Program of China during the 11th Five-year Plan Period (2008ZX10002-006) and the National Basic Research Program of China (No. 2007CB512902 and No. 2006CB504302).
