Functional constipation can be caused by delayed colonic transit or dysfunction of the pelvic floor muscles. Standard medical care in paediatric practice is often based on clinical experience and mainly consists of a behavioural approach and toilet training, along with the prescription of laxatives. Evidence to evaluate the effectiveness of pelvic physiotherapy for this complaint is lacking.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>A two-armed multicentre randomised controlled trial has been designed. We hypothesise that the combination of pelvic physiotherapy and standard medical care will be more effective than standard medical care alone for constipated children, aged 5 to 17 years. Children with functional constipation according to the Rome III will be included. Web-based baseline and follow-up measurements, scheduled at 3 and 6 months after inclusion, consist of the numeric rating scale in relation to the perceived severity of the problem, the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire and subjective improvement post-intervention (global perceived effect). Examination of the pelvic floor muscle functions, including digital testing and biofeedback, will take place during baseline and follow-up measurements at the physiotherapist. The control group will only receive standard medical care, involving at least three contacts during five months, whereas the experimental group will receive standard medical care plus pelvic physiotherapy, with a maximum of six contacts. The physiotherapy intervention will include standard medical care, pelvic floor muscle training, attention to breathing, relaxation and awareness of body and posture. The study duration will be six months from randomisation, with a three-year recruitment period. The primary outcome is the absence of functional constipation according to the Rome III criteria.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This section discusses the relevance of publishing the study design and the development of the presented physiotherapy protocol.

No clear organic cause is found in over 90% of the children who suffer from constipation, so-called functional constipation (FC). FC includes delayed colonic transit and dyssynergic defaecation. In the majority of children dyssynergic defaecation is the cause for their complaints, and refers to an incomplete evacuation of faeces due to paradoxical contraction of, or failure to relax the pelvic floor muscles when straining and/or a failure to increase intra rectal pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In some patients, delayed colonic transit may be the result of dyssynergic defaecation. Approximately 50% of children show this abnormal defecation pattern [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Withdrawal of stool, hard painful defecation or fear of stool, resulting in a vicious circle, is the most commonly proposed explanation of the aetiology of dyssynergic constipation in children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>The standard medical care (SMC) for FC children in routine paediatric practice is often based on clinical experience and mainly consists of a behavioural approach and toilet training along with the prescription of laxatives, sometimes supported by disimpaction or a high fibre diet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Despite intensive medical and behavioural treatment long-term follow-up studies have shown that 50% of the children still have complaints of constipation after five year follow up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>Since dyssynergic dysfunction of the pelvic floor is the major reason for FC in children, it is thought that pelvic physiotherapists, who have specific expertise in treating dyssynergic dysfunction, as musculoskeletal experts might play an important role to increase the success rate. All prerequisites for proper micturition and defecation, such as a relaxed toilet posture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], adequate straining [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and trunk stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], are trained extensively. Pelvic floor muscle training involves training the right use of the pelvic floor muscles (PFM) during contracting and straining, breathing and changes in abdominal pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. In case of (urine) incontinence, the treatment can be extended with additional PFM exercises.</p><p>Standard pelvic physiotherapy (PPT) care for the constipated child has not been described. In most cases, PPT consists of education, demystification, the use of micturition and defecation diaries, toilet training, breathing and relaxation exercises and pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT), with PFMT including exercises and biofeedback (BF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><sec><title>Trial design, hypothesis and research</title><p>To date, there has been little scientific evidence evaluating the effectiveness of pelvic physiotherapy (PPT) in childhood constipation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].

Awareness of urge and coordination of the PFM during filling and straining will be practised. During MFB, the child will receive information about the activity of the pelvic floor muscles by means of a visual display or a beeping sound.

The success rate (absence of FC) of the controls has been set at 60% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. There is no published PPT success rate but it is estimated to be 75%. Based on a two-sided effect, an alpha of 0.05, a power of 80% and an expected drop-out rate of 20%, at least 367 children should be enrolled in this study.</p></sec><sec><title>Randomisation and blinding</title><p>Randomisation will be based on a list of random numbers generated by a computer in a 1:1 ratio. Concealed randomisation will take place immediately after the second visit to the physiotherapist. Blinding of practitioners, children and outcome assessor is impossible. However, the investigator and parents are blinded for the web-based and PPT baseline measurements and the diary data.</p></sec><sec><title>Data analysis</title><p>After checking for missing data and testing for normality, group differences will be analysed using the Pearson Chi-square test, or likelihood ratio in the case of dichotomous outcomes. Continuous outcomes will be analysed using the independent samples t-test or the Mann&#x02013;Whitney U test. Adjusted group differences will be analysed using multivariable logistic regression with ordinal variables transformed into dummies, taking into account possible differences in mean number of sessions. Finally, subgroup analyses will be done to establish normal values and observed differences in effectiveness for relevant clinical subgroups.</p><p>Data analysis will be done according to the intention-to-treat principle. Characteristics of the study population at baseline will be described. Potential effect modifiers like age and gender [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], as well as potential confounders like urinary incontinence, enuresis and abdominal pain will be taken into account [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. To assess selection bias, responders and nonresponders will be compared in terms of relevant clinical and demographic variables. Data analysis will be carried out using SPSS version 19.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois). A two-tailed p-value of 0.05 will be considered statistically significant.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Why publish a study protocol? This study aims to show that pelvic physiotherapy in combination with standard medical care is more effective than standard medical care alone in constipated children. To our knowledge, this article is the first to describe the design of an RCT among children with FC to assess the effect of PPT as an add-on to SMC. The Dutch Pelvic Physiotherapy Protocol (DPPP) presented here is based on the available literature, a survey and a Delphi procedure among experts. Exchanging knowledge and expertise with other researchers is important in order to prevent duplicate research. Consequently, it has been decided to publish the study protocol prior to achieving results.</p><p>The DPPP was developed between 2007 and 2009. Given that no studies have so far been published on the effect of PPT in childhood constipation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>] and that a repeat survey on standard PPT among 49 Dutch physiotherapists in 2011 did not yield substantial differences compared to the 2007 survey, we feel this protocol is as up-to-date as possible.</p><p>In the absence of an evaluation tool, we will use parameters for male adults to define the proper childhood pelvic floor muscle functions. These values are expected to be similar to the children&#x02019;s, as is also the opinion of the experts and the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].</p><p>Confounding in our trial may arise due to the Hawthorne-effect as a result of differences in number of the protocolised contacts. Although it is expected, based on experience, that the mean number of treatment sessions will be equal, adjusted group differences will be analysed.</p><p>Biofeedback, as a modality of PPT, is an umbrella term in the literature, covering different types of treatment, e.g. manometry (MT), myofeedback (electromyography feedback) (MFB), rectal balloon training (RBT), functional electric stimulation, flowmetry and ultrasound scan. It is administered in various ways depending on availability, costs, setting (clinic/private, discipline involved [physiotherapist/nurse/medical doctor]) and country. There are also differences in the biofeedback method used (peri-anal surface electrodes, intra-anal probes, anal manometry or RBT), the practitioner administering it (gastroenterologist, paediatrician or psychologist), number of treatments and outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. Furthermore, trials show a substantial lack of quality and harmonisation, resulting in heterogeneous treatment protocols and difficulties when interpreting the findings reported in the literature. Mixed results of BF treatment for constipation have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>].</p><p>FC caused by pelvic floor dysfunction or delayed colonic transit can manifest itself as a single or combined problem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>]. The behavioural approach, concentrating on toilet training and learning to recognise signals from the body such as the urge to defecate, is important for all constipated children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. To date, the relationship between pelvic floor muscles, breathing, trunk control and posture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] has been largely ignored. Therefore, we feel that PFM training must be included in the treatment and should be the starting point of the therapy, rather than being studied as a single modality.</p><p>In order to standardise pelvic physiotherapy and minimise information bias, the treatment protocol has been designed in consultation with all participating specialised physiotherapists, who are experienced in treating constipated children.</p><p>As with most physiotherapeutic and medical interventions, the practitioner and patient will not be blinded to the treatment interventions. However, the investigator and patient will be blinded for the web-based and PPT baseline measurements and diary data.</p><p>Potential confounders will be the presence of urinary incontinence, enuresis, abdominal pain and the use of laxatives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. The presence of incontinence, enuresis and pain can influence the perception of patients' quality of life or may distort the SDQ and GPE scores.</p><p>Patients' compliance with the home toilet training and the use of laxatives will be monitored, as it determines the therapy intensity and, indirectly, the success of the therapy. Finally, the use of laxatives will be taken into account, as it can influence the number of stool events and consistency. The results of this trial will be used to evaluate the proposed Dutch pelvic physiotherapy protocol and to determine normal values for the pelvic floor muscle function in children. These outcomes will serve as recommendations in the guideline on PPT in constipated children, which will be developed using the standard method for clinical practice guideline development of the Royal Dutch Society for Physical Therapy (KNGF).</p></sec><sec><title>Endnote</title><p>The web-based medical software had been developed by Fastguide, Bergen op Zoom, the Netherlands.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>BF: Biofeedback; DPPP: Dutch pelvic physiotherapy protocol; EMG: Electromyography; FC: Functional constipation; GPE: Global perceived effect; ICS: International continence society; KNGF: Royal Dutch Society for Physical Therapy; NRS: Numeric rating scale; M-WB: Measurement, web-based; M-PPT: Measurement at PPT practice; MFB: Myofeedback; PFM: Pelvic floor muscles; PFMT: Pelvic floor muscle training; PPT: Pelvic physiotherapy; RBT: Rectal balloon training; RCT: Randomised controlled trial; SDQ: Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire; SMC: Standard medical care.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>MvE substantially contributed to the design of the study and the drafting of the manuscript.
