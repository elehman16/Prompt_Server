Pharmacological treatments for these conditions appear relatively ineffective in Parkinson&#x02019;s disease. Mindfulness courses are increasingly popular and recognised as effective for managing emotional states, and there is growing evidence for the effectiveness of mindfulness courses for people with long-term medical conditions. With this exploratory pilot trial, we want to assess the feasibility of the procedures and processes, including recruitment, most appropriate outcome measure(s), acceptability of type and number of measures, potential nocebo effects, and potential effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a specially adapted distance-delivered mindfulness-based intervention in people affected by Parkinson&#x02019;s disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>This is a pilot two-arm randomised parallel group controlled trial. Sixty participants who meet eligibility criteria will be randomly assigned either to an 8-week mindfulness-based intervention group or a wait-list control group. The mindfulness intervention will include 1-h weekly sessions delivered by a health psychologist trained to facilitate mindfulness courses. Participants in both groups will complete standardised questionnaires assessing anxiety, depression, pain, insomnia, fatigue, and daily activities at four time points (baseline, 4, 8, and 20&#x000a0;weeks). The analysis will also consider potential mechanisms of change, such as acceptance, self-compassion, and tolerance of uncertainty, as well as health economic outcomes. Participants&#x02019; experiences of the mindfulness interventions will be explored via in-depth interviews.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>A mindfulness-based intervention for people with Parkinson&#x02019;s delivered remotely, through Skype group videoconferences, may represent a viable, more accessible, intervention for people with mobility limitations and people who live in rural areas. The trial will provide important information about the feasibility, potential efficacy and cost-effectiveness, and acceptability of the intervention as well as mechanisms of psychosocial adjustment. The results of this pilot trial will help us design a phase III trial to assess efficacy of an online mindfulness-based intervention in Parkinson&#x02019;s disease and evaluate significance.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02683330">NCT02683330</ext-link>

Indeed, non-motor symptoms dominate the clinical picture of PD and contribute to severe disability, impaired quality of life, and shortened life expectancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Anxiety and depression are the most prevalent non-motor symptoms in PD. Depending on the criteria used, depression affects up to 50% of people affected by PD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and up to 31% of people with PD report some level of anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Even when people do not experience significant psychological disorders, they may still struggle to adjust to the social, emotional, and personal changes brought on by the condition.</p><p>Pharmacological interventions for anxiety and depression have received the most empirical attention to date. However, people with PD benefit less from antidepressant treatment than do patients without PD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Also, there is a high risk of negative side effects and adverse interactions between antidepressants and antiparkinsonian medications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Anxiety is managed pharmacologically largely also by antidepressants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Atomoxetine, an effective drug treatment for anxiety in non-PD patients, was not found to be efficacious for anxiety in PD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Benzodiazepines, commonly used for anxiety disorder treatment, are not recommended for PD patients due to adverse effects including cognitive and psychomotor impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Therefore, non-pharmacological interventions can provide a good alternative for mood problems in PD.</p><p>To date, there is very little research into the effectiveness of psychological interventions in PD, with only a small number of studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] investigating the feasibility and effectiveness of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) in the treatment of depression and anxiety. Mindfulness-based group therapy is a rapidly growing psychological approach to helping people adjust to chronic illness and manage unpleasant symptoms that is embedded within the concept of acceptance. Mindfulness focuses on finding a new way to relate to thoughts and to accept them as passing events that do not necessarily represent a state of reality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Mindfulness is based on the philosophy that human suffering develops in part by efforts to struggle with and avoid our own psychological and emotional pain. Changing one&#x02019;s relationship to thoughts appears to be the most effective component of mindfulness-based intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Over a typical 8-week mindfulness course, participants complete daily mindfulness meditation practices and attend weekly group meetings.</p><p>Furthermore, mindfulness has potential cost advantages as interventions are delivered to groups requiring less therapist time per patient. Mindfulness courses have clear time boundaries, and once the techniques have been taught, patients can continue practising without additional contribution from a therapist.</p><p>A 2005 meta-analysis of the health benefits of mindfulness across a range of chronic illnesses suggested that mindfulness is at least moderately effective at improving symptom management, anxiety, and depression in a range of conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Three recent small randomised control trials (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;29, 30, and 14) showed a significant decrease after the mindfulness-based intervention in reported motor symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and symptoms of depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] for people with PD. A qualitative study evaluating the acceptability and feasibility of this approach in a group of patients with PD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] has found that this form of intervention is well accepted by patients with PD. Further, an MRI study showed that mindfulness in PD leads to structural brain changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Increased grey matter density was found in the mindfulness group compared to the usual-care group in the right amygdala and bilaterally in the hippocampus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. These areas have been postulated to play an important role in PD as they seem to contribute to clinical motor symptoms (bradykinesia, tremor, rigidity) and non-motor symptoms.</p><p>To date, there is very little research in evaluating the effects of mindfulness in reducing anxiety and depression in patients with PD. Given the body of evidence exposed above, it would be realistic to expect that a mindfulness-based intervention could be beneficial for people with PD in relation to issues such as denial and acceptance of the illness, the loss of independence, and the many disturbances that go together with a disease over which the person has limited control.</p><p>We propose to deliver a mindfulness intervention via Skype, an online application that enables videoconferences with two or more people. Online mindfulness courses might facilitate attendance and adherence in this particular population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. There has been increasing use of distance-delivered interventions for people with disease-related barriers such as impaired mobility. Further, there is evidence that distance-delivered mindfulness interventions can also be effective in people with chronic medical conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p>We ran two patient advisory group meetings (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;14) with people with PD in preparation for this trial. Participants of these meetings were recruited through Parkinson&#x02019;s UK research network and most had some knowledge of mindfulness and its application. The first and second authors facilitated the groups. We talked to participants about our plans with the trial and the development of the intervention, and here, we incorporated their feedback. The focus group participants talked about mindfulness being beneficial to people who do not necessarily experience high levels of anxiety or depression but still they have difficulties adjusting to PD challenges and managing PD symptoms. Participants also reported that although using Skype may exclude people not familiar with technology or people who do not own a computer, this method of delivery would make it possible for people across the country and those with restricted mobility to participate. Patient advisory group participants were overall in favour of using Skype and as one participant said &#x02018;we need to move with the times, we need to go with the technology&#x02019;.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Aims</title><p>The overall objective of this study is to assess the feasibility of procedures and processes as well as potential efficacy (i.e. explore potential for detecting change in each of the proposed measures for each group) of a mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) for people with PD, which will be delivered via Skype.</p><p>The specific aims of this trial are to:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Monitor rates of recruitment, retention, refusal, adherence to the mindfulness sessions, and homework practice, as well as the appropriateness of eligibility criteria to determine the rate of each for planning the main trial</p></list-item><list-item><p>Assessing time and resource problems, for example whether it is feasible for patients to answer all the questionnaires and the time taken to do so, the flow of participants entering the study, the use of equipment to set up Skype, and other resources needed</p></list-item><list-item><p>Determine data management issues, by monitoring levels of missing data and data variability</p></list-item><list-item><p>Evaluate the potential for detecting a change in each of the proposed outcome measures (anxiety, depression, pain, fatigue, insomnia, quality of life, subjective well-being, physical impact of PD, health costs) when comparing the mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) group to the wait-list control (WLC) group</p></list-item><list-item><p>Understand the mechanisms of change (mindfulness skills, acceptance, self-compassion, decentering, tolerance of uncertainty) in each patient group, including any potential nocebo effects in the WLC group</p></list-item><list-item><p>Assess the qualitative experiences of receiving the mindfulness intervention and people&#x02019;s views and experiences of using Skype as a mode of delivery as well as people&#x02019;s feedback on the questionnaires used</p></list-item></list>

Fox Foundation. Recruitment started in February 2016 and is expected to finish in June 2016.</p><p>People with PD who see the web advert or the email during the trial period and are interested in the study will get in touch with the trial coordinator. Participants will receive adequate information before consenting to take part in the study, including information sheets and discussion with the trial coordinator. Potential participants will be issued with a Participant Information Sheet and will be encouraged to read it carefully and to discuss it with others before making a decision. Participants will also be encouraged to contact the researchers with any questions that they might have. In the initial discussion with the participant, the trial coordinator will check whether the participant has understood the purpose and nature of the research and what the research involves, its benefits (and lack of benefits), risks, and burdens. After the initial discussion with the trial coordinator and consideration of the information sheets, potential participants will have at least 24&#x000a0;h to fully consider the implications of taking part in the research, ask questions, and reflect, before giving consent. Individuals participating in the study will sign a written consent form before the baseline assessments. On the form, participants are given the choice to consent to the mindfulness trial and questionnaire assessments only or to an additional in-depth telephone interview after their mindfulness programme has been completed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Eligibility screening and enrolment</title><p>During the initial telephone contact, the trial coordinator will explain the purpose of the study in detail and potential participant&#x02019;s questions will be answered. After obtaining a verbal consent and explaining what will happen with the data given in the case of eligibility/ineligibility, the trial coordinator will administer the screening questionnaires via telephone. After screening, participants will be notified whether they are eligible or ineligible for the trial. If the results of the screening assessment indicate that they are eligible for the study, they will be given an invitation to participate and the trial coordinator will check whether they need any help with setting up Skype and clarify technicalities for the sessions.</p><p>Participants will be sent the equipment they need to use Skype, such as headsets and web-cameras (if not incorporated in their computers) as well as a booklet with instructions on how to set up Skype on their computer.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Randomisation</title><p>Participants will be randomly assigned to either the MBI group or the WLC group with a 1:1 allocation using a computer-generated blocked randomisation scheme.

The sessions will last 1&#x000a0;h and will be held via videoconference through Skype, an online application, in groups of five people. The videoconferences will be initiated by AB and will be arranged at a day and time that is most suitable for all participants in the group. CDs with homework mindfulness practices will address potential issues people with PD may come across during practices, like resting tremor, spasms, fatigue, and mind wandering.</p><p>The sessions will be carried out based on a written manual. However, flexibility will be allowed to follow issues and topics that are more important for the group during the sessions. Participants will be issued the mindfulness manual before their first session and will be encouraged to read only the chapter of the relevant session each week. The manual will contain eight chapters. In each chapter, the homework for each week will be outlined followed by a brief description of the week&#x02019;s theme.</p><p>Participants will sign a consent form indicating that they understand that they are being recorded and that recordings will be stored in password-protected files and only be used for the stated purposes (i.e. fidelity checks and supervision).</p><sec id="Sec14"><title>Developing of the MBI manual and meditation CDs&#x02014;new adaptations</title><p>The MBI manual is based on the mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) programme for depression developed by Segal et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In this study, we are using this MBCT programme but tailored to the needs of people with PD. One of the main changes we have introduced is the reduction of time in the mindfulness home practice. The original MBCT programme suggests that participants should practise mindfulness meditation for 45&#x000a0;min, 6&#x000a0;days a week. Due to their condition, people with PD may have difficulties maintaining a long practice, due to problems with sitting still in one posture, maintaining concentration, and fatigue. Therefore, the meditation practices were shortened to 20&#x000a0;min to accommodate the needs of people with PD. Further, we have reduced the weekly group sessions from 2/2.5 to 1&#x000a0;h. It has been found that the correlation between mean effect size and the number of in-class hours is non-significant for both clinical and nonclinical samples, which suggests that adaptations that include less class time may be worthwhile for populations for whom longer time commitment may be a barrier to their ability to participate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In fact, shortened class time has been used successfully before, for example in people with multiple sclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], multiple sclerosis and peripheral neuropathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], and PD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The manual also includes PD-specific examples. These changes will make the intervention more accessible for people with PD without compromising its effectiveness.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>MBI sessions</title><p>AB will deliver the 8-week course. AB is a health psychologist, who has completed teachers&#x02019; training to deliver mindfulness-based courses and has experience delivering mindfulness programmes for people with neurological conditions via Skype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].

We will consider the trial feasible if these processes compare favourably to other psychological trials or mindfulness trials in PD. We will also assess the appropriateness of the eligibility criteria in recruiting a population receptive to, and appropriate for, a mindfulness intervention by assessing adherence and retention rates. We will assess whether the criteria were too restrictive by comparing recruitment targets against actual recruitment process and also assessing whether too many people were excluded based on specific criteria.</p><p>We will assess time and resource problems that can occur during the main study by assessing the length of time required to fill out all the questionnaires. We will investigate whether there is participant overload, how much time it takes to screen participants and mail out consent forms, whether Skype equipment is needed, and how problems with installing or using Skype can best be managed.</p><p>We will also investigate issues around data collection, whether data from different data points can be matched, whether diary entries can be logged accurately, whether there are important data variables left blank, or whether the data show too much or too little variability.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Patient-centred outcome measures</title><p>We will explore the potential for detecting change in each of the following outcome measures for each group separately.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>])</title><p>This 14-item scale will be used to assess symptoms of depression (7 items) and anxiety (7 items).

Mindfulness-based interventions have been traditionally delivered in a face-to-face group setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. This pilot trial will look specifically at assisting psychological adjustment for people with PD and is conducted in preparation of an efficacy study for an online MBI in PD. The distance delivery of this trial means that we are offering psychological support to a group of patients who would not otherwise routinely have formal access to psychological interventions but who nonetheless are faced with considerable psychological challenges. With this study, we will explore different ways to deliver group psychological interventions and we will enrich our knowledge on the specific needs and challenges faced by people affected by PD as well as how best to address these needs.</p><p>Some limitations of the current study need to be acknowledged. First, we will not have a large enough sample to account for the heterogeneity in the non-motor challenges that people with PD face. Therefore, we will not be able to make sub-group comparisons of the potential effectiveness of the interventions for people who entered the trial with different non-motor challenges. Further, a WLC group can induce nocebo effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>], inflating the effectiveness of the intervention. Any worsening of symptoms for the WLC group will be reported and suggestions will be made for more appropriate controls in a future larger trial. Also, the total HADS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] score may not be the most appropriate tool to detect caseness of depression and anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. However, it was chosen since HADS measures anxiety and depression without confounding by somatic symptoms of the physical disorder, in contrast to other depression and anxiety scales that include items like insomnia, retardation of psychomotor, tremor, dry mouth, muscle aches, loss of energy, and fatigue. These items although they are an indication of anxiety or depression, they can also be symptoms of PD and not a reflection of anxiety or depression. There are also some validation studies for HADS showing good psychometric properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. In addition, HADS will potentially be chosen as the primary outcome of the intervention and it was important to choose a measure that is sensitive to change both during the course of an illness and in response to medical or psychological intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. HADS is also relatively short and easy to administer. Finally, Skype calls depend on the strength of the internet connection and can interrupt therapy sessions. AB has experience delivering these courses over Skype without excessive technical problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. AB usually incorporates any disruptions or lack of quality as examples that participants could use to practise staying with difficulties and identify thoughts arising when there is frustration, so these interruptions become part of the mindfulness learnings. The qualitative interviews with participants at the end of the courses will help us explore experiences of the course and the Skype delivery. These interviews will direct us to potential changes in the future courses.</p><p>Nevertheless, this pilot trial will answer important questions about the feasibility of procedures and processes as well as the potential efficacy of an 8-week distance-delivered mindfulness course in reducing distress and increasing the quality of life. If the results show that this intervention is feasible and potential effective for people with PD, a grant will be prepared for a large randomised control trial which will aim to assess the effectiveness of this intervention on a representative sample and compared against an active control group. We will also explore the role of different &#x02018;active ingredients&#x02019; of mindfulness-based approaches such as acceptance, self-compassion, decentering, and cultivating mindfulness skills to determine how mindfulness interventions work and which are the most important components of these interventions regarding changes in outcome measure. Further, this pilot trial will provide some indication regarding the cost-effectiveness of the intervention and its acceptability to patients.</p><p>This pilot trial is set up to be methodologically robust and to conform to CONSORT guidelines. We have taken care to address key sources of bias; the MBI for PD course will be subject to ongoing supervision to ensure therapy fidelity, and this will also be checked post-therapy by independent raters. The assessments of patient outcomes are self-reported and collected by an independent researcher who is uninvolved in therapy delivery. The MBI trial for PD also benefits from service-user input from the early stages of therapy design and manual development, right through to the in-depth evaluation of the MBI sessions. The data from the feedback interviews will be particularly important in guiding any changes to the MBI format.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>CBT</term><def><p>Cognitive behavioural therapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GCP</term><def><p>Good Clinical Practice</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MBI</term><def><p>Mindfulness-based intervention</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MBCT</term><def><p>Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NHS</term><def><p>National Health Service</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NRES</term><def><p>National Research Ethics Service</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PD</term><def><p>Parkinson&#x02019;s disease</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WLC</term><def><p>Wait-list control</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the anonymous Patient and Public Involvement group for their feedback on the MindPD manual and questionnaires and Parkinson&#x02019;s UK, in particular, Amelia Hursey, for supporting recruitment.</p><sec id="FPar15"><title>Funding</title><p>This study is funded by Parkinson&#x02019;s UK (K-1409).
