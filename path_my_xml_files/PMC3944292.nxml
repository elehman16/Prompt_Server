exercise using a saing on the balance ability of patients with hemiplegia. [Subjects]
Forty patients with hemiplegia resulting from stroke were divided into a sling exercise
group (SEG, n=20) and a mat exercise group (MEG, n=20). [Methods] The SEG conducted the
trunk stabilization exercise using a sling, and the MEG performed the trunk stabilization
exercise on a mat. [Results] The balance ability of both groups significantly improved.
Although there were no significant differences between the groups, the SEG showed a
greater reduction in the sway area (SA) and the sway length (SL) of the center of the
pressure compared to the MEG. [Conclusion] We recommend trunk stabilization exercise using
a sling as a clinical intervention to improve the balance ability of patients with
hemiplegia.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Hemiplegia</kwd><kwd>Trunk stabilization exercise</kwd><kwd>Sling</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Hemiplegia is the main symptom of stroke, which results in diverse sensory, motor,
perception, recognition, and language problems<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Hemiplegia is commonly associated with a decrease in trunk
adjustment ability. In particular, it causes a decrease in the activities of the lateral
trunk muscles, and an increase in the asymmetry between the left and the right side, as well
as paralysis of the trunk muscles. Additional complications are a decrease in the
simultaneous contraction of the trunk muscles and a tendency to fall toward the paretic
side, triggering problems, such as qualitative degradation of gait<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Physical therapy interventions are needed for these motor
disorders to enable patients with brain damage to live independent lives.</p><p>The trunk muscles are essential for the maintenance of different postures in daily life.
Therefore, maintaining the strength and the endurance of the trunk muscles is crucial<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Core stability is a kinetic chain activity
necessary for the stabilization of the trunk<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. It regulates optimal task performance ability, movement, muscle
power, and motor ability. Among the intervention methods for trunk stabilization, a sling
reduces the burden on the joints and simultaneously contracts the muscles restrained by
pain, dynamically and statically, thereby stimulating the nerve roots and reactivating the
muscles<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Recently, trunk stabilization
exercise using a sling has been investigated in a number of studies, which have reported
positive results. Balance and gait are impaired in hemiplegic patients due to loss or
reduction of trunk adjustment ability. Therefore, selective trunk adjustment exercise is
important, and trunk stabilization exercise is prescribed as an intervention.</p><p>Trunk stabilization exercises using a sling are largely reserved for non-hemiplegic people
and orthopedic patients. This study investigated the effects of trunk stabilization exercise
using a sling on improvements in the balance ability of hemiplegic patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects of this study were 40 patients diagnosed with hemiplegia resulting from stroke
by a rehabilitation doctor practicing in B Hospital located in Daegu, South Korea. They were
randomly and equally assigned to a sling exercise group (SEG: 11 males, 9 female) and a mat
exercise group (MEG: 13 males, 7 female). The mean &#x000b1; SD age, height, and weight of the SEG
was 51.15&#x000b1;14.81&#x02005;years, 163.45&#x000b1;8.53&#x02005;cm, and 62.07&#x000b1;9.79&#x02005;kg, respectively. Eleven of the
patients had right hemiplegia, and nine had left hemiplegia. The onset period was
14.10&#x000b1;11.40 months. The mean &#x000b1; SD age, height, and weight of the MEG was 48.65&#x000b1;12.81&#x02005;years,
164.10&#x000b1;8.11&#x02005;cm, and 63.80&#x000b1;9.26&#x02005;kg, respectively. Eight of the patients had right hemiplegia,
and 12 had left hemiplegia. The onset period was 12.75&#x000b1;9.60 months.</p><p>The inclusion criteria were as follows: no visual field defect, no abnormality in the
vestibular organs, no orthopedic disease, an unrestricted range of motion, ability to
understand and perform the exercise as instructed by the researcher, and a score of 24 or
higher on the Mini-Mental State Examination-Korean version. All the subjects understood the
purpose of this study and provided their written informed consent prior to their
participation in the study in accordance with the ethical standards of the Declaration of
Helsinki.</p><p>The SEG contracted the transversus abdominis and raised the trunk in all the exercise
positions. In the first exercise of the trunk stabilization exercises using a sling, the
patients hooked their heels in the sling and raised their pelvis and maintained it in a
raised position for 10 seconds. In the second exercise, the patients hooked one knee in the
sling in a side-lying position and raised their pelvis, so that their head, trunk, and lower
extremity made a straight line. They maintained this posture for 10 seconds. The same method
was performed on the opposite side. In the third exercise, the patients hooked their knees
in the sling and raised their trunk and maintained this stance in a prone on elbow position.
In the first exercise in the MEG, the patients tilted their pelvis in a hook-lying position
(HLP) to the backside and maintained the position for 10 seconds. In the second exercise,
they extended their arms toward the front side, raised the scapula in a HLP, and bent the
trunk, and maintained the position for 10 seconds. The third exercise involved raising the
pelvis and maintaining the position for 10 seconds, taking care to ensure that the lumbar
region did not sag. In the fourth exercise, the patients stretched one leg straight in a
pelvic elevation position and maintained the position for five seconds, and then adopted the
same position on the opposite side<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Both
groups conducted their exercises three times per week, 30 minutes each time, and carried out
warming-up and cooling-down exercises before and after the exercise. Measurements were
collected twice, before and after the intervention, which lasted for 8weeks.</p><p>For the measurement of balance ability, a biofeedback analysis system (AP1153 Biorescue,
France), was used to determine the sway area (SA) and the sway length (SL) of the center of
the pressure in a static standing position.</p><p>The experimental results were statistically analyzed using SPSS 20.0 KO (IBM, IL, USA).
After the general characteristics of the subjects were determined, the paired t-test was
used to compare the variation in the SA following quiet standing and the variation in the SL
following quiet standing between pre- and post- intervention within each group. The
significance of the difference between the two groups was investigated using the independent
t-test. Statistical significance was accepted for values of p&#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The SA and the SL of the center of the pressure of the SEG in a standing position had

stabilization program using a sling significantly improved elite soccer players&#x02019; posture,
balance, kicking speed, and functional strengths of the pelvis and the trunk muscles and
concluded that functional muscle strength exercise using a sling was effective at enhancing
nerve root adjustment. Park et al.<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>
reported that the muscle strength of patients with chronic lumbar pain, who conducted a
sling exercise for four weeks, significantly increased in the lumbar region. In a study of
lumbar pain patients assigned to trunk stabilization exercise on a mat or the same exercise
using a sling, Kim<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup> observed that the
trunk stabilization exercise using the sling was more effective than the trunk stabilization
exercise on the mat for strengthening the muscles of the thoracic and lumbar regions.</p><p>In the present study, although the differences were not statistically significant, the SA
and SL of the center of the pressure in a static standing position decreased more in the SEG
than in the MEG. We attribute the greater decreases in the SA and SL of the center of the
pressure of the SEG to conducting the exercise on an unstable base of support. This induces
proprioceptive stimuli and activation of the whole muscles in closed kinetic chain exercise.
Michael et al.<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup> proposed that trunk
stabilization exercise using a Swiss ball enhanced the strength and balance of the trunk
muscle by utilizing muscle tissues that were not usually used, and that the continuous
movement of the body was needed to counter the unstable state of the trunk when using the
Swiss ball. O&#x02019;Sullivan et al.<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that performing exercise to stabilize the
center of the pressure on an unstable base of support stimulated more proprioceptors and
motor organs of the cerebrum than exercise on a stable base of support, maximizing the sense
of balance and the balance maintaining ability, and effectively enhancing trunk
stabilization. The results of the aforementioned studies demonstrate the effectiveness and
the importance of exercise on an unstable base of support, including exercise with a
sling.</p><p>We conclude that trunk stabilization exercise using a sling as a clinical intervention
aimed at improving the balance ability of patients with hemiplegia resulting from stroke is
useful for patients who need to improve postural adjustment and balance ability.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Kelley</surname><given-names>RE</given-names></name><name><surname>Borazanci</surname><given-names>AP</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Stroke rehabilitation</article-title>. <source>Neurol
