Macrophages play an important role in wound healing, in particular by killing microbes.

While the stress group underwent a standardized short-term psychological stress task after catheter-induced wound infliction, stress-controls did not. Catheter insertion was controlled. Assessing the microbicidal potential, we investigated PMA-activated superoxide anion production by HMDM immediately before and 1, 10 and 60 min after stress/rest. Moreover, plasma norepinephrine and epinephrine and salivary cortisol were repeatedly measured. In subsequent <italic>in vitro</italic> studies, whole blood was incubated with norepinephrine in the presence or absence of phentolamine (norepinephrine blocker) before assessing HMDM microbicidal potential.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Compared with stress-controls, HMDM of the stressed subjects displayed decreased superoxide anion-responses after stress (<italic>p</italic>&#x02019;s &#x0003c;.05).

Although current findings suggest that the stress-induced delay of wound healing is associated with a suppressed immune reaction in early phases of wound healing, the precise underlying mechanisms of this stress effect remain unclear <xref rid="pone.0055875-Gouin1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.</p><p>Macrophages are tissue-resident immune cells that are differentiated from circulating blood monocytes. When activated, macrophages acquire competence to perform a variety of critical immunological functions, including the killing of microbes (i.e. microbicidal activity) and tumor cells, regulation of lymphocytes and inflammation, or remodeling and repair of tissue <xref rid="pone.0055875-Taylor1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0055875-Woods1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. In particular, macrophage microbicidal activity plays a significant role in early phases of inflammation such as the first phases of skin wound healing <xref rid="pone.0055875-MahdavianDelavary1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Macrophage activation in terms of microbicidal activity can be investigated in pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages, a phenotype developed following activation with inflammatory cytokines (e.g. IFN-&#x003b3;, TNF-&#x003b1;) and bacterial products (e.g. LPS) <xref rid="pone.0055875-Taylor1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055875-Pelegrin1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. M1 macrophages are characterized by enhanced microbicidal activity <xref rid="pone.0055875-Martinez1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055875-Hunter1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, which is mainly mediated by increased secretion of microbe killing highly oxidizing agents, the so-called reactive oxygen species (ROS; e.g. superoxide anion, hydrogen peroxide) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS; e.g. nitric oxide) <xref rid="pone.0055875-Taylor1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055875-Dale1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Moreover, M1 macrophages secrete high amounts of chemokines and pro-inflammatory cytokines <xref rid="pone.0055875-Taylor1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p><p>Given that psychological stress can impair wound healing <xref rid="pone.0055875-Walburn1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055875-Robles1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0055875-Robles2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, and given the role of microbicidal active M1 macrophages in early wound healing phases <xref rid="pone.0055875-MahdavianDelavary1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, stress may exert at least parts of its wound healing impairment by inhibiting the microbicidal potential (i.e. ROS production) of these cells. However, the effect of acute psychological stress on ROS-dependent microbicidal potential of <italic>ex vivo</italic> isolated human M1 macrophages has not yet been investigated. To date, inhibitory effects of acute psychological stress on ROS production have only been observed in undifferentiated circulating human blood phagocytes (i.e. neutrophils and monocytes as precursors of macrophages) <italic>in vitro</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0055875-Atanackovic1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Notably, only the investigation of macrophages as tissue cells might allow conclusions regarding microbicidal activity of macrophages at sites of inflammation or wounding. Also, monocytes and macrophages differ considerably in their gene expression profile <xref rid="pone.0055875-Hashimoto1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> with the result that findings for monocytes are not necessarily replicated in macrophages and vice versa. Hitherto, studies in rodents investigating the effects of psychological stress on the microbicidal potential of <italic>ex vivo</italic> isolated macrophages reported stress-induced, albeit inconsistent changes in the production of ROS and RNS <xref rid="pone.0055875-Stanojevic1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0055875-PalermoNeto1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Acute stress may influence M1 microbicidal potential via activation of the two major stress systems, the hypothalamus-pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis and/or the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). Both monocytes and macrophages express receptors for a variety of neuroendocrine products of the HPA axis and the SNS (e.g. receptors for glucocorticoids [GC] and catecholamines [CA] as major stress hormones) <xref rid="pone.0055875-Woods1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055875-Blotta1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0055875-ReyesGarcia1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Moreover, <italic>in vitro</italic> studies exposing non-human macrophages to GC or CA demonstrated predominantly hormone-induced decreases in ROS production <xref rid="pone.0055875-Stanojevic1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055875-Colton1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Taken together, mental stress may modulate macrophage microbicidal potential, probably by stress-induced release of GC (as the final products of HPA axis activation) and/or of CA release (resulting from SNS activation).</p><p>The purpose of this study was twofold: First, in a sample of healthy men we set out to examine the effects of a potent acute psychological stressor known to induce large stress hormone increases compared to a non-stress control condition on microbicidal potential of M1 macrophages differentiated from pre-activated monocytes (stress study). We inserted a venous catheter which we intended to function as an open wound to pre-activate circulating monocytes as precursors of later M1 macrophages <italic>in vivo.</italic> Psychosocial stress was induced via the widely used Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) <xref rid="pone.0055875-Kirschbaum1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. For the investigation of M1 cell microbicidal potential, we performed an WST-1 assay as described elsewhere with minor modifications <xref rid="pone.0055875-Sakai1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. The assay principle is based on the reduction of 2-(4-Iodophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-(2,4-disulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (WST-1) by superoxide anions produced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-activated human monocyte-derived M1 macrophages (HMDM) <xref rid="pone.0055875-Tan1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Our main hypotheses were that a) catheter-insertion as open wound induction would increase microbicidal potential of HMDM over time, and that b) acute psychological stress would inhibit this wound-induced increase in microbicidal potential. To validate our open wound paradigm, we controlled for catheter insertion by applying a non-open wound blood sampling method (i.e. short-term cannula insertion instead of long-term catheter insertion) in an additional control group.</p><p>Second, in order to investigate underlying mechanisms, we tested whether the hypothesized inhibiting effect of stress is statistically mediated by blood norepinephrine (NE), epinephrine (EPI) and/or cortisol levels. Significant mediation effects were further examined in a series of <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments. For this purpose, we set out to incubate whole blood with stress hormones in the presence or absence of the respective stress-hormone-antagonists before performing the WST-1 assay.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Design and Procedure</title><sec id="s2a1"><title>Stress study</title><p>Subjects of the stress group and of the stress-control group reported to the laboratory by 10 a.m. and had abstained from extensive physical exercise, alcohol, and caffeinated beverages during the previous 24 h. Subjects were given a calorically standardized breakfast with comparable nutritional composition before an indwelling venous catheter was inserted not only for blood sampling but also to induce an open wound. The following resting period of 165 min was intended to allow <italic>in vivo</italic> stimulation of circulating monocytes by the applied open wound paradigm. Next, subjects of the stress group were exposed to the TSST <xref rid="pone.0055875-Kirschbaum1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, which comprises a short introduction followed by a 5-min preparation period, a 5-min mock job interview, and a 5-min mental arithmetic task (serial subtraction) in front of an unknown panel of two persons. The TSST has repeatedly been shown to induce significant neuroendocrine stress responses <xref rid="pone.0055875-Dickerson1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Subjects of the stress-control group were not exposed to the TSST but were required to stand in the empty TSST room for 10 min in order to control for a possible influence of orthostatic stress. Before and after TSST/rest, subjects remained seated in a quiet room.</p><p>Blood samples for WST-1 reduction measurements were obtained immediately before (serving as baseline levels) and 1, 10 and 60 min after TSST/rest cessation. To determine CA levels, blood samples were taken immediately before (baseline) and 1, 10, and 20 min after TSST/rest cessation. For determination of salivary free cortisol levels, samples of saliva were collected immediately before (baseline) and 1, 10, 20, 30, 45, and 60 min after TSST/rest cessation. To determine mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), blood pressure was measured by sphygmomanometry (Omron 773, Omron Healthcare Europe B.V. Hoofdorp, Netherlands) immediately before and 40 min after insertion of the venous catheter. MAP was calculated by the formula (2/3 * mean diastolic BP)+(1/3 mean systolic BP). At the end of the experiment, participants were debriefed and remunerated with 175 Swiss Francs for their participation.</p></sec><sec id="s2a2"><title>Catheter-control: Pilot data</title><p>To control for catheter insertion, subjects of the catheter-control group reported to the laboratory for blood collection by short-term cannula venipuncture twice during the same day. The time interval between the two blood samples was intentionally chosen to be comparable to the interval between the first and the last blood sample in the stress study (i.e. baseline assessment and 60 min after stress/rest). Moreover, to account for potential circadian rhythm effects, the first and the last blood sample were drawn at the exact same time of the day as in the stress study (with exception of one subject staring earlier (10 a.m.) and one subject starting later (2 p.m.)). Nine milliliters of blood were drawn from a peripheral vein through disposable cannulas into EDTA-coated tubes (Sarstedt, Numbrecht, Germany) and layered on top of 10 ml Ficoll, and the WST-1 assay was performed as describe below.</p></sec><sec id="s2a3"><title>In vitro experiments</title><p>In order to assess the effects of physiological post-stress levels of NE on HMDM (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055875-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), subjects reported to the laboratory for blood collection on a single study day between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m. Nine milliliters of blood were drawn from a peripheral vein through disposable cannulas into EDTA-coated tubes (Sarstedt, Numbrecht, Germany) and incubated with three different concentrations of NE. We added 50 &#x000b5;l of various concentrations of NE to whole blood resulting in a final concentration of 0 (reference sample), 500 (low post-stress levels of NE), and 1000 pg/ml (high post-stress levels of NE) NE.

For the <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments with the alpha-adrenergic blocker phentolamine used as NE-antagonist, blood samples were incubated with 100 und 1000 pg/ml phenolamine for 10 min before exposure to 500 pg/ml NE for 20 min. Notably, we decided for a stimulation by 500 pg/ml NE as this concentration is close both to the mean NE post stress level (678.95 pg/ml) and to the lowest NE stress increase level (308 pg/ml) that we observed in our stress study.

We favored ANCOVAs over multiple linear regression analyses to test for statistical mediation because steps 2 and 3 include repeatedly measured WST-1 reduction as the dependent variable. The use of multiple linear regression analysis would require artificial integration of the repeatedly measured dependent variable into a single measure index resulting in a loss of information.</p><p>Post-hoc testing of significant mediation effects comprised first, statistical evaluation of the indirect effect.

Additionally, we assessed pilot data to test whether catheter insertion as compared to non-permanent short-term cannula insertion would increase macrophage microbicidal potential during the testing period of our stress study. We used a WST-1 assay based on the reduction of WST-1 by superoxide anions produced by PMA-activated <italic>ex vivo</italic> isolated HMDM <xref rid="pone.0055875-Sakai1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055875-Tan1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, and measured plasma levels of the stress hormones NE, EPI, and cortisol. To validate our statistical mediation results we also performed <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments with NE in the presence or absence of phentolamine.</p><p>As hypothesized, we found an increase in WST-1 reduction of PMA-activated <italic>ex vivo</italic> isolated HMDM over time in the stress-control group but not in the stress group and not in the catheter-control group. WST-1 reduction by HMDM of the stressed subjects remained unchanged throughout the study period. Without insertion of a venous catheter, i.e. in the catheter-control group, we observed a decrease in WST-1 reduction by HMDM during the testing period. The stress-induced inhibition of stimulated macrophage microbicidal potential was statistically mediated by NE changes but did not significantly relate to EPI and cortisol changes. Higher NE stress responses (&#x00394;NE) were associated with lower scores of WST-1 reduction by HMDM. In line with this, NE at post-stress levels reduced WST-1 reduction in our <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments. Furthermore, adrenergic blockade with phentolamine before incubation with NE completely blocked the observed decrease in WST-1 reduction. Taken together, our findings suggest that wound-induced stimulation of the microbicidal potential of HMDM is reduced by acute psychological stress, and that this effect of stress is mediated by stress-induced NE plasma levels. Notably, the effect of stress on WST-1 reduction was of medium to large or large effect size.</p><p>What are the potential implications of these findings and how do they relate to the literature? In contrast to our stressed subjects, we found that macrophage microbicidal potential of the stress-controls increased in terms of WST-1 reduction over time. We intentionally aimed for an increase in macrophage microbicidal potential in the stress-control group as we applied a standardized wound by simple insertion of a venous catheter more than two hours (165 min) prior to baseline assessment. After a review of the wound healing literature, we identified this time interval to be sufficiently long to allow initiation of wound healing processes and thus monocyte priming stimulation <xref rid="pone.0055875-MahdavianDelavary1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055875-Stroncek1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. In line with such reasoning, macrophage activity did not increase but even decrease in the catheter-control group during the monitoring period. Consequently, we interpret the observed continuous and apparently linear increase in microbicidal macrophage potential in the stress-control group as reflection of successful monocyte pre-activation due to wound healing initiation. Thus, our open wound paradigm seems to work in the expected direction. Notably, the observed decrease in WST-1 reduction over time in the catheter-control group might relate to circadian effects <xref rid="pone.0055875-Atanackovic1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p><p>Our main finding is that microbicidal potential of HMDM of the stressed subjects remained unchanged throughout the study period. Psychological stress has been repeatedly shown to delay the process of wound healing <xref rid="pone.0055875-Walburn1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055875-Gouin1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> in which macrophages are known to play a pivotal role <xref rid="pone.0055875-MahdavianDelavary1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Skin wound healing characteristically runs in consecutive and overlapping phases with the inflammatory phase as an early phase beginning within hours after wound application <xref rid="pone.0055875-Stroncek1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. This phase aims at eliminating potential microbes, foreign particles and cell debris in the wound <xref rid="pone.0055875-MahdavianDelavary1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055875-Stroncek1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. After approximately 48 hours, the most prominent immune cells in the wound area are monocyte-derived macrophages, predominantly of the M1 macrophage phenotype <xref rid="pone.0055875-MahdavianDelavary1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055875-Stroncek1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055875-Engelhardt1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. These M1 macrophages are essential for successful completion of the inflammatory phase: They kill microbes by microbicidal activity and also promote inflammation by secreting pro-inflammatory cytokines, thus contributing to the progression to the next levels of wound healing <xref rid="pone.0055875-Taylor1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055875-Martinez1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Notably, the differentiation method used in our study (i.e. co-incubation of <italic>ex vivo</italic> isolated monocytes with IFN-&#x003b3;, TNF-&#x003b1;, and LPS) is known to result in M1 macrophages, i.e. our HMDM represent M1 macrophages <xref rid="pone.0055875-Martinez1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. After successful cleaning of the wound, macrophages appear to change their functional phenotype into M2 macrophages, which show increased effector functions important for the next phases of wound healing <xref rid="pone.0055875-Stout1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Given the importance of our HMDM as tissue M1 macrophages <xref rid="pone.0055875-MahdavianDelavary1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055875-Duffield1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0055875-Porcheray1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, our findings suggest that the stress-induced delay in wound healing may be mediated by suppression of M1 macrophage microbicidal potential, the necessary precondition for microbicidal activity. Moreover, our cross-sectional analyses and <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments suggest that the stress-induced release of NE mediates the observed stress-induced attenuation of microbicidal macrophage potential. Interestingly, while the literature of stress effects on wound healing consistently demonstrates a stress-induced delay in wound healing <xref rid="pone.0055875-Walburn1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, Dhabhar and colleagues postulate that acute stress contributes to immunoenhancement by both increased traffic of immune cells to target tissues soon after the beginning of stress and immune cell activation <xref rid="pone.0055875-Dhabhar1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. The reduced macrophage microbicidal potential that we observed after acute stress points to an immunosuppressive effect by acute stress. Thus, our findings appear at first glance to be more consistent with the findings from wound-healing studies than with those from Dhabhar et al. <xref rid="pone.0055875-Dhabhar1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. However, it cannot be ruled out that the stress-induced suppression of macrophage microbicidal potential is overcompensated by increased numbers of macrophages in target tissues as a consequence of acute stress. Moreover, it can also not be ruled out, that the suppressive effects of stress on macrophage microbicidal potential are adaptive if stress exposure persists for more than 10 min. Lastly, given that ROS can damage tissues once they reach a certain concentration <xref rid="pone.0055875-Wlaschek1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, reduced macrophage activity (as a result of acute short-term stress) could represent a mechanism that protects target tissues from excessive and thus harmful concentrations of ROS. Considering this, our findings may extend the assumptions of Dhabhar et al. <xref rid="pone.0055875-Dhabhar1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>.</p><p>What mechanisms may underlie our observed findings? We propose the following hypothesized process to explain NE-mediated attenuation of wound-induced activation of HMDM microbicidal potential in the stress group as compared to the stress-control group: NE inhibits LPS-induced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-&#x003b1; <xref rid="pone.0055875-Verhoeckx1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055875-vanderPoll1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. Given this ability of NE to inhibit stimulated cytokine release by monocytes, NE may inhibit monocyte/macrophage cytokine release (1) either during the <italic>in vivo</italic> wound-priming period when wound application-induced thrombin release may stimulate cytokine release and/or (2) during the <italic>in vitro</italic> differentiation period when LPS, TNF-&#x003b1;, and IFN-&#x003b3; are used as stimulating agents. Consequently, NE may reduce cytokine concentrations and thus lower expression of NADPH oxidase subunits as prerequisites of PMA-induced NADPH oxidase activation <xref rid="pone.0055875-Sakai1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Notably, NADPH oxidase is a membrane bound enzyme complex made up of several subunits and responsible for ROS formation in macrophages <xref rid="pone.0055875-ElBenna1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0055875.s001">File S1</xref> depicts the proposed process in detail. Notably, the observed stress-induced reduction of macrophage microbicidal potential was independent of chronic stress or cognitive stress appraisal (data not shown).</p><p>Some limitations of our study must be reported. First, we activated NADPH oxidase supraphysiologically using the synthetic stimulus PMA leading to increased NADPH oxidase activity in comparison to natural stimuli <xref rid="pone.0055875-Sakai1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055875-Siddiqi1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. We can only speculate as to whether stress reduces physiologically activated NADPH oxidase activity. Second, our mediation analysis is of a statistical nature. Although cross-sectional results clearly indicate mediation by NE, and inhibitory effects of NE on HMDM could be validated in our six in vitro experiments, further experimental studies are needed to verify this finding, particularly in larger sample sizes. Third, we cannot rule out that the FBS used in our WST-1 assay contains hydrocortisone. Thus, the non-significant mediation effect for cortisol on HMDM needs to be interpreted with care. A fourth limitation refers to the existing gender differences between participants of the stress study and the blood donators of the additional experiments (i.e. catheter-control group and <italic>in vitro</italic> subject group). While our main findings are restricted to healthy, medication-free, non-smoking men, the findings of the additional subsequent experiments were conducted in female subjects without applying any exclusion criteria. Notably, all female subjects seemed healthy although we did not verify this. Fifth, the sample sizes of the additional experiments are small. Given this, and given the limited gender selection (i.e. women only) results of the additional subsequently conducted experiments (i.e. catheter-control and <italic>in vitro</italic> data) should be considered as pilot or preliminary data. Further studies are needed to replicate our findings in other (and larger) samples and settings investigating both, men and women.</p><p>Our study does also have various strengths: It is the first human study to investigate stress reactivity of macrophage microbicidal potential after wound application. It combines both <italic>in vivo</italic> wound application and stress induction and <italic>in vitro</italic> measurement of M1 microbicidal potential. In addition to the fact that our study design included a resting stress-control group, a further strength was the standardized and simple wound application paradigm initiating wound healing processes in a natural manner. Furthermore, as monocytes/macrophages represent the dominating leukocyte subpopulation in the wound area for approximately 48 hours after wound application <xref rid="pone.0055875-MahdavianDelavary1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055875-Stroncek1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055875-Engelhardt1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, our 48h-monocyte <italic>in vitro</italic> incubation period was intended to create maximum numbers of monocyte-derived M1 macrophages that possibly resemble <italic>in vivo</italic> macrophage activation processes at wound sites.</p><p>In sum, our findings suggest that microbicidal potential as the precondition for microbicidal activity of human M1 macrophages is inhibited by acute psychological stress. Furthermore, the mechanism by which stress decreases HMDM microbicidal potential may involve NE stress responses. Our findings might have implications for the stress-induced delay in wound healing. A better understanding of the mechanisms how psychological stress delays wound healing may provide important information for developing interdisciplinary intervention strategies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0055875.s001"><label>File S1</label><caption><p>Proposed process to explain stress-induced wound healing attenuation.</p><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0055875.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0055875-Walburn1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
