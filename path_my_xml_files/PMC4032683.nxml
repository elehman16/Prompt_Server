<italic>Introduction.</italic> Spasticity is a disabling symptom resulting from reorganization of spinal reflexes no longer inhibited by supraspinal control. Several studies have demonstrated interest in repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in spastic patients. We conducted a prospective, randomized, double-blind crossover study on five spastic hemiparetic patients to determine whether this type of stimulation of the premotor cortex can provide a clinical benefit. <italic>Material and Methods.</italic> Two stimulation frequencies (1&#x02009;Hz and 10&#x02009;Hz) were tested versus placebo. Patients were assessed clinically, by quantitative analysis of walking and measurement of neuromechanical parameters (<italic>H</italic> and <italic>T</italic> reflexes, musculoarticular stiffness of the ankle). <italic>Results.</italic> No change was observed after placebo and 10&#x02009;Hz protocols. Clinical parameters were not significantly modified after 1&#x02009;Hz stimulation, apart from a tendency towards improved recruitment of antagonist muscles on the F&#x000fc;gl-Meyer scale. Only cadence and recurvatum were significantly modified on quantitative analysis of walking. Neuromechanical parameters were modified with significant decreases in <italic>H</italic>

Introduction</title><p>
Any central nervous system lesion induces major reorganization of partially denervated underlying structures. The definition of spasticity, resulting from reorganization of spinal segmental reflexes, which no longer subjected to supraspinal control, was established by Lance [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and was recently modified by the EU-SPASM consortium: [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] &#x0201c;<italic>Spasticity-disordered sensorimotor control, resulting from an upper motor neuron lesion, presenting as intermittent or sustained involuntary activation of muscles.</italic>&#x0201d; The prevalence of spasticity varies according to the type of brain lesion: more than 90% in cerebral palsy [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], almost 50% after head injury [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], 37 to 78% in multiple sclerosis (MS) [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], and 19 to 35% after stroke [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Spasticity predominantly affects the extensor, postural, and antigravity muscles of the lower limbs [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Spasticity of the foot results in equinus deformity due to overactivity of triceps surae and varus deformity due to overactivity of inversion muscles and weakness of eversion muscles. All these deformities are responsible for unstable gait support, with or without pain, poor clearance of the foot during the swing phase, difficulty wearing shoes, and limitation of walking distance.</p><p>The cerebral cortex exerts a powerful inhibitory effect on muscle tone, mediated via the reticular formation, as the ventromedial medullary reticular formation decreases muscle tone with a facilitating effect of the premotor cortex [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. On the basis of these findings, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) must therefore be targeted to the premotor cortex in order to reinforce suprasegmental inhibition and consequently decrease spasticity.</p><p>Three published trials have demonstrated interesting effects of rTMS on spastic symptoms using various frequencies and various targets, on <italic>H</italic> reflexes in healthy subjects [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], spasticity in MS patients [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and decreased spasticity in combination with neurological recovery [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>We therefore conducted a prospective, randomized, double-blind study of the effects of rTMS on clinical, functional, and neuromechanical parameters in patients with disabling spastic hemiplegia.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2. Material and Methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>2.1. Population</title><p>Five patients (5 men with a mean age of 56 years [46&#x02013;75 years]) with spastic hemiparesis were consecutively included in this study by a multidisciplinary &#x0201c;spasticity&#x0201d; clinic. These 5 patients presented left-sided hemiparesis. Spastic hemiparesis was secondary to stroke in 4 patients (hemorrhagic stroke in 3 cases and ischemic stroke in 1 case) and intracranial tumour surgery (convexity meningioma, right central sulcus) in 1 case.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><title>2.2. Stimulation Protocol and Parameters</title><p>According to a number of animal studies, the premotor cortex is a powerful regulator of contralateral muscle tone [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The premotor cortex, integrating extrapyramidal pathways, is situated, according to the cytoarchitectural studies of Brodmann (Area 6) followed by Vogt (Area 6<italic>&#x003b1;&#x003b2;</italic>), at the intersection of the superior frontal sulcus and the precentral gyrus [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. This area appears to facilitate activation of dorsal reticulospinal pathways located in the ventromedial medullary reticular formation [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and projecting onto the spinal cord via a dorsal reticulospinal tract, which inhibit muscle tone. The objective of this study was therefore to modulate this cortical regulation of spinal reflex activity, the suppression of which, following a supraspinal lesion, constitutes the pathophysiological basis for spasticity.</p><p>Each of the stimulation protocols was targeted to the premotor cortex on the side of the lesion (i.e, the hemisphere contralateral to the side of spastic hemiparesis). According to the literature, the premotor cortex would appear to be the most promising target in this indication [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This zone was identified by neuronavigation based on acquisition of a 3D T1 MRI sequence for each patient. Anatomical correspondence was performed according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Nexstim): use of glasses in which spatial positioning is detected by triangulation by means of an infrared camera, followed by palpation of landmarks on the skull surface by a cursor also localized in space. The error estimated by software was verified (refusal of an error &#x02265;2&#x02009;mm).</p><p>This prospective, randomized, crossover study was conducted under double-blind conditions (blinded person performing stimulation and randomization of the stimulation protocols). Each patient received the 3 stimulation protocols (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), including a placebo protocol, in random order, using a MagProR30 stimulator in compliance with the TMS Safety Consensus Group guidelines [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Each daily stimulation phase lasted 16 minutes and 40 seconds, that is, 1,000 impulses, for five consecutive days. Stimulation weeks were separated by an interval of at least one month and a complete assessment was performed prior to each session (D0). These assessments were repeated 4 days and 21 days (D9 then D31) after the end of stimulation.</p><p>The first protocol consisted of continuous low frequency 1&#x02009;Hz stimulation at 90% of the motor threshold and the second protocol consisted of high frequency 10&#x02009;Hz stimulation at 100% of the motor threshold, composed of twenty 5-second trains separated by 45-second intervals. We chose these two different frequencies according to the literature [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Placebo stimulation was randomized to one of the two frequencies with application of an audio coil, not delivering any magnetic impulses.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><title>2.3. Clinical Assessment</title><sec id="sec2.3.1"><title>2.3.1. Spasticity</title><p>Ankle spasticity, the primary endpoint of the study, was scored by the modified Ashworth scale [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], with the knee flexed and the knee extended, at slow speed then at rapid speed.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3.2"><title>2.3.2. Neurological Assessment</title><p>Residual antagonist muscle activity was evaluated in the supine position by the simple order: &#x0201c;raise your foot.&#x0201d; The percentage amplitude of recruitment of antagonists was evaluated: less than 25%, between 25% and 50%, between 50% and 75%, or between 75% and 100% (score from 1 to 4). Fine touch on the leg and foot and proprioception of the big toe were tested with the patient's eyes closed. Sensory assessment was scored as normal, decreased, or absent. Pain when wearing shoes was assessed by a visual analogue scale (VAS) from 0 to 10, where 0 represented no pain and 10 represented the worst imaginable pain. Finally, the global neurological recovery score was evaluated by the F&#x000fc;gl-Meyer scale [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2.4"><title>2.4. Analysis of Walking</title><p>Quantitative analysis of walking (QAW), performed in the movement analysis laboratory, allows objective and systematic acquisition of spatiotemporal and kinematic parameters [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Acquisition and data processing systems and the positioning of markers on the patient's lower limbs have been previously described by our laboratory [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Photographs of the position of the markers were taken during first application of the markers to decrease the risk of subsequent marker placement errors (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2(a)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2(b)</xref>). A static acquisition was obtained by recognition of the markers using 6 infrared cameras (Vicon MX F 40). Dynamic acquisitions were obtained during spontaneous walking, on a maximum of 10 passages, with bare feet in every case and without assistance whenever possible. Conditions were identical between the various sessions to allow objective comparison of all parameters.</p><sec id="sec2.4.1"><title>2.4.1.

The angle of dorsiflexion at the strike phase, maximum dorsiflexion during the stance phase and at the beginning of the swing phase, and maximum plantar flexion at the end of the swing phase was measured in the sagittal plane of the ankle. The range of ankle motion was also measured.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2.5"><title>2.5. Electromyographic Assessment</title><p>

Assessment of Passive Stiffness of the Ankle</title><p>Passive stiffness of the ankle was evaluated by using an ankle ergometric device designed by the Universit&#x000e9; de Technologie de Compi&#x000e8;gne [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and by applying sinusoidal perturbations with an amplitude of &#x000b1;1.5 on either side of the ankle neutral position to the ankle at rest (90). The frequency of sinusoidal perturbations ranged from 4 to 16&#x02009;Hz with increments of 1&#x02009;Hz. Application of sinusoidal perturbations induced variations of passive torque of the ankle joint, the amplitude and dephasing of which are frequency-dependent. A stiffness constant (Kp, expressed in&#x02009;Nm/rad), reflecting passive musculoarticular stiffness of the ankle, was calculated from Bode diagrams, as described by Lambertz et al. [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec2.7"><title>2.7.

Statistical analyses were performed with JMP 9.0.2 software (SAS Institute INC 2010). A paired<italic> t</italic>-test was used for all comparisons of means. The limit of significance was 0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>3. Results</title><p>The mean interval between the initial accident responsible for spasticity and initiation of the protocol was 79 months [range: 29&#x02013;136 months]. The five patients complied with all aspects of the protocol and the assessments. No serious adverse event was observed. Two patients experienced transient headache that resolved in response to treatment with step I analgesics. One patient reported tiredness related to travelling to and from the hospital for the daily visits during the week of stimulation. No significant difference was observed for any of the parameters studied before each stimulation session, which validates the reproducibility of measurements and return to baseline before each new stimulation protocol.</p><p>No statistically significant change or tendency to change was observed for any of the clinical, neuromechanical, and gait parameters after the placebo and 10&#x02009;Hz stimulation protocols. Significant changes were demonstrated after the 1&#x02009;Hz stimulation protocol. This section will therefore be confined to a detailed description of these changes.</p><sec id="sec3.1"><title>3.1.

Neurological Assessment</title><p>Clinical examination did not reveal any changes in the motor function of the peroneal and triceps surae muscles. In contrast, a tendency towards improved recruitment of antagonist muscles was observed on D9, especially for the maximum percentage angulation of dorsiflexors under active conditions.

One patient reported pain when wearing shoes (VAS: 4) at the baseline assessment. Stimulation suppressed this pain in this patient (VAS: 0 on D9 and D31).</p><p>The mean F&#x000fc;gl-Meyer score was 28 at the baseline assessment and was significantly increased at the D9 assessment (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>,<italic> t</italic>-test, <italic>P</italic> = 0.047) with return to baseline on D31.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3.2"><title>3.2.

Discussion</title><p>This study based on a series of 5 patients is the first randomized, double-blind, crossover study to assess all clinical and complementary parameters of spasticity. The main limitation of this study is the small number of patients, as the main limiting factor for recruitment is the cost of transport of these patients who cannot travel unassisted (the study required a total of 25 trips to and from the hospital for each patient).</p><p>This prospective study did not reveal any modification of spastic symptoms regardless of the stimulation protocol tested, as no variation of the Ashworth score (always evaluated by the same clinician) or presentation of the foot (no variation of the equinovarus deformity after stimulation) was demonstrated. Two studies [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] assessed the clinical parameters of spasticity and their changes after treatment by rTMS. The first study [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] concerned a population of patients with multiple sclerosis complicated by spasticity but did not provide any details concerning the spinal or cerebral site of multiple sclerosis. The stimulation target differed from that adopted in the present study, as these authors performed primary motor cortex stimulation. The duration of stimulation was also longer (2 weeks) than in our protocol. No modification of clinical parameters (the only parameters evaluated in this study) was observed after 1&#x02009;Hz stimulation. However, an average 2-point reduction of the global Ashworth score (corresponding to the sum of modified Ashworth scores evaluated in the ankle, knee, and hip) was demonstrated immediately after and one week after the stimulation protocol. The second study published in the literature [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] simultaneously evaluated neurological recovery and improvement of spasticity in response to a low frequency (1&#x02009;Hz) premotor cortex stimulation protocol in stroke patients. A more marked improvement of spasticity was observed after stimulation of the contralateral side to the spastic hemiparesis, but this study reported few details concerning clinical parameters and used various scores that are not validated in the literature. Overall, rTMS therefore appears to have only a minor effect on spasticity<italic> per se</italic>, regardless of the stimulation parameters and targets tested.</p><p>The 1&#x02009;Hz stimulation protocol of the premotor cortex ipsilateral to the lesion appeared to have a positive effect on antagonist muscle recruitment (significant facilitation of dorsiflexion of the ankle 3 weeks after completion of the stimulation protocol) and on the functional capacities of the lower limb (increased F&#x000fc;gl-Meyer score). These results are supported by the increased range of motion of the ankle demonstrated during quantitative analysis of walking. However, this comparison must be interpreted very cautiously, as it is based on two different types of recruitment: active recruitment tested during clinical examination and reflex recruitment during walking. Moreover, no improvement of gait was demonstrated on quantitative analysis regardless of the type of stimulation. On the contrary, a tendency towards slowing of gait was observed after stimulation, very probably related to &#x0201c;destabilization&#x0201d; of the patient in relation to the changes of two kinematic parameters observed during this study (range of motion of the ankle and decreased recurvatum of the knee). Adaptation of gait to these modifications is obviously a long process and the effect of stimulation was so short-lived that the patient did not have time to modify gait in order to derive a benefit from these improved parameters. This aspect will need to be assessed in longer term studies of repetitive stimulation protocols. An improvement of gait would probably be observed after several repetitions of the same 1&#x02009;Hz rTMS protocol.</p><p>The modifications of neuromechanical parameters of the ankle observed in this study appear to be more promising, as the 1&#x02009;Hz stimulation protocol clearly appeared to reinforce suprasegmental inhibition (greater than 30% reduction of the <italic>H</italic>
<sub>max&#x02061;</sub>/<italic>M</italic>
<sub>max&#x02061;</sub> and <italic>T</italic>/<italic>M</italic>
<sub>max&#x02061;</sub> ratios), while 10&#x02009;Hz and placebo protocols did not induce any modification of these parameters. Similar results were reported in a study conducted on 10 healthy subjects after a 5&#x02009;Hz primary motor cortex stimulation protocol [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, this result is in complete contradiction to the effect reported in the literature in patients with multiple sclerosis [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], as a reduction of this <italic>H</italic>
<sub>max&#x02061;</sub>/<italic>M</italic>
<sub>max&#x02061;</sub> ratio was demonstrated after the 10&#x02009;Hz stimulation protocol, which was not observed in the present study. This previous study also reported a tendency towards an increase of this ratio in healthy subjects after the 1&#x02009;Hz stimulation protocol. Reduction of the <italic>H</italic>
<sub>max&#x02061;</sub>/<italic>M</italic>
<sub>max&#x02061;</sub> ratio in our series is supported by the reduction of the <italic>T</italic>/<italic>M</italic>
<sub>max&#x02061;</sub> ratio, which was more marked at the early assessment, suggesting a complementary action of rTMS on elements of the T reflex loop not involved in the <italic>H</italic> reflex loop (spindle sensitivity, gamma drive, and spindle recruitment by more compliant elastic structures) [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], correlated with the reduction of passive stiffness of the ankle observed in this study. Testing of ankle stiffness comprises a passive component (particularly the length and elasticity of muscle and tendon structures) and an active component (spindle sensitivity, gamma drive, and spindle recruitment). One hypothesis to explain this reduction of passive stiffness would be a reduction of muscle tone and therefore the number of residual cross-bridges, thereby making the muscle more compliant. This effect on the muscle tone would have consequences on both the passive and active components of ankle stiffness. Further investigations must be conducted on these aspects. This effect on ankle stiffness remained stable at the long-term assessment (stability of stiffness and <italic>T</italic>/<italic>M</italic>
<sub>max&#x02061;</sub> ratio), while the effect of rTMS on suprasegmental inhibition was reinforced (more marked reduction of the <italic>H</italic>
<sub>max&#x02061;</sub>/<italic>M</italic>
<sub>max&#x02061;</sub> ratio at the long-term assessment).</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>5. Conclusion</title><p>In summary, the only rTMS protocol with an objective effect in this study was the low frequency (1&#x02009;Hz) protocol targeted to the premotor cortex on the side of the lesion. Only a moderate clinical effect was observed, predominantly on the consequences of spasticity (recruitment of antagonists and recurvatum) but not on spastic symptoms<italic> per se</italic>. The observed effect appeared to be due to reinforcement of suprasegmental inhibition acting on the <italic>H</italic> reflex loop and a reduction of muscle tone, but these mechanisms need to be confirmed. A long-term repetitive stimulation protocol now needs to be proposed to enable the patient to adapt his gait to these changes, which would therefore probably facilitate walking, which remains the primary objective of any therapeutic intervention designed to improve spasticity.</p></sec></body><back><sec><title>Disclosure</title><p>This research received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conflict"><title>Conflict of Interests</title><p>All authors declare they have no conflict of interests in this field.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' Contribution</title><p>Luc Terreaux and K&#x000e9;vin Buffenoir are equally contributed in this work.
