improving respiratory muscle strength and controlling lung inflammation may be important
for improving immune system in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, So the
aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of low level laser therapy and
inspiratory muscle training on interleukin-6 (IL-6) as a marker of inflammation and
CD4+/CD8+ ratio as a marker for T Lymphocytes in these patients. [Subjects and Methods]
Forty male patients with stable COPD participated in the study, their ages ranged between
55&#x02212;65&#x02005;years. They were randomly divided into group (A) who received inspiratory muscle
training and group (B) who received low level laser (LLL) acupuncture stimulation for
about 8 week. [Results] There was a reduction in the concentration of plasma IL-6
associated with an increase in CD4+/CD8+ ratio in both groups, but laser was superior to
inspiratory muscle training. IL-6 and CD4+/CD8+ were negatively correlated. [Conclusion]
Both inspiratory muscle training and low level laser therapy are effective physical
therapy modalities in promoting immune disturbances. The results also supported the
superior role of LLLT over IMT in managing immune disturbances.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Low level laser therapy</kwd><kwd>Inspiratory muscle training</kwd><kwd>Immunity</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major public health problem with a higher
level of incidence. Despite this fact, it had received little attention in the Middle East
to be still under recognized and underdiagnosed. So the patient was represented in an
advanced stage<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The most important risk factors for COPD in this region are tobacco smoke, passive smoking,
shisha (water Pipe), low socioeconomic status associated with indoor pollutant, and out air
pollution<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>COPD is defined as progressive and partially reversible airflow obstruction. It is a
preventable and treatable disease, characterized by small airways disease as a result of
inflammation, excess mucus production and peribronchial fibrosis associated with parenchymal
destruction<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The inspiratory muscles in patients with COPD face a mechanical disadvantage of
hyperinflation with a consequence of disturbed length-tension relationship<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. The end result is a change in the intrinsic
properties of the inspiratory muscles and loss of strength, with the release of lung
inflammatory mediators (cytokines) such as IL-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&#x003b1;), and
C-reactive protein (CRP)<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Patients with COPD hard pulmonary and extra pulmonary systemic inflammation that can be
explained based on multiple theories<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>These mechanisms or theories include cytokines spill over from the lung into systemic
circulation, tobacco smoke with its role in oxidative stress and endothelial
dysfunction<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Another supposed theories
include hypoxia and dynamic hyperinflation, both of them are associated with an increase in
the systemic biomarkers of inflammation<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Aging may also be a contributing factor,
as aging is associated with low-grade systemic inflammation and as the disease progress
slowly so the majority of the patients are elderly<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8+) T-lymphocytes are suppressor cells of the immune system
that induce apoptosis of epithelial and endothelial cells and reflects lung parenchyma
destruction<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. On the other hand,
cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4+) is expressed on the surface of T-helper cells
(T-lymphocytes) Normally there are about 1&#x02013;2 CD4+ cells for every CD8+ cell, so the
CD4+/CD8+ ratio ranges between 0.9 and 1.9<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In COPD, repeated stimulation of T-Lymphocyte as a result of chronic infection and
exacerbation can decrease the number of CD4+ cells, and so the ratio of CD4+/CD8+ is
decreased<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>IL-6 is a glycoprotein and one of the cytokines that was markedly affected by the exercise
duration and intensity. Cytokines such as IL-6 can be upregulated within the lungs of
animals exposed to inspiratory resistive loading, which can then enter the systemic
circulation<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. The reason for this
release may include depletion of glycogen in the diaphragm, and so energy crisis that needs
signals for the liver to increase glucose output<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is still unknown whether the respiratory muscles contribute to
this systemic inflammation.</p><p>On the other hand, low level laser therapy is a non-invasive, has no side effects,
available, and cost-saving physical therapy modality with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory
effects<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. Its anti-inflammatory
effects had been studied by many authors, who examined the cellular signaling responsible
for these effects and concluded that reduction in calcium sensitivity may be responsible for
its anti-inflammatory effect<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. So the purpose
of the present study was to investigate the effect of low level laser therapy on acupuncture
points and inspiratory muscle training on modulating the immune disturbances, such as
chronic inflammation in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, aiming to
manage this problem and reduce its systemic manifestations, hence reducing exacerbation
attacks, hospital admission, and mortality rates for these patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Forty male patients with mild to moderate COPD were recruited for this study from Imbaba
National Institute for Allergy and Chest Diseases, Giza, out-patient clinic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Flow <bold>c</bold>hart for study procedure</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jpts-29-1527-g001"/></fig>). Patients were diagnosed according to American Thoracic Society<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup> standards and all of them had forced expiratory volume in
the first second to be equal to 70&#x02212;50% of the predicted value Their ages ranged between
55&#x02212;65&#x02005;years old and they were medically stable. All of them had a previous history of
smoking; with smoking index &#x0003c;400. Patients were excluded from the study if they were
heavy smoker, FEV was less than 50% of the of the practiced value, a requirement for
supplemental oxygen, chest infection or pulmonary hypertension, cardiac diseases, obesity or
diabetes mellitus as these diseases could affect measurement of immune system and
inflammatory markers, and mental disorders that could affect the understanding and
cooperation of the patient. This study was approved by the National Institute for Allergy
and Chest Diseases Ethics Committee. The study procedure was explained for all patients and
informed consent was obtained from them. The study was complying with the ethical standards
of Declaration of Helsinki. Patients were randomly assigned into two groups; group (A) who
received inspiratory muscle training in addition to their medical treatment and group (B)
who received low level laser therapy on the acupuncture points in addition to the same
medical treatment. Randomization process was performed using closed envelopes. The
investigator prepared 50 closed envelopes with each envelope containing a card labeled with
either the group A or the group B. Finally, each patient was asked to draw a closed envelope
that contains whether he was allocated to the group A or the group B. The patients were
randomly allocated to either a study (n=25) or control (n=25) group. The randomization was
done by a colleague independent and blind to the study using concealed envelopes within
which the group description was randomly placed within them.</p><p>Spirometry was used to select COPD patients with mild to moderate airways obstruction
(FEV1, was in the range of 70&#x02212;50% of the predicted value). It was also used to measure the
maximum inspiratory pressure as an indicator for inspiratory muscle strength, to be used for
adjusting the intensity of inspiratory muscle training program for group (A). Kits and
standard anticoagulant tube (EDTA) of blood samples was used for measuring interleukin 6
(IL-6), flow cytometer to measure CD4+/CD8+ ratio.</p><p>Inspiratory muscle trainer (REF-HS730, Respironic, NJ, USA) was used in group (A) for
applying resisted inspiratory muscle training. Pointer laser (LLL3A, GALAS, He-Ne Laser
Acupuncture) Point laser was applied on acupuncture points for group (B); with the following
parameters, peak power 5 watts wave length 904 nanometer, pulse length 200 nanoseconds.</p><p>Medical history and demographic data of the patients was collected. The severity of smoking
index was calculated according to the number of cigarette/day &#x000d7; number of years of smoking).
Pulmonary function test was conducted to select the eligible patients before entry the
study. In all patients, several practice tests were performed before obtaining the baseline
value to avoid the possible training and learning effects. All the data were collected by
the same investigator who was blinded to the patient assignment and also to the mode of
treatment they received. For spirometry measurement, flow-volume loop measurement (FEV1) was
obtained from sitting position, with a straight posture. Patient was asked to breathe
normally at first until his breathing was rhythmic, then takes complete expiration, followed
by deep, complete inspiration, and then forced rapid expiration. The test was repeated three
times, and the largest FEV1 obtained was recorded.</p><p>Maximal inspiratory pressure was measured using spirometry after calibrating the mouth
pressure of the device, and the patient was instructed to inhale maximally from a residual
volume, through a specialized mouthpiece that had a small air leak to prevent pressure
generation by glottis closure and was connected to pressure transducer. The patient was
asked to maintain the pressure for about one second. The best value of three repeated trials
was recorded as the maximal inspiratory pressure<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Plasma or serum samples were obtained by venipuncture and stored on ice. The collections
were taken between 9 and 12 am, at least 24 hours and not more than 5 days after the last
treatment session.</p><p>IL-6 was measured using sample which centrifuged at 4&#x000b0;C for 10 minutes and then stored at
between &#x02212;75&#x000b0;C and &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C. Concentration of IL-6 was measured by commercially available enzyme
linked immunosorbent assays (ELLIS As).</p><p>The percentage of positive lymphocytes in the blood CD4+ and CD8+ cells were collected from
venous blood. Ten milliliters of venous blood was drawn in an anticoagulant tube (EDTA) for
each patient.</p><p>Treatment procedure was explained for patients in both groups. Group (A) received
inspiratory muscle training program for about 2 months aiming to improve the strength of the
inspiratory muscle. The intensity was adjusted to be about 30% of the maximal inspiratory
pressure measured before entry the treatment program and the resistance was increased by
about 5% each week, till reaching 60% and was maintained at this intensity till the end of
the two months. The inspiratory training program was applied through a pressure threshold
device which had a spring loaded valve, requiring the patient to inspire hard enough to open
the valve and permit inspiration against that force.</p><p>The program was applied for about 30 minutes in the form of sets about 6 sets, and each set
consisted of 5 deep breaths and in between rest for about 1 minute<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>. Also this group received placebo laser therapy while the
device was off. As there is no heating effect and the patient could not detect if the device
was on or off.</p><p>During the training sessions, rating for the perceived dyspnea according to modified Borg
scale was used to assign the dyspnea during training. The intensity of training should be
adjusted according to score 3 for patients in group (A)<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>For group (B) low level laser therapy was applied from comfortable sitting position, on the
following acupuncture points; large interesting 11, kidney meridian 27, large intestine 4,
lung meridian 1, and lung meridian 7. Each point was exposed to LLLT for about 90 seconds
for twice per day, 3 times per week for 2 months. Before application, the target areas were
cleaned with alcohol to minimize any back scatter or reflection. For protection from the
laser&#x02019;s beam, patient and physiotherapist wore protective glasses. This group also received
placebo inspiratory muscle training with a fixed low load about 7 cm H<sub>2</sub>O that was
not changed through-out the study period.</p><p>Subject characteristics compared between both groups using t test. Mixed MANOVA was
conducted to compare the mean values of IL6 and CD4+/CD8+ ratio between the laser and IMT
groups and between pre and post treatment in each group. Pearson Correlation Coefficient was
conducted to determine the correlation between IL6 and CD4+/CD8+ ratio. The level of
significance for all statistical tests was set at p&#x0003c;0.05. All statistical analysis was
conducted through SPSS (statistical package for social sciences, version 19).</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p><xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Comparison of mean age, weight, height and BMI between laser and IMT

with a reduction in CD4+/CD8+ (about 0.47 in LASER group and 0.49 in the IMT group) which

inspiratory muscle training. In patients with COPD, the respiratory muscles did not complain
from reduction in the oxidative capacity, as hypoxia acted as stimulus for endurance
training due to the increased ventilation. So the diaphragm suffers from lack of strength,
rather than endurance<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><sup>)</sup>. The positive
immunomodulator effects of IMT seen in the present study may be the result of (1) Elevation
of the antioxidant enzymes of the diaphragm as reported by, Sigala et al.<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref><sup>)</sup>;
Barreiro et al.<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref><sup>)</sup>, (2) increased glycogen
storage in the diaphragm as IL-6 secretion is increased after glycogen depletion to act as a
stimulus for the liver to increase glucose out-put<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>; (3) stimulation for slowly adapting stretch receptors within the
lung which can affect autonomic nervous system, decreasing sympathetic output<xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Attenuation of chemoreceptors activities within the diaphragm after IMT which aims to
improve strength as a result of repeated exposure to high metabolite during training, may be
another mechanism responsible for positive immunity effect seen in the present study. Witt
et al.<xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref><sup>)</sup> and Romer<xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref><sup>)</sup> had concluded that improved respiratory muscle strength
may eliminate the inhibitory feedback signals that cause recruitment of another accessory
muscles of respiration with a resultant decrease in the work of breathing.</p><p>The results of the present study were supported by Mills et al.<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup> Who examined the effect of cycling exercise at lactate
steady state on IL-6 in healthy males after 6 weeks of IMT with intensity about 50% of
maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP). Their results showed a reduction in IL6 and they
attributed that to reduction in metaboreflex of the respiratory muscles that could increase
blood flow to the liver, facilitating IL-6 uptake and also could increase leg blood flow
with less glycogen utilization. It had been assumed that the strenuous contraction of
respiratory muscles in patients with COPD could activate afferent nerve fibers within the
phrenic nerve. These impulses can travel through hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis with a
resultant secretion of &#x003b2;-endorphin in an attempt to decrease the activation and so tidal
volume is reduced<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The improvement of inspiratory muscle strength after IMT applied in the present study may
eliminate the activity of &#x003b2;-endorphin with a more deep breathing and oxygenation to the
liver and peripheral muscles.</p><p>The reduction in CD4+/CD8+ ratio observed in COPD patients in the present study may be
another aspect of immune system disturbances in these patients as a result of increased
cytotoxic-T cells (CD8+) and reduction of helper-T cells (CD4+)<xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref><sup>)</sup>. Patients with COPD had defect in macrophages phagocytic
action (airway clearance) associated with an increase in its lifespan with a defect in their
elimination or apoptosis. CD8+ is responsible for this apoptosis and should be also
eliminated upon their activation. As a result of autoimmune deficiency in these patients,
the old macrophages and CD8+ accumulate within the lung along with an increase in the
inflammatory cytokines (IL-6) in a trial to eliminate them. The previous findings shed the
light on apoptosis dysregulation<xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref><sup>)</sup></p><p>The reduction in CD4+/CD8+ in IMT group may be a promising feature of the effective
intensity used in this type of training to be efficient to stimulate regulating T-cells
capable of down regulating autoimmunity disturbances<xref rid="r42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref><sup>)</sup>. The results of the present study coincided with that reported by
Davidson et al.<xref rid="r43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref><sup>)</sup>, who concluded that
acute incremental exercise (one shoot) had anti-inflammatory effect in patients with COPD.
Their study revealed an immediate increase in CD8+ after exercise which returned to the
baseline after 2 hours. In the previous study, the patients had a normal baseline value for
CD4+/CD8+ (2.4 + 1.6).</p><p>Another physical therapy modality that is known by approved anti-inflammatory effect; LLLT,
as seen in the results of the present study, it was superior to IMT in achieving better
adaptive (Cellular) immunity response, CD4+/CD8+ ratio was nearly normalized (about 0.95)
after LLT application. The results of the present study were supported by previous animal
studies such as that done by De-Lima et al. <xref rid="r44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref><sup>)</sup>, who examined the effect of LLLT on acute lung inflammation induced
by intestinal ischemic &#x02212;reperfusion in rat model. Infrared laser was applied (660&#x02005;nm), power
out-put of 30 mw, on the skin over the upper trachea. Their results revealed an increase in
the anti-inflammatory mediators (interleukin-10) to counteract the proinflammatory mediators
(tumor necrosis factor, TNF) which was also reduced after laser irradiation.</p><p>De-Silva et al.<xref rid="r45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref><sup>)</sup>, also examined the
effect of LLLT on acute lung inflammation induced by formaldehyde inhalation in rats.
Infrared laser (660&#x02005;nm), with power out of 30 mw was applied at the trachea (3 Points) and
at each lung lobe (3 points for each lung). The previous study concluded the
anti-inflammatory effect of LLLT (increase in the level of IL-10) associated with a
reduction in IL-6 as observed in the present study. The study of De-Silva et al.<xref rid="r45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref><sup>)</sup> shed the light on the possible complex
role of IL-6 in lung diseases associated with chronic inflammation.</p><p>Low level laser therapy might induce a reduction in mucus over production, cytokine release
