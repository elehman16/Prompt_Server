exercise program on the transfer quality and activities of daily living (ADL) in
wheelchair-dependent spinal cord injury patients. [Subjects and Methods] We randomly
divided 22 patients into 2 groups. During the intervention period, one group received
treatment with both conventional physical therapy and a standard sitting pivot transfer
exercise program (experimental group, n=12) and the other group was managed solely with
conventional physical therapy (control group, n=10). The standard transfer exercise
program comprised of an independent and a dependent program. Exercises were conducted 30
minutes daily, 3 times per week, over a period of 6 weeks. All subjects were tested using
a transfer assessment instrument (TAI) and spinal cord independence measure (SCIM) before
and after the intervention. [Results] Compared to the control group, the intervention
group scored higher on both the transfer assessment instrument (TAI Part 1, Part 2, TAI
total score) and spinal cord independence measure tests (SCIM mobility room and toilet
score; SCIM total score). [Conclusion] In conclusion, the standard transfer exercise
program is an effective tool which improves transfer quality and the ability of
wheelchair-dependent spinal cord injury patients to carry out their ADLs.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Spinal cord injury</kwd><kwd>Dependent transfer</kwd><kwd>Motor imagery</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Patients with spinal cord injuries who are wheelchair dependent use the strength and
function of their upper limbs to aid manual wheelchair propulsion and to perform functional
activities such as transferring out of their chair and moving paralyzed areas of the body,
for example, to prevent the development of pressure sores<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Transfer is performed by spinal cord injury patients during their
activities of daily living (ADLs), such as during transfer to and from the bed, car seat and
bath chair. Pivot transfer is the most typical movement method<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>, and should be performed for about 15 to 20 times a day<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Transfer is an essential element of the spinal cord injury patient&#x02019;s life, and when these
patients cannot perform transfer, or when they find it increasingly difficult to transfer
due to pain and damage to the musculoskeletal system, their functional activity
decreases<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>There has been a lot of interest in the transfer technique and its ability to optimize
functional activity for patients with disabilities and minimal residual function.</p><p>Malouin &#x00026; Richards<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup> have focused on
investigating the role of motor image training as a method to optimize motor function. The
validity of motor imagery has been proven in numerous studies which have investigated this
technique and its neurophysiological basis in patients with spinal cord injuries<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Grangeon et al.<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup> showed that motor image training and general
rehabilitation training in cervical injury patients improved their score in the performance
of hand function tasks and also shortened performance time, thus demonstrating that motor
image treatment and general rehabilitation treatment are effective when conducted together.
However, because study of Grangeon et al.<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup> has been conducted case study of cervical patients, it is a
difficult to generalize.</p><p>Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of a standardized
transfer exercise program based on motor learning and motor image training on the ability of
patients with randomized spinal cord injuries to transfer and to perform their ADLs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Study participants were recruited from rehabilitation centers through bulletin board
notices posted at local hospitals. Twenty-two patients with spinal cord injuries were
recruited from R. Hospital in Gyeonggi-do. All patients provided written informed consent.

University.</p><p>All selected patients had spinal cord injuries, but specific criteria included 1) patients
whose neurological function had plateaued over eight months from the start of the study<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>; 2) patients who were moving for &#x0003e;4
hours mainly using a manual wheelchair<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>;
3) patients who had been using a manual wheelchair for more than six months; 4) patients who
were performing dependent pivot transfer; 5) patients who could receive training for more
than 30 minutes; 6) patients whose muscle tension in all four limbs was below stage 3 of the
Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS)<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>; and 7)
patients who had not participated in a study similar to our own within the past year.</p><p>Exclusion criteria included 1) progressive spinal cord injuries (ie, myelitis); 2)
comorbidities; 3) secondary damage (ie, bedsores); 4) inability to stand up without a
support; 5) inability to receive training due to pain; 6) limited visual or auditory

transfer, two groups were generated using the pseudo-random allocation method, and included
12 members in the experimental group and 10 members in the control group. The experiment was
conducted for six weeks, and patients were orientated to the test method and the training
method before the start of the study.</p><p>The experimental group and the control group conducted pre-checks related to transfer and
ADL performance prior to the start of the experiment. Both groups received general physical
therapy for six weeks (five 60-minute sessions per week), while the experimental group also
followed a standardized transfer exercise program (three 30-minute sessions per week). Post
tests were conducted for both groups after six weeks.</p><p>One week before the experiments and analyses, patients were educated about the training and
measurement method during a session which lasted for one hour and occurred twice weekly.</p><p>The standardized transfer exercise program<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup> is based on a clinical practice guideline (CPG) which describes a
protocol that should be followed in order to preserve upper limb function for the therapist
and wheelchair user. Therapist has provided transfer training for intervention group. The
image training used in this study was based on this CPG (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>The standardized transfer exercise program process included image training for 1&#x02013;2 weeks
which was based on the motor learning method theory. In order to facilitate learning,
participants were placed in a quiet environment without interruptions. Prior to image
training, they were encouraged to sit in their wheelchair and assume the most comfortable
posture to relax their bodies and minds. At the same time, they were presented with a
20-minute educational video which described the standardized biomechanical transfer posture
related to upper limb damage, as well as the transfer technique, including information on
the transfer working direction, joint angle, and move order. For the image education,
training was repeated for ten minutes<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>From weeks 2&#x02013;4, a standardized transfer exercise program was conducted together with image
training, and repeated 4 or 6 times, respectively. Patients underwent a 10-minute
preparatory exercise, aviation exercise and wind-up exercise. If patients experienced any
difficulties in learning and acquiring a specific technique, the transfer parts were
visualized and the exercises were repeated and compensation strategies were presented. To
facilitate learning, difficult parts were exercised first, then whole movements were
connected, and feedback was provided based on motor learning theory<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>As for the difficulty level of transfer practice, the height of the arrival point was
adjusted, and based on studies of the real environment<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. In order to adjust the level of difficulty, the environment was
rearranged to include a mat, an undulating table, and a bench, and uneven transfer was
performed according to the performance conditions with the points of arrival at 40&#x02005;cm
(bathroom height), 50&#x02005;cm (mat height) and 60&#x02005;cm (car height). If necessary, a push bar was
used<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. No slide boards were used due to limited hand function and the
possibility of causing pain<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>From weeks 5&#x02013;6, real transfer practice was conducted in conjunction with the standardized
transfer exercise program (4 times) and image training (6 times). Patients performed 10
minutes of preparatory exercises, aviation exercises and wind-up exercises. The patients
were recorded as they attempted to perform these exercises, and individual feedback based on
motor learning theory was provided regarding how well the motions were performed<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>During the arbitration period, if any subjects complained of dizziness, low blood pressure,
or pain, they were allowed to rest until the symptoms disappeared.</p><p>General physical therapy was performed at R. Hospital using the principles of spinal cord
injury treatment in both the experimental group and control group. Therapy was guided by
physical therapists with clinical experience of 2 to 7&#x02005;years, and occurred for 60 minutes 5
times a week, over a six-week period<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>.
In order to examine transfer in this study, a Transfer Assessment Instrument (TAI) was
used.</p><p>The TAI was developed by McClure et al.<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup> and is an instrument which is used to assess the quality and
quantity of transfer performance in wheelchair users. All patients are capable of receiving
10 points regardless of their injury level or amount of assistance required during transfer.
The TAI is not biased based on subjects&#x02019; age, disability type, gender, weight, muscle,
balance, shoulder pain, period of wheelchair use or the number of times of transfer. In
addition, the TAI does not require any expensive or highly technical equipment, and is an
economical instrument which can easily and quickly be used in the clinic<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. The score ranges of intra-rater
reliability for TAI Part 1, Part 2 and Total 3 were r=0.81 to 0.85, and the score ranges of
inter-rater reliability for TAI Part 1, Part 2 and Total 3 were r=0.74 to 0.88, which shows
that the score has high reliability<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The TAI consists of two parts and three scores. Part 1 consists of 15 items, which are
indicated by &#x02018;Yes&#x02019;, &#x02018;No&#x02019; and &#x02018;N/A&#x02019;. The score ranges from 0 to 10, and is calculated by
adding up the score of each transfer performed, multiplying by 10 and dividing by the number
of items applied. Part 2 consists of 12 items ranked on a Likert scale from &#x02018;Strongly
disagree&#x02019; (0) to &#x02018;Strongly agree&#x02019; (4). The score ranges from 0 to 10 and is calculated by
adding up the score of each transfer performed, multiplying by 2.5 and dividing by the
number of items applied. The Total 3 score is calculated as the mean score of Parts 1 and
2<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In this study, the spinal cord independence measure (SCIM) was used in order to examine
patients&#x02019; ADLs.</p><p>SCIM is an instrument to assess spinal cord injury patients&#x02019; daily life, and was developed
by Catz et al<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. This instrument consists
of three domains (self-activity, 20 points; breathing and sphincter control, 40 points; and
movement, 40 points), and the total score is 100 points. the spinal cord independence
measure (SCIM) is able to sensitively reflect changes in the spinal cord injury patients&#x02019;

between 83&#x02013;96% on the items of room and bathroom<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. The internal consistency Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha was 0.847 to 0.849, and
the reliability between the testers was r=0.745&#x02013;0.962<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. The concurrent validity was r=0.779 to 0.790<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup> while the concurrent validity of the Korean SCIM was
r=0.972 to 0.975, which showed a high correlation<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS ver. 21.0. Data are
presented as mean and standard deviation. The response sample t test was conducted in order
to examine changes before and after each motor image. The independent samples t-test was
conducted in order to examine the difference between groups. P values &#x02264;0.05 were considered

experimental group compared to the control group. Rice et al.<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup> conducted standardized transfer training based on the results of
the existing transfer and assessed transfer at different times after discharge from hospital
(six weeks, six months and one year). They found that there were no significant differences
between groups among patients who performed independent transfers. However, in the assisted
transfer group, patients who received the intervention performed higher quality transfers
one year later compared to patients in the control group, which is in keeping with the
results of this study. There were some limitations in the design of the study described, as
patients were provided with at-home educational materials and assessed after discharge, thus
making it difficult to control for environmental exposure. This limitation was avoided in
our study as patients followed specific training times under the supervision of qualified
physical therapists.</p><p>Compared to the control group, the dependent transfer experimental group showed significant
improvements in a number of areas including 1) the room and bathroom items; 2) respiratory
muscle and sphincter control; 3) motions for the prevention of bedsores; 4) transfer ability
to the car seat, toilet and bath; and 5) wheelchair movement on the bed. All of these
changes contributed to an improvement in functional independence. One limitation of this
study is that the assistant&#x02019;s help ranged widely between 1% and 100%. However, we believe
that the differences observed between the two groups in this study are still meaningful,
because the SCIM takes into account whether or not patients are aided by an assistant. For
patients who require only a little assistance, There are three very important factor in
transfer technique. They are moment, muscle compensation, and head &#x00026; hip joint
relationship along with the level of neurologic damage<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. The standardized transfer exercise program increased the
understanding of biomechanical mechanisms, wheelchair preparing techniques and proficiency
in learning compensation movements.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Nyland</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Quigley</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Preserving transfer independence among individuals with
