Since the People's Republic of China was established in 1949, the Chinese government has given high priority to the control of schistosomiasis, establishing a number of special bodies to manage control activities from the national to the township level <xref rid="pntd.0002122-Mao1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0002122-McManus1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.

A further report in 2004 indicated that disease transmission had been interrupted or controlled in 42% of provinces, 40% of counties, and 53% of towns, previously endemic for schistosomiasis <xref rid="pntd.0002122-Zhou5" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p><p>However, prospects for the control of schistosomiasis have been less optimistic in recent years, particularly since the termination of the World Bank Loan Project (WBLP) for schistosomiasis control at the end of 2001 <xref rid="pntd.0002122-Zhou4" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Compared with the second national survey of <italic>S. japonicum</italic> in China in 1995, the third national survey conducted in 2004 showed that the prevalence of <italic>S. japonicum</italic> infection in humans had not substantially changed in the lake and marshlands and other areas of Southern China <xref rid="pntd.0002122-Zhou4" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.

Firstly, 63 kilometres of fencing were installed to prevent animals from grazing in areas where <italic>Oncomelania</italic> snails were present. Warning signs were placed along the fenced areas, with the help of the local government authorities, and professional management staff were employed to ensure the intervention was effective.</p><p>Secondly, 7 safe grazing pasture areas were established totaling 190 hectares (1,900,000 m<sup>2</sup>). Each area was 20&#x02013;30 hectares and was designed to contain about 1,100 animals. The pastures were carefully selected with no or very few snails, which, if present, were quickly eliminated by mollusciciding. Specialized managers were employed to manage each of the grazing areas and ponds were established to enable the bovines to drink uncontaminated water.</p><p>Fences comprised cement columns and barbed wire which ensured long-term usage. Each cement column was 160 centimeters (cm) in height and shaped as a triangular prism with 15 cm edges. Each column had three holes through which the barbed wire was fixed, and the distance between each was 2 meters.</p></sec><sec id="s2c2"><title>Improving health and health care facilities</title><p>To reduce the potential of humans as a source of infection for snails, measures were undertaken (May to July, 2009) to improve the health and well-being of villagers and the existing health care facilities.

To deal with humans feces, 1,545 home lavatories were constructed or repaired with three-cell septic tanks and 618 households were provided with marsh-gas pool latrines. Furthermore, all fishermen were provided with fecal-matter containers to prevent them from excreting feces directly into river or lake freshwater.</p></sec><sec id="s2c3"><title>Strengthening specialized schistosomiasis clinics</title><p>In order to implement the interventions in the intervention villages, specialized schistosomiasis clinics were strengthened at the village level (March to May, 2009).

Therefore, schistosomiasis control in these regions was especially important.</p><p>Because of high rates of <italic>S. japonicum</italic> reinfection in both humans and bovines in marshland and lake regions <xref rid="pntd.0002122-Guo1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0002122-Engels1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0002122-Balen1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, it was very difficult to reduce the rate of <italic>S. japonicum</italic> infection in humans to a relatively low level (such as less than 1%). The study of Wang et al. showed that a comprehensive control strategy, which was based on interventions to reduce the transmission of <italic>S. japonicum</italic> infection from cattle and humans to snails, can solve this problem <xref rid="pntd.0002122-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. However, the authors mentioned that their study included only a small number of villages and the villages were not selected in a random manner. So they were not sure whether the strategy was still highly effective in other endemic areas. A similar study was implemented in Jiangsu Province of China, but this study did not have parallel control groups <xref rid="pntd.0002122-Sun1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. In our study, we applied a similar strategy but strived to avoid these limitations. We adopted a random manner to select 12 villages in Gong'an County, Hubei Province and randomly assigned them to intervention or control groups.</p><p>Our study proved that the new comprehensive strategy to control transmission of <italic>S. japonicum</italic> was highly effective in the study areas. Firstly, the prevalence of schistosomiasis in humans declined to a relatively low level after implementing the new interventions. Compared with 2008, the rate of infection in humans in the intervention villages decreased from 3.41% in 2008 to 0.81% in 2011. The generalized linear model showed that a higher infection risk for humans in the control villages than in the intervention villages (OR&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1.250, P&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.001). Secondly, comparing with 2008, the rate of infection in bovines, snails and cow dung in the intervention group decreased from 3.3% to none, 11 of 6,219 to none, and 3.9% to none in 2011, respectively. Thirdly, during the peak transmission period, after the implementation of the new control strategy, the rate of infection in sentinel mice decreased from 31.7% in 2008 to 1.7% in 2011. It should be noted that the randomized, controlled design pertains only to the human, bovine, and snail data while the environmental cow dung and infectious water data were only collected in the intervention villages.</p><p>Bovines are the main infection source of <italic>S. japonicum</italic> in the marshlands and lakes in China, and are responsible for an estimated 75%&#x02013;90% of the egg contamination <xref rid="pntd.0002122-Gray1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0002122-Guo1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Therefore, it was very important to reduce the role of bovines as an infection source. Recently, the main measures included providing farmers machines instead of bovines and prohibiting bovines in these regions. These measures were effective <xref rid="pntd.0002122-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. However, if these measures were used in some rural areas of Hubei Province, there would be some challenges. Firstly, the machines are not suitable due to the limitation of landform or farmers' knowledge. Secondly, the bovines can bring additional economic benefits for villagers, so the villagers were reluctant to give up cattle rearing.</p><p>For these reasons, in our study we adopted new interventions for bovines which included building safe pastures for grazing and preventing bovines from grazing on snail habitat beach areas. Our study proved that these measures were effective. Moreover, these measures were sustainable because the cost of fences and pastures was a one-time expense because the material is durable. We used a triangular cement fence post, which requires less cement than a square shape.</p><p>Our study showed that there was no statistically significant decline in the <italic>S. japonicum</italic> infection prevalence in humans, bovines and snails from 2008 to 2011 in the control villages. Past studies showed that the effect of chemotherapy with praziquantel for humans and cattle was limited in controlling schistosomiasis in lake and marshland regions <xref rid="pntd.0002122-Xianyi1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0002122-Wang2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, because it does not prevent reinfection <xref rid="pntd.0002122-Engels1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0002122-Sun1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. In contrast, the integrated control strategy can reduce the transmission of <italic>S. japonicum</italic> infection from humans and cattle to snails, reducing contaminated water as a source of infection in humans <xref rid="pntd.0002122-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. However, this difference is of little practical consequence unless the integrated interventions lead to more sustainable control and a reduction of the basic reproductive number (R<sub>0</sub>). If R<sub>0</sub> can be kept less than 1 over a length of time, the disease could be gradually eliminated <xref rid="pntd.0002122-Ma1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. This is probably the most important potential outcome of the intervention. However, a longer term follow-up study is needed to test this potential outcome. Taken together, we considered that the new interventions, especially the interventions for bovines and humans, were the most important components of the integrated control strategy.</p><p>A potential limitation of the study was that we did not investigate the status of <italic>S. japonicum</italic> infection in people who quit the study. Thus, we could not compare the difference of these people's infection between intervention and control groups.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Conclusions</title><p>An integrated control strategy, aiming to weaken the roles of bovines and humans as sources of <italic>S. japonicum</italic> infection, was effective in controlling the transmission of <italic>S. japonicum</italic> in marshland regions of China.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0002122.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>CONSORT Checklist.</p><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0002122.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0002122.s002"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><p>Trial protocol (Chinese language file).</p><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0002122.s002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are very grateful to all staff at the Gong'an County Institute for Schistosomiasis Control and the villagers who participated in this study.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pntd.0002122-Chitsulo1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
