One such medication is the partial NMDA agonist d-cycloserine. It has been suggested that d-cycloserine enhances cognitive behaviour therapy by making learning faster. While animal studies have supported this view of the drug accelerating learning, evidence in human studies has been mixed. We therefore designed an experiment to measure the effects of d-cycloserine on human motor learning.</p></sec><sec id="section2-0269881116658988"><title>Methods:</title><p>Fifty-four healthy human volunteers were randomly assigned to a single dose of 250mg d-cycloserine versus placebo in a double-blind design. They then performed a motor sequence learning task.</p></sec><sec id="section3-0269881116658988"><title>Results:</title><p>D-cycloserine did not increase the speed of motor learning or the overall amount learnt. However, we noted that participants on d-cycloserine tended to respond more carefully (shifting towards slower, but more correct responses).</p></sec><sec id="section4-0269881116658988"><title>Conclusion:</title><p>The results suggest that d-cycloserine does not exert beneficial effects on psychological treatments via mechanisms involved in motor learning.

Participants fasted for 2h before the testing visit to prevent nutrition dependent influences on drug intake. Testing took place from 10:00 h onwards. Participants were tested on a motor sequence learning task 3h after drug administration. According to product information (King&#x02019;s Pharmaceutical), plasma peak levels are reached within 3&#x02013;4h; other studies (<xref rid="bibr21-0269881116658988" ref-type="bibr">Patel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bibr32-0269881116658988" ref-type="bibr">van Berckel et al., 1997</xref>, <xref rid="bibr31-0269881116658988" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>) found that peak levels are reached within 1 h.

Consolidation effects were measured at 2h and 24h after the initial motor learning.</p></sec><sec id="section9-0269881116658988"><title>Motor task description</title><p>Participants performed a visually cued reaction time task, as previously described in <xref rid="bibr27-0269881116658988" ref-type="bibr">Stagg et al. (2011)</xref>, responding as quickly and as accurately as possible to a star symbol (cue) appearing in fast succession in one of four possible side-by-side positions (positions 1, 2, 3 and 4) on the screen (Figure S1 in the Supplementary Material online). With the four fingers of their right hand, participants used four buttons of a standard computer keyboard to react in accordance with a star&#x02019;s position on the screen. In each of 15 sequence learning blocks, three repeats of a fixed 10-digit sequence were presented. In the sequence, there were no directly adjacent repeats of the four positions, that is, participants were not cued to press the same button more than once successively. The cues were presented at a rate of one cue every 1.03s. The presentation of the cues was not dependent on participants&#x02019; responses, the sequence continued independent of whether participants pressed the correct button, a wrong button or no button. Participants were instructed to respond as quickly and accurately as possible. For practice, participants initially performed a 30-trial &#x02018;training block&#x02019; consisting of visual cue positions in random order. As a manipulation check, another 30-trial &#x02018;random block&#x02019; was presented after 13 sequence learning blocks, to confirm that improvements in reaction time throughout the series of 15 sequence blocks occurred due to learning a specific sequence rather than generic motor skill improvement. For clarity, throughout the paper blocks are labelled from 1 to 17 with blocks 1 and 15 being the random sequence blocks.</p><p>Previous research (<xref rid="bibr16-0269881116658988" ref-type="bibr">Kuriyama et al., 2011</xref>) has suggested that effects of DCS on motor learning might only be seen after a consolidation phase. We therefore additionally tested participants on a brief version of the motor task, including three sequence blocks, two and 24 hours after the main motor task.</p></sec><sec id="section10-0269881116658988"><title>Data analysis</title><p>All analyses were performed in Matlab and SPSS.

Errors consisted of omitted responses, as well as pressing of an incorrect button. Reaction times for error trials were discarded. As participants started to develop anticipatory responses with learning (Figure S2B and Supplementary Results online), we included reaction times of up to 300ms before the onset of the cue on the screen (negative reaction times) in the analysis. To ensure that these early reaction times were really responses to the subsequent cue and not late responses to the previous one, we only included them as responses to the subsequent cue if the response was the correct button with respect to the subsequent cue (a control analysis revealed that in this early time window 92% of responses were correct with respect to the subsequent cue). We transformed reaction times by the natural logarithm. As log transformation is only possible on positive values, we added a fixed 300ms to each reaction time value (i.e. the earliest anticipatory responses were coded as at time &#x0003e; 0ms).</p></sec><sec id="section12-0269881116658988"><title>Assessing learning</title><p>In line with previous research (<xref rid="bibr27-0269881116658988" ref-type="bibr">Stagg et al., 2011</xref>) learning in this task was measured as an improvement in reaction time across the task. To assess most generally whether learning occurred, we performed an ANOVA for reaction time over all learning blocks (i.e. blocks 2 to 14 and 16 to 17) including group (two levels) and block (15 levels) as factors.</p></sec><sec id="section13-0269881116658988"><title>Balancing how fast and correctly to respond</title><p>Previous studies suggested that NMDA receptors not only play a role in learning, but are also involved in other functions, such as decision-making. In the present task, participants did not have to make any decisions per se, such as choosing between different options. Nevertheless, as they had been instructed to respond &#x02018;as fast and accurately as possible&#x02019;, they had to decide how to strike a balance between these two constraints (we note that over all blocks, reaction time and accuracy correlated positively (<italic>r</italic><sub>&#x003c4;</sub> = 0.20, <italic>p</italic>=0.032), supporting the idea of a trade-off). For example they could respond faster by pressing a key before the appearance of the visual cue, based on their learnt expectation of the next target in the 10-digit sequence. Or instead they could maximize their accuracy by only responding after the visual cue appeared on the screen. In an exploratory analysis, we wanted to examine whether DCS affected how this balance was set. As a simple measure of this balance, we multiplied the log-transformed (and range normalized, range set to between 1 and 10) reaction times (for each block) by the (range normalized) accuracy (for each block), called here &#x02018;Balance score&#x02019;. High values then indicated that participants responded correctly and slowly while low values indicated less accurate but faster responding. We compared how the groups differed throughout learning using ANOVA and <italic>t</italic>-tests.</p></sec><sec id="section14-0269881116658988"><title>Assessing consolidation</title><p>Additional data was collected on a shorter three-block version of the same sequence task at 2h and 24h after the initial learning to assess effects of DCS on motor learning consolidation. As DCS has a long half-life and we used a high dose of DCS compared with previous studies, we expected participants to still have relatively high DCS levels after the end of testing, which could improve consolidation. Reaction time and Balance score group differences were again assessed using ANOVAs.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="section15-0269881116658988"><title>Results</title><p>DCS did not affect participants&#x02019; mood or arousal (Table S2 online).</p><sec id="section16-0269881116658988"><title>Initial learning performance</title><p>We assessed whether DCS could enhance motor learning.

Similarly, DCS did not affect either just the early speed of learning or the total amount of learning (see Supplementary Methods and Results and Figure S2 online).

We hypothesized that at least for the 2h consolidation, the groups should still differ because of DCS&#x02019;s long half-life of 8&#x02013;15h, which would mean that DCS levels should still be high during this first consolidation phase. We found marginal evidence for this: in the consolidation test after 2h, the DCS group showed a trend for higher Balance score (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0269881116658988">Figure 1(b)</xref> &#x02018;Consolidation (2h)/(24h)&#x02019;, ANOVA, main effect of group: <italic>F</italic>(1,52)=3.4, <italic>p</italic>=0.071).

In the task, participants had to learn to tap out a simple motor sequence, following visual cues on a computer screen. While participants showed improvements in reaction times with learning, this was not affected by DCS. There was also no drug effect on the consolidation of motor learning after 2h or after 24h. This result is in agreement with several other studies that have failed to find DCS (at doses of 100mg, 175mg or 250mg) to enhance motor learning (<xref rid="bibr5-0269881116658988" ref-type="bibr">Cherry et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bibr6-0269881116658988" ref-type="bibr">Feld et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bibr15-0269881116658988" ref-type="bibr">Kuo et al., 2008</xref>). However, we note that <xref rid="bibr16-0269881116658988" ref-type="bibr">Kuriyama et al. (2011)</xref> found that 100mg of DCS could enhance motor sequence performance after consolidation learning. These discrepancies could be due to the specifics of the task or difference in drug dose or timing of DCS administration (Kuriyama et al. administered DCS 1.5h before the task). Effects of DCS are strongly dose-dependent (<xref rid="bibr33-0269881116658988" ref-type="bibr">Walker et al., 2002</xref>) and discrepancies between human and animal studies might be due to the fact that human studies tended to use a lower dose (about three times smaller than those used in animal studies). Lastly, it is also possible that the true effects of DCS on motor sequence learning have a small effect size and therefore only reach significance in some studies with the level of statistical power commonly employed.</p></sec><sec id="section21-0269881116658988"><title>DCS may shift the balance between responding quickly and accurately</title><p>It has been suggested that DCS could influence decision-making or integration of evidence for decision-making, based on neural network simulation studies (<xref rid="bibr28-0269881116658988" ref-type="bibr">Standage and Pare, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bibr29-0269881116658988" ref-type="bibr">Standage et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bibr34-0269881116658988" ref-type="bibr">Wang, 2002</xref>) and empirical work implicating NMDA receptors in this process (<xref rid="bibr7-0269881116658988" ref-type="bibr">Floresco et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bibr17-0269881116658988" ref-type="bibr">Meuwese et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bibr24-0269881116658988" ref-type="bibr">Scholl et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bibr25-0269881116658988" ref-type="bibr">Self et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bibr26-0269881116658988" ref-type="bibr">Shen et al., 2010</xref>). We therefore performed an exploratory analysis of whether DCS shifted the balance of how quickly and how accurately participants responded. We found that DCS shifted participants&#x02019; response towards more careful, namely slower but more correct, responding. However, the effect was not strong, only reaching significance in the late phase of the initial learning, possibly due to low task sensitivity. Our measure of &#x02018;balance in responding&#x02019; might be related to the speed/accuracy trade-off that has been measured in decision-making tasks (<xref rid="bibr3-0269881116658988" ref-type="bibr">Britten et al., 1992</xref>) and that has been proposed to be implemented by changes to NMDA receptor conductance (<xref rid="bibr29-0269881116658988" ref-type="bibr">Standage et al., 2013</xref>). We do stress, however, that our main objective was to test learning effects of DCS, and the motor learning task we used was not a specifically designed task to measure a speed/accuracy trade-off. Our study can therefore be seen as a first hint that DCS may affect the speed/accuracy trade-off, but future studies, using specifically designed tasks (e.g. <xref rid="bibr1-0269881116658988" ref-type="bibr">Bogacz et al., 2010</xref>), will be needed to clarify this and to see whether this effect of DCS may be related to its clinical properties. For example, DCS could help patients with anxiety disorders, who might tend to decide too quickly that stimuli are threatening, to first reflect on them and then decide more accurately.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="section22-0269881116658988"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We found that a single dose of 250mg of DCS did not affect motor sequence learning or consolidation in humans.
