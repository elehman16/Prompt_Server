To prevent such harms, governments have introduced liquor licensing laws to control the supply and consumption of alcohol in a variety of community settings [<xref rid="dar12330-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref>, <xref rid="dar12330-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref>].

While private venues are the most commonly reported setting for consuming alcohol <xref rid="dar12330-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">[4]</xref>, the amount of harm associated with consumption in licensed venues (e.g. bars, pubs, nightclubs) is disproportionately greater [<xref rid="dar12330-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref>, <xref rid="dar12330-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref>, <xref rid="dar12330-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref>, <xref rid="dar12330-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref>, <xref rid="dar12330-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref>, <xref rid="dar12330-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref>], despite them operating under liquor licensing regulations to minimise the risk of harm <xref rid="dar12330-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">[10]</xref>. It has been suggested that limited compliance by licensed premises with liquor licensing laws, particularly those relating to the &#x02018;over serving&#x02019; of alcohol to intoxication, contributes to this disproportionate association [<xref rid="dar12330-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref>, <xref rid="dar12330-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref>, <xref rid="dar12330-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref>]. One possible explanation for the limited compliance is less than optimal policing of liquor licensing laws. In Australia for example, just 3% of breaches of liquor licensing laws have been reported to involve breaches by licensed premises, with the remaining 97% involving breaches by consumers <xref rid="dar12330-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">[5]</xref>.</p><p>A number of factors have been reported to impede policing of liquor licensing laws, including a lack of skills and training <xref rid="dar12330-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">[9]</xref> and limited availability of relevant intelligence information [<xref rid="dar12330-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref>, <xref rid="dar12330-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref>]. Various approaches to policing, such as intelligence&#x02010;led and problem orientated policing [<xref rid="dar12330-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref>, <xref rid="dar12330-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref>, <xref rid="dar12330-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref>, <xref rid="dar12330-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">19</xref>], have been suggested to address such barriers and have demonstrated effectiveness in reducing crimes, such as homicide and violence, antisocial behaviour, car theft and drug dealing [<xref rid="dar12330-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref>, <xref rid="dar12330-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">20</xref>, <xref rid="dar12330-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">21</xref>, <xref rid="dar12330-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">22</xref>, <xref rid="dar12330-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">23</xref>]. These approaches generally involve the systematic collection of information regarding the characteristics of incidents, the use of such information to identify high&#x02010;risk locations, offenders and types of crime, and the subsequent selection and targeting of policing responses <xref rid="dar12330-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">[2]</xref>.</p><p>Despite the centrality of information systems to enhancing police capacity to respond to crime <xref rid="dar12330-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">[16]</xref>, analysis of police information systems in the USA <xref rid="dar12330-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">[24]</xref>, UK <xref rid="dar12330-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">[25]</xref> and Australia <xref rid="dar12330-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">[26]</xref> suggest that such systems do not facilitate the recording and analysis of information regarding what constitutes an &#x02018;alcohol&#x02010;related incident&#x02019;, the intoxication status of persons involved in incidents and the setting of alcohol consumption preceding an incident [<xref rid="dar12330-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">27</xref>, <xref rid="dar12330-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">28</xref>, <xref rid="dar12330-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">29</xref>].

Although police recording of such information has been demonstrated to be feasible for drink driving incidents <xref rid="dar12330-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">[32]</xref>, only one study has reported the feasibility of recording such information for a broader range of alcohol&#x02010;related incident types <xref rid="dar12330-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">[29]</xref>. The study team has previously reported that, following a 12&#x02010;month organisational change intervention in a single police region in Australia, between 87% and 100% of incidents had such information recorded <xref rid="dar12330-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">[33]</xref>.</p><p>As no studies have reported the ability to increase police recording of information regarding the alcohol&#x02010;related characteristics of attended incidents over an extended period of time and across diverse geographic areas, a study was undertaken to: (i) determine the effectiveness of an intervention to facilitate police recording of the alcohol consumption characteristics of people involved in assault incidents; and (ii) describe such characteristics by geographic area and setting of alcohol consumption.</p></sec><sec id="dar12330-sec-0006"><title>Methods</title><sec id="dar12330-sec-0007"><title>Study design and setting</title><p>A stepped wedge pragmatic trial was conducted across the state of New South Wales (NSW), Australia (population 6.7 million) <xref rid="dar12330-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">[34]</xref>.

Second, if a person involved in an incident was recorded as having consumed alcohol prior to its occurrence, the incident was automatically &#x02018;flagged&#x02019; as &#x02018;alcohol&#x02010;related&#x02019;. Third, to facilitate the ready analysis of recorded information, the database was modified to produce automated data reports.</p><p>Modifications to the database were implemented sequentially at the commencement of the intervention in each of the three study areas and were retained as routine practice following completion of the study. In area 1, the modifications were introduced in April 2002, in area 2 in June 2003 and in area 3 in September 2004.

For the three areas respectively, 8%, 12% and 13% of licensed premises had 12 or more such people associated with the premises in this period. Of the licensed premises linked to at least one assault incident involving an intoxicated person, 20% of premises were recorded to be associated with 61.5%, 62.4% and 61.3% of such incidents for the three areas respectively.</p></sec></sec><sec id="dar12330-sec-0031"><title>Discussion</title><p>Following implementation of the intervention, alcohol consumption information was recorded by police for 85&#x02013;100% of people involved in assault incidents. This level of recording was achieved across all four information items, in all three areas and sustained for up to 45 months. The mean proportion of assault incidents classified as alcohol related was significantly greater in regional/rural areas (50&#x02013;47%) than in metropolitan areas (38%). More people in metropolitan areas (54%) were reported to consume alcohol on licensed premises prior to an assault than people in regional/rural areas (39&#x02013;42%). Twenty per cent of premises accounted for approximately 60% of all assaults linked to licensed premises, with single licensed premises associated with up to 108 assaults in 1 year. Approximately 70% of persons involved in such incidents were reported as being intoxicated regardless of where they last consumed alcohol, including in licensed premises. These observed differences in the occurrence of assaults between geographic areas, and between and within settings of alcohol consumption demonstrate the potential of the newly acquired information to inform the targeting of policing strategies to high&#x02010;risk areas and settings of alcohol consumption.</p><p>Previous short&#x02010;term studies (up to 12 month of intervention) have reported that between 81% and 95% of police&#x02010;attended incidents or persons involved in such incidents have had their alcohol&#x02010;related status recorded [<xref rid="dar12330-bib-0046" ref-type="ref">46</xref>, <xref rid="dar12330-bib-0047" ref-type="ref">47</xref>, <xref rid="dar12330-bib-0048" ref-type="ref">48</xref>]. The findings of the study confirm the viability of police recording this and additional alcohol consumption information, demonstrate that such recording can occur in a routine manner sustained over an extended period of time, on a jurisdiction&#x02010;wide basis, and for a variety of incident types, not only those defined by alcohol involvement, such as drink driving offences [<xref rid="dar12330-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">32</xref>, <xref rid="dar12330-bib-0047" ref-type="ref">47</xref>]. The findings are supported by crime statistics routinely reported by the NSW Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research <xref rid="dar12330-bib-0049" ref-type="ref">[49]</xref>.</p><p>The prevalence of alcohol involvement in assaults found in this study is broadly consistent with that reported in previous studies [<xref rid="dar12330-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref>, <xref rid="dar12330-bib-0048" ref-type="ref">48</xref>]. Briscoe and Donnelly reported that 23.1% of assault incidents were flagged as &#x02018;alcohol&#x02010;related&#x02019; by New South Wales Police, a proportion that approximates the 26% of incidents flagged in this study prior to the intervention <xref rid="dar12330-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">[27]</xref>. The observed increase in the prevalence of such incidents to 44.5% demonstrates the enhanced availability of information afforded to police by the intervention. However, such a prevalence is lower than the 77% of assault, offensive behaviour and language incidents reported to be alcohol related in a 2&#x02010;week study by Ireland and Thommeny <xref rid="dar12330-bib-0046" ref-type="ref">[46]</xref>, a difference that may be explained by the shorter study timeframe, and differences in incident types, season and location in that study.</p><p>The realisation of harm reduction benefits from the enhanced availability to police of alcohol&#x02010;related information is dependent on the manner in which the information is subsequently applied to responses by police and other agencies. While such agencies have a range of strategies for policing liquor licensing regulations <xref rid="dar12330-bib-0050" ref-type="ref">[50]</xref>, including education, deterrence, evidence gathering and formal law enforcement, the deployment of such strategies is suggested to be non&#x02010;systematic <xref rid="dar12330-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">[14]</xref>. The enhanced information availability provides a basis for more systematic approaches to the use of such strategies [<xref rid="dar12330-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref>, <xref rid="dar12330-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref>]. A randomised controlled trial of an intervention utilising police recorded incident information found a 15% greater reduction in alcohol&#x02010;related incidents associated with premises that received the intervention compared with those that received normal policing <xref rid="dar12330-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">[33]</xref>. As that study was conducted using study&#x02010;specific intelligence gathering tools, further research is required to confirm these findings using routinely collected and recorded police data.</p><p>The utility of the information recorded in this study could be enhanced by combining it with information from other sources, such as police infringement notices and judicial and other actions undertaken in relation to alcohol policing <xref rid="dar12330-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">[5]</xref>. Through the combining of such information, a more robust approach to identifying the need and type of police response appropriate for high&#x02010;risk areas and settings could be achieved.</p><p>The findings of this study should be considered in the context of a number of its design characteristics. First, the stepped wedge study design used in this study was modified due to the absence of pre&#x02010;intervention data regarding the level of police recording of the new information items. Notwithstanding this limitation, the consistency and replication of the observed findings in the absence of any other known explanation supports the conclusion that enhanced information availability is likely to be attributable to the intervention.</p><p>Second, the use of self&#x02010;reported last&#x02010;place&#x02010;of&#x02010;alcohol&#x02010;consumption information, and self&#x02010;reported name and address of licensed premises carries a risk of inaccuracy. The recording of information with such limitations is, however, a normal element of policing practice, providing preliminary information before the gathering of more reliable and valid evidence to establish definitive associations between incidents, people and locations. In this context, the utility of the recorded information is recognised as being restricted to having an &#x02018;intelligence&#x02019; function, with the information not being considered to infer causality. An alternative means of identifying high&#x02010;risk locations and settings of alcohol consumption is to utilise information regarding the actual location of assaults (e.g. on licensed premises). Such information is however similarly limited by potential biases associated with the reporting of such incidents by licensees and/or the persons involved. Nonetheless, further research regarding the validity of the reported information is warranted.</p><p>Third, the intervention program was implemented in a single police jurisdiction in Australia, thereby potentially limiting its generalisability. However, as the intervention has the ability to be tailored and scaled to accommodate variations between jurisdictions in terms of information systems, data collection processes and legislative context, it has the potential to be implemented more broadly. This potential has been demonstrated by the successful implementation by New Zealand Police of an equivalent alcohol&#x02010;related crime information system, using similar implementation strategies <xref rid="dar12330-bib-0051" ref-type="ref">[51]</xref>.</p><p>Finally, although the intervention sought to enhance police recording of the new information items for multiple incident types, only one incident type (assaults) was considered in this study. Further research is required to determine the generalisability of the study findings to other incident types.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="dar12330-sec-0032"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The research team acknowledges funding support provided by Alcohol Education and Research Foundation, New South Wales Police, Hunter New England Population Health, The University of Newcastle and Hunter Medical Research Institute.
