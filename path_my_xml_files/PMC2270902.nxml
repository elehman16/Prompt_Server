The study participants were prepared for ablation using thyroid hormone withdrawal. Ablation was considered successful when serum thyroglobulin concentration was less than 1 ng/mL and no uptake was present in <sup>131</sup>I scan. Ablation was successful following one administration of radioiodine in 42 (52&#x00025;; 95&#x00025; CI, 41&#x00025; to 63&#x00025;) of the 81 evaluable study participants who received 1100 MBq, and in 43 (56&#x00025;, 45&#x00025; to 67&#x00025;) of the 77 subjects who received 3700 MBq activity (<italic>P&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;</italic>.61). There was no difference between the groups in the numbers of repeat radioiodine treatments needed to complete ablation (<italic>P&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;</italic>.27). The higher activity was associated with more nausea and taste disturbances, and a longer stay in a radioprotected isolation unit. None of the participants died from thyroid cancer during a median follow up of 51 months; three subjects in the 3700 MBq group and none in the 1100 MBq group were diagnosed with distant metastases during follow-up. In a meta-analysis of four randomized studies that compared the 1100 and 3700 MBq activities, the 1100 MBq activity tended to be associated with a higher risk of unsuccessful ablation (relative risk 1.148, 95&#x00025; CI 0.974 to 1.353, <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a; .10).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>The results provide no conclusive evidence that 3700 MBq activity is more effective for ablation of the thyroid remnant than 1100 MBq activity.

The potential advantages include eradication of occult carcinoma foci, and improved sensitivity of postoperative <sup>131</sup>I scanning and serum thyroglobulin measurements for detection of recurrent disease <xref rid="pone.0001885-Sherman1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Ablation is generally well tolerated, but may be associated with transient neck pain and oedema, sialadenitis, lethargy, impairment of gonadal functions, and rarely radiation-associated second cancer <xref rid="pone.0001885-Sherman1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0001885-Jarzab1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.

The administered activities vary widely between centers from as small as 925 MBq (25 mCi) to as high as 7400 MBq (200 mCi) regardless of whether chosen empirically or based on dosimetry-guided techniques <xref rid="pone.0001885-Sherman1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0001885-Roos1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.

The relative benefits and harms of lower and higher administered activities thus remain unknown.</p><p>We evaluated the safety and efficacy of two commonly used radioiodine ablative activities (1100 MBq, 30 mCi; and 3700 MBq, 100 mCi) administered following thyroidectomy for differentiated thyroid cancer. We made an effort to accrue the majority of patients who underwent total or near total thyroidectomy in a single center. Since efficacy of <sup>131</sup>I depends on the amount of the thyroid tissue left behind at surgery, we restricted the study within a patient population treated with thyroidectomy. To our knowledge, this is the first randomized study on thyroid ablation that addresses also adverse effects of radioiodine and duration of isolation required following administration.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001885.s001">Protocol S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001885.s002">Checklist S1</xref>.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Study population</title><p>One-hundred and sixty patients with histologically confirmed thyroid carcinoma were entered to this prospective, randomized, phase III, open-label, single-center study between January 2000 and October 2004.

Patients who presented with macroscopic inoperable locoregional disease or with distant metastases were excluded, as well as pregnant women. The study participants are consecutive with the exception of the patients who were not eligible, those who selected not to participate, and a few patients who were not included because of logistic reasons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001885-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Staging work-up was performed four to five weeks after thyroidectomy and included physical examination, blood cell counts, blood biochemistry, serum thyroglobulin and triiodothyronine measurements, and usually chest X-ray. Postoperative neck ultrasonography or computed tomography were not mandated by the protocol.</p><fig id="pone-0001885-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0001885.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>A consort diagram of the study.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0001885.g001"/></fig><p>All participants were randomly allocated to receive either 1110 or 3700 MBq activity of<sup> 131</sup>I five to six weeks after thyroidectomy. At randomization, patients were stratified according to the presence or absence of histologically verified cervical lymph node metastases. Randomization was carried out centrally, and was done with a computer program where random digits were weighted based on the proportion of past randomizations to yield a balanced number of randomizations between the two groups in a concealed fashion.</p><p>The primary endpoint was successful thyroid ablation defined as 1) absence of abnormal uptake in a diagnostic whole body <sup>131</sup>I scan, 2) undetectable (less than 1 ng/mL) serum thyroglobulin during both levothyroxine administration and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) stimulation, and 3) absence of palpable metastases in the neck. All three conditions had to be met for ablation to be considered as successful. We performed a second efficacy analysis (not specified by the study protocol) taking absence of abnormal activity in a diagnostic radioiodine scan as the sole criterion for successful ablation. Other endpoints in the study were tolerability of radioiodine treatment, the number of subsequent radioiodine treatments required to complete thyroid ablation, absorbed activity in the neck following <sup>131</sup>I administration, and the time spent in an isolation unit following radioiodine administration.</p><p>All patients signed an informed consent prior to performing any of the study procedures.

The percentage uptake was measured with an Atomlab 950 Thyroid Uptake System (Biodex, New York, USA) 48 hours after administration of 7.4 MBq radioiodine. The ablative radioiodine activity (1100 MBq or 3700 MBq) was administered approximately five days later as oral capsules that were swallowed with water.</p><p>The patients stayed in a hospital isolation unit after radioiodine administration until the radiation protection limit required by the Finnish authorities was met; the remaining whole body <sup>131</sup>I activity was required to be less than 400 MBq corresponding to approximately 15 &#x000b5;Sv/h dose equivalent rate measured with a Geiger counter at one meter distance. Oral levothyroxine replacement therapy was initiated four days after radioiodine administration and adjusted individually based on serum TSH and free triiodothyronine measurements.</p><p>A whole-body iodine scan and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) were performed four to seven days after ablative <sup>131</sup>I administration using a double-headed Toshiba 7200 A/UI gamma camera (Toshiba Medical Systems, Nasu, Japan) equipped with high energy parallel-hole collimators. SPECT was done in 139 (87&#x00025;) cases; it was not performed in 21 cases due to logistic reasons. The effective radioiodine activity half-life (T&#x000bd;)<sub>eff</sub> in the neck was calculated using the physical (T&#x000bd;<sub>phys</sub>, eight days) and biological (T&#x000bd;<sub>biol</sub>) half-lives.

Serum thyroglobulin levels were measured both while the patient was receiving levothyroxine and during TSH stimulation, which was achieved by abstaining from levothyroxine administration or by administering recombinant human TSH (rhTSH) for patients judged to tolerate abstaining from levothyroxine poorly (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;11; four in the low activity arm and seven in the high activity arm). Serum thyroglobulin was analyzed using immunofluorometry (normal reference range, &#x0003c;24 ng/mL). In addition, a diagnostic whole body scan, carried out under TSH stimulation, was performed after administration of 185 MBq of <sup>131</sup>I. It was not performed when serum thyroglobulin was detectable (&#x02265;1 ng/mL) while the patient was receiving levothyroxine.</p><p>Radioiodine ablation was repeated whenever serum thyroglobulin was detectable or when abnormal uptake was present in the thyroid bed or at extrathyroid sites in a diagnostic radioiodine scan. The repeat administered activity was the same as the first administered activity except for 15 patients in the 1100 MBq group who received 3700 MBq and for one patient in the 3700 MBq group who received 2960 MBq. When a second repeat treatment was required, all but two patients received at least 3700 MBq.</p><p>Adverse effects related to radioiodine administration, graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria version 2.0, were recorded by the study participants on structured forms approximately four days before <sup>131</sup>I administration, and four to seven days, two to three weeks, and three months following treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>We estimated that one radioiodine treatment would be successful in 40&#x00025; of the study participants allocated to the 1100 MBq group and in 60&#x00025; of those allocated to the 3700 MBq group. Using power (1-&#x003b2;) 80&#x00025;, &#x003b1; .05 and a one-sided test, 160 participants were to be recruited to the study.

Frequency tables were analysed with the chi-square test or Fisher's exact test. The Bonferroni method was used to correct for multiple testing. Distributions of the days spent in an isolation unit were compared using the Mann-Whitney test. Confidence intervals for one proportion were calculated using normal approximation. A formal meta-analysis was conducted using pooled data from three previous studies and the present study. The combined relative risk (RR) and the 95&#x00025; confidence interval for the RR were estimated with a fixed effect assumption.

In general, the smaller administered radioiodine activity was better tolerated. Six prior randomized studies have evaluated radioiodine activity in thyroid ablation <xref rid="pone.0001885-Creutzig1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0001885-Bal2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0001885-GawkowskaSuwinska1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.

The only large trial accrued 509 patients diagnosed with papillary or follicular thyroid cancer in Northern India <xref rid="pone.0001885-Bal2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. In this study the participants were divided into eight groups treated with different activities ranging from 555 MBq (15 mCi) to 1850 MBq (50 mCi). A higher success rate (81.6&#x00025;) was reported with activities of 925 MBq or greater as compared to lower activities (555 or 740 MBq, 61.8&#x00025;). However, interpretation of this trial is difficult, because 28&#x00025; of the patients underwent subtotal thyroidectomy or hemithyroidectomy, postoperative neck radioiodine uptake was generally high, the timing of ablation ranged between one month and nine years after surgery, a single primary end-point was not used, and 18&#x00025; fewer patients than expected were allocated to the two groups that received the least activity.</p><p>Three prior randomized trials have compared the 1100 MBq activity with the 3700 MBq activity <xref rid="pone.0001885-Creutzig1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0001885-Bal1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Although these studies have been criticized for their small size and methodology <xref rid="pone.0001885-Roos1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, the results are in line with the present findings (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0001885-t005">Table 5</xref>). The results of the meta-analysis performed by us found that the success rate in thyroid remnant ablation as evaluated by radioiodine scan tends to be higher with the 3700 MBq activity than with the 1100 MBq activity. The relative risk of unsuccessful ablation was 1.148 with the 1100 MBq activity, but the 95&#x00025; confidence interval crossed 1.0 and the difference was thus not statistically significant. When the data of the meta-analysis (RR 1.148, success rates 71.3&#x00025; vs. 62.1&#x00025;) are used to design a study aiming to demonstrate superiority of the 3700 MBq radioiodine activity over the 1100 MBq activity using a two-sided significance level of 0.05 and power of 80&#x00025;, altogether 822 subjects would need to be entered to the study. The number of study participants required may be even larger than this when successful ablation is defined by undetectable serum thyroglobulin concentration and a negative radioiodine scan. All studies performed so far may thus have been inadequately powered to be able to reliably demonstrate a difference in success of thyroid ablation between these two radioiodine activities.</p><p>Three randomized trials have compared 1100 MBq (30 mCi) activity with 1800 MBq (50 mCi) activity,<sup>8,10,14</sup> and two randomized trials 1800 MBq activity with 3700 MBq (100 mCi) activity.<sup>8,9</sup> Although some trials suggest that a high activity is more efficacious,<sup>9,14</sup> the pooled risk ratios are not statistically significant and the results are therefore consistent with there being a superior effect associated with a high activity or no difference (reviewed in Hackshaw et al.<sup>13</sup>).</p><p>Patients with a unifocal carcinoma 1.0 cm in diameter or less, node-negative, and no extension beyond the thyroid capsule have low long-term recurrence rate (&#x0003c;2&#x00025;) and may not benefit from adjuvant radioiodine, whereas radioiodine is likely beneficial when carcinoma persists in the neck or elsewhere. Selective use of radioiodine may be recommended for patients who have disease between these two extremes <xref rid="pone.0001885-Pacini1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. The American Thyroid Cancer Association Guidelines Taskforce recommends radioiodine ablation for stage III and IV disease (defined as American Joint Committee on Cancer 6<sup>th</sup> edition), to all patients with stage II disease younger than age 45 years and most patients with stage II disease 45 years or older, and to selected patients with stage I disease <xref rid="pone.0001885-Cooper1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>.</p><p>The National Compehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines recommend use of 30 to 100 mCi radioiodine in cases of papillary, follicular or H&#x003cb;rthle cell carcinoma &#x02265;1 cm in diameter, with nodal or distant metastases, or with aggressive histology when there is suspected or proven thyroid bed uptake in total body radioiodine scan after thyroidectomy <xref rid="pone.0001885-National1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p><p>Higher administered activity was associated with more nausea and taste disturbances. The absolute risk for radioiodine-induced cancers has not been well established, but the risk of any second primary cancer after initial diagnosis of thyroid cancer is increased approximately 30&#x00025; over that of the general population <xref rid="pone.0001885-Sandeep1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0001885-Rubino1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, and the risk appears to increase with increasing cumulative administered activity <xref rid="pone.0001885-Rubino1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.

This finding suggests that if the time to distant recurrence or overall survival are selected as the study primary endpoints, the study size needs to be very large, and it is doubtful whether such a study will be conducted. However, studies larger than the present one addressing radioiodine activity are warranted to exclude small but still clinically significant differences in efficacy between small and high administered radioiodine activities. The present study was a single-center trial, which is a limitation of the study, and further studies addressing radioiodine activity should preferentially be carried out in a multicenter setting. We used serum thyroglobulin levels as the basis of evaluation of success of radioiodine ablation, because whole body <sup>131</sup>I scanning generally has low sensitivity after radioiodine ablation <xref rid="pone.0001885-Pacini1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0001885-Torlontano1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0001885-Haugen1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.</p><p>In conclusion, the results of the present trial and the meta-analysis provided no conclusive evidence that administration of 3700 MBq activity is more effective for ablation of the thyroid remnant than 1100 MBq activity among patients treated with total thyroidectomy for differentiated thyroid carcinoma. Administration of the smaller activity is associated with fewer common adverse effects and a shorter stay in a radiation protection unit, and does not result in more repeat treatments. The relative benefits and harms of using high (3700 MBq) as compared to low (1100 MBq) radioiodine activity remain inadequately studied, since none of the prior studies have addressed important aspects in clinical decision-making such as side effects of radioiodine administration, duration of isolation, or cancer recurrence rates after radioiodine administration.<sup>6,7,8</sup> Evidence for selection of one or the other of the two radioiodine activities thus remains inconclusive. Importantly, the anti-cancer efficacy of different radioiodine activities has not been addressed in large, adequately powered controlled clinical trials. Such trials should receive a high priority.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0001885.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>CONSORT checklist</p><p>(0.05 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0001885.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0001885.s002"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><p>Trial Protocol</p><p>(0.07 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0001885.s002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank the nursing staff of the Department of Oncology, Helsinki University Central Hospital, for skilful assistance.
