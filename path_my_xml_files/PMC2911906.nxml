Mean CRP was 64% lower by week 2 with adalimumab and essentially unchanged with placebo. Univariate analyses indicated that elevated CRP at baseline and time-averaged CRP were strongly associated with radiographic progression for placebo-treated patients but not for adalimumab-treated patients. Multivariate analysis confirmed that elevated baseline CRP was the only strong independent risk factor for radiographic progression (for CRP &#x02265;1.0 mg/dl: odds ratio = 3.28, 95% confidence interval = 1.66 to 6.51, <italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.001).

PsA was previously considered a mild form of arthritis, typically less severe than rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Evidence has accumulated, however, to show that PsA is associated with substantial morbidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Progression of clinical and radiographic damage in PsA has been related to disease activity and severity, both at presentation and at follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Progressive erosive disease had been reported in more than one-half of patients with PsA and is often associated with functional impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Patients with PsA are at increased risk of death compared with the general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], and severity of PsA at presentation is a predictor of mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Before the advent of biologic agents, therapies were employed in PsA based on experience in RA, despite differences in the types of joint damage typical of each disease and despite the lack of evidence to support prevention of clinical or radiographic damage in PsA. Randomized controlled trials of traditional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs for patients with PsA have not included radiographic assessments, and data from an observational study provided no evidence that disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs prevented radiographic damage in PsA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In contrast, randomized controlled trials with anti-TNF agents in patients with PsA have demonstrated not only clinical efficacy, but also significant inhibition of radiographic progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>The Adalimumab Effectiveness in PsA Trial (ADEPT) is one of the largest randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of a TNF antagonist for treatment of PsA to date. ADEPT demonstrated that 24 weeks of treatment with adalimumab improved arthritis, skin disease and quality of life, and prevented radiographic joint destruction in patients with PsA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Subanalyses of ADEPT have suggested that radiographic progression was associated with several baseline factors, including elevated values of C-reactive protein (CRP), swollen joint count (SJC), and tender joint count (TJC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. It is not known which factors, if any, were independently associated with radiographic progression in ADEPT.</p><p>CRP is a sensitive marker for systemic inflammation. Elevated concentrations of CRP have been associated with radiographic progression in RA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. PsA and RA have distinct types of joint pathology, however, so they do not necessarily have identical risk factors for joint damage. In addition, CRP is not always elevated in patients with clinically active arthritis. The aim of this <italic>post hoc </italic>analysis was therefore to extend previous studies in PsA by determining whether CRP or other factors were independent predictors of radiographic progression in ADEPT. We found that baseline CRP, as measured with a high-sensitivity assay, was the dominant independent predictor of radiographic progression, and that the relationship between CRP and radiographic progression was different for patients treated with placebo compared with adalimumab.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>ADEPT study design</title><p>ADEPT was a phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which patients were randomized to receive subcutaneous placebo or adalimumab 40 mg every other week. Randomization was centrally stratified by methotrexate use (yes/no) and extent of psoriasis (&#x0003c; 3% or &#x02265;3% body surface area (BSA)) at baseline. Radiographs of the hands and feet were obtained at baseline and week 24, and were read by two blinded readers using a modified version of the total Sharp score (mTSS) that included assessments of distal interphalangeal joints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Clinical and laboratory assessments were performed throughout the study, as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>ADEPT was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki (2000), and the protocol was approved by the institutional review boards of the participating centers. All patients provided written informed consent before any study-related procedures were initiated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Patients</title><p>The present analysis included all patients in ADEPT for whom radiographs had been obtained at baseline and week 24. ADEPT eligibility criteria required a minimum of three tender joints and three swollen joints, active psoriatic skin lesions or a history of psoriasis, and a history of an inadequate response or intolerance to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Eligibility criteria are described in greater detail elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical and laboratory assessments</title><p>Numbers of joints evaluated were 78 for TJC and 76 for SJC. Serum CRP was assessed at a central laboratory with a high-sensitivity assay (upper limit of normal = 0.287 mg/dl), for samples obtained at baseline and weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24. Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies were not measured in ADEPT.</p></sec><sec><title>Predictor variables</title><p>Variables tested as risk factors for radiographic progression included the following baseline measures: treatment received (adalimumab vs. placebo), patient age, PsA disease duration, psoriasis disease duration, continuous CRP, categorical CRP (&#x02264;0.287 vs. &#x0003e; 0.287 mg/dl; &#x0003c; 1.0 vs. &#x02265;1.0 mg/dl; &#x0003c; 2.0 vs. &#x02265;2.0 mg/dl), mTSS, joint erosion (JE) score, joint space narrowing (JSN) score, SJC, TJC, body weight, methotrexate use (yes/no), and rheumatoid factor (positive/negative). For the univariate analyses only, 24-week time-averaged CRP was also tested as a predictor variable.</p></sec><sec><title>Outcome measure</title><p>The outcome measure for univariate and multivariate analyses was radiographic progression, defined as a change in modified total Sharp score (&#x00394;mTSS) &#x0003e; 0.5 from baseline to week 24 (yes/no). The mTSS value of 0.5 was chosen because it is an accepted threshold that has been previously used to assess radiographic progression in ADEPT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and early RA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Subgroup analyses</title><p>Mean &#x00394;mTSS from baseline to week 24 was determined for patients grouped <italic>post hoc </italic>by baseline CRP concentration (&#x0003c; 1.0 vs. &#x02265;1.0 mg/dl); by baseline CRP concentration using the following four categories: &#x02264;0.287 mg/dl, &#x0003e; 0.287 to &#x0003c; 1 mg/dl, &#x02265;1.0 to &#x0003c; 2.0 mg/dl, and &#x02265;2 mg/dl; and by time-averaged CRP concentration each using the following four categories: &#x02264;0.287 mg/dl, &#x0003e; 0.287 to &#x0003c; 1 mg/dl, &#x02265;1.0 to &#x0003c; 2.0 mg/dl, and &#x02265;2 mg/dl. These four categories were chosen to represent CRP concentrations that are normal (for the high-sensitivity assay employed in ADEPT), slightly elevated (or approximately normal, for nonhigh-sensitivity assays), moderately elevated, and very elevated, respectively. Mean CRP concentrations were determined for patients grouped by whether they had radiographic progression (&#x00394;mTSS &#x0003e; 0.5) or not (&#x00394;mTSS &#x02264;0.5) from baseline to week 24.</p></sec><sec><title>Cumulative probability plots</title><p>Cumulative probability plots were generated to depict &#x00394;mTSS results for all patients by treatment arm, with separate curves for patients with baseline CRP &#x0003c; 1.0 mg/dl and baseline CRP &#x02265;1.0 mg/dl.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Summary statistics were provided for baseline variables by treatment group. The mean and standard deviation were summarized for continuous variables, and the number and percentage of patients for categorical variables.</p><p>Differences between treatment groups for the change from baseline in CRP by visit were analyzed by an analysis of variance model with treatment group and baseline methotrexate use/extent of psoriasis as factors (yes/&#x02265;3% BSA, yes/&#x0003c; 3% BSA, no/&#x02265;3% BSA, no/&#x0003c; 3% BSA). Within each CRP subgroup (&#x02264;0.287 mg/dl, &#x0003e; 0.287 to &#x0003c; 1.0 mg/dl, &#x0003c; 1.0 mg/dl, &#x02265;1.0 mg/dl, &#x02265;1 to &#x0003c; 2.0 mg/dl, and &#x02265;2.0 mg/dl), differences between treatment groups were compared using an analysis of covariance model, with treatment as a factor and ranked baseline mTSS as the covariate for changes in mTSS at week 24. For each patient, time-averaged CRP (in mg/dl) was determined as the area under the curve of CRP values from baseline to week 24 (in units of mg/dl-weeks), divided by 24 weeks.</p><p>Univariate analyses were performed using logistic regression models for each treatment separately and combined to determine potential associations between radiographic progression and each predictor variable. Multivariate analysis using a logistic regression model was performed for selected baseline variables, including all that were statistically significant (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.05) in the univariate analysis, except for JSN and JE scores (to prevent duplication with mTSS). The multivariate analysis was performed four times: once with CRP as a continuous variable, and three times with CRP as a dichotomous variable (once each at a threshold of 0.287, 1.0 and 2.0 mg/dl). The results for non-CRP risk factors are reported from the analysis with CRP as a dichotomous variable at a threshold of 0.287 mg/dl.</p><p>All statistical tests were two-sided and considered significant at &#x003b1; = 0.05. <italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

The present <italic>post hoc </italic>analysis has extended previous studies of joint damage in PsA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] by identifying factors that independently predicted radiographic progression in a randomized, placebo-controlled study of PsA (ADEPT). Furthermore, it determined whether these factors had similar effects for patients treated with adalimumab versus those treated with placebo. The principal finding, obtained from a multivariate linear regression analysis, was that an elevated baseline CRP concentration was the dominant independent risk factor for radiographic progression in PsA. Treatment with adalimumab was the dominant predictor for reduced radiographic progression.</p><p>Univariate analyses demonstrated that elevated baseline CRP was strongly associated with radiographic progression only for placebo-treated patients. In contrast, while almost no radiographic progression occurred among adalimumab-treated patients with baseline CRP &#x0003c; 1.0 mg/dl, those with baseline CRP &#x02265;2.0 mg/dl had the best overall radiographic outcomes; that is, the lowest mean &#x00394;mTSS. These results indicate that the baseline CRP concentration was a predictor of which patients with PsA were at risk for subsequent joint damage, that adalimumab was effective for preventing most joint damage in PsA, and that the greatest radiographic benefit from adalimumab occurred for patients with the greatest baseline CRP concentrations.</p><p>Cumulative probability plots demonstrated that adalimumab prevented nearly all radiographic progression among patients with baseline CRP &#x0003c; 1.0 mg/dl and, compared with placebo, most radiographic progression among patients with baseline &#x02265;CRP 1.0 mg/dl (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). They also illustrated that the mTSS did not increase for a substantial portion of placebo-treated patients, including some with baseline CRP &#x02265;1.0 mg/dl. This finding was not attributable to concomitant use of methotrexate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and was too frequent to have been caused only by spontaneous improvements in clinical arthritis activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Instead, the absence of radiographic progression in some patients probably reflects true disease heterogeneity, plus several quantitative factors - including the tendency for PsA to cause radiographically detectable joint damage less frequently than RA, the limited duration of placebo-controlled observation in ADEPT (24 weeks), and the ability of radiographs to detect only a portion of total joint damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>The magnitude of radiographic benefit observed here with adalimumab is probably a low estimate compared with what might have been observed if adalimumab and placebo had been compared over a longer period of time. Consistent with this expectation, adalimumab inhibited radiographic progression in patients from ADEPT to 48 weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and to 2 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Although baseline CRP was &#x0003c; 1.0 mg/dl in a smaller portion of patients treated with placebo (60%) than adalimumab (66%; <italic>P </italic>= 0.282) in ADEPT, the overall radiographic efficacy of adalimumab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] cannot be explained by this difference because mean &#x00394;mTSS was significantly lower with adalimumab, regardless of whether baseline CRP was &#x0003c; 1.0 mg/dl or &#x02265;1.0 mg/dl.</p><p>This analysis also found that radiographic joint damage at baseline was an independent predictor of radiographic progression. The magnitude of this association was small in the multivariate analysis, both in absolute terms and when compared with the results for baseline CRP variables (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). Baseline joint damage also predicted progression of damage in a previous observational cohort study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In that study, tender and swollen joints were identified as independent predictors of radiographic progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]; in the current study, however, TJC and SJC were predictive of progression only in the univariate analysis, not in the multivariate analysis. This disparity between studies may be related to the finding that CRP was a stronger predictor of joint damage than were the physical examination-based indicators of arthritic inflammation. The disparity may also be related to the greater joint counts at baseline in ADEPT (mean values of 24 tender joints and 14 swollen joints), compared with the observational cohort study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>The present study focused mainly on evaluating baseline measures as predictors of joint damage. It also examined the role of treatment effect, by assessing patients in terms of their 24-week time-averaged CRP. For placebo-treated patients, the association between &#x00394;mTSS and time-averaged CRP was similar to that observed between &#x00394;mTSS and baseline CRP, probably because an elevated CRP tends to remain elevated without treatment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2d</xref>). For adalimumab-treated patients, the mean &#x00394;mTSS was inhibited regardless of the concentration of time-averaged CRP. Adalimumab thus appeared to inhibit radiographic progression not only by reducing inflammation, but also via effects that were not entirely dependent on control of inflammation. These findings are consistent with evidence that TNF antagonists can directly inhibit the osteoclast pathway in patients with PsA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], and with radiographic outcomes observed in patients with RA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Further research is needed to understand variations in responses to TNF antagonists, not only for individual patients, but also with respect to destructive versus proliferative joint disease in PsA.</p><p>The main limitation of the analyses presented here is that they were designed <italic>post hoc</italic>. ADEPT is a unique resource because it is the only randomized controlled trial of a TNF antagonist in PsA that continued placebo therapy for 24 weeks without an escape option. The 24-week duration limited the &#x00394;mTSS in placebo-treated patients to a mean value of 1.0, however, and did not allow radiographic efficacy to be assessed in the full study population after an initial period of therapy. The number of adalimumab-treated patients with radiographic progression was small, which precluded subset analyses in this group. The mTSS used for ADEPT was modified for PsA by including the distal interphalangeal joints, but it only measured erosions and joint space narrowing and only in peripheral joints. Other PsA-related radiographic findings were assessed in ADEPT, such as juxtaarticular periostitis and pencil-in-cup. They changed by amounts that were too small to warrant their inclusion in the present analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>We have shown that an elevated CRP concentration at baseline was an independent predictor of radiographic progression for patients with PsA. This risk relationship was strong only for patients treated with placebo. Treatment with adalimumab rapidly reduced the mean CRP concentration, and was an independent predictor of reduced radiographic progression in PsA. Adalimumab inhibited radiographic progression across the spectrum of baseline or time-averaged CRP, doing so by preventing nearly all progression in patients with baseline CRP &#x0003c; 1.0 mg/dl and greatly limiting it in others. These analyses demonstrate that patients with the greatest elevations in baseline CRP were at greatest risk for joint damage if untreated, and were the ones who derived greatest radiographic benefit when treated with adalimumab.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ADEPT: Adalimumab Effectiveness in PsA Trial; BSA: body surface area; CI: confidence interval; CRP: C-reactive protein; &#x00394;mTSS: change in modified total Sharp score; JE: joint erosion; JSN: joint space narrowing; mTSS: modified total Sharp score; OR: odds ratio; PsA: psoriatic arthritis; RA: rheumatoid arthritis; SJC: swollen joint count; TJC: tender joint count; TNF: tumor necrosis factor.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>DDG has received consulting fees and honoraria from Abbott Laboratories, Amgen, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Centocor, Roche, UCB, Schering, and Wyeth, and has received unrestricted research and education funds from Abbott, Amgen, Schering, and Wyeth.
