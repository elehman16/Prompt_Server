It is caused by lesions in the postchiasmal visual pathways, primarily due to strokes and, to a lesser extent, trauma and tumors.<sup><xref rid="i2164-2591-6-5-11-b01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> People with HH may compensate for their hemifield loss by scanning using eye and/or head movements toward the blind hemifield. However, there is accumulating evidence<sup><xref rid="i2164-2591-6-5-11-b02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> that many do not compensate well leading to impaired hazard detection in simulated driving,<sup><xref rid="i2164-2591-6-5-11-b03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="i2164-2591-6-5-11-b04" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="i2164-2591-6-5-11-b05" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="i2164-2591-6-5-11-b06" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="i2164-2591-6-5-11-b07" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="i2164-2591-6-5-11-b08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> in on-road driving,<sup><xref rid="i2164-2591-6-5-11-b09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> and in walking tasks.<sup><xref rid="i2164-2591-6-5-11-b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup></p><p>In order to see an object in the blind hemifield, people with complete HH need to scan at least as far into the blind hemifield as the location of the object. However, they receive no visual cues from peripheral vision as to when to scan or how far to scan into the blind hemifield. People with HH are usually aware of their visual field loss (unless they have spatial neglect) and could use voluntary, cognitive control to guide their blind-side scanning. For example, patients with HH may be trained or told to scan to the blind side in order to detect potential hazards.<sup><xref rid="i2164-2591-6-5-11-b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> However, relatively little is known about the extent to which people with HH use such strategies in real world situations (e.g., driving<sup><xref rid="i2164-2591-6-5-11-b02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>) or whether they are able to adapt their scanning patterns in response to differing conditions (e.g., a busy city-center street with frequent hazards versus a quiet rural road with infrequent hazards).</p><p>Only a limited number of studies have addressed the question of whether people with HH adapt their scanning strategies. A recent study using a gaze-contingent simulation of HH concluded that efficient search strategies were not spontaneously adopted by the majority of participants; however, a minority (4/20) did modify their search strategy in response to changing task demands. In general, a strategy of searching the seeing side before the blind side was adopted both for difficult search tasks in which each item needed to be viewed in a serial fashion as well as easier tasks in which the target was clearly visible in the periphery and a large saccade toward the blind side would have been the more efficient strategy. Only four participants modified their search to start from the blind field when the task was easy. In another study, Schuett et al.<sup><xref rid="i2164-2591-6-5-11-b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> reported that normally sighted participants with simulated HH became more efficient at a dot-counting task (an irregular array of dots) and a reading task after a short period of practice (&#x0223c;15 minutes) on each of the tasks. However, in follow-up studies they found no evidence of transfer of learning (modification of gaze behaviors) between the two tasks, either for simulated HH<sup><xref rid="i2164-2591-6-5-11-b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> or real HH<sup><xref rid="i2164-2591-6-5-11-b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> (i.e., participants who practiced the dot-couting task did not demonstrate improvements on the reading task and vice versa).</p><p>In a study involving detection of peripherally presented moving basketballs within a virtual environment, participants with HH scanned less extensively in the horizontal plane and spent more time looking toward the ground when performing the task while walking than when seated.<sup><xref rid="i2164-2591-6-5-11-b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Thus, when walking, it appears that they modified their gaze behaviors in favor of walking, at the expense of peripheral target detection. In a driving simulator study<sup><xref rid="i2164-2591-6-5-11-b03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> involving detection of stationary pedestrians on the blind and seeing sides, no improvement in blind-side detection rates was found between two simulator sessions, approximately 1 week apart. These results suggested that no learning had occurred, despite 60 minutes of test drives at each session. Moreover, information was available in the seeing hemifield about pedestrian eccentricity, which could have been used as a guide for the scanning behaviors that were needed for detection of blind-side pedestrians. However, gaze movements were not recorded so it was unknown whether there were any changes in gaze behaviors.</p><p>In this paper, we report an analysis of gaze behaviors from a driving simulator study<sup><xref rid="i2164-2591-6-5-11-b05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> in which we evaluated detection performance of people with HH for pedestrians that were stationary to the side of the driving lane and pedestrians that approached the driving lane, walking or running on a collision course (detection rates and reaction time results were reported previously<sup><xref rid="i2164-2591-6-5-11-b05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>). The scanning requirements for successful detection of blind-side pedestrians differed for the two pedestrian conditions, providing an opportunity to examine whether participants adapted their scanning behaviors. In the stationary condition the pedestrians did not move after appearing.<sup><xref rid="i2164-2591-6-5-11-b03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="i2164-2591-6-5-11-b05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Thus, their eccentricity increased rapidly as the car progressed, moving them farther into the blind hemifield, requiring increasingly larger gaze movements for detection. On the other hand, in the approaching condition, the pedestrians were on a collision course,<sup><xref rid="i2164-2591-6-5-11-b05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="i2164-2591-6-5-11-b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> so their eccentricity remained approximately constant as the car progressed. Thus, the magnitude of the gaze scan needed for detection would also have remained approximately constant, and smaller than the gaze scan needed in the stationary condition.</p><p>Herein, we address two main questions: (1) did participants with HH adapt their blind-side scan magnitudes (without training or instructions) to match the differing scanning requirements (pedestrian eccentricities) for successful blind-side detection in the stationary and approaching conditions; and (2) were the previously reported<sup><xref rid="i2164-2591-6-5-11-b05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> differences in blind-side detection rates between the two conditions accounted for by differences in the scanning requirements? We quantified the magnitudes of scans after the appearance of pedestrians in the blind hemifield and tested the hypothesis that blind-side scans would be larger in the stationary than the approaching condition. We expected to find greater evidence of within-session learning in the stationary condition (where scanning requirements were higher) than in the approaching condition. In addition, we tested the hypothesis that more time would be available after the pedestrian appearance for a moderate-sized gaze scan to reach the pedestrian in the approaching than the stationary condition, resulting in better detection rates but longer response times.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>The study followed the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the institutional review board at the Schepens Eye Research Institute.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Participants</title><p>The study was completed by 12 individuals with HH, as detailed previously.<sup><xref rid="i2164-2591-6-5-11-b05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> All participants met the following inclusion criteria: (1) complete HH, as measured with a kinetic V4e target in a Goldmann perimeter; (2) no visual neglect (Bells test<sup><xref rid="i2164-2591-6-5-11-b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> and Schenkenberg line bisection test<sup><xref rid="i2164-2591-6-5-11-b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>; (3) no significant cognitive decline (Mini-Mental State Examination test<sup><xref rid="i2164-2591-6-5-11-b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> &#x02265; 24); (4) visual acuity of at least 20/40 in each eye with the habitual correction; (5) no physical impairment that could prevent the use of the standard vehicle controls (gas and brake pedals, steering wheel and horn); and (6) prior driving experience.

The central screen (64&#x000b0; horizontal) provided the view through the windshield while the flanking and lateral screens provided the view from the lateral windows. The rear- and side-view mirrors were inset on the LCD monitors simulating the positions in a real car. The simulator included a motion seat with three degrees of freedom, a force-feedback steering wheel, a dashboard with the speedometer and other instrument displays, and all the usual controls found in an automatic transmission car. The simulated drives took place in a 1600 &#x000d7; 800-m virtual world.</p><p>Events in the virtual world were programmed through a scenario development toolbox (FAAC Corp.) that rendered the movement of pedestrians and vehicles dependent on the location of the participant's vehicle within the world. Data from the simulator stream (including the location and status of all programmed objects and the driver's car in the virtual world) were continuously recorded at 30 Hz. A Smart Eye remote six-camera infrared eye and head tracking system (Pro 5.4; Smart Eye, Gothenburg, Sweden) was used to track gaze at 60 Hz. This system enabled tracking across the full width of the field of view of the simulator with an accuracy of 2&#x000b0; across the central screen where the pedestrians appeared. Custom-written software was used to synchronize the 60-Hz Smart Eye data stream with the 30-Hz simulator data stream and the virtual world coordinate system.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Research Procedures and Detection Task</title><p>Participants completed two driving simulator sessions on separate days (&#x0223c;1 week apart), one with stationary and one with approaching pedestrians in counterbalanced order.<sup><xref rid="i2164-2591-6-5-11-b05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> After practice drives that provided acclimation to the driving simulator and the detection task, a five-point calibration of the gaze tracker across the central driving simulator screen was performed. Participants then completed a total of approximately 60 minutes of experimental data collection in which they performed the pedestrian detection task while driving along predetermined routes in city and rural environments. Data collection was split into five test drives, each lasting approximately 10 to 12 minutes with short breaks between when needed (for many participants it would have been too tiring to complete 60 minutes of driving without a break).</p><p>Life-size pedestrian figures were scripted to appear on the central screen every 15 to 60 seconds, either on the right or left of the road at small (&#x0223c;4&#x000b0;) or large (&#x0223c;14&#x000b0;) eccentricities with respect to the center of the travel lane.<sup><xref rid="i2164-2591-6-5-11-b05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> However, the actual eccentricities experienced by each participant varied depending on the speed and the position of the virtual vehicle within the travel lane. Each test drive contained an equal number of pedestrians at each eccentricity on the left and right sides. The pedestrians appeared at a distance of 67 m from the driver's car on city roads and 134 m on rural undivided highways, equivalent to approximately 5 seconds when traveling at 30 and 60 mph (the posted speed), respectively. The pedestrians initially subtended 1.7&#x000b0; vertically in city drives and half that in rural highway drives.</p><p>After appearing, pedestrians were either stationary in their initial position as the participant's car approached (stationary condition) or walked/ran toward the road as if to cross the car's trajectory (approaching condition). It was the same pedestrian figure for the stationary and approaching conditions; the only difference was whether the pedestrian remained stationary or walked/ran. In the approaching condition, small eccentricities (&#x000b1;4&#x000b0;) represented hazards approaching from an adjacent lane, or the sidewalk beside the participant's lane, while larger eccentricities (&#x000b1;14&#x000b0;) represented hazards approaching more quickly and from a greater distance (e.g., a jogger or a bicyclist approaching from the opposite sidewalk on a road with 2 lanes in each direction). Approaching pedestrians always stopped before entering the participant's lane to avoid collisions; however, they were programmed to run at such speed that if the car had continued at the posted speed limit and the pedestrian had not stopped before the travel lane, a collision would have occurred. The eccentricity of stationary pedestrians with respect to the car heading increased rapidly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="i2164-2591-6-5-11-f01">Figs. 1a</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="i2164-2591-6-5-11-f01">c</xref>).

Moreover, they were not given any instructions about scanning or the use of specific scanning strategies to look for pedestrians, and they were not given any feedback about their detection performance during the driving simulator sessions</p><p>Detection rates, reaction times, and the proportion of timely responses for the small and large eccentricity pedestrians were previously reported in detail.<sup><xref rid="i2164-2591-6-5-11-b05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> In this paper, we focus on an analysis of gaze scan magnitudes.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Gaze and Pedestrian Eccentricity on the Blind Side</title><p>Gaze and pedestrian eccentricities (in the horizontal plane) were calculated with respect to the car heading direction for all pedestrians that appeared at approximately 14&#x000b0; on the blind side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="i2164-2591-6-5-11-f01">Fig. 1</xref>). Data from small (&#x0223c;4&#x000b0;) eccentricity blind-side pedestrians were not included in the analysis because it was sometimes impossible to reliably distinguish small magnitude saccades (&#x02264;4&#x000b0;) from noise in the recorded gaze data. Only gaze movements that took the eyes at least 6&#x000b0; into the blind hemifield, and could therefore be analyzed with little ambiguity, were included in analyses. A gaze scan was defined as a movement (the combined head + eye movement) taking the eye from the straight ahead gaze position into the blind hemifield that had a magnitude of at least 6&#x000b0;. Movements that returned the eyes from the blind hemifield toward the straight-ahead gaze position were categorized as return movements, not scans, and were not analyzed.</p><p>For each pedestrian appearing at approximately 14&#x000b0; on the blind side, gaze scans toward the blind hemifield were analyzed from the time at which the pedestrian appeared to the time of the horn press (logged electronically by the driving simulator) when pedestrians were detected, or to the time at which the pedestrian disappeared when pedestrians were not detected. Gaze scans toward the blind hemifield comprised either a single movement (e.g., scans at &#x0223c;4 and 5 seconds in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="i2164-2591-6-5-11-f01">Fig. 1d</xref>) or a series of sequential saccades in a stepwise manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="i2164-2591-6-5-11-f01">Figs. 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="i2164-2591-6-5-11-f01">1b</xref>). The gaze scan was always defined as the whole movement, from straight ahead to the maximum eccentricity into the blind hemifield. Each scan was quantified in terms of the magnitude (the maximum eccentricity into the blind hemifield) and the time after the pedestrian appearance at which the scan reached the maximum eccentricity. When detection occurred participants had a strong tendency to keep fixating the pedestrian or to make several scans back to the pedestrian (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="i2164-2591-6-5-11-f01">Figs. 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="i2164-2591-6-5-11-f01">1b</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="i2164-2591-6-5-11-f01">1d</xref>). To address our main hypotheses, we were only interested in analyzing scanning behaviors until the point of detection; therefore, gaze scans after the horn press were not analyzed.</p><p>Each gaze scan was also categorized by whether or not it reached the pedestrian. A scan was classified as having reached the pedestrian if gaze intersected the pedestrian or came within 2&#x000b0; of the pedestrian (as the accuracy of the gaze tracker was 2&#x000b0; across the central screen where the pedestrians appeared). When a pedestrian was detected, the first scan to reach the pedestrian before the horn press, as well as any earlier scans that did not reach the pedestrian, were included in analyses. When a pedestrian was missed, all scans that did not reach the pedestrian from the time of appearance to disappearance were included.</p><p>In addition, when a gaze scan intersected with the pedestrian (or came within 2&#x000b0; of the pedestrian), we determined the time after the pedestrian appearance of the first intersection (or when the scan came within 2&#x000b0;) and the eccentricity of the pedestrian at that time point.</p><p>For the 14&#x000b0; eccentricity pedestrians on the blind side, there were 13 events in the approaching condition and 13 in the stationary condition for each subject, giving a total of 312 events across the 12 participants. Due to technical difficulties, gaze data were not available for 12 of these events. Of the remaining 300 events, 21 (7%) were excluded from analysis for the following reasons: too much missing gaze data (<italic>n</italic> = 11); gaze data were too noisy (<italic>n</italic> = 9); and the driver stopped the car abruptly during a pedestrian event (<italic>n</italic> = 1).

The pedestrians either walked/ran toward the driving lane on a collision course with the participant's car or stood stationary to the side of the lane. We did not give any instructions or training in how to scan to look for the pedestrians while driving because our goal was to evaluate spontaneous adaptation.</p><p>The two conditions presented different scanning requirements for successful detection of pedestrians appearing in the blind hemifield. While the eccentricity of the stationary pedestrians increased rapidly with a median of 31&#x000b0; after 2.5 seconds, requiring increasingly larger scans for detection, the eccentricity of the approaching pedestrians remained approximately constant at median 14&#x000b0; even after 2.5 seconds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="i2164-2591-6-5-11-f03">Fig. 3</xref>), requiring a more moderate sized scan for detection. However, even a moderate scan of 14&#x000b0; is close to the limit of a typical eye saccade; eye saccades of normally-sighted observers when walking are usually less than 15&#x000b0;.<sup><xref rid="i2164-2591-6-5-11-b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="i2164-2591-6-5-11-b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Thus, the appearance eccentricity of 14&#x000b0; presented a challenging situation in terms of the scanning demands for participants with complete HH. Head as well as eye movements were often needed to scan sufficiently far into the blind hemifield, especially in the stationary condition.</p><p>There were clear differences in scanning behaviors toward pedestrians appearing in the blind and seeing hemifields (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="i2164-2591-6-5-11-f01">Figs. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="i2164-2591-6-5-11-f02">2</xref>). When a pedestrian appeared in the seeing hemifield, there was typically a single gaze scan to the pedestrian, which occurred within 1 second of the appearance. By comparison, the timing of the first scan to reach a pedestrian in the blind hemifield was much more variable reflecting the lack of both temporal and eccentricity-related visual cues from peripheral vision on that side. When a pedestrian was present in the blind hemifield, it was by chance whether a scan to the blind side was made. Interestingly participants did not rely entirely on peripheral vision for detection of pedestrians in the seeing hemifield. In the vast majority of cases, they fixated the pedestrian before pressing the horn.</p><p>Given that participants were all aware of their hemifield loss and information about the eccentricity and relative movement of pedestrians was readily available on the seeing side, we evaluated the extent to which they modified the magnitudes of their blind-side gaze scans to match the differing pedestrian eccentricities in the two conditions. Contrary to our hypothesis that blind-side scans would, on average, be larger in the stationary than the approaching condition, the overall distributions of scans magnitudes did not differ in the two conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="i2164-2591-6-5-11-f05">Fig. 5</xref>).

Interestingly, the median magnitudes of those scans (35&#x000b0; and 14&#x000b0;, respectively) were very close to the median pedestrian eccentricities in the two conditions after 2.5 seconds (31&#x000b0; and 14&#x000b0;, respectively).</p><p>If participants had used information from the seeing side to guide their blind-side scanning, then we would have expected to find evidence of within session changes in scan magnitudes. Of the 12 participants, three did demonstrate evidence of within session adaptation of their blind-side scan magnitudes to match the differing pedestrian eccentricities in the two conditions. Participant S5, who drove regularly on private land, exhibited adaptive behaviors in both the stationary and approaching conditions, increasing scan magnitudes in the former and decreasing scan magnitudes in the latter. Participants S8 and S9, both former drivers, also showed learning effects in the stationary condition with median scan magnitudes increasing between the first and last two drives. However, the two participants S1 and S2, who were current on-road drivers did not exhibit any evidence of adaptive behaviors. Interestingly, Nowakowska et al.<sup><xref rid="i2164-2591-6-5-11-b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> also reported that a similar proportion of participants (4/20) with simulated HH modified their search strategy in response to differing task demands, starting search from the blind side rather than the seeing side when the search task was easy and the target could be easily detected in peripheral vision. As in the current study, participants were not given any instructions about specific scanning strategies and did not receive any training other than practice trials.</p><p>The second question we examined in this paper was whether differences in detection performance between the stationary and approaching condition were accounted for by the differences in the scanning requirements of the two conditions. Detection rates were higher and response times were longer for the approaching than the stationary condition. Up to 1.5 seconds after the pedestrian appearance, there was little or no difference between the two conditions in terms of the magnitudes of scans that reached the pedestrian (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="i2164-2591-6-5-11-f08">Fig. 8</xref>). It was only at later times, especially beyond 2.5 seconds after the pedestrian appearance, that differences emerged. At these later times significantly larger scan magnitudes were needed for detection in the stationary (median 31&#x000b0;) than the approaching condition (median 14&#x000b0;) because the pedestrian eccentricity was much greater. As a consequence, relatively few scans reached the pedestrian after 2.5 seconds in the stationary condition. By comparison, in the approaching condition, an approximately 14&#x000b0; scan was still sufficient to reach the pedestrian after 2.5 seconds, and in some cases almost up until the time that it disappeared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="i2164-2591-6-5-11-f01">Fig. 1e</xref>). Approximately 31% of scans that reached the pedestrian occured after 2.5 seconds in the approaching condition (compared with only 13% in the stationary condition), resulting in overall higher detection rates but longer response times.</p><p>Thus, differences in the scanning requirements did account for the differences in detection performance between the two conditions. Stationary pedestrians were more likely to be missed because there was only a small time window within which an approximately 14&#x000b0; gaze scan would be large enough to reach the pedestrian eccentricity. The more safety-relevant approaching pedestrians stayed at a fixed eccentricity for longer allowing more time for a typical (moderate) scan to reach them resulting in better detection rates. However, the magnitude of gaze scanning to the blind side was still often insufficient and the majority of participants still had blind-side detection deficits (missed detections or delayed responses) that could potentially result in a collision in real-world driving.</p><p>To compensate effectively in everyday life, it seems that patients with HH would need to be able to adapt their scanning strategy to the demands of differing enviroments and situations, requiring voluntary, cognitive control of blind-side scanning. Based on their studies with simulated HH, Schuett et al.<sup><xref rid="i2164-2591-6-5-11-b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> advocated task-specific scanning training for patients with HH, while Nowakowska et al.<sup><xref rid="i2164-2591-6-5-11-b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> suggested that patients should be trained to rapidly adjust their search strategy depending on the particular visual context (e.g., searching for a small object in a cluttered environment versus a large object in an uncluttered environment). However, the results of our study indicate that a majority of people with long-standing HH do not seem to be able to rapidly and spontaneously modify their scanning strategy, even in the presence of clear cues from the seeing side. If they were unable to adapt their scanning in conditions where the frequency and position of pedestrians were far more predictable than in real-world driving, then it seems unlikely that they would be able to adapt to rapidly changing and unpredictable situations in on-road driving.</p><p>In summary, our results suggest that 25% of participants (3/12) were able to use voluntary, cognitive control to modify their blind-side scan magnitudes to match the differing scanning requirements of the two pedestrian conditions without any specific instructions or training. It is possible that some of the participants may have exhibited other changes in scanning behaviors that our analysis did not capture. We expect that more participants would have modified their scan magnitudes if explicit training had been given. Our goal, however, was to evaluate spontaneous adaptation of scanning behaviors; therefore, explicit training was not given. More research is needed to establish the extent to which people with HH use effective scanning strategies in real-world mobility situations, whether they are able to adapt their scanning strategies in response to differing task demands, and whether scanning training generalizes to everyday mobility tasks. Each of these topics needs to be addressed using objective recordings of gaze behaviors,<sup><xref rid="i2164-2591-6-5-11-b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> which is challenging in uncontrolled, dynamic mobility situations, especially when walking. Driving simulators can provide a safe, controlled, and repeatable test environment for such studies.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Supported in part by National Institutes of Health Grants: R01-EY025677 (AB), R00-EY018680 (AB), K99-EY026130 (CA), R01-EY12890 (EP) and S10-RR028122 (EP).</p><p>Disclosure: <bold>C.F.
