Kisspeptin has been shown to stimulate GnRH release and pulsatility. Recent evidence suggests that kisspeptin may not work alone but in combination with two other neuropeptides, neurokinin B (NKB) and dynorphin, collectively termed KNDy neurons (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), to affect GnRH release and pulsatility. NKB is a member of the tachykinin family and in humans is encoded by the tachykinin-3 (<italic>TAC3</italic>) gene and acts at the neurokinin-3 receptor (NK3R) encoded by the <italic>TACR3</italic> gene. Dynorphin is an opioid that acts at the &#x003ba;-opioid receptor (KOR).</p><p>These three neuropeptides are found throughout the brain; however, they colocalize in a particular neuronal subpopulation in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) in mice (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), rats (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), sheep (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), goats (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), and monkeys (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). The ARC is an important hypothalamic area that affects GnRH secretion and may represent the site of the elusive GnRH pulse generator (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Multiunit activity (MUA) volleys near KNDy neurons in the ARC closely correspond with LH pulses (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). This has led to the concept of the KNDy hypothesis, which suggests that KNDy neurons in the ARC may interact to control GnRH release and pulsatility (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).</p><p>KNDy neuropeptides have been studied individually and affect LH secretion. Mutations in the genes encoding for kisspeptin, NKB, and their receptors (<italic>KISS1</italic>, <italic>TAC3</italic>, <italic>KISS1R</italic>, <italic>TACR3</italic>) result in hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), indicating that both kisspeptin and NKB are critical for normal GnRH secretion in humans and subsequent puberty and reproduction. Kisspeptin has been shown to act on kisspeptin receptors (KISS1R) expressed on GnRH neurons to stimulate GnRH release (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), which subsequently stimulates gonadotropin secretion (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). However, NKB's effects have been more variable, with some studies showing stimulatory or inhibitory effects on gonadotropins. It is now clear that sex steroid milieu, pubertal status, and gender are important factors that govern the effects of NKB on gonadotropin release (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Although the NKB receptor, NK3R, is not largely expressed on GnRH neurons (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), it is expressed on KNDy neurons in the ARC, and therefore, NKB is likely to act here to govern GnRH release (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p><p>Endogenous opioids have an inhibitory role on LH secretion. In particular the opioid dynorphin and agonists of its receptor, KOR, have been shown to inhibit LH secretion (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) as well as inhibiting MUA in the medial basal hypothalamus (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Conversely, iv naloxone (an opioid receptor antagonist) increased MUA activity in the ARC as well as LH (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), and specific KOR antagonists have been shown to cause a rise in LH (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Thus, dynorphin is thought to act at the level of the hypothalamus to inhibit GnRH and subsequent gonadotropin secretion.</p><p>In summary, anatomical and functional data in animals suggest that KNDy neuropeptides play an important role to control GnRH release and pulsatility. In humans anatomical studies also suggest that the KNDy neuropeptides are colocalized in the infundibular nucleus (equivalent of the ARC in humans) (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). However, no previous studies have investigated the effects of combined administration of the KNDy neuropeptides on gonadotropin release in humans.</p><p>Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the KNDy hypothesis in humans by assessing for the first time the effects of coadministration of kisspeptin-54, NKB, and an opioid receptor antagonist, naltrexone, on LH pulsatility (surrogate marker for GnRH pulsatility in humans) and gonadotropin release.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Ethics</title><p>Ethical approval was granted by the UK National Research Ethics Committee-Central London (Research Ethics Committee number 14/LO/1098).

To allow for the repeat measurements over time, a multilevel linear regression analysis was used as well as two-level models with individual measurements nested within patients. Treatment group was considered to be a fixed effect. The differing relationships over time between treatment combinations were determined by examining the size of the interaction between treatment and time. A significant interaction would imply that the changes in outcome over time varied between treatment groups. To allow for a flexible curved relationship between time and the outcome variable, linear, squared, and cubic terms for time were included if found to improve the fit. The LH, FSH, T, and estradiol data suggest that the best fit came by including linear, squared, and cubic terms for time. LH and FSH results were found to have positively skewed distributions and thus were analyzed on the log scale. T and estradiol data were approximately normally distributed, and therefore, no data transformation was performed. In view of differing baseline sex steroid values between participants, T and estradiol results were analyzed as a change from baseline.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>LH pulse number, amplitude, and approximate entropy (ApEn) analysis</title><p>J.D.V. used a previously described, blinded deconvolution method with 93% sensitivity and specificity to analyze LH pulsatility (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>).

In this study we investigated the KNDy hypothesis in humans for the first time by coadministration of kisspeptin, NKB, and an opioid receptor antagonist, naltrexone, on gonadotropin release and LH pulsatility in healthy male volunteers.</p><p>Although both kisspeptin and naltrexone administered alone increased LH, their combined administration did not significantly increase LH secretion or LH pulsatility above that of kisspeptin alone. It is possible that kisspeptin alone had maximally stimulated LH release and hence no further increase occurred with coadministration of NAL+KP. However, only the NAL+KP group caused a significant rise in LH pulse amplitude, implicating opioid inhibition in limiting the kisspeptin induced rise in LH pulse amplitude. Animal studies have previously shown that pretreatment with a KOR antagonist unmasked the LH effects of senktide (NK3R agonist) (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). In our study, there were no effects of coadministration of an opioid antagonist with NKB.</p><p>The data from volunteers who received combined NKB+KP revealed a novel interaction between NKB and KP in humans. Our data suggest that coadministration of NKB limited the ability of kisspeptin to stimulate a rise in LH and FSH.</p><p>It is interesting to speculate about the mechanism by which coadministration of NKB may have limited the ability of kisspeptin to stimulate a rise in LH in this human study. It is obviously not possible to determine changes in hypothalamic expression of neuropeptides after the acute hormone infusion in humans. However, studies in rats show that intra-ARC administration of senktide to ovariectomized and estradiol-treated rats resulted in a reduction in GnRH1 and KISS1R mRNA expression in the medial preoptic area (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). This suggests that ARC NKB may suppress GnRH secretion directly by reducing GnRH transcription but also indirectly by reducing KISS1R (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Therefore, one could tentatively propose a mechanism in which NKB in the presence of an abundance of kisspeptin acts to inhibit GnRH secretion by affecting GnRH and KISS1R transcription to reduce the actions of kisspeptin on gonadotropin release.</p><p>NKB and kisspeptin have never been coinfused in humans previously, and relatively few animal studies have investigated the effects of peripheral coadministration of NKB+KP. One previous study in male mice showed that ip coadministration of NKB+KP resulted in an approximately 20% lower rise in LH compared with when ip KP was administered alone (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Consistent with this in the same study, the authors investigated the interaction between NKB+KP in hypothalamic explants. They showed that NKB caused no increase in GnRH, whereas kisspeptin increased GnRH; however, coadministration of NKB+KP resulted in no increase in GnRH above basal state (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), indicating that NKB inhibited the kisspeptin induced rise in GnRH. This is similar to our findings in which coadministration of NKB+KP led to a lower rise of LH and FSH when compared with kisspeptin administration alone. The only other study that has investigated the effects of peripheral coadministration of NKB+KP was performed by Ramaswamy et al (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). They showed in GnRH primed juvenile rhesus monkeys that a continuous iv infusion of senktide or vehicle for 48 hours followed by iv kisspeptin-10 resulted in a similar rise in LH. However, this latter protocol was different from our study because a 48-hour infusion of high-dose senktide was administered to cause NK3R desensitization prior to kisspeptin treatment, unlike in our study in which NKB+KP were coadministered acutely over an 8-hour study period.</p><p>Another important consideration is whether sex steroid-negative feedback could have influenced our interpretation of the gonadotropin results (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>) because the men in our study had normal testes that could respond to the increases in LH secretion observed in some groups. Our major findings were as follows: 1) alone and in combination, KP- and NAL-treated groups demonstrated an increase in LH and LH pulsatility vs vehicle groups and 2) NKB+KP demonstrated attenuated gonadotropins vs KP alone. If these findings were due to steroid-negative feedback, then we would have expected to observe a reduction in T and estradiol in the KP- and NAL-treated groups vs vehicle (therefore diminishing negative feedback) and to observe an increase in T and estradiol in the NKB+KP groups vs KP alone (therefore increasing negative feedback effects). However, neither of these hypotheses were evident in this time course. In fact, we observed that the increases in T and estradiol mirrored the gonadotropin changes in each group (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://press.endocrine.org/doi/suppl/10.1210/jc.2016-1911/suppl_file/jc-16-1911.pdf">Supplemental Figures 5&#x02013;7</ext-link>). Together these data suggest that the results observed in this study were predominantly due to neuropeptide infusions and opioid receptor blockade on gonadotropin release rather than due to changes in steroid-negative feedback.</p><p>In this study we were also able to investigate the orderliness of the LH pulses (ApEn). Our results suggest that kisspeptin administration results in more ordered pulses, whereas opioid blockade results in more disordered pulses. In addition, kisspeptin may have a more dominant role in determining the orderliness of LH pulses as when kisspeptin is coadministered with naltrexone the effects are to produce more ordered pulses (and the ability of naltrexone to generate less ordered LH pulses are not observed).</p><p>The aim of our study was to investigate the KNDy hypothesis in humans for the first time, and our data reveal interesting and novel interactions after the coadministration of kisspeptin, NKB, and naltrexone on gonadotropin release and LH pulsatility in healthy male volunteers. However, we need to be cautious in extrapolating our findings to making definitive conclusions regarding the role of the KNDy neurons in humans. This is because the basis of the KNDy hypothesis is that the subpopulation of arcuate neurons that colocalize kisspeptin, NKB, and dynorphin interact together to affect pulsatile GnRH release. As such, many animal studies testing the KNDy hypothesis have used intracerebroventricular administration of peptides directly into the central nervous system. This is obviously not possible in humans, and we have used the peripheral administration of peptides, which may not have full access to the central nervous system, although the ARC is thought to have an incomplete blood-brain barrier and its KNDy neurons extend to the median eminence, which opens to the portal blood (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). In addition, kisspeptin and NKB have been demonstrated to have actions on kisspeptin and NK3R receptors on GnRH neurones extending into the median eminence and organum vasculosum lamina terminalis (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Together this evidence suggests that peripherally administered kisspeptin and NKB can cross the blood-brain barrier sufficiently to affect GnRH neuronal function. Consistent with this, data in the current study show that kisspeptin and NKB were able to modulate LH pulsatility and gonadotropin release. Although kisspeptin, NKB, and naltrexone were administered peripherally, studies have shown that they have little direct effect on the pituitary gland but exert their effects on GnRH secretion above the level of the pituitary gland, which then subsequently determines pituitary gonadotropin secretion (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>).</p><p>In this study we have been cautious in our interpretation of the results by using a 1% significance level (rather than the traditional 5% significance level) to define statistical significance. This was used on the advice our statistician (P.B.) to account for the relatively large number of combinations between pairs of groups. A limitation of this approach is that subtle interactions may have not been identified. However, the advantage of this approach is that the statistically significant findings presented in this study are robust.</p><p>In summary, our study has shown for the first time in humans the important interactions of KNDy signaling in regulating GnRH release and pulsatility (using LH as a surrogate marker). This has important implications not only for improving our understanding of GnRH pulse generation in humans but also in optimizing novel hormonal therapeutic agents to treat reproductive disorders.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group content-type="abbreviations"><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations:
