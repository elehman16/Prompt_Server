In Brazil, cholesterol is responsible for nearly 8% of the deaths caused by non-transmissible diseases, which represents around 4.5 million people. On the other hand, lipid abnormalities associated with increased glycemia, or even diabetes, are dangerous in view of the high vulnerability of these volunteers to coronary diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Epidemiological studies show a positive relation between increased blood sugar levels (glycemia), lipid dysfunction and cardiovascular diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the primary cause of death in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Relative risk of CVD is 2- to 4-fold higher in diabetic people compared with nondiabetic people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Dyslipidemia has been identified as a risk factor for cardiovascular complications in T2DM. The American Diabetes Association guidelines indicate that, the primary goal of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) concentration is less than 2.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL) in diabetic people without overt CVD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>Probiotic agents are defined as live microorganisms that when administered in adequate amounts confer health benefits on the host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].There are some reports in literature suggesting or demonstrating that the consumption of food products containing probiotic microorganisms may reduce the level of serum cholesterol in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The first scientific report associating lactic acid bacteria with a reduction in serum cholesterol was published in 1974 by Mann and Spoerry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], who observed an 18% reduction in the total serum cholesterol level of warriors of an African tribe whose regular diet included milk fermented by lactobacillus.</p><p>Prebiotics can be defined as non-digestible food ingredients that beneficially affect the host by stimulating the growth and/or activity of one or a limited number of desired bacteria in the colon, such as bifidobacteria, which are regarded as beneficial to human health. Although prebiotic components primarily act in the large intestine, they also may have some impact on microorganisms in the small intestine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>The prebiotics identified thus far are non-digestible carbohydrates, including lactulose, inulin and several oligosaccharides that provide carbohydrates which the colon's beneficial bacteria are able to ferment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Some of the effects attributed to prebiotics include the modulation of key physiological functions, such as the absorption of calcium, lipid metabolism, glycemia, modulation of the composition of the intestinal microbiota - which plays a primary role in gastrointestinal physiology, and a reduced risk of colon cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. There are some reports linking the consumption of prebiotics to reduced glycemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The combination of the probiotic and prebiotic might improve the survival of the bacteria crossing the upper part of the gastrointestinal tract, thereby enhancing their effects in the large bowel. In addition, their effects might be additive or even synergistic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>As the consumption of foods containing probiotic and prebiotic ingredients is growing consistently every year, and in view of the limited number of studies investigating their effect in the elderly, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of the consumption of a symbiotic shake containing <italic>Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium bifidum </italic>and fructooligosaccharides on glycemia and cholesterol levels in elderly people.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Production of the symbiotic shake and the placebo shake</title><p>The symbiotic shake was developed and manufactured by the company Maxinutri Alimentos LTDA from a formulation containing 9% skim milk powder (Confepar), 23% whey powder (Alibra), 21% maltodextrin (Companhia Lorenz), 15% oatmeal (SL Alimentos), 7% texturized soybean protein TSP (Texpro), 5% soybean fiber (Gama AS), 3.5% guar gum (Doce Aroma), 3.5% collagen (Gelita do Brasil), 5% soybean extract (San Luca), 4.5% fructooligosaccharide (Corns Products), 0.032% sucralose (China), 0.024% acessulfame (China), 0.7% tricalcium phospfate (China), 2% <italic>Lactobacillus acidophilus </italic>(Fortitech), 2% <italic>Bifidobacterium bifidum </italic>(Fortitech), 1.55% flavor (Doce aroma), 0.035% sodium chloride (China) and 0.032 caramel color (Corns Products).</p><p>All ingredients were added to a Ribbon paddle blender. In a first stage, a premix was prepared from the ingredients of greater volume, which individually represent more than 3% of the total volume of the formulation. The remaining ingredients were added in small amounts in a way so as to obtain a homogeneous and uniform blend. The final blend was filled into plastic containers sealed with aluminum foil and labeled with information regarding the date of manufacture, expiry date and instructions on how to prepare the product for consumption.

The volunteers were asked to fast for at least 8 hours before the blood draw to prevent possible interference with postprandial lipemia which in common in non-fasting blood samples. The plasma was separated from formed elements of the blood immediately after collection by centrifugation at 2500 rpm for 10 minutes.

As for eating habits in particular, the consumption of fermented foods, fibers and oligosaccharides may contribute to reducing cholesterol and glycemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Probiotic bacteria and prebiotics have been introduced into the gastrointestinal tract through food matrices such as yogurts and cheeses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. However, at present, efforts are directed towards developing other, non-dairy foods to be used as food matrix to deliver probiotics to the intestinal tract, including shake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and cereal bars [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], among others. There are several studies on the efficacy of the consumption of probiotics on the reduction of blood cholesterol levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], with some of these also reporting reduced glycemia as a result of the regular intake of prebiotics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. However, the literature contains only few and fragmentary data and information on the effect of probiotics and prebiotics in elderly people. For that reason, the purpose of the present study was to investigate and evaluate the effect of the consumption of a symbiotic shake on the lipid profile and glycemia in elderly people. To this purpose, two periods were evaluated: (1) a pre-ingestion period (15 days prior to initiating the consumption of the products); and (2) the ingestion period (30 days of continued consumption of the products).</p><p>At the end of the ingestion period, the volunteers that received the symbiotic shake exhibited a reduction in total cholesterol, n-HDL-C and triglycerides levels (25.84%, 41.30%; and 37.27%, respectively) and an increase on HDL-C concentrations (35.15%). Similar findings were reported by Larskin et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], who observed a reduction in total cholesterol and triglycerides after 5 weeks ingestion of <italic>L. acidophilus </italic>and <italic>B. bifidum</italic>. However, Lewis et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] did not observe any change in blood lipids in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study investigating the effect of yogurt with <italic>Lactobacilllus acidophilus </italic>on plasma lipid levels. De Roos et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] also did not observe any significant influence on the serum cholesterol of individuals who had consumed yogurt enriched with <italic>Lactobacillus acidophilus</italic>, though they did find statistically significantly higher HDL cholesterol concentrations in these same individuals. Similar results were observed by Kiebling et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], who reported a significant increase in HDL cholesterol with the administration of yogurt fermented by <italic>L. acidophilus </italic>145 and <italic>B. logum </italic>913 and added with 1% oligofructose. However, Greany et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], investigating capsules with combination of culture pure of <italic>L. acidophilus </italic>DDS-1, <italic>B. logum </italic>UABL-14 and FOS, did not observe any significant elevation in HDL.</p><p>Although many studies demonstrate the positive effect of prebiotics and probiotics on the modulation of serum cholesterol levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], some of these studies report conflicting findings and the mechanisms underlying the modulation of serum cholesterol levels by symbiotics remain largely obscure. According to Lee et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], five mechanisms may be involved in the reduction of cholesterol levels by lactic bacteria: (a) inhibition of the enzymatic synthesis of cholesterol by the fermentation products of lactic bacteria, mainly short chain fatty acids; (b) the bacteria may facilitate elimination of cholesterol through the feces; (c) inhibition of cholesterol absorption back into the body by binding with cholesterol; (d) the bacteria may interfere with the recycling of bile salts, facilitating their elimination. In this situation, cholesterol is mobilized to produce bile salts, resulting in a fall in blood cholesterol levels; (e) assimilation by lactic acid.</p><p>According Ooi and Liong [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] some species of Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Enterococcus, and Streptococcus have demonstrated to have the capacity of lowering plasma cholesterol level. One of the underlying mechanisms is that these probiotic bacteria can reduce the reabsorption of bile acids through enterohepatic circulation. This is due to the fact that conjugated bile acids but not free forms are partly absorbed and directed back to the liver. Live lactobacilli and bifidobacteria cells can hydrolyze the conjugated bile acids, excrete them faster and reduce the extent to which they are reabsorbed.</p><p>In vitro experiments showed that probiotic bacteria, including <italic>L. acidophilus </italic>spp. and <italic>B. bifidus </italic>may assimilate cholesterol and deconjugate bile salts. The probiotic bacteria may assimilate dietary cholesterol, reducing absorption and increase bile excretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. However, these effects are dependent on the ingestion of bacterial strains capable of colonizing the small intestine where cholesterol is absorbed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>In an earlier study it was evaluate the effect of the same symbiotic product on fecal microbiota of elderly people. The obtained results showed an increase in the population of <italic>Bifidobacterium </italic>spp. and <italic>Lactobacillos </italic>spp. (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.01) and a decrease on <italic>Clostridium </italic>spp. and <italic>Bacteroides </italic>spp. (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.05) counts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The modification of the fecal microbiota composition observed during the ingestion of the synbiotic shake could collaborate to improve the lipid profile.</p><p>The effect of symbiotics on glycemia has not yet been fully elucidated and the data available on this subject are often somewhat contradictory, since they depend to a large extent on the specific physiological conditions of each individual. It is possible that, as is the case of other fibers, fructooligosaccharides influence the absorption of macronutrients, particularly carbohydrates, retard gastric emptying and/or decrease small-bowel transit time. Gluconeogenesis induced by inulin and oligofructose may be mediated by short-chain fatty acids, particularly propionate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. In our study, we observed a significant reduction in glycemia in the group that consumed the symbiotic shake. The findings of our study are in accordance with previously published data and reports in literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. According to Luo et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] healthy volunteers who consumed 20 g fructooligosaccharides for 4 weeks presented a reduction of basal hepatic glucose production. In a clinical study conducted by Cicek et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], diabetes type 2 volunteers who consumed 20 g oligofructose per day exhibited a significant reduction in blood glucose levels after 6 weeks. According to Kaur &#x00026; Gupta [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], inulin and oligofructose modulate the hormonal level of insulin and also the metabolism of carbohydrates and lipids by their ability to lower blood sugar levels.</p><p>In our experiments, we observed a numerical reduction in total cholesterol, a significant increase in HDL and a significant decrease in glycemia in the volunteers that ingested 200 mL/day of the symbiotic shake. No significant change was observed in the volunteers that took the placebo shake. A comparison between the results of our study with findings reported in the literature reveals a considerable number of discrepancies. According to Manzoni et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], these discrepancies may be due to the microorganism used, the volunteer population selected for the study, the manner in which the probiotic is administered and the duration of the protocol, with the positive effects being more evident in long-term protocols.</p><p>It should be noted that this study had some limitations that will be considered in future studies. First, the study population at the end of the protocol was small, since some volunteers had health problems that impeded the continuation of the study. The second limitation refers to the fact that volunteers make use of oral hypoglycemic agents and thus, the positive effects on blood glucose levels cannot be attributed only to the symbiotic product. However, since drug treatment was not able to maintain blood glucose of the study population at normal levels, could be attributed to the symbiotic shake a synergistic effect. Finally, the authors consider important the quantification of short-chain fatty acids produced by intestinal microbiota, using in vitro models, to relate to lipid-lowering effects observed.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Based on the results obtained, it can be concluded that regular consumption of 200 mL of symbiotic shake for 30 days resulted in a positive change in the lipid profile and blood glucose level of the volunteers, and this product could be used to assist in maintaining lipids and glucose normal levels in the elderly population. Nonetheless, more studies will be required to confirm the effectiveness of the product.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>TC: Total cholesterol; HDL-C: High density lipoprotein cholesterol; LDL-C: Low density lipoprotein cholesterol; VLDL: Very low density lipoprotein cholesterol; n-DHL-C: Non high density lipoprotein cholesterol; SCFA: Short-chain fatty acids.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>All authors have read and approved the final manuscript.
