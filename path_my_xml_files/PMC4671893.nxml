<bold>Study Design</bold>&#x02003;Randomized controlled trial.</p><p>
<bold>Objective</bold>&#x02003;The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of the bone grafting substitute silicate-substituted calcium phosphate (SiCaP) compared with recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein 2 (rhBMP-2) and to evaluate the clinical outcomes over a period of 2 years.</p><p>
<bold>Methods</bold>&#x02003;Patients undergoing PLF surgery for DDD at a single center were recruited and randomized to one of two groups: SiCaP (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;9) or rhBMP-2 (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;10). One patient withdrew prior to randomization and another from the rhBMP-2 group after randomization. The radiologic and clinical outcomes were examined and compared. Fusion was assessed at 12 months with computed tomography and plain radiographs. Clinical outcomes were evaluated by recording measures of pain, quality of life, disability, and neurologic status from 6 weeks to 2 years postoperatively.</p><p>
<bold>Results</bold>&#x02003;In the SiCaP and rhBMP-2 groups, fusion was observed in 9/9 and 8/9 patients, respectively. Pain and disability scores were reduced and quality of life increased in both groups. Leg pain, disability, and satisfaction scores were similar between the groups at each postoperative point; however, back pain was less at 6 weeks and quality of life was higher at 6 months in the SiCaP group than the rhBMP-2 group.</p><p>
<bold>Conclusions</bold>&#x02003;SiCaP and rhBMP-2 were comparable in terms of achieving successful bone growth and fusion. Both groups achieved similar alleviation of pain and improved quality of life and neurologic, satisfaction, and return to work outcomes following PLF surgery.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>lumbar fusion</kwd><kwd>bone graft substitutes</kwd><kwd>Actifuse</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein 2 (rhBMP-2) is used as an alternative to iliac crest bone in posterolateral lumbar fusion (PLF) surgery, but there are potential concerns about the cost and the associated complications including radiculitis, ectopic bone formation, and osteolysis.<xref rid="JR1500014or-1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>

SiCaP in the form of Actifuse (Baxter, Elstree, Hertfordshire, United Kingdom) or rhBMP-2 in the form of Infuse (Medtronic, Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States) and Mastergraft (Medtronic) was packed in the facet joints and posterolateral gutters. With Actifuse, 10 to 15 mL was used per level per side. One large Infuse sponge (12&#x02009;mg rhBMP-2, 1.5 mg/mL) wrapped around 15&#x02009;cc Mastergraft calcium phosphate ceramic granules was used per level, with half in each posterolateral gutter.</p></sec><sec><title>Outcomes</title><p>Fusion success was assessed with computed tomography (CT) scans 12 months after surgery and with plain radiographs taken at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after surgery.

</p><p>This study is the first randomized trial to evaluate the effects of using SiCaP relative to rhBMP-2 in this particular PLF surgical setting. We observed postoperative fusion rates of 100% at 12 months with SiCaP, confirming the usefulness of SiCaP in the context of PLF for patients with DDD.

<italic>Evidence-Based Spine-Care Journal</italic> (EBSJ) reviewers unanimously commended the authors for performing a prospective randomized controlled trial with thoughtfully designated patient cohorts and a relevant surgical technique-related study question about osteobiologics and their osseous healing in a posterolateral instrumented lumbar fusion setting. Although some reviewers were concerned about the small sample size, EBSJ decided to proceed with publication to show an example of a well-executed pilot study with a combination of meaningful patient-reported outcomes in addition to surgeon-reported variables such as radiographic data and even CT scans at 12 months to objectively rate fusion mass. It was apparent to our reviewers that the study authors sought to create a &#x0201c;clean&#x0201d; study without the usual variables influencing outcomes&#x02014;for instance, by selecting patients who did not require an anterior interbody fusion or by avoiding a left-to-right comparison of a posterolateral bone graft bed with different bone graft materials. Perhaps most importantly, patient selection appears to have been done in a very controlled fashion to keep extraneous influences on bone healing of a posterolateral fusion to a minimum. Reporting was also done in a very transparent fashion, allowing a reviewer to evaluate each patient's outcomes scores individually. There are three findings EBSJ would like to underscore:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Fusion studies are hard to do. Making sure that there is indeed a solid bony fusion takes a long time for follow-up and usually more than plain radiographs&#x02014;as was done in this study where the investigators were able to get a CT scan at the 1-year postoperative follow-up.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The authors have shown equivalence of a silicate calcium phosphate material to a recombinant bone morphogenic protein in a small group setting, which basically represents a pilot efficacy trial.</p></list-item><list-item><p>In the bigger picture, simple questions like the one posed here (Can one achieve similar fusion results with a much less expensive anorganic bone graft substitute compared with a genetically engineered recombinant implant?) are often the most difficult to answer as the number of variables to consider can be daunting. The cleaner the study design, the more difficult it will be to recruit patients to achieve adequate sample sizes. More-definitive answers can only be generated from larger multicenter efforts and eventually are probably better answered using a registry format to answer efficiency-related questions at the cost of precision relative to the focus of the question. For the basic questions at hand, smaller pilot studies such as this one are ideal to establish initial patient safety and efficacy.</p></list-item></list><p>EBSJ and <italic>Global Spine Journal</italic> hope that this study will inspire many further prospective investigations by AOSpine going forward.</p></sec><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Baxter Healthcare sponsored this investigation.
