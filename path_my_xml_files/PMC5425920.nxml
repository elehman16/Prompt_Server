Nonylphenol (NP), an environmental EDC, possesses weak estrogenic activity, which is used in the production of many consumer compounds, including agricultural chemicals and spermicides (<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Accumulating data suggested that NP has toxic impact on the immune, reproductive, and endocrine system in offspring rats; the adverse effects of NP exposure via placenta on nervous system development in F<sub>1</sub> rats were reported sparsely.</p><p>Immediate early genes (IEGs) are a class of genes, which can be activated and transcribed dynamically in response to neuronal activity. As activity-dependent transcription factors, it has been proposed that c-fos and c-jun have important roles in signal transduction, cell proliferation and differentiation and neuronal plasticity that is implicated with long-term memory consolidation in the brain (<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).</p><p>Acetylcholine (Ach), as a neurotransmitter and a neuromodulator in the brain, is necessary for the process of neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission as well as synaptic plasticity. Acetylcholinesterase (AchE) is implicated with the termination of cholinergic transmission by Ach hydrolysis, and degradation of Ach to inactive precursors (acetate and choline) in the synaptic cleft. Choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and AchE are important for maintaining a stable level of Ach in living brain systems. Thus, modulation of the cholinergic signaling pathway, including the inhibition of AchE, the activation of ChAT, and the promotion of Ach synthesis, may serve as strategies for the treatment of memory dysfunction induced by NP neurotoxicity.</p><p>In this report, we performed behavioral toxicity test method together with the histology and morphology observation of brain to explore the impact of NP on neurobehavioral development and ChAT and AchE activities as well as c-jun and c-fos expressions in hippocampus of F<sub>1</sub> rats.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Animals and treatments</title><p>Sixty Sprague-Dawley rats were purchased from Animal Center of the Third Military Medical University (Chongqing, China). After acclimatization for 7 days, females were caged with males (ratio 3:1). Vaginal smears were collected daily, and gestational day (GD) 0 was confirmed by sperm-positive vaginal smear. Subsequently, the 28 dams were randomly assigned to 4 groups (n=7 per group), which were given NP (dissolved in groundnut oil) by gavage at the doses of 50 mg/kg/day, 100 mg/kg/day, 200 mg/kg/day and groundnut oil (vehicle control; 10 ml/kg/day), respectively, from GD 6 until GD 21. After postnatal day (PND) 60, filial generation (F<sub>1</sub>) rats were reared in the laboratory with free access to standard rat fodder (8 gram fodder/100 gram body weight). The animals were group housed under controlled temperature maintained at 20&#x000b1;2 &#x000b0;C and humidity at 60&#x000b1;5 % on a 12:12-hr light-dark cycle (lights on 09:00&#x02013;21:00 hr).

Briefly, the apparatus was a plastic box (27x15x12 cm<sup>3</sup>) whose floor was made of parallel bronze bars. The left end of the grid was occupied by a 4 cm diameter, 5 cm high wooden platform. The behavior of rats was recorded in a personal computer using a step-down test video monitoring system (Shanghai Jiliang Software Technology Co, Ltd, China) coupled to an infrared sensor located in the apparatus. The experiments were carried out from 10:00 to 14:00 hr.</p><p>In the period of learning, before the beginning of the training session, rats were placed on the apparatus to adapt for 5 min. In the training session, rats were put on the grid floor and then a continuous electric shock (0.4 mA) was delivered to the grid floor by an isolated stimulator. When the electric shock was delivered, the rat escapes from the grid floor back up onto the platform. The time for offspring rats to escape from the grid floor back up onto the platform was defined as reaction time (RT). The duration of training test was for 5 min and the shock was maintained for this period. The time of electronic shock suffered by rats when escaping from platform to the grid floor in 5 min was defined as the number of errors. Latency to first step-down (step-down latency, SDL), RT and the number of errors were recorded as learning credit from memory. The number of errors at 24 and 96 hr in pups were recorded after the first day of step-down avoidance test training. In the period of memory consolidation, the tests were administered again 2 days after the learning period. Latency to first step-down and the number of errors were recorded as memory consolidation test. In the period of memory fade away, the tests were administered again 3 days after the memory consolidation period, and the latency to first step-down, RT and the number of errors were recorded.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>ChAT and AchE activities detection in hippocampus</title><p>Following step-down avoidance test, the rats in each group were killed by decapitation under anesthesia at the age of 8 weeks.

Aliquots of the homogenate were further diluted with saline to 5% for ChAT assay. The supernatant was collected for the measurement of AchE and ChAT activities. The activities of ChAT and AchE were measured by spectrophotometry using the corresponding commercial kits (Nanjing Jiancheng biological technology Co, LTD, Nanjing, China).

Results of the current study showed decreased ChAT activity and enhanced AchE activity in hippocampus tissues in rats. Since Ach is closely related to many physiological functions such as body movement, and learning and memory, the damage of the cholinergic nerve function can lead to developmental disorder with behavioral retardation and other symptoms in rats (<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), which is highly consistent with the delayed physiological and neurological development indicators observed in our previous studies (<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Therefore, within the dose range of the experiment design, decreased ChAT activity and enhanced AchE activity may change the Ach levels in the brain. Once Ach changes as the first messenger in the nerve signal transmission system, the second and third cellular messengers will be further affected (<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Hence, we speculated that NP could have an adverse effect on the release and transmission of neurotransmitter via regulating the dynamic balance of Ach, resulting in neurological behavior changes in the offspring rats.</p><p>Exposure to NP during embryonic period and lactation might cause an increase in the level of estrogen and a decrease in the level of androgen in pups. The potential mechanism of NP-induced neurotoxicity may stem from NP&#x02019;s weak estrogen-like activity: NP vies for estrogen receptor to cause the imbalance of endocrine system, alteration of the endocrine milieu of brain development, which affects further cholinergic neurotransmitter to deliver Ach. NP affects c-fos and c-jun protein expressions in hippocampus due to the facts that NP may induce abnormal changes in the morphology, structures and functions of astrocytes, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression. These alterations subsequently promote apoptosis, and lead to the retardation of neural reflex time in nerve developmental stages of rats.</p><p>The aatural Science Foundation of Chictivations and expressions of IEGs are often regarded as the indicators for neural activity and gene activity functions (<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). The current experimental results showed that the number of brown positive cell with c-jun and c-fos positive reaction in the hippocampus of offspring in the high dose group was higher when compared to the control group. Previous studies have found that c-jun can be specifically expressed in nervous system, and as one of the transcription factors, its regulatory range is quite wide, which can be activated and affected by a variety of chemical substances in various tissues (<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Cerebral ischemia and hypoxia can induce c-jun expression (<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) in nerve cells of the corresponding hypoxia ischemia parts. When the cells are stimulated, the concentration of the heterologous Fos-jun complexes composed of c-jun and c-fos nuclear proteins could be rapidly increased in a very short period (<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).</p><p>This study found that NP exposure during pregnancy would induce NP accumulation in the brain tissue of offspring rats, and exposure to NP has an adverse effect on the neural transmitter and IEGs in the signaling pathway of hippocampal neural cells. The proposed response process could be: after exogenous signal stimulation of NP to nervous system, excitement of the first level neurons that stimulates secretion of neurotransmitter, and interfering with the dynamic balance of acetylcholine. Ach, a key neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, functions on the cell membrane of target cells as the first messenger (<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), followed by trans-membrane transduction mechanism of transferring external stimulation signals into the cells, and activating the intracellular second messenger. When causing in transient stress response in cells, the second messenger could activate the transcription of c-jun and c-fos, which are regarded as the third messenger, with the generated mRNA moved from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and being translated into c-fos and c-jun protein.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In the current study, we conducted toxicological behavioral tests and testified the toxic effect of gestational exposure to NP on c-jun, and c-fos proteins expression and learning and memory function in hippocampus of offspring rats, together with the pathological abnormalities in hippocampus ultrastructure of F<sub>1</sub> rats exposed at dose level of 200 mg/kg/day. We made a conclusion that NP exposure might induce a reduction in learning and memory ability of F<sub>1</sub> rats, the reasons may be due to the alterations in the expressions of c-jun and c-fos, as well as ChAT and AchE activities in hippocampus of pups.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>This work was supported by the foundation of the National Natural Science Foundation
