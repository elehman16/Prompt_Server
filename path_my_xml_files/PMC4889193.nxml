Therefore, 2 alternative protocols for initiation of captopril were compared in a prospective randomized clinical trial. A &#x0201c;rapid uptitration&#x0201d; protocol reached an optimal dose on day 3, whereas the alternative, &#x0201c;prolonged uptitration&#x0201d; protocol, reached an optimal dose on&#x000a0;day 9. Forty&#x02010;6 patients (54% male) were recruited to the trial, with a median age of 0.7 year (<styled-content style="fixed-case">IQR</styled-content> 0.5&#x02013;2.3 years). Captopril was&#x000a0;initiated while in intensive care in 39% of patients and on the cardiology ward in 61%. There were no differences between the&#x000a0;protocols in episodes of hypotension, symptomatic hypotension, or indices of renal function.

In adult cardiology, a strong evidence base has produced clear recommendations as to when and how to initiate ACEIs therapy, typically in an outpatient setting.<xref rid="jah31408-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref>, <xref rid="jah31408-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref>, <xref rid="jah31408-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref>, <xref rid="jah31408-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref>, <xref rid="jah31408-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref>, <xref rid="jah31408-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref> In contrast, children with heart disease more often commence ACEIs as inpatients, and while pediatric formularies usually suggest starting with a low initial test dose (eg, 0.1&#x000a0;mg/kg captopril) and uptitration, no guidance is given as to the safest or most effective method of reaching a target dose.<xref rid="jah31408-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref>, <xref rid="jah31408-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref> Because there are concerns that ACEIs therapy in infants and very small children is particularly likely to result in hypotension and renal impairment,<xref rid="jah31408-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref> evidence&#x02010;based guidelines for ACEIs initiation and uptitration in children are necessary. We sought to address this knowledge gap. Based on existing practices in our institution, we prospectively tested the hypotheses that (1) introduction of protocol ACEIs uptitration would prove feasible and (2) a rapid ACEIs uptitration protocol for infants and children would be as safe as and more effective in achieving a target dose than a more prolonged protocol.</p></sec><sec id="jah31408-sec-0006"><title>Methods</title><p>This study consisted of 2 components: (1) an institutional retrospective chart review of ACEI use initiation and uptitration in pediatric cardiac inpatients and (2) a prospective randomized open&#x02010;label clinical trial of rapid versus prolonged uptitration of captopril in pediatric cardiac inpatients. In reporting the results of the randomized trial, we have followed CONSORT (consolidated standards for reporting trials) 2010 reporting guidelines.<xref rid="jah31408-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">19</xref>
</p><sec id="jah31408-sec-0007"><title>Setting</title><p>This study was conducted within The Labatt Family Heart Center at The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto. This center provides inpatient and outpatient medical and surgical care to infants and children with congenital and acquired heart disease, including cardiac transplantation and mechanical circulatory support.</p></sec><sec id="jah31408-sec-0008"><title>Definitions of &#x0201c;Target&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Optimal&#x0201d; ACEI Doses</title><p>In our institution, ACEIs therapy is usually initiated with captopril dosed every 8&#x000a0;hours (q8h). Identical definitions of target and optimal captopril dose were used for the retrospective and prospective parts of this study. Each fell within manufacturer recommended dose ranges and our institutional formulary guidelines.<xref rid="jah31408-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref> The SAVE (survival and ventricular enlargement) study<xref rid="jah31408-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">20</xref> demonstrated a survival benefit in adults with 50&#x000a0;mg of captopril 3 times a day, which would approximate 0.7&#x000a0;mg/kg per dose q8h. On the basis of this, after reviewing doses reported in published studies of captopril use in infants and children (0.25&#x000a0;mg&#x02013;1&#x000a0;mg/dose)<xref rid="jah31408-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref> and after formally surveying the pediatric cardiologists in our institution, we defined a &#x0201c;target&#x0201d; dose of captopril as &#x02265;0.7&#x000a0;mg/kg per dose q8h. We defined a somewhat higher optimal dose at &#x02265;1&#x000a0;mg/kg per dose q8r. To evaluate whether target and optimal doses were achieved, doses were rounded to the nearest 0.01&#x000a0;mg/kg.</p><p>Once it is evident a patient tolerates ACEIs, our standard practice is to exchange captopril for a longer&#x02010;acting formulation in those for whom ACEI therapy is likely to be long term. The choice of drug depends on physician preference and the indication for treatment, though enalapril is most frequently prescribed. Few studies have examined pharmacoequivalency doses of ACEIs, and there are no widely recommended conversion methods. After canvasing the opinion of staff physician colleagues in The Hospital for Sick Children's Division of Cardiology, we pragmatically defined the target dose of enalapril to be &#x02265;0.1&#x000a0;mg/kg per dose every 12&#x000a0;hours (q12h) and the optimal dose of enalapril as &#x02265;0.3&#x000a0;mg/kg per dose q12h.</p></sec><sec id="jah31408-sec-0009"><title>Part 1: Retrospective Chart&#x000a0;Review</title><p>Institutional research ethics board approval was obtained for this part of the study, and a waiver for individual patient consent was granted. The pharmacy database of The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto was queried to identify pediatric cardiology inpatients starting ACEI therapy after September 1, 2005. The charts of 50 consecutive patients were examined, and the following data were collected: demographics, diagnosis, date of ACEI initiation, baseline bloodwork, concomitant medications, name of ACEI, initial and subsequent ACEI doses, predose and postdose blood pressure (BP), duration of hospital stay, name of ACEI at discharge, discharge dose, discharge bloodwork, and ACEI dose at 8&#x000a0;weeks postdischarge.</p></sec><sec id="jah31408-sec-0010"><title>Part 2: Prospective Randomized Open&#x02010;Label Trial of Rapid Versus Prolonged Initiation and Uptitration of Captopril</title><sec id="jah31408-sec-0011"><title>Trial design</title><p>Analysis of data from the retrospective chart review raised concerns about suboptimal ACEI dosing in our patients (see later). We therefore designed a prospective randomized open&#x02010;label clinical trial of rapid versus prolonged initiation and uptitration of captopril in pediatric cardiac inpatients at our center. Our intentions were to determine whether adoption of a protocol would improve ACEI dosing and to rigorously test the safety and efficacy of 2 different potential uptitration strategies. Subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio with stratification to permit equal numbers of intensive care patients in each arm. There were no changes to the methods after the trial began. The study was approved by the institutional research ethics board and by Health Canada (control No. 122190). The trial was registered at the US&#x000a0;National Institutes of Health (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00742040). The full protocol for this trial is available by contacting the corresponding author.</p></sec><sec id="jah31408-sec-0012"><title>Participants and recruitment</title><p>Investigators were notified of any patient who met&#x000a0;all 3 eligibility criteria: (1) pediatric cardiac inpatient (located on the cardiology ward or in the cardiac intensive care unit [CICU]), (2) aged 0 to 18&#x000a0;years, and (3) primary physician decided to commence an ACEI. Indications for ACEIs were based only on clinician choice and not protocol. To maximize recruitment, those who were identified within 24&#x000a0;hours of initiation of captopril but had yet to start uptitration were eligible for inclusion. Prospective enrollees were screened against the following exclusion criteria: patients with a known sensitivity to ACEIs, serum potassium &#x0003e;5&#x000a0;mmol/L, those treated with any ACEIs for &#x0003e;24&#x000a0;hours within the preceding 6&#x000a0;months, and infants aged &#x0003c;36&#x000a0;weeks postconceptual age. Following screening eligibility, a member of the study team obtained written informed consent from participants or their parent/guardian. The ongoing management of potential subjects who declined participation was determined according to the preferences of their primary physician.</p></sec><sec id="jah31408-sec-0013"><title>Randomization</title><p>After eligibility screening and consent, a member of the study team contacted the Hospital for Sick Children's Research Support Pharmacy and reported recruitment. The Research Support Pharmacy created master randomization tables by using a block 4 1:1 ratio of rapid:prolonged uptitration design. Randomization was stratified according to hospital unit, so that there were equal numbers of CICU and cardiology ward patients in each group. Randomized patients received all captopril doses according to the protocol to which they were allocated, or a protocol variance was recorded.</p></sec><sec id="jah31408-sec-0014"><title>Study drug</title><p>The Research Support Pharmacy purchased Canadian commercial supplies of captopril for use in this study. The study drug was identical to that dispensed by the pharmacy for use in clinical practice. The method of administration was also unchanged from that in clinical use, namely in solution with water, by &#x0201c;dissolve and dose&#x0201d; method or as tablets. For dissolve and dose administration, 12.5&#x02010;mg tablets were dissolved in 12.5&#x000a0;mL of sterile water to produce 1&#x000a0;mg/mL solution. Administration of each dose was oral or via enteral tube.</p></sec><sec id="jah31408-sec-0015"><title>Interventions</title><p>During the study, patients started on captopril were randomly assigned to either a rapid or a prolonged medication uptitration protocol, and the clinical care team prescribed captopril doses accordingly. The rapid protocol was designed so that the optimal dose of captopril could be reached on day 3. The prolonged protocol was designed so that the optimal dose of captopril could be reached on day 9. Each protocol included identical instruction for measurement of BP and drawing of blood samples. Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="jah31408-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref> details these protocols. Adherence and variances from the protocols were recorded. Adverse events, serious adverse events, and adverse drug reactions were defined according to The International Conference on Harmonization E&#x02010;6 Good Clinical Practice guidelines as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient subject after the administration of (but not necessarily having a causal relationship to) captopril. We adhered to The Hospital for Sick Children's adverse event reporting requirements as well as Health Canada's drug trial regulations.</p><fig fig-type="Figure" xml:lang="en" id="jah31408-fig-0001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Protocols for uptitration of captopril dose and blood pressure (<styled-content style="fixed-case">BP</styled-content>) monitoring.

For each new drug dose, BP monitoring was performed in all patients at baseline and at 30&#x02010;minute intervals for 2&#x000a0;hours after drug administration or until baseline BP returned. Blood samples (potassium, sodium, urea, and creatinine) were drawn at baseline and then again (so as to permit concurrent sampling with clinically indicated testing) on days 3, 4, or 5 after starting captopril. This was consistent with our standard clinical practice.</p></sec><sec id="jah31408-sec-0017"><title>Data collection</title><p>Baseline data collected after enrollment and randomization included indication for ACEIs, current height and weight, and renal function. After initiation of captopril, the following data were collected from daily review of the clinical chart: baseline BP, postdose BPs, renal function after starting ACEIs, and protocol variances. At discharge from the hospital, additional data elements were captured, including duration of hospital stay, discharge dose of ACEIs, any instructions to increase the ACEI dose as an outpatient, and concomitant medications at discharge. Serum urea, creatinine, BP, and ACEI dose were recorded at the outpatient visit closest to 8 weeks postdischarge (between 4&#x000a0;and 12&#x000a0;weeks postdischarge).</p></sec><sec id="jah31408-sec-0018"><title>Study outcomes</title><p>The primary outcome was the number of subjects in each arm of the study who reached target and optimal ACEI doses during their inpatient stay. This was determined at the time of hospital discharge. Protocol variances were recorded prospectively as secondary outcomes to capture adverse events or challenges following the protocols. Seven potential protocol variances were defined a priori, and a pathway was determined for managing each (see Data S1). Potential variances were:

</p><p>In addition, we were interested to observe the length of hospital stay after initiation of ACEIs and the pattern of ACEI use and dose after hospital discharge; these measures were assessed by review of the clinical chart at 12 to 16&#x000a0;weeks postdischarge. The only change to the outcome measures as defined in the study protocol made after the trial started was to broaden the time point of outpatient data collection from &#x0201c;8&#x000a0;weeks postdischarge&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;the nearest outpatient visit to 8&#x000a0;weeks postdischarge, no fewer than 4&#x000a0;weeks and no longer than 12&#x000a0;weeks.&#x0201d; This change was made for practical purposes, because it rapidly became apparent that few patients were being seen at exactly 8&#x000a0;weeks.</p></sec><sec id="jah31408-sec-0019"><title>Sample size</title><p>Sample size was calculated by using the proportion of patients in each group who were expected to achieve target ACEI dose with each of the 2 uptitration protocols. Based on the retrospective component of the study, we anticipated that 40% of patients in the prolonged uptitration group would achieve the target ACEI dose before hospital discharge compared with 80% of patients in the rapid uptitration group. At a significance level of 0.05 and a required study power of 85%, we determined that 25 patients in each group would be necessary. Based on pharmacy records reviewed for the retrospective case note survey and on a recruitment estimate of 70%, we anticipated attainment of a sample size of 50 patients within a 16&#x02010;month period. In fact, it took 72&#x000a0;months to complete prospective recruitment for this study.</p></sec></sec><sec id="jah31408-sec-0020"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Data are presented as mean and SD values and as median values with 25th and 75th percentiles and frequencies as appropriate.

The predose and discharge values for serum creatinine (38.6&#x000a0;versus 38.6&#x000a0;&#x003bc;mol/L, <italic>P</italic>=0.8), estimated glomerular filtration rate according to the modified Schwartz equation&#x000a0;(73 versus 72&#x000a0;mL/min per 1.73&#x000a0;m<sup>2</sup>, <italic>P</italic>=0.9), and systolic BP (91 versus 87&#x000a0;mm&#x000a0;Hg, <italic>P</italic>=0.09) were similar, whereas serum potassium increased between these time points (4.0&#x000a0;versus 4.5&#x000a0;mmol/L, <italic>P</italic>=0.001). At the point of discharge from hospital, 35 (70%) of 50 children remained on ACEIs: 30 took captopril, 4 took enalapril, and 1 took ramipril. Of those discharged with captopril or enalapril, only 12 (36%) of 34 had attained a target range ACEI dose and 8 (24%) of 34 had attained an optimal ACEI dose. The median discharge dose of captopril was 0.6 (0.4&#x02013;1.0) mg/kg per dose q8h. None of the patients was discharged at or above target enalapril dose: mean was 0.2 (0.2&#x02013;0.3) mg/kg per dose q12h.

Our results suggest that the introduction of a 3&#x02010;day protocol for the inpatient initiation and uptitration of captopril is more likely than standard clinical practice to achieve a target range ACEI dose in pediatric cardiology inpatients. With a prospective randomized comparison, we were able to demonstrate equivalent safety between a 3&#x02010;day rapid uptitration protocol and a more gradual 9&#x02010;day protocol, and we showed that the 3&#x02010;day protocol can be used safely in infants and children in both ward and intensive care settings.</p><p>ACEIs have been used frequently in pediatric cardiology, nephrology, and endocrine practices and are widely recommended by experts.<xref rid="jah31408-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref>, <xref rid="jah31408-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref>, <xref rid="jah31408-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref>, <xref rid="jah31408-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref>, <xref rid="jah31408-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref>, <xref rid="jah31408-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">21</xref> Unusually (for pediatric medications), these agents are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of pediatric hypertension.<xref rid="jah31408-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref> Despite widespread familiarity with this drug class, there have been little data available to clinicians regarding the routine use of ACEIs in pediatric clinical practice. Our retrospective chart review was consistent with adult data, suggesting that with routine practice, underdosing of these medications is frequent.<xref rid="jah31408-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">22</xref>, <xref rid="jah31408-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">23</xref> It has not been known whether different approaches are advisable in infants and older children, for inpatient ward or intensive care unit settings, or for those taking concomitant vasoactive medications. Our data suggest that they are not and that uptitration need not be delayed in inpatients.</p><p>Our protocol for rapid uptitration had no more frequent episodes of hyperkalemia or elevated creatinine than did the more&#x02010;cautious, prolonged approach. For those patients who experienced a rise in creatinine, the degree of elevation tended to be higher in the rapid uptitration arm. However, this trend was not statistically significant and it unlikely to be clinically relevant. In fact, the only patient who experienced more than doubling of the baseline creatinine level was in the prolonged arm. Taken as a whole, our data suggest that rapid uptitration of captopril in this population was not of itself particularly detrimental to renal function. Nonetheless, it should be remembered that ours was a small study and careful monitoring of renal function remains essential whenever starting ACEIs in children.</p><p>Episodes of hypotension were no more frequent in the rapid uptitration protocol than in the prolonged prolonged, and, overall, we found symptomatic hypotension to be infrequent during the initiation of captopril. While only 1 of our patients was prescribed an ACEI for the primary purpose of BP control, it is interesting to note that any BP&#x02010;lowering effect of captopril was seen early in both protocols, maximal within 30&#x000a0;hours, and maintained without further change while patients remained on treatment. A similar pattern was seen in 10 young (3.5&#x02013;20&#x000a0;years) hypertensive patients whose BP response to various doses of captopril was studied by Sinaiko et&#x000a0;al.<xref rid="jah31408-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">24</xref> In that study, the onset of hypotensive response occurred within 15&#x000a0;minutes of captopril administration and peaked at around 90&#x000a0;minutes, and many patients had no further augmentation of response after the second or third dose.<xref rid="jah31408-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">24</xref> The authors also noted that the magnitude of BP response appeared unrelated to the dose of captopril or its blood concentration.<xref rid="jah31408-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">24</xref> These findings, consistent with ours, likely relate to the mechanisms of action of captopril and its pharmacokinetics in infants and children. Further investigation with serial measurements of plasma renin activity and bradykinin levels may be warranted.</p><p>It was evident from our study that in pediatric cardiac inpatients, ACEI dosing at discharge is more likely to be optimized or within target range if uptitration is pursued more aggressively. This is an important finding given the concerns that efficacy of this medication class in heart failure patients is closely linked to dosing and that suboptimal dosing has been demonstrated to be a clinical problem in several guideline adherence studies of heart failure in adults.<xref rid="jah31408-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">22</xref>, <xref rid="jah31408-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">23</xref>
</p><sec id="jah31408-sec-0034"><title>Limitations</title><p>The barriers to conducting randomized clinical trials of cardiovascular drugs in children are well documented,<xref rid="jah31408-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">25</xref>, <xref rid="jah31408-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">26</xref> and in conducting this study, we encountered similar limitations. Most important, the number of subjects included in our study was small. While we calculated that 50 patients would be sufficient to detect a difference between the protocols with regard to the discharge dose of ACEIs, it is possible the study could be underpowered to detect differences in the number of adverse effects between the groups. For example, there were more episodes of symptomatic hypotension within 2&#x000a0;hours of the captopril dose in the rapid uptitration arm than in the prolonged arm, and perhaps if the study were larger this result may have reached statistical significance. Although seemingly sufficient to investigate our primary hypotheses, the limited size of this study also prevented detailed subgroup analysis, and we are unable to determine whether there was an interaction between subject age, sex, or race and the favorability of either the rapid or the delayed uptitration protocol.</p><p>While there are studies of the pharmacokinetics of ACEIs in children and of their antihypertensive effects,<xref rid="jah31408-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">24</xref>, <xref rid="jah31408-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">27</xref>, <xref rid="jah31408-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">28</xref>, <xref rid="jah31408-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">29</xref> little is known about how these features relate to the efficacy of treatment for pediatric heart failure, which in this study was the primary indication for ACEIs. Our definitions of &#x0201c;target&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;optimal&#x0201d; doses of ACEIs for pediatric patients were largely based on extrapolation from adult guidelines and on the consensus of physicians in our institution, so to some extent we were studying uptitration in an unverified dosing range. It is also important to highlight that this study did not evaluate the clinical or biochemical efficacy of ACEIs in children with heart disease.</p></sec></sec><sec id="jah31408-sec-0035"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We conclude that uptitration of ACEIs in cardiac inpatients can be rapidly achieved and that undue delays do not significantly alter the potential risks of ACEI introduction. We also conclude that an optimal outpatient dose of ACEI is more likely to be achieved through rapid protocolled uptitration. Further study will be required to determine if these advantages translate into important clinical benefits for pediatric cardiac patients.</p></sec><sec id="jah31408-sec-0037"><title>Sources of Funding</title><p>This study was funded primarily by internal funds from The Research and Education Fund, Department of Pharmacy, and The Labatt Family Heart Center and The Research Support Pharmacy at The Hospital for Sick Children Toronto.
