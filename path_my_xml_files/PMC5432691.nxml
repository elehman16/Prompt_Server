Inflammatory stimulation can cause the fallopian tube wall stiffness, peripheral tissue adhesion and lumen obstruction, so that it is difficult to pick up the ovum and delivery the sperm, and thus inducing the secondary infertility.<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p><p>At present, in order to adjust the population policy in China, the full liberalization of the second child policy was formally implemented in January 1st 2016, which means that a couple can give birth to two babies. The multipara has strong desires of childbearing again. How to effectively recanalize the obstructed fallopian tube becomes an important clinical problem for the pregnancy again. The fallopian tube interventional recanalization is an effective operation for treating the fallopian tube obstruction.<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>-<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> However, the obstruction easily recurs. At present, the ozone has been applied in the treatment of gynecological infectious diseases at home and abroad for decades.

The anterior lip cervix was clamped. The 10F guide tube with gasbag (Cook, Bloomington, Ind, USA) was inserted into the anterior end into the uterine cavity through the cervix. The guide tube was fixed and the air bag was expanded. The 5F guide tube was selectively inserted into the interstitial fallopian tube and the salpingography was performed, so as to determine the occlusion site. The micro guide wire and micro guide tube were replaced, gently moved back and forth in the obstructed fallopian tube, so as to dredge the lumen. Meanwhile the liquid was used to fill the lumen. The operation should be step by step and gradually push inside until the obstruction in fallopian tube was removed. The second salpingography confirmed the lumen was unobstructed. The affected fallopian tube was treated with the conventional hydrotubation, so as to eliminate the inflammation and avoid the re-adhesion.

The common causes include pelvic, vaginal and peripheral organ inflammation. If the above inflammations are not controlled in time, the upward diffusion will appear, involving the fallopian tubes, resulting in fallopian tube mucosal swelling, vasodilatation and congestion, fibrin exudation, adhesion with surrounding tissues,<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>-<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> leading to tubal obstruction and infertility. In addition, feculent sexual intercourse, sexual intercourse during menstruation, long-term vaginal bleeding, abdominal surgery and long-term sitting can cause the fallopian tube occlusion.</p><p>Fallopian tube interventional recanalization is effective for the recanalization of the lumen, which has good curative effect for isthmus or interstitial occlusion.<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> This surgery has many advantages, including less injury, safe operation and quick recovery. It has replaced the traditional laparotomy and has been widely used in clinical practice. The shortcoming is the radiation hazards of X-ray. The patients accept a small amount of radiation. Considering better prenatal and postnatal care, the sexual intercourse should be performed after the postoperative 2-3 menstrual cycles. However a considerable number of patients still appeared to the postoperative re-occlusion, which affects the efficacy of surgery. The reason for re-occlusion may be as follows: (1) after adhesiolysis, the wound surface occurs to inflammatory exudation; (2) the fallopian tube is scratched by technical reasons; (3) the intraoperative conventional drug perfusion only has the transient anti-inflammatory and anti-adhesion effects.<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> The efficacy is not sustained.</p><p>Ozone is non-toxic and innocuous. It can efficiently sterilize and treat various diseases, which is widely applied in the whole world.<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>-<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Moreover, the ozone has strong oxidizing ability, can inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, antagonize the release of inflammatory factors, reduce the local edema exudation and tissue hypoxia, improve the local cycle through inducing the overexpression of antioxidant enzymes. The above effects can promote the wound repair of the fallopian tube, and then reduce the obstruction again.<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> The results showed that compared with the conventional gentamicin, glucocorticoid drug and other perfusion drugs, although the recanalization success rates showed no significant difference between the two groups, the postoperative pregnancy rate after ozone perfusion showed significant advantages. Postoperative follow-up data showed that the recurrence rate of the ozone therapy was lower, showing that the ozone perfusion was helpful to decrease the postoperative adhesion and improve the pregnancy rate.</p><p>The evaluation of postoperative discomfort symptoms showed some patients appeared to have fever, abdominal pain and other symptoms in the two groups. However, the fallopian tube perforation and other severe injuries did not appear. The above symptoms disappeared after being positively treated.</p><p>In short, fallopian tube obstruction is one of the main causes of infertility. The ozone perfusion was performed in the multipara with fallopian tube obstruction in this study. The results showed that ozone was helpful to improve the postoperative pregnancy rate and reduce the re-occlusion. Ozone not only has the characteristics of no drug resistance and low cost, but also has no obvious adverse reaction in the perioperative period and better therapeutic safety. Combined with the above advantages, it is worth popularizing in the clinical treatment of fallopian tube obstruction in the multipara.</p><sec id="sec2-10"><title>Authors&#x02019;
