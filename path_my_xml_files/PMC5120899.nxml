The global burden of T2DM in 2013 was estimated to be approximately 548 billion USD.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> Atherosclerotic disease is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality.<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup> Previous studies have shown that T2DM is a major risk factor for atherosclerosis, and that T2DM accelerates the progression of atherosclerosis.<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> The identification of atherosclerosis at subclinical stages would facilitate early intervention, leading to improved prognoses.</p><p>Previous studies have also shown that T2DM is a major risk factor for metabolic syndrome (MetS), which is characterized by insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and obesity.<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup> The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey reported that the prevalence of MetS in the United States was approximately 34% between 1988 and 1994.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> The prevalence of MetS has been shown to increase with increasing age,<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> and the interaction between the components of MetS has been shown to contribute to the development of atherosclerosis.<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> Various strategies are currently employed to treat T2DM, including lifestyle modifications and medical interventions. However, relatively few trials have investigated the effects of long-term pharmacological treatment for subclinical atherosclerosis and MetS in T2DM patients. In addition, relatively few studies of subclinical atherosclerosis and MetS have been reported for Asian populations, for whom diet and lifestyle risk factors can differ significantly from those of their Western counterparts.</p><p>We performed a randomized, controlled study comparing the efficacy of intensive medical therapy and that of conventional treatment regimens for slowing the development and progression of subclinical atherosclerosis and improving hyperglycemia, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and albuminuria in Chinese T2DM patients. Our findings provide valuable clinical evidence relevant to the development of more effective early intervention strategies for atherosclerosis and MetS-related complications in Chinese T2DM patients.</p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Participants and methods</title><sec><label>2.1</label><title>Participants</title><p>We enrolled 316 patients who had received a diagnosis of T2DM at the Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University (Changsha, China) between January 3 and October 31, 2002.

When hyperglycemia occurred, obese and nonobese patients were first treated with metformin or glipizide, respectively, combined with additional glucose-lowering drugs in some cases. Insulin therapy was prescribed for cases in which metformin or glipizide was ineffective. When hypertension occurred, patients were first treated with captopril or valsartan combined with extended-release nifedipine or other antihypertensive drugs in some cases. When TC or TG levels exceeded the target concentrations, patients were treated with simvastatin or fenofibrate. When albuminuria occurred, patients were treated with captopril or valsartan. Patients also received dietary advice and exercise instructions to assist them in maintaining a near-normal bodyweight.</p><p>Patients in the conventional treatment group were treated in the outpatient clinic, and received conventional pharmacological therapy. They underwent a follow-up examination every 3 months from March 2002 to December 2014. Their FPG, 2hPG, BP, body weight, heart rate, and pulse rate at the dorsal artery of the foot were measured every 3 months, and their TC, TG, HDL-C, LDL-C, and HbA1c were measured every 6 months. Once yearly, their UAlb, CR, FINS, height, WC, and HC were measured, and they underwent vascular ultrasound to assess the thickness of the intima-media (IMT) of the CCA, FA, and CIA.

However, the incidence of subclinical atherosclerosis in the conventional treatment group was higher than that in the intensive medical therapy group at the 6-year follow-up examination.</p><p>Age, CR, and CIA-IMT were identified as significant risk factors for atherosclerosis in both groups, which is consistent with the findings of previous studies.<sup>[<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup> We also found that the IMT of the CCA, FA, and CIA of patients in the intensive medical therapy group were significantly lower after 6 years of treatment than those in the conventional treatment group. However, the IMTs did not differ significantly between the 2 groups at the end of the study period. These results showed that intensive medical therapy reduced the incidence of subclinical atherosclerosis from 2006 to 2010 only, but the Kaplan&#x02013;Meier analysis of the data showed that intensive medical therapy significantly reduced the overall risk of subclinical atherosclerosis, compared with that in the conventional treatment group, suggesting that different treatment strategies might be needed to reduce atherosclerotic deposition in Chinese T2DM patients after 6 years of intensive medical therapy.</p><p>Our findings are also consistent with those of previous studies, which showed that the carotid artery IMT increased progressively in T2DM patients treated with metformin for 24 weeks,<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> and that it did not differ significantly between the patients treated with metformin for 18 months and those who received the placebo treatment.<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> The long-term effect of metformin treatment on the risk of cardiovascular disease remains largely unclear.<sup>[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup> In addition, a previous study showed that, although treatment with valsartan for 24 months did not influence CCA-IMT, it did improve vascular wall function in patients with essential hypertension.<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup></p><p>The development of subclinical atherosclerosis has also been reported in patients who had been treated with simvastatin.<sup>[<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup> Fenofibrate has been shown to inhibit the progression of carotid IMT in people with essential hypertension and mild hyperlipidemia,<sup>[<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup> but did not significantly inhibit the progression of carotid IMT in T2DM patients.<sup>[<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</sup> A limited number of studies have investigated the role of glipizide and captopril in preventing subclinical atherosclerosis. In general, the use of these drugs alone is ineffective for preventing subclinical atherosclerosis. However, our results showed that the use of these drugs in combination reduced the risk of subclinical atherosclerosis in Chinese T2DM patients.</p><p>We also explored the effect of intensive medical therapy on indicators of MetS, and found that the HOMA-IR index, GFR, albuminuria, and CR decreased in both groups over the 12-year follow-up, suggesting that both therapies were effective for reducing markers of MetS in T2DM patients. The proportion of patients with albuminuria in the intensive medical therapy group was significantly lower in 2003 than that of the conventional treatment group. These results suggest that intensive medical therapy is more effective for maintaining renal function in Chinese T2DM patients, compared with the effects of the conventional treatment.</p><p>We also evaluated the effectiveness of intensive medical therapy for the management of MetS, compared to that of the conventional treatment regimen. The success rate for the intensive medical therapy group was significantly lower than that of the conventional treatment group from 2006 to 2012. However, the success rate in the intensive medical therapy group did not differ significantly from that of conventional treatment group in the latter years of the follow-up period, and a Kaplan&#x02013;Meier analysis did not show a significant difference in MetS risk between the treatment groups. Studies in both animals and humans have suggested that treatment with metformin,<sup>[<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</sup> captopril,<sup>[<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</sup> valsartan,<sup>[<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]</sup> simvastatin,<sup>[<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]</sup> or fenofibrate <sup>[<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]</sup> alone reduced the development of MetS, which is largely consistent with our findings. Because MetS increases the risk of cardiovascular disease,<sup>[<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]</sup> it seems unlikely that improvements in MetS indicators contributed to a lower risk of subclinical atherosclerosis in the intensive medical therapy group, compared with that in the conventional treatment group.</p><p>The average age of the intensive medical therapy and conventional treatment groups (66 and 65 years at baseline, respectively) may have confounded our results because the risks of MetS and subclinical atherosclerosis have both been shown to increase with increasing age,<sup>[<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]</sup> which might have contributed to the lack of a significant difference in incidence rates between the treatment groups in the latter years of the follow-up period. Although all patients were reimbursed for drug costs, the greater initial economic burden for the conventional treatment group may have contributed to a higher drop-out rate. The significantly greater percentages of smokers, alcohol users, and patients with a family history of MetS and higher levels of FPG, 2-hPG, and LDL in the conventional treatment group at the end of the study period, compared to those in the intensive medical therapy group in 2014, might have also influenced our results. However, these differences would seem more likely to contribute to a greater difference between the treatment groups, which was not the case for our analysis.</p><p>Although we are unaware of other investigations that have compared the effects of intensive medical therapy and conventional pharmacological treatment on both subclinical atherosclerosis and MetS in T2DM patients in China, the relatively small size of our study population warrants confirmation our findings in a larger cohort of T2DM patients in China. Previous studies have investigated factors contributing to the development of subclinical atherosclerosis and MetS in Chinese Americans.<sup>[<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]</sup> However, diet and environmental factors for Chinese people in the United States differ from those of residents of mainland China.<sup>[<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]</sup> Furthermore, variation occurs between different methods of measuring atherosclerotic deposition. Therefore, the use of flow-mediated vasodilatation, arterial stiffness, or the ankle-brachial index for assessing atherosclerotic plaque deposition in future studies is also warranted.</p><p>In conclusion, we found that, although Chinese T2DM patients with subclinical atherosclerosis and MetS remained at a high risk for developing more severe atherosclerotic disease after 12 years of intensive medical therapy, the progression of subclinical atherosclerosis and MetS indicators were reduced in Chinese T2DM patients during the first 6 years of intensive medical therapy, compared with those of patients receiving conventional treatment. Our findings provide important clinical data for the improvement of strategies for the prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis and MetS in Chinese T2DM patients.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: 2hPG = The 2-h postprandial plasma glucose level, ACR = albumin to creatinine ratio, ALT = Alanine aminotransaminase, BMI = body-mass index, BP = blood pressure, BUN = Blood urea nitrogen, CCA = common carotid artery, CI = confidence interval, CIA = common iliac artery, CR = urinary creatinine, DBP = diastolic BP, FA = femoral artery, FINS = Fasting plasma insulin, FPG = overnight fasting plasma glucose level, GFR = Glomerular filtration rate, HbA1c = Glycated hemoglobin, HC = hip circumference, HDL-C = high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, HOMA-IR = homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, HR = hazard ratio, IMT = intima-media thickness, LDL-C = low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, MetS = metabolic syndrome, SBP = systolic BP, T2DM = type 2 diabetes mellitus, TBil = total bilirubin, TC = Total cholesterol, TG = triglyceride, UAER = urinary albumin excretion rate, UAlb = urinary albumin, WC = waist circumference.</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The authors declare no conflict of interest with regard to the publication of this research report.</p></fn><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p>This study was supported by grants from the Fifteen National Science and Technology Tackling Key Problems Project (grant nos. 2001BA702B01 and 2001BA702B04) and the Eleventh National Five-Year Technology Support Program (grant no. 2006BA102B08).</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Danaei</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Finucane</surname><given-names>MM</given-names></name><name><surname>Lu</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name><etal/></person-group>
