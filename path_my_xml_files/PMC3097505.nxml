Valzan<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> tablets were prepared according to a dry granulation method (roll compaction). To assess the bioequivalence of Valzan<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> tablets a randomized, two-way, crossover, bioequivalence study was performed in 24 healthy male volunteers. The selected volunteers were divided into two groups of 12 subjects. One group was treated with the reference formulation (Diovan<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) and the other one with the generic Valzan<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, with a cross-over after the drug washout period of 14 days. Blood samples were collected at fixed time intervals and valsartan concentrations were determined by a validated HPLC assay method. The pharmacokinetic parameters AUC<sub>0&#x02013;48</sub>, AUC<sub>0&#x02013;&#x0221e;</sub>, C<sub>max</sub>, T<sub>max</sub>, K<sub>e</sub> and T<sub>1/2</sub> were determined for both the tablets and were compared statistically to evaluate the bioequivalence between the two brands of valsartan, using the statistical model recommended by the FDA. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) did not show any significant difference between the two formulations and 90% confidence intervals (CI) fell within the acceptable range for bioequivalence. Based on this statistical evaluation it was concluded that the test tablets (Valzan<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) is well formulated, since it exhibits pharmacokinetic profile comparable to the reference brand Diovan<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Valsartan</kwd><kwd>Formulation</kwd><kwd>Bioequivalence</kwd><kwd>Immediate Release</kwd><kwd>HPLC</kwd><kwd>Diovan<sup>&#x000ae;</sup></kwd><kwd>Valzan<sup>&#x000ae;</sup></kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Valsartan is chemically <italic>N</italic>-pentanoyl-<italic>N</italic>-{[2&#x02032;-(1<italic>H</italic>-tetrazol-5-yl)biphenyl-4-yl]methyl}-L-valine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-scipharm_2011_79_123">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>Valsartan is a nonpeptide, orally active and specific angiotensin II antagonist acting on the AT<sub>1</sub> receptor subtype present in many tissues, such as vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland [<xref rid="b1-scipharm_2011_79_123" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].

The broad peak from 1.5&#x02013;2.3 min is related to plasma components that their concentration may be influenced by the presence of valsartan [<xref rid="b10-scipharm_2011_79_123" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].

The accuracy of the method was proven since the intra-day accuracy was in the range from 99 to 111% and the inter-day accuracy was in the range of 98.52 to 106% during the entire range of the calibration curves.</p><p>The results of stability of the drug at room temperature and in frozen plasma showed that valsartan is stable. In fact, the difference in the drug concentrations in the two analyses was always less than 10%. There was no trend in the changes in the drug concentration when the samples were kept at room temperature for 24 h, indicating the stability of valsartan in the plasma samples at room temperature. In frozen plasma, the difference in the drug concentration in all samples in the two analyses was always less than 10% in each sample. There was no trend in the change in the drug concentration in frozen plasma stored at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C during the study period, indicating the stability of valsartan in frozen plasma.</p><p>The limit of quantification of valsartan in this assay was 0.01 &#x003bc;g/mL.

Most of these methods employ a liquid extraction procedure with protein precipitation (mostly with methanol), reversed-phase C<sub>18</sub> column separation followed by fluorometric [<xref rid="b11-scipharm_2011_79_123" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b15-scipharm_2011_79_123" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] or ultraviolet detection [<xref rid="b16-scipharm_2011_79_123" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="b17-scipharm_2011_79_123" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Likewise, the method described in this report uses a liquid extraction step followed by fluorescence detection. Our method provides results comparable to those obtained using flurometric detection and superior to those utilizing UV detection. However, our method possesses a number of advantages. With the chromatographic conditions described, it was possible to completely resolve valsartan and the internal standard (etodolac) peaks within 7 min. The quantitative range of the assay (0.01&#x02013;1 &#x003bc;g/mL) is comparable to that obtained by Daneshtalab <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref rid="b11-scipharm_2011_79_123" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] without the additional time required for the back-extraction step used by the authors. The method allows accurate quantification of valsartan concentrations that are expected after regular dose administration. Overall, our method provides a rapid, sensitive, and economically-convenient procedure for the analysis of valsartan in human plasma samples encountered in pharmacokinetics studies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods|results"><title>Results of pharmacokinetic study</title><p>The alternative HPLC-fluorescence method described and used here for valsartan quantification provides adequate sensitivity and high sample throughput required for pharmacokinetic studies.

AUC<sub>0&#x02013;&#x0221e;</sub>, C<sub>max</sub> and T<sub>max</sub> values were statistically analyzed for determination of bioequivalence of this generic product. Other pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., T<sub>1/2</sub> and K<sub>e</sub>) results were used as supporting results in this pharmacokinetic design. This study was conducted on healthy volunteers according to the study protocol. All subjects received the same dosages of medication, i.e one single dose of test formulation in the form of the test product or one single dose of reference in the form of the reference product with a 14 days washout period. No adverse events necessitating subject withdrawal from the study were reported. Statistical comparison of the main pharmacokinetic parameters, AUC<sub>0&#x02013;48</sub>, AUC<sub>0&#x02013;&#x0221e;</sub>, C<sub>max</sub> and T<sub>max</sub> clearly indicated no significant difference between test and reference 160mg/tablet, in any of the calculated pharmacokinetic parameters. The obtained values were in good agreement with the FDA requirements for bioequivalence of generic drugs [<xref rid="b20-scipharm_2011_79_123" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Since the AUC<sub>0-&#x0221e;</sub> and C<sub>max</sub> mean ratios are within the 80%&#x02013;125% interval, it was concluded that the tested Valzan<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> tablet (160 mg valsartan) elaborated by Pharmacare, Palestine, is bioequivalent for both extent and rate of absorption to the commercial Diovan<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> tablet (160mg valsartan) manufactured by Novartis Pharma AG, Basile, Switzerland/Suiza.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The validated HPLC method employed here proved to be simple, fast, reliable, selective and sensitive enough to be used in clinical pharmacokinetic studies of valsartan in humans. The statistical analysis of the results of AUC<sub>0&#x02013;48</sub>, AUC<sub>0&#x02013;&#x0221e;</sub> and C<sub>max</sub> using the ANOVA method showed that both test immediate release tablet Valzan<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (160 mg valsartan, Pharmacare) and reference immediate release tablet Diovan<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (160 mg valsartan, Novartis) are bioequivalent, since they deliver equivalent amounts of valsartan to the systemic circulation at equivalent rates for both AUC<sub>0&#x02013;48h</sub> and C<sub>max</sub> ratios within the 80&#x02013;125% interval proposed by Food and Drug Administration [<xref rid="b20-scipharm_2011_79_123" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. These results demonstrate that the formulation of this new generic tablet is good, an essential condition not only to achieve good therapeutic benefits but also to avoid any adverse effect due to bad formulation.

The volunteers were not on concomitant medications and they were free from significant cardiac, hepatic, renal, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, neurological or hematological disease as determined within four weeks prior to the beginning of the study by way of medical histories and physical examinations. Subject&#x02019;s health status was determined following a physical examination, laboratory tests and medical history by a qualified registered MD physician. The physician reviewed all preclinical laboratory tests for each subject. Tests included the following: (i) physical examination: height, weight, blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature and respiratory rate; (ii) blood chemistry: glucose, uric acid, BUN, creatinine AST, ALT, cholesterol and triglycerides; (iii) hematological tests: hemoglobin, hematocrit, ESR, WBCs with differential, RBCs with platelets count and morphology, lymphocytes, MCV, MCH, monocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, HIV and Hepatitis B screen; (iv) urine analysis: specific gravity, pH and microscopic examination. These clinical tests were performed in order to determine if they fitted with the participation in the study. Exclusion criteria included extreme weight ranges (overweight or underweight), anemia, liver or renal dysfunction, parasitic and other diseases or conditions that was judged to affect the absorption, distribution and/or elimination of valsartan. All volunteers were given a written informed consent, which explained the nature of the study. All volunteers were interested and willing to participate in the study. The subjects were asked to abstain from taking drugs and alcohol for at least 3 days prior to the study and throughout the study period. On the night before starting the study, the volunteers were instructed to fast for at least 10 h before drug administration. The study had an open randomized two-period crossover design with a 14-day washout period between doses. The volunteers were arbitrarily divided into two equal groups each of 12 subjects. To the first group the reference formulation was given and to the second group the test formulation was given with a crossover after a washout period of two weeks. On the morning of the experiment, a blood sample was withdrawn from each volunteer to serve as a blank for the drug assay. Each of the 24 volunteers then took one Valzan<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 160 mg per tablet as the test drug, or one Diovan<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>160 mg per tablet as the reference drug followed by 240 ml of water. Blood samples for plasma drug assay were collected from an indwelling catheter inserted in the antecubital vein of one of the arms.

After evaporation of the methanolic solution, 0.25 mL of blank plasma was added to each tube to form a set of calibration standards with concentrations of 10, 5, 2, 1, 0.5, 0.2, 0.1, 0.05, 0.02, 0.01 &#x003bc;g/ mL.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample preparations for HPLC injection</title><p>25 &#x003bc;L of each study sample was transferred to a clean test tube. The study samples were treated as the calibration standards after addition of the internal standard.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Validation Procedures</title><p>The validation of this chromatographic analytical method was performed in order to evaluate its linearity, selectivity, stability, precision and accuracy.</p><p>Calibration curves were constructed from the peak area ratio (drug/ internal standard) and the corresponding valsartan concentration in each calibration standard. The linearity study was carried out in the concentration range of 0.01 to 10 &#x003bc;g/mL. To assess linearity, drug free plasma was spiked with known amounts of the drug to achieve the concentration of 0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0, and 10 &#x003bc;g/mL.</p><p>Precision was determined as the coefficient of variation (%CV), and the accuracy as the percentage relative error (RE) of a series of measurements. Precision and accuracy data were obtained by analyzing aliquots of three spiked plasma samples at low middle and high concentration levels of valsartan. Intra-day reproducibility was determined by analyzing three replicates of calibration curves on the same day, and inter-day reproducibility was evaluated by the analysis of six different calibration curves on six different days during the study period.</p><p>The stability of the drug at room temperature was determined by preparing three different plasma samples for each drug concentration and then injecting the samples immediately into the HPLC system. The samples were kept at room temperature and were injected again after 24 h. The concentrations measured at time zero and after 24 h were compared to determine whether there were changes in the concentrations with time.</p><p>The stability of the drug in frozen plasma was investigated by the analysis of the study samples obtained from three volunteers twice. The first analysis was performed at the beginning of the study and the second analysis was performed at the end of the study. The samples were stored at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C between the analyses. The low limit of quantification (LLOQ) is defined as the lowest concentration of analyte that can be determined with acceptable precision and accuracy under the stated experimental conditions. The LLOQ was estimated by analyzing samples with known amounts of valsartan, at progressively lower concentrations, starting at the lower end of the calibration curves. The performance of the assay during the analysis of the study samples was evaluated by the analysis of the quality control (QC) samples. The QC samples were prepared by spiking blank plasma with valsartan before the beginning of the study sample analysis. The QC samples were prepared to have low, medium and high valsartan concentrations (0.05, 1.0 and 5.0 &#x003bc;g/mL). Three QC samples were incorporated with each analysis run and were treated as unknown samples. The concentration in each QC sample was determined from the calibration curve and the calculated concentration was compared with the nominal concentration. The analysis run was accepted if at least 2 out of 3 QC samples were within 20% of nominal concentration [<xref rid="b24-scipharm_2011_79_123" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>An incurred sample reanalysis (ISR) was performed on 72 sample from all study subjects. Three sample points for each study period were selected and reanalyzed to test the reproducibility of the assay [<xref rid="b25-scipharm_2011_79_123" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Pharmacokinetic and statistical analysis</title><p>The maximum valsartan plasma concentration (C<sub>max</sub>) and the corresponding time of peak plasma concentration (T<sub>max</sub>) were taken directly from the slope of the semi-logarithmic plot of the terminal phase of the plasma concentration-time curve calculated by linear regression. The elimination half&#x02013;life (T<sub>1/2</sub>) was derived by dividing ln<sub>2</sub> by the elimination rate constant Ke. The areas under the valsartan plasma concentrations time curves from (AUC<sub>0&#x02013;48</sub>) and the area to the infinity (AUC<sub>0&#x02013;&#x0221e;</sub>) were calculated by using the linear trapezoidal method. Extrapolation to the infinity was done by adding the value Ct/Ke to the calculated AUC<sub>0&#x02013;48</sub> (where Ct is the last detectable concentration of valsartan). For the purpose of bioequivalence analysis, one way analysis of variance (ANOVA procedure) was used to assess the effect of formulations, periods, sequences and subjects on AUC<sub>0&#x02013;48</sub>, AUC<sub>0&#x02013;&#x0221e;</sub>, and C<sub>max</sub>.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>Special Acknowledgments to Pharmaceutical Services Center, University of Tanta, College of Pharmacy, Tanta, Egypt who make this work possible through his special scientific efforts.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p>This article is available from: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.3797/scipharm.1009-01">http://dx.doi.org/10.3797/scipharm.1009-01</ext-link></p></fn></fn-group><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; Statements</title><sec><title>Competing Interests</title><p>The authors declare no conflict of interest.</p></sec><sec><title>Informed Consent &#x00026; Ethical Approvals</title><p>The institutional and (inter)national ethical guides for experiments on human subjects were followed and informed consent was obtained.
