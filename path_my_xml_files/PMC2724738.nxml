<article-title>The Effect of Alternative Graphical Displays Used to Present the Benefits of Antibiotics for Sore Throat on Decisions about Whether to Seek Treatment: A Randomized Trial</article-title>
</related-article><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>Carling and colleagues carry out a trial evaluating different methods of communicating information to people regarding the risks and benefits of taking statins.

We calculated a relative importance score (RIS) by subtracting the VAS scores for the downsides of taking statins from the VAS score for CHD. We used logistic regression to determine the association between participants' RIS and their choice. 2,978 participants completed the study. Relative risk reduction resulted in a 21&#x00025; higher probability of choosing to take statins over all values of RIS compared to the absolute summary statistics. This corresponds to a number needed to treat (NNT) of 5; i.e., for every five participants shown the relative risk reduction one additional participant chose to take statins, compared to the other summary statistics. There were no significant differences among the absolute summary statistics in the association between RIS and participants' decisions whether to take statins.

</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="editor"><title>Editors' Summary</title><sec id="s5a1"><title>Background</title><p>People often have to make decisions about their health care. Ideally, all the health care decisions that a person makes should be those best suited to his or her personal circumstances and expectations. Take, for example, someone with a high amount of cholesterol (a type of fat) in his or her blood. Because this condition increases the chances of developing potentially fatal coronary heart disease (CHD), such a person will often be advised by his or her doctor to take statins to reduce blood cholesterol levels. However, the person needs to consider both the benefits and downsides of this course of action. Can he or she afford to pay for statins, if their health care system requires him or her to? Does the person want to take a pill every day that might cause some side effects? That is, the person has to consider his or her &#x0201c;values&#x0201d;&#x02014;the relative desirability of all the possible outcomes of taking statins&#x02014;before deciding whether to follow his or her doctor's advice.</p></sec><sec id="s5a2"><title>Why Was This Study Done?</title><p>It is well known that how information is presented to patients about treatment options and their consequences affects the choices that they make. For example, patients who are told that a drug will halve their chances of developing a disease (a 50&#x00025; relative risk reduction) are more likely to decide to take that drug than those who are told it will reduce their absolute (actual) risk of developing the disease from 4&#x00025; to 2&#x00025;. Less is known, however, about which presentations of treatment effects best help people to make decisions that are consistent with their own values. In 2002, therefore, a series of internet-based randomized trials (studies in which participants are randomly allocated to different &#x0201c;treatment&#x0201d; groups) called the Health Information Project: Presentation Online (HIPPO) was initiated. Here, the researchers describe HIPPO 2, a trial that investigates how alternative summary statistics for communicating the reduction of CHD risk with statins affect people's decisions to take statins.</p></sec><sec id="s5a3"><title>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</title><p>Nearly 3,000 adults in Norway and North America rated the relative importance to them of CHD risk reduction, the cost of statins, and the need to take a daily pill through an interactive Web site. The researchers used these data to calculate a &#x0201c;relative importance score&#x0201d; (RIS), an indicator of each participant's values. Each participant then decided whether or not to take statins after being shown one of six summary statistics about the effect of statins on CHD risk (relative risk reduction and five indicators of absolute risk reduction). The presentation of the effect of statins as a relative risk reduction resulted in more people deciding to take statins over the whole RIS range than any of the absolute summary statistics. For every five participants shown the relative risk reduction statistic, an extra participant chose to take statins compared to the other summary statistics. When asked to compare the six summary statistics, the statistic that most people preferred and understood best was the &#x0201c;natural frequency,&#x0201d; an absolute summary statistic that gave the number of people likely to develop CHD with and without statin treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s5a4"><title>What Do These Findings Mean?</title><p>Although these findings may not be generalizable to other populations or to other medical decisions, they provide new insights into how the presentation of information can affect the choices people make about health care. Specifically, these findings indicate that the presentation of the reduced risk of getting CHD as a result of taking stains as a relative amount is more likely to persuade people to take statins than several absolute summary statistics. They also suggest that the persuasive effect of the relative risk reduction summary statistic is not affected by the relative importance attached to the consequences of taking statins by individuals. That is, people shown the relative risk reduction statistic may be more likely to start statins to reduce their CHD risk (or a drug that reduces the risk of developing another disease) whatever their personal values than people shown absolute summary statistics. Finally, the findings on participant preferences suggest that natural frequencies may be the best summary statistic to include in tools designed to help people make decisions about their healthcare.</p></sec><sec id="s5a5"><title>Additional Information</title><p>Please access these Web sites via the online version of this summary at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1000134">http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1000134</ext-link>.</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>A <italic>PLoS Medicine</italic>

In studies to find a minimally important difference, ARR produced 20&#x00025; larger differences in the medians than NNT (25&#x00025; versus 5&#x00025;). The same review found that presenting the percentage of people experiencing outcomes with and without treatment resulted in more accurate perceptions than RRR when baseline risk was also provided. Others have advocated summary measures that have been less well studied, such as the tablets needed to take (TNT) <xref rid="pmed.1000134-Skolbekken1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> and &#x0201c;natural frequencies&#x0201d; (NF), i.e., raw observations that have not been transformed into percentages.

Hollnagel proposed a similar summary statistic, referred to as whole numbers <xref rid="pmed.1000134-Hollnagel1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p><p>There is a large literature that addresses how different presentations, including positive versus negative framing, different summary statistics, and different formats (numeric, verbal, or graphical) influence understanding, perceptions, and decisions; and how information about risk is used in decisions <xref rid="pmed.1000134-McGettigan1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pmed.1000134-Trevena1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. However, to our knowledge, there are no studies investigating the relationship between the summary statistic used and the extent to which decisions are consistent with individuals' values, apart from our pilot study <xref rid="pmed.1000134-Carling1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.</p><p>Thus, we designed this study to assess the extent to which the use of different summary statistics affects choices about using statins to reduce the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). We chose this decision because it is common, important, familiar to many, and because high-quality evidence is available about the benefits and downsides of statins <xref rid="pmed.1000134-Ebrahim1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. It is a &#x0201c;preference sensitive&#x0201d; decision that is affected by patients' values <xref rid="pmed.1000134-OConnor2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Thus, among people with the same hypothetical or real risk of CHD, one would expect some degree of correlation between how important the desirable and undesirable consequences of taking statins are to them and the likelihood that they would decide to take statins. In other words, one would expect that people for whom the benefits of taking statins were less important and the downsides more important would be less likely, on average, to decide to take them than people for whom the benefits were more important and the downsides were less important.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study Design</title><p>The CONSORT checklist and the protocol for this study are available as supporting information; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1000134.s001">Text S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1000134.s002">S2</xref>.</p><p>This study was an Internet-based randomized trial (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1000134.s003">Text S3</xref>) in which participants were randomized to one of six summary statistics presenting information about CHD risk reduction associated with statin use (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1000134.s004">Text S4</xref>).

The model was also explored by including numeracy and salience as covariates.</p><p>We used the model without covariates to test the three hypotheses based on the results of our pilot study <xref rid="pmed.1000134-Carling1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> by (1) comparing the log odds of RRR to the log odds of the pooled absolute summary statistics for the RIS value at which the predicted log odds was zero (i.e. odds&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1) for the pooled summary statistics; (2) comparing the slope of the log odds of ARR to the slope of the pooled absolute summary statistics (excluding ARR), and (3) comparing the slope for the ER group to zero and testing for a difference in slope between ER and the slope of the pooled summary statistics excluding ER. Thus, we used a Bonferroni correction for four comparisons to adjust the confidence intervals for these analyses corresponding to an overall significance level of 0.05 (i.e. 0.05/4&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.0125) although the sample size estimates were based on three comparisons.</p><p>We performed additional comparisons for the difference in log odds at the median, 1st, and 3rd quartile values for RIS, and we compared the slope for the ER group to the slope for the pooled absolute summary statistics group (excluding ER) We did not adjust the 95&#x00025; CIs or <italic>p</italic>-values for these or other comparisons. They should be interpreted with caution due to multiple testing since no assessment of their power was made in the protocol.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Sample Size</title><p>Using data from the pilot study, we estimated we would need about 750 to 800 participants per group to achieve 80&#x00025; power to test each one of the three hypotheses at 0.0167 alpha level (after applying a Bonferroni correction).</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Ethics</title><p>The protocol was reviewed and approved by the ethics committee of the University at Buffalo Medical School, Buffalo, New York. Participants gave informed consent via the Web site interface, having been given information about the study and told that they could quit at any time and request that their data be deleted. Contact information that some participants supplied in order to request the study results or to participate in the lottery was stored in a separate database that was not linkable with study data.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>The study recruited 2,978 eligible participants between June 2003 and July 2005 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pmed-1000134-t001">Table 1</xref>). We decided to stop recruitment prior to achieving the intended sample size after multiple efforts to encourage participation over two years. We did not look at the results prior to deciding to stop the study. The six groups were similar, with respect to sex, age, years of education, salience of the scenario, and their elicited values. Most respondents were from USA (42&#x00025;) and Norway (26&#x00025;). Seventy-three percent of the participants chose the English language version of the Web site. Numeracy varied across the six groups from 65&#x00025; that answered both questions correctly in the RRR group to 75&#x00025; in the TNT and NF groups.</p><table-wrap id="pmed-1000134-t001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pmed.1000134.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Participant characteristics.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pmed-1000134-t001-1" xlink:href="pmed.1000134.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Category</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Subcategory</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">RRR</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ARR</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">NNT</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ER</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">TNT</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">NF</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Overall</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">

We did not find important differences in the relationship between decisions and values among the five absolute summary statistics we tested. However, natural frequencies may be preferable, based on self-reported preference, understanding and satisfaction with the information, and confidence in decision. This result supports the advice of others that natural frequencies should be the preferred summary statistic for decision aids and other risk communication tools <xref rid="pmed.1000134-Gigerenzer1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pmed.1000134-OConnor1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1000134.s001"><label>Text S1</label><caption><p>CONSORT checklist.</p><p>(0.04 MB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1000134.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1000134.s002"><label>Text S2</label><caption><p>Study protocol.</p><p>(0.15 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1000134.s002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1000134.s003"><label>Text S3</label><caption><p>CONSORT flow chart.</p><p>(0.01 MB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1000134.s003.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1000134.s004"><label>Text S4</label><caption><p>Risk presentation.</p><p>(0.01 MB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1000134.s004.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to express our deep appreciation to Jan Arve Dyrnes and Gro Alice Hamre for programming the Web pages that were used for this study and providing technical support; to Jon Helgeland and Jan Odgaard Jensen for statistical advice; and to Tom MacKenzie for helpful comments on an earlier version of this article.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p>This study was funded by the Norwegian Research Council.
