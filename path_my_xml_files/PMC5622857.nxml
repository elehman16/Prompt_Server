The value of asparaginase was further addressed in a group of non-very high-risk patients by comparing prolonged (long-asparaginase) <italic>versus</italic> standard (short-asparaginase) native <italic>E. coli</italic> asparaginase treatment in a randomized part of the phase III 58951 trial of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Children&#x02019;s Leukemia Group. The main endpoint was disease-free survival. Overall, 1,552 patients were randomly assigned to long-asparaginase (775 patients) or short-asparaginase (777 patients). Patients with grade &#x02265;2 allergy to native <italic>E. coli</italic> asparaginase were switched to equivalent doses of <italic>Erwinia</italic> or pegylated <italic>E. coli</italic> asparaginase. The 8-year disease-free survival rate (&#x000b1;standard error) was 87.0&#x000b1;1.3% in the long-asparaginase group and 84.4&#x000b1;1.4% in the short-asparaginase group (hazard ratio: 0.87; <italic>P</italic>=0.33) and the 8-year overall survival rate was 92.6&#x000b1;1.0% and 91.3&#x000b1;1.2% respectively (hazard ratio: 0.89; <italic>P</italic>=0.53). An exploratory analysis suggested that the impact of long-asparaginase was beneficial in the National Cancer Institute standard-risk group with regards to disease-free survival (hazard ratio: 0.70; <italic>P</italic>=0.057), but far less so with regards to overall survival (hazard ratio: 0.89). The incidences of grade 3&#x02013;4 infection during consolidation (25.2% <italic>versus</italic> 14.4%) and late intensification (22.6% <italic>versus</italic> 15.9%) and the incidence of grade 2&#x02013;4 allergy were higher in the long-asparaginase arm (30% <italic>versus</italic> 21%). Prolonged native <italic>E. coli</italic> asparaginase therapy in consolidation and late intensification for our non-very high-risk patients did not improve overall outcome but led to an increase in infections and allergy. <italic>This trial was registered at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov">www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link> as #NCT00003728.</italic></p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The rate of success in the treatment of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and non-Hodgkin lymphoblastic lymphoma (NHL) has increased steadily since the 1970s. With contemporary risk-directed therapy the 5-year overall survival rate is nowadays nearly 90%.<sup><xref rid="b1-1021727" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> This major improvement in outcome results from a better understanding of the disease, more accurate stratification according to prognostic risk factors and optimized drug use.</p><p>One of the essential components in treatment protocols for childhood ALL and NHL is asparaginase (ASNase), an enzyme that catalyzes serum asparagine and glutamine deamination. In contrast to healthy cells, lymphoblasts are unable to produce endogenous asparagine because of the lack of the enzyme asparagine synthetase, and rely on plasma levels of this amino acid for protein synthesis. A depletion of plasma asparagine by ASNase results in selective apoptosis of lymphoblasts.<sup><xref rid="b2-1021727" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> The adverse effects of ASNase are mainly related to disturbances in normal protein synthesis and to hypersensitivity reactions.</p><p>Several study groups have demonstrated a benefit of intensive ASNase treatment compared to less intensive regimens.<sup><xref rid="b3-1021727" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b7-1021727" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> In the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Children&#x02019;s Leukemia Group (EORTC-CLG) 58881 trial, our study group showed that the use of a more potent ASNase with a longer half-life improved patients&#x02019; outcome. Patients receiving native <italic>E. coli</italic> ASNase 10,000 IU/m<sup>2</sup> twice weekly in induction and late intensification experienced longer event-free and overall survival than patients randomized to <italic>Erwinia</italic> ASNase at the same dosage and frequency.<sup><xref rid="b3-1021727" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b8-1021727" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> These results were confirmed by the DFCI 95-01 trial for patients treated with 25,000 IU/m<sup>2</sup> weekly of native <italic>E. coli</italic> or <italic>Erwinia</italic> ASNase<sup><xref rid="b4-1021727" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. Both studies made clear that the use of native <italic>E. coli</italic> ASNase was responsible for a reduction in relapse rate, albeit resulting in more toxicity. Based on these studies and data from pharmacokinetic and ASNase activity monitoring, it is known that higher doses of <italic>Erwinia</italic> ASNase and shorter dose intervals are required to achieve ASNase activity that is adequate in comparison with that provided by <italic>E. coli</italic> ASNase. Several study groups now incorporate ASNase activity monitoring for the optimization of ASNase therapy.</p><p>Not only do the formulation and dose of ASNase seem to play a role, but the duration of the ASNase treatment also has an impact on survival. The Italian, Dutch and Hungarian IDH-ALL-91 trial demonstrated an improved outcome for patients who received extended high-dose native <italic>E. coli</italic> ASNase treatment in consolidation therapy (25,000 IU/m<sup>2</sup> weekly for 20 weeks) compared to the same treatment based on a reduced-intensity Berlin-Frankfurt-M&#x000fc;nster (BFM)-backbone without extra ASNase.<sup><xref rid="b5-1021727" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> The benefit of prolonged native <italic>E. coli</italic> ASNase for T-cell ALL and NHL was also proven in the Pediatric Oncology Group (POG) study 8704 in which a high-dose ASNase regimen of 25,000 IU/m<sup>2</sup> given weekly for 20 weeks starting from consolidation resulted in higher continuous complete remission rates.<sup><xref rid="b6-1021727" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> An increase in event-free survival was also observed in the subsequent Dana Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) trial (ALL 91-01) as a result of the prolongation of high-dose native <italic>E. coli</italic> ASNase (25,000 IU/m<sup>2</sup> weekly) or pegylated (PEG)-ASNase (2,500 IU/m<sup>2</sup> every other week) for 20 to 30 weeks during intensification therapy.<sup><xref rid="b7-1021727" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> However, patients were not randomized to a standard <italic>versus</italic> prolonged schedule of ASNase, and the duration of ASNase was actually based on ASNase tolerance.</p><p>In contrast, the controversy of intensified ASNase treatment was highlighted in the <italic>Associazione Italiana Ematologia e Oncologia Pediatrica</italic> (AIEOP) ALL-91 trial, in which high-dose <italic>E. coli</italic> ASNase treatment (25,000 IU/m<sup>2</sup> weekly for 20 weeks during late intensification and early continuation) did not have an impact on disease-free survival compared to standard <italic>E. coli</italic> ASNase treatment (4 doses of 10,000 IU/m<sup>2</sup> during late intensification).<sup><xref rid="b9-1021727" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup></p><p>The mode of administration (continuous or discontinuous ASNase administration) may have different implications on the development of ASNase hypersensitivity and silent inactivation of ASNase. The probability of the appearance of hypersensitivity reactions does not only increase with the number of administrations within the same cycle but also in discontinuous administration schedules, in which ASNase is reintroduced after an ASNase-free interval.<sup><xref rid="b10-1021727" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup></p><p>Furthermore, more intensive ASNase therapy goes along with an increase in ASNase-related toxicities. With the advantages and side effects of ASNase in mind, the optimal dosage and number of ASNase administrations remain subject of debate. The EORTC-CLG, therefore, conducted a randomized phase III trial 58951, comparing a conventional native <italic>E. coli</italic> ASNase regimen with a prolonged native <italic>E. coli</italic> ASNase therapy in a BFM-based treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-1021727">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="f1-1021727" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>General scheme of the EORTC-CLG 58951 trial.

Several contemporary collaborative studies have demonstrated that intensification of ASNase therapy could offer an advantage in terms of outcome for the patients. Nevertheless, extrapolation of these findings is difficult as different dosages and sources of ASNase were applied in different chemotherapy backbones. This was the reason why the EORTC-CLG study group decided to investigate the effect of extended native <italic>E. coli</italic> ASNase therapy in consolidation and late intensification on top of a BFM-backbone for all non-very high risk patients as one of the randomized issues in the 58951 study.</p><p>We observed a slightly higher 8-year disease-free survival in the long-ASNase group (87.0% <italic>versus</italic> 84.4%; HR: 0.87; <italic>P</italic>=0.33) and a similar overall survival (92.6% <italic>versus</italic> 91.3%; HR: 0.89; <italic>P</italic>=0.53) rate in the long-ASNase group compared to the short-ASNase group. The analogous outcome rates were confirmed in subgroup analysis according to immunophenotype, EORTC risk group, and prednisolone/dexamethasone randomization. Exploratory analysis with an <italic>a posteriori</italic> classification of the ALL patients according to NCI risk criteria showed a trend towards higher 8-year disease-free survival rate for the long-ASNase patients in the NCI standard-risk group due to a lower number of bone marrow relapses. However, the 8-year overall survival rate was comparable in the two groups. Excluding patients who did not receive the ASNase treatment as planned according to the allocated arm or excluding allergic patients did not affect the disease-free survival rates. Our data are in accordance with the results of the AIEOP ALL-91 study, in which no advantage could be demonstrated for intermediate-risk patients randomized to receive either standard treatment (4&#x000d7;10,000 IU/m<sup>2</sup> ASNase during late intensification) or weekly high-dose ASNase 25,000 IU/m<sup>2</sup> for 20 weeks during late intensification and early continuation.<sup><xref rid="b9-1021727" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> The International BFM study group showed in the IDH-ALL-90 trial that extended high-dose native <italic>E. coli</italic> ASNase (25,000 IU/m<sup>2</sup> weekly for 20 doses, starting from the beginning of continuation therapy) <italic>versus</italic> no ASNase could improve outcome in standard-risk ALL patients treated with a reduced-intensity BFM-based protocol.

The dose reduction was mainly dictated by the fear of an excess in toxicity for those patients. Ahlke <italic>et al.</italic> studied the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of different dosages of native <italic>E. coli</italic> ASNase.

As previously reported by Domenech <italic>et al.</italic>,<sup><xref rid="b12-1021727" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> the number of infections during induction was similar for the patients treated with dexamethasone or prednisolone in the EORTC-CLG 58951 trial. The concern of an excess in toxicity due to extended native <italic>E. coli</italic> ASNase use turned out to be correct as patients in the long-ASNase arm had a trend towards more grade 3&#x02013;4 infections during consolidation and late intensification, especially when they received dexamethasone in induction. Others have reported that dexamethasone was associated with a higher risk of infection during consolidation treatment, particularly in older children and adolescents.<sup><xref rid="b10-1021727" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b20-1021727" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> The excess in severe infections during consolidation and late intensification could be the result of the additional myelosuppressive effect of prolonged administration of native <italic>E. coli</italic> ASNase in combination with intensive treatment<sup><xref rid="b10-1021727" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b21-1021727" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> and decreased immunoglobulin production resulting from decreased protein synthesis. Although moderate, hematologic toxicity from prolonged ASNase treatment might increase the immunosuppressive effect of dexamethasone, especially due to the fact that ASNase diminishes dexamethasone clearance.<sup><xref rid="b22-1021727" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup></p><p>As expected due to the longer exposure to the drug, the cumulative incidence of grade 2&#x02013;4 allergy was higher in the long-ASNase arm than in the short-ASNase arm (30.5% <italic>versus</italic> 21.7%). Although intermittent administration of native <italic>E. coli</italic> ASNase is considered to be a risk factor for allergy, our study demonstrated that the rate of grade 2&#x02013;4 allergic reactions in the long-ASNase arm was higher in consolidation than in late intensification (22.1% <italic>versus</italic> 10.3%). Concomitant administration of corticosteroids in late intensification reduces the risk of clinical hypersensitivity reactions, whereas the protective effect of the corticosteroids is absent in consolidation.<sup><xref rid="b2-1021727" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="b23-1021727" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Although concurrent administration of corticosteroids reduces the clinical signs of allergic reactions, it does not influence the neutralizing antibodies and the subsequent inactivity of ASNase. It is known that not only the frequency of allergy, but also the incidence of silent inactivation increases with longer duration of native <italic>E. coli</italic> ASNase exposure. As native <italic>E. coli</italic> ASNase activity monitoring was not performed in the EORTC 58951 trial, the incidence of silent inactivation in this study remains unclear. However, it is likely that the long treatment arm had more silent inactivators who subsequently received insufficient ASNase in the late intensification phase. The EORTC 58951 study ran in a period in which therapeutic drug monitoring was not routinely performed to detect silent inactivation and subtherapeutic asparaginase activity. Nowadays it is well known that therapeutic drug monitoring is essential in order to optimize asparaginase treatment and therefore an increasing number of study groups are including such monitoring in their study protocols.</p><p>Despite the fact that grade 3&#x02013;4 pancreatitis was rare in both treatment arms (&#x0003c;2%), there was a trend to a slightly higher incidence among patients randomized to the long-ASNase group.

Based on the results of the EORTC-CLG 58881 study, the subsequent 58951 trial recommended higher dosages of <italic>Erwinia</italic> ASNase (20,000 IU/m<sup>2</sup> 3 times a week) for patients with an allergic reaction.

An increasing number of study groups now incorporate the monitoring of ASNase activity to optimize treatment efficacy. It is widely accepted that ASNase activity is optimal if trough activity levels are &#x0003e;100U/L.<sup><xref rid="b2-1021727" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> A recent DCOG study highlighted the short activity of <italic>Erwinia</italic> ASNase by measuring trough levels of ASNase activity. Effective ASNase activity levels were found in 100% (at 48 h) and 33% (at 72 h) of patients treated with 20,000 IU <italic>Erwinia</italic> ASNase twice or three times a week.<sup><xref rid="b24-1021727" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> In our study, allergic patients received <italic>Erwinia</italic> ASNase three times a week, mostly on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. Although ASNase monitoring was not routinely performed in our study, extrapolating the data of Tong <italic>et al.</italic> we assume that at least some of our patients receiving Erwinia ASNase were undertreated during the weekend. <sup><xref rid="b24-1021727" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>This, together with the fact that fewer patients in the long-ASNase arm received all intended doses as planned in the protocol, could mitigate the potential benefit of prolonged ASNase treatment. Moreover, prolonged native <italic>E. coli</italic> ASNase therapy resulted in an increase in allergic reactions, pancreatitis and infections which can hamper the treatment efficacy by omission or delay of other essential chemotherapeutics.</p><p>It is important to note that ASNase therapy in our study consisted of treatment for 12 weeks in the long-ASNase arm <italic>versus</italic> 6 weeks in the short arm, given in a discontinuous way. Our extended arm is not comparable with the very prolonged and continuous use of ASNase (30 weeks) in the DCOG and DFCI protocols. In the DCOG ALL10 protocol, patients with medium risk according to minimal residual disease received therapy intensification including 30 weeks of PEG-ASNase exposure and dexamethasone/vincristine pulses. This resulted in a significantly higher 5-year event-free survival rate compared with that in historical controls (88% <italic>versus</italic> 76%; <italic>P</italic>=0.056).<sup><xref rid="b25-1021727" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> An increase in event-free survival was also observed in the DFCI ALL 91-01 trial for patients who tolerated prolonged high-dose native <italic>E. coli</italic> ASNase (25,000 IU/m<sup>2</sup> weekly) or PEG-ASNase (2,500 IU/m<sup>2</sup> every other week) for 30 weeks compared to patients who tolerated less than 20 weeks of extended ASNase therapy.<sup><xref rid="b7-1021727" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> The relatively short extension of ASNase treatment in our trial together with the increased risk of silent inactivation and allergy due to the discontinuous administrations, may have nullified the effect seen in the very prolonged, continuous schedules of the DCOG and DFCI protocols. Moreover, we used native <italic>E. coli</italic> ASNase, which is being increasingly replaced by PEG-ASNase in contemporary childhood ALL trials, due to the longer action and the lower incidence of allergy and silent inactivation.</p><p>In conclusion, this study demonstrates that a 6-week prolongation of native <italic>E. coli</italic> ASNase therapy in a discontinuous administration schedule (during consolidation and late intensification) does not significantly improve patients&#x02019; overall outcome. Our study underscores the hypothesis of Pession that the overall treatment intensity of this BFM-based regimen, with four-drug induction for all patients, already results in maximal therapeutic efficacy, whereas intensification with prolonged native <italic>E. coli</italic> ASNase therapy does not add any benefit for these patients.<sup><xref rid="b5-1021727" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> One has to be cautious to extrapolate our results to other studies especially if less intensive induction therapy, other asparaginase preparations or other administration schedules are used.
