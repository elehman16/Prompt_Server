<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Several forms of psychotherapy have been found to be effective in the treatment of MDD.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> For example, behavioural activation (BA) has a strong empirical basis.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> BA is an established psychological treatment derived from learning theory. It is aimed at increasing adequate behaviours and learning about the relations between behaviour and mood. The efficacy of BA for treating MDD has been established in a number of studies over the past four decades.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Moreover, a dismantling study showed that BA could be as effective as the full cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) treatment package.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Moreover, in a later randomised controlled trial, BA was found to be as effective as antidepressant medication.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>It is also well established that guided self-help interventions, administered through the Internet, can have positive effects on symptoms of depression.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8&#x02013;10</xref> An increasing number of studies show that this treatment format can be as effective as face-to-face treatment for mild-to-moderate MDD and anxiety disorders.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Guided treatments distributed digitally have provided a way to reach a larger number of patients in a manner that in most cases requires less therapist time than face-to-face psychotherapy, but with similar clinical outcome.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> There are, however, to our knowledge no controlled trial of an Internet-delivered intervention based solely on BA, and no study using smartphones for the delivery of BA, even if studies are being conducted on smartphone-administered CBT,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> for example, in the treatment of MDD.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p><p>Like BA, mindfulness is often used as a component in multicomponent treatment packages, such as mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), dialectical behaviour therapy,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> and acceptance and commitment therapy.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Studies have shown a significant negative correlation between mindfulness and depression,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>
<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> meaning that more mindfulness practice is associated with lower levels of depression. Moreover, a meta-analysis based on 39 studies of mindfulness for depression and anxiety showed a moderate effect size of Hedges&#x02019; g=0.59 for improving mood symptoms.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> The analysis also showed that mindfulness was effective for individuals with depression as primary and secondary diagnoses. Moreover, mindfulness has been shown to be effective in relapse prevention in depression with an overall risk ratio mean of 0.66 (95% CI 0.53&#x000a0;to 0.82, p&#x0003c;0.01).<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Comorbid disorders such as anxiety have also been shown to be sensitive to mindfulness-based interventions.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Mindfulness has also appeared as a component in Internet-based CBT treatments, but there have been few studies on mindfulness as a stand-alone, digitally distributed treatment for depression.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></p><p>Research suggests that depression severity is a significant moderating factor in the treatment of depression. There are also indications of a distinct difference between antidepressant medication and placebo in severe depression. Such a difference has not been verified in mild-to-moderate depression,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> and that combined treatments with medication and psychotherapy are more effective than single treatments.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> These results suggest that baseline depression severity may moderate the response to different variants of treatments. Thus, it is concluded that different treatments distributed digitally can target different subgroups of depression, in terms of severity. For example, Dimidjian <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> found that among more severely depressed patients, BA was as effective as antidepressant medication, and significantly outperformed cognitive therapy, whereas for the less severely depressed patients, no differential treatment effects were observed. However, in meta-analyses on BA versus cognitive therapy this has not been found.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></p><p>The advantages as well as the challenges of using mobile phones in CBT treatment have been summarised by Boschen and Casey.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> One challenge with using the mobile phone as a platform for psychological treatment is that the user must be able to interact with the programme in an easy way.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> In order to attain this simple and fast interaction, it might be easier to target-specific treatment components than entire treatment programmes in smartphone applications. This would make BA and mindfulness, both components in more extensive treatment packages, suitable targets for smartphone-based interventions. Another important feature of mobile technology is the possibility for the therapist to reach the patient outside of the therapy room or when not sitting in front of the computer, and thus create direct incentives for behaviour change in the patient's everyday life.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Therefore, BA is a treatment that could benefit from the use of new mobile technologies (eg, smartphones), even more than mindfulness, by creating direct incentives for BA in patient's everyday life.</p><p>In this study, we hypothesised that BA treatment delivered over smartphone would be more effective than mindfulness treatment delivered over smartphone. A meta-analysis by Mazzucchelli <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> detected a significant moderate pooled effect size of Hedges&#x02019; g=0.33 (Cohen's d=0.31) when comparing BA with other psychological interventions, such as psychoeducation about depression, problem-solving, assertiveness training and brief interventions. As such, we expected a moderate between-group effect size (Cohen's d=0.50<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) in this study. We also expected, in line with Dimidjian <italic>et al</italic>&#x02019;s<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> conclusion, that BA would be superior to mindfulness for participants suffering from more severe depression (scored &#x02265;10 on 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire Depression Scale (PHQ-9) and fulfilled the criteria for an ongoing primary diagnosis of major depression of moderate character). Since we did not test the effects of a full MBCT programme but rather a brief version with fewer exercises, the mindfulness application was not hypothesised to be as effective as the BA. In addition, research has shown that depressed individuals, to a greater extent, have deficits in cognitive functioning such as concentration difficulties, distractibility and impairments in memory, as well as problem in engaging in effortful cognitive processes.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28&#x02013;31</xref> Therefore, we concluded that the BA intervention would be more suitable for the more severely depressed participants since mindfulness require more cognitive functioning in initial stages, such as the ability to control attention in order to focus on the present moment.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>
<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></p><p>The study was based on our previous work on guided Internet-treatment for depression,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> but in the current study the treatment content was delivered entirely via the participants&#x02019; personal smartphones, using recently developed smartphone applications. The aim of this study was to test the effects of two smartphone-delivered treatments: one based on BA and the other on mindfulness. Hence, the main question is whether BA is more effective than mindfulness delivered through a smartphone application. In order to evaluate long-term effects, we also included a 6-month follow-up after the start of the treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>Written informed consent was obtained from all participants by surface mail before the study started.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Recruitment and selection</title><p>The participants were mainly recruited via mass media and advertisements in large Swedish newspapers.

The diagnosis of MDD was confirmed by a structured interview (see below). In addition, an assessment of suicidal ideation was conducted. The interviews were conducted over telephone by four MSc clinical psychology students. The principal research executive together with the interviewers reviewed all the protocols from the interviews.</p><p>Of the 231 individuals who initially expressed interest in the study, 126 completed all the questions in the online screening (22 did not finish the screening and 83 did not begin the screening). Of these, 29 were excluded before the diagnostic interview started. The most common reason for exclusion was an ongoing psychological treatment. Other reasons for exclusion were wrong type of mobile phone (ie, not having access to a smartphone) and score under 5 on the PHQ-9. Thirteen individuals were excluded after the diagnostic interview. The most common reason was that the participant was considered to be in need of another kind of treatment. Eighty-four participants were subsequently included. Before the study started, three participants chose not to participate. Hence, 81 participants were finally included in the data analysis.

The psychoeducation aimed to introduce the participants to the treatment and establish a minimum level of knowledge concerning MDD, touching on topics such as the prevalence of depression, its aetiology and maintenance factors based on operant conditioning, as well as the theoretical basis for BA.

A prototype of the smartphone application was tested in a pilot study.<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> This prototype, however, was not specifically designed for depression interventions. The purpose of the BA application was to make it easy for the participant to remember and register important behaviours in order to increase everyday activation. The application contained a database of 54 behaviours, divided into three different areas for the participant to add to their application. See <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="bx1">box 1</xref> for the list of behaviours from the database. The database aimed to provide suggestions, help and inspiration to get started with the application. Participants were also able to add their own areas and behaviours into the application and start performing and registering these. Through the initial psychoeducation, the participants were advised to add only a few (between 2 and 4) behaviours initially, mainly from the existing database, and to choose behaviours that were easy to perform.

Hence, the therapists sent encouraging messages every other, or every third day to the participants, as well as weekly general educational messages via mail. The difference in how the therapists communicated in the mindfulness intervention, compared with the BA intervention, was that the therapists could not give specific feedback on activities or exercises that the participants had performed. Otherwise, the communication was similar (length and type of guided content in the feedback). In addition, the participants given the mindfulness intervention were also asked to write a weekly reflection to summarise their work and thoughts on the current treatment week, and send this reflection to their therapist via email.

All therapists had completed their clinical training as well as 16&#x02005;weeks of practice. Each therapist was responsible for the treatment or 8&#x02013;10 participants from the BA group and an equal number of participants from the mindfulness group. The therapists were randomly allocated to the participants, with the restriction of not having more than 10 participants from each group.

Random intercept models were selected for all measures. Differences between the BA treatment and the mindfulness treatment were primarily investigated by modelling interaction effects of group and time. For the PHQ-9 and the AAQ-II, where weekly measures were available, the covariance between the random intercept and slope was not significant, and therefore was not included in the model. Hence, a random intercept model was also used for these measures. Between-group differences at post-treatment were analysed using independent t tests. Power analysis indicated an 89% chance of detecting a between-group effect size of d=0.60 (&#x003b1; level=0.05, one tailed). Within-group and between-group effect sizes (Cohen's d) were calculated by dividing the differences in means by the pooled SDs.<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref> This was carried out from premeasurements to postmeasurements, and from premeasurements to the 6-month follow-up data.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>The two groups did not differ significantly on any of the measures at pretreatment (t=0.50 to 0.67, df=79, p=0.78&#x02013;0.50).

Hence, the main question was whether BA is more effective than mindfulness delivered through a smartphone application. We hypothesised that BA treatment delivered via smartphone would be more effective than mindfulness treatment delivered via smartphone. We also expected that BA would be superior to mindfulness for participants suffering from more severe depression. When analysing the whole sample as one entity, the result showed that the two interventions did not differ significantly from one another, either from pretreatment to post-treatment or from pretreatment to the 6-month follow-up on any of the outcome measures. Also, there were no significant differences in recovery rates between the groups, either at post-treatment or at the 6-month follow-up.</p><p>This study also explored how different levels of initial depression severity could moderate response to the different interventions. All randomised participants were classified into either high or low severity of depression based on the cut-off scores on the PHQ-9 and whether they fulfilled the criteria for an ongoing primary diagnosis of major depression. For participants with higher severity of depression, the treatment based on BA was superior to the treatment based on mindfulness, as measured with PHQ-9. In contrast, for participants with lower initial severity, the treatment based on mindfulness was more effective than the treatment based on BA, as measured with PHQ-9 and BDI-II.</p><p>The result from the analysis of the higher severity participants is in line with Dimidjian <italic>et al</italic>'s<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> finding. In contrast to the meta-analysis by Cuijpers <italic>et al</italic>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Dimidjian <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> found that BA was comparable in efficacy to antidepressant medication, and more efficacious than cognitive therapy, but only among those patients who were more severely depressed. Since it is known that depressed individuals, to a greater extent, have concentration difficulties, distractibility and problems in engaging in effortful cognitive processes,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28&#x02013;31</xref> Beck <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref> have long suggested that therapists should focus on behavioural strategies early in treatment when patients are more depressed and return to that emphasis later if patients start to worsen. We expected that the BA intervention would be more suitable for the more severely depressed participants since mindfulness require more cognitive functioning in initial stages, such as the ability to control attention in order to focus on the present moment.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>
<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></p><p>The result from the analysis of the less severely depressed participants was unexpected to us. Although there is only initial evidence that mindfulness treatment is effective for acute or severely depressed patients,<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>
<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref> mindfulness has proven to be effective for relapse prevention of recurrent depression.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>
<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>
<xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref> A possible explanation of the results could be that there was a difference between the two treatment groups, although not significant, in the number of participants who were suffering from major depression. In the BA group, 64.7% (n=11) were diagnosed with major depression in the initial screening, compared with 30.8% (n=4) in the mindfulness group (&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> (N=30, df=1)=3.39, p=0.07).</p><p>Moreover, the results showed significant improvements from pretreatment to post-treatment on the primary outcome measures in both treatment conditions with large within-group effect sizes and large recovery rates, comparable to other depression treatments.<xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>
<xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref> This might indicate that the smartphone format used in this study could work well for a depressed population. However, a replication with a waiting list group should be conducted to rule out the possibility that the effects occurred due to natural recovery.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Limitations</title><p>There are a number of limitations that need to be mentioned. The first is that no waiting list group was included. Although our main research question was to assess whether BA is more effective than mindfulness delivered via smartphone, a control group given no intervention would have yielded a more clear result.</p><p>A second limitation is that the study was underpowered. Thus, it is difficult to detect significant overall differences between the two smartphone treatments, even if significant interaction effects were found when using mixed-effects model with PHQ-9 in the subgroup analyses. A post hoc power analysis revealed that a sample of 393 participants was required to detect small between-group effects. We did not expect that the mindfulness treatment would be as effective and powered the trial as if a moderate between-group effect would be found.</p><p>A third limitation was that the participants were recruited nationally through mass media and advertisements. Thus, we cannot be sure that this treatment would work in a clinical setting, for example, an outpatient psychiatric facility. However, the mean depression severity as measured by the BDI-II at intake (M=24.10) is rather close to the limit of 29, proposed for defining severe depression,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> meaning that the depression severity in this study was comparable to an outpatient psychiatric population.</p><p>Fourth, we recruited a broad range of participants, with regard to severity of depression (a minimum of 8 and a maximum of 44 on BDI-II at intake). This makes it difficult to target a specific group for which the treatments would be most effective. Nevertheless, a subgroup analysis showed that the participants with higher severity of depression responded significantly better to the BA than to the treatment based on mindfulness, whereas the treatment based on mindfulness worked significantly better than the treatment based on BA for the participants with lower initial depression severity. Additionally, it can be argued that these broad inclusion criteria reflect a real population (ie, an outpatient psychiatric population) of individuals with depressive disorders. However, this contributed to power limitations as well.</p><p>A fifth related concern was the large number of participants that had college-level or university-level education (65.5%). This might compromise the generalisability of the results, since it is possible that guided self-help is especially well suited for educated patients. However, there are data indicating that 50% of patients seeking psychotherapy have some college education<xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref> and that educated patients may be more inclined to seek help for mental health problems in general.<xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref></p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Some clinical implications of this study are discussed as follows. Owing to the need for simple and fast interaction with the treatment programme, singular treatment components such as BA and mindfulness might be a better target for smartphone applications than entire multicomponent treatment packages. At the same time, there is a need for guided self-help treatments distributed digitally that can reach out to more patients. This study is one of the first to test a treatment for depression, administered via smartphone. The large within-group effects on the primary outcome measures, as well as the large recovery rates for both groups, are comparable to other depression treatments and indicate that this smartphone format with a small amount of text and minimal therapist support might work well for a depressed population. However, as aforementioned, a replication with a waiting list group should be conducted to rule out that the effects occurred due to natural recovery.</p><p>Moreover, this study also shows that BA might work better for a more severely depressed population, whereas mindfulness might work better for people suffering from light depression. These results suggest that different treatments distributed digitally can target different subgroups of depressed patients in terms of severity. However, more studies are needed to strengthen this hypothesis before any conclusions can be drawn.</p><p>From a broader perspective, we believe that smartphones will be integrated even further in society since they are already socially accepted and come at relatively low costs considering their functionalities,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> and therefore may serve an important role in healthcare. Therefore these results, showing that mild-to-moderate major depression can be treated effectively by means of a supported smartphone application, might be important in making depression treatment and other psychological treatments more assimilated into people's daily life. As suggested by Ly <italic>et al</italic>,<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> the smartphone format might also help increasing patients&#x02019; awareness of being in treatment, even in everyday settings, and therefore better help patients create direct incentives for treatment-related activities in their everyday life.<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> Using smartphones to distribute psychological treatment might also help making it possible to reach out with psychological therapy to a broader group of people, since their use attracts no attention,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> allowing users to interact with a device without fear of judgement or stigma. Lastly, psychological treatments distributed via smartphones are not only relevant for Swedish conditions but also for the developing countries of the world, which increasingly are empowered by mobile phones with Internet connection.</p><p>This study might pave the way for a broad range of other trials conducted via smartphones, self-help interventions and face-to-face treatments with the smartphone as an adjunct tool. We believe that a substantial part of Internet-based interventions in the future will be executed through smartphones or at least supported by smartphones. Further studies should focus on both formats, as well as expanding the treatment platform to other psychological disorders.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e214" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2013-003440.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e215" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2013-003440.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> KHL developed the application.
