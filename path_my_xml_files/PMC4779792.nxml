We designed this trial to establish the effect of early detection by screening on ovarian cancer mortality.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In this randomised controlled trial, we recruited postmenopausal women aged 50&#x02013;74 years from 13 centres in National Health Service Trusts in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Exclusion criteria were previous bilateral oophorectomy or ovarian malignancy, increased risk of familial ovarian cancer, and active non-ovarian malignancy. The trial management system confirmed eligibility and randomly allocated participants in blocks of 32 using computer-generated random numbers to annual multimodal screening (MMS) with serum CA125 interpreted with use of the risk of ovarian cancer algorithm, annual transvaginal ultrasound screening (USS), or no screening, in a 1:1:2 ratio. The primary outcome was death due to ovarian cancer by Dec 31, 2014, comparing MMS and USS separately with no screening, ascertained by an outcomes committee masked to randomisation group. All analyses were by modified intention to screen, excluding the small number of women we discovered after randomisation to have a bilateral oophorectomy, have ovarian cancer, or had exited the registry before recruitment. Investigators and participants were aware of screening type.

Screening ended on Dec 31, 2011, and included 345&#x02008;570 MMS and 327&#x02008;775 USS annual screening episodes. At a median follow-up of 11&#x000b7;1 years (IQR 10&#x000b7;0&#x02013;12&#x000b7;0), we diagnosed ovarian cancer in 1282 (0&#x000b7;6%) women: 338 (0&#x000b7;7%) in the MMS group, 314 (0&#x000b7;6%) in the USS group, and 630 (0&#x000b7;6%) in the no screening group. Of these women, 148 (0&#x000b7;29%) women in the MMS group, 154 (0&#x000b7;30%) in the USS group, and 347 (0&#x000b7;34%) in the no screening group had died of ovarian cancer. The primary analysis using a Cox proportional hazards model gave a mortality reduction over years 0&#x02013;14 of 15% (95% CI &#x02212;3 to 30; p=0&#x000b7;10) with MMS and 11% (&#x02212;7 to 27; p=0&#x000b7;21) with USS. The Royston-Parmar flexible parametric model showed that in the MMS group, this mortality effect was made up of 8% (&#x02212;20 to 31) in years 0&#x02013;7 and 23% (1&#x02013;46) in years 7&#x02013;14, and in the USS group, of 2% (&#x02212;27 to 26) in years 0&#x02013;7 and 21% (&#x02212;2 to 42) in years 7&#x02013;14. A prespecified analysis of death from ovarian cancer of MMS versus no screening with exclusion of prevalent cases showed significantly different death rates (p=0&#x000b7;021), with an overall average mortality reduction of 20% (&#x02212;2 to 40) and a reduction of 8% (&#x02212;27 to 43) in years 0&#x02013;7 and 28% (&#x02212;3 to 49) in years 7&#x02013;14 in favour of MMS.</p></sec><sec><title>Interpretation</title><p>Although the mortality reduction was not significant in the primary analysis, we noted a significant mortality reduction with MMS when prevalent cases were excluded. We noted encouraging evidence of a mortality reduction in years 7&#x02013;14, but further follow-up is needed before firm conclusions can be reached on the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of ovarian cancer screening.</p></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p>Medical Research Council, Cancer Research UK, Department of Health, The Eve Appeal.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="cesec10"><title>Introduction</title><p>The poor prognosis for ovarian cancer<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> motivated us to start a programme of screening research 30 years ago.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> We have since reported CA125 as a predictor of ovarian cancer risk,<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> high specificity<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> and preliminary evidence of a survival benefit<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> of multimodal screening using CA125 interpreted with a cutoff with transvaginal ultrasound as a second-line test, development of a risk of ovarian cancer algorithm (ROCA) for interpretation of longitudinal CA125,<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> use of morphological criteria in second-line transvaginal ultrasound,<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> and use of ROCA in a pilot randomised controlled trial.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> During this period, advances in treatment have only produced a slight reduction in disease mortality.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p><p><boxed-text id="cetextbox10"><caption><title>Research in context</title></caption><p><bold>Evidence before this study</bold></p><p>During the 1990s, findings from large prospective studies of screening showed that both CA125 and ultrasound-based ovarian cancer screening could identify preclinical cases of ovarian cancer. These studies included some by our own group with use of a multimodal strategy incorporating CA125 with ultrasound as a secondary test. In the year before the start of this trial, a systematic review of 25 ovarian cancer screening studies commissioned by the National Health Service Health Technology Assessment Programme reported that although ultrasound and multimodal screening can detect ovarian cancer in asymptomatic women, the effect of screening on ovarian cancer was unproven. The authors concluded that screening should not be introduced into clinical practice until further information was available from randomised trials designed to assess the effect of ovarian cancer screening on mortality and its adverse effects and cost-effectiveness. After that publication, our group reported the findings of a pilot randomised controlled trial in 22&#x02008;000 postmenopausal women showing the feasibility of ovarian cancer screening with use of a multimodal screening strategy and provided preliminary evidence of a survival benefit in this population. During this trial, two large randomised controlled trials were done: the Shizuoka Cohort Study of Ovarian Cancer Screening and the ovarian component of the Prostate Lung Colorectal Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial. The Shizuoka Cohort Study of Ovarian Cancer Screening only reported on ovarian cancer detection and not on deaths. Findings from the ovarian component of the PLCO Cancer Screening Trial showed no difference in ovarian cancer deaths between the screening and control groups. We searched MEDLINE between Jan 1, 2001, and Nov 31, 2015, using the protocol described by Mosch and colleagues, with the following search terms: &#x0201c;ovarian neoplasms&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;Fallopian tube neoplasms&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;ovar*&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;fallopian tub* OR adnex*&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;tumo*&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;malignan*&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;carcinoma* OR adenocarcinoma* OR neoplasm* OR mass*&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;mass screening&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;early detection of cancer&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;randomized controlled trial&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;controlled clinical trial&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;randomized&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;placebo&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;clinical trials&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;randomly&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;trial&#x0201d;. This search yielded 234 publications, which, when limited to randomised controlled trials of human female adults published in the English language resulted in 64 articles, 11 of which were duplicated. The remaining 53 articles consisted of 28 pertaining to the PLCO Cancer Screening Trial, 11 from our own group, and one from Kobayashi and colleagues in 2008 (the Shizuoka Cohort Study of Ovarian Cancer Screening). We identified three key randomised controlled trials in ovarian cancer screening. Of these, only the PLCO Cancer Screening Trial thus far has reported mortality data.</p><p><bold>Added value of this study</bold></p><p>To our knowledge, this trial is the first randomised controlled trial of ovarian cancer screening to produce findings that show that in postmenopausal women from the general population, annual screening with use of the multimodal strategy is safe and could reduce deaths due to ovarian cancer.

A further secondary outcome was complications related to screening and false-positive surgery. Centres reported screening-related complications to a designated safety officer. We deemed screen-positive surgery resulting in benign pathology or normal adnexa false positive. Medical notes were centrally reviewed for complications, which were classified as major (resulting in sequelae) or minor by a designated gynaecological oncologist. Other secondary outcomes were to assess and compare the performance characteristics of the two screening strategies, assess the psychological effects of screening, and establish the resource implications of screening.</p></sec><sec id="cesec70"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>In 2000, we estimated that a sample size of 200&#x02008;000 women at a two-sided 5% significance level for a difference in relative ovarian cancer mortality of 30% would give 90% power for the no screening versus combined screening groups and 80% power for the no screening versus MMS or no screening versus USS comparisons. After trial extension to Dec 31, 2014, our recalculated power remained 80% at a two-sided 5% significance level to detect a reduction of 30% in no screening versus MMS or no screening versus USS comparisons.</p><p>The primary mortality analysis was an MMS versus no screening and USS versus no screening analysis of the primary outcome with use of a Cox proportional hazards model. The primary analysis initially consisted of comparison of the combined MMS and USS with the no screening group and individual comparisons of MMS with no screening and USS with no screening. The assumption was that sensitivity of the two screening strategies would be similar. During the trial, the data monitoring and ethics committee concluded that this assumption was not the case. On the basis of differences in performance characteristics of the two strategies at the initial screen,<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> we updated our primary statistical analysis to MMS versus no screening and USS versus no screening comparisons. We defined survival time from date of randomisation to date of death due to ovarian cancer or censorship, or sooner if the volunteer died of another cause or was lost to follow-up. To allow for the fact that we were comparing two intervention arms against a control group, we made a Dunnett correction for multiple testing against a control to the critical &#x003b1; (&#x003b1;=0&#x000b7;0258).

The incidence of invasive epithelial ovarian cancer and peritoneal cancer was also similar: 52 (48&#x02013;61; 575 cancers; 1&#x02008;097&#x02008;089 women-years) per 100&#x02008;000 women-years in the no screening group, 55 (48&#x02013;57; 299 cancers; 548&#x02008;553 women-years) per 100&#x02008;000 women-years in the MMS group, and 47 (41&#x02013;53; 259 cancers; 548&#x02008;825 women-years) per 100&#x02008;000 women-years in the USS group.</p><p>We noted screening complications in 30 (&#x0003c;1%) women in the MMS group and 61 (&#x0003c;1%) in the USS group, giving a screening-related complication rate of 8&#x000b7;6 per 100&#x02008;000 in the MMS group and 18&#x000b7;6 per 100&#x02008;000 in the USS group (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 9</xref>). We noted benign adnexal pathology or normal adnexa in 488 (1&#x000b7;0%) women in the MMS group and 1634 (3&#x000b7;2%) women in the USS group who had screen-positive surgery (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 9</xref>). This finding translates to 14 (345&#x02008;572 annual screens) false-positive surgeries per 10&#x02008;000 screens in the MMS group and 50 (327&#x02008;775 annual screens) false-positive surgeries per 10&#x02008;000 screens in the USS group. For each ovarian and peritoneal cancer detected by screening, an additional two (488 false positives; 212 ovarian and peritoneal cancers) women in the MMS group and ten (1634 false positives; 164 ovarian and peritoneal cancers) women in the USS group had false-positive surgery. Women in the MMS group had a complication rate of 3&#x000b7;1% (95% CI 1&#x000b7;7&#x02013;5&#x000b7;0; 15 of 488) and those in the USS group had a rate of 3&#x000b7;5% (2&#x000b7;7&#x02013;4&#x000b7;5; 57 of 1634). Outside of the trial, during the same period, 792 (0&#x000b7;8%) women in the no screening group, 466 (0&#x000b7;9%) in the MMS group, and 441 (0&#x000b7;9%) in the USS group had both ovaries or the only remaining ovary removed for a range of indications and had benign pathology or normal adnexa. Data for complications associated with these surgeries are not available. The overall ratio of women who had surgery resulting in benign adnexal pathology or normal adnexa to women with ovarian and peritoneal cancer was 1&#x000b7;2 (792:645) in the no screening group, 2&#x000b7;7 (954:354) in the MMS group, and 6&#x000b7;4 (2075:324) in the USS group. Details of final follow-up questionnaire responses are provided in the <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix (p 25)</xref>. Ovarian cancer screening outside of UKCTOCS was documented in 1660 (4&#x000b7;3% [95% CI 4&#x000b7;1&#x02013;4&#x000b7;5]) of 38&#x02008;238 women in the no screening group who completed the follow-up questionnaire in 2014.</p></sec><sec id="cesec100"><title>Discussion</title><p>The relative mortality reduction was 15% in the MMS group and 11% in the USS group, but these reductions were not significant with the primary prespecified Cox analysis. In retrospect, it would have been preferable to specify a primary analysis that was weighted to reflect the predictable delay in mortality reduction in a screening trial of this type. Nevertheless, in view of the trend in mortality in the no screening and screening groups, significance using the Cox analysis could be achieved on further follow-up. However, the prespecified secondary subgroup analysis with exclusion of prevalent cases in the MMS group was significant, suggesting that the long-term effect of an MMS screening programme is about a 28% mortality reduction after 7 years of screening. This significant, yet delayed effect was supported by the sole post-hoc weighted analysis, which was also significant for the MMS group. These results are encouraging for various reasons. First, the mortality hazard rate in the no screening group seems to increase, whereas in the two screened groups, it levels off, resulting in decreasing HRs. This finding suggests that the difference in mortality between no screening and screening groups will increase with time and further follow-up. Second, the mortality difference was not constant across the trial. It was low for the first 7 years after randomisation, but the estimated mortality reductions increased during years 7&#x02013;14. The mortality reduction in the MMS group for years 7&#x02013;14 remained high in subgroup analyses with exclusion of prevalent cases for primary and secondary outcomes and in the secondary outcome analyses including peritoneal cancer deaths (albeit slightly lower). This late effect was predictable in view of the unavoidable time interval from randomisation to diagnosis and then death. For participants who died in the no screening group the median interval from randomisation to death was more than 8 years.</p><p>The late effect on mortality seen in this trial is often noted in screening trials in which survival is measured from date of randomisation. In the European Randomised Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer trial,<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr"><sup>36</sup></xref> an effect of screening only emerged 7 years after randomisation. Similarly, investigators of the Norwegian Colorectal Cancer Prevention Trial<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr"><sup>37</sup></xref> noted an effect 9 years from randomisation. The PLCO Cancer Screening Trial<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> and National Lung Screening Trial<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> used the weighted log-rank test in anticipation of this delayed effect. Overall, the results suggested that an unequivocally significant difference in mortality might emerge after longer follow-up.</p><p>The estimate of relative reduction in ovarian cancer mortality in UKCTOCS is in keeping with relative reductions noted in breast cancer randomised screening trials, which vary between 15% and 25%, and with those noted in meta-analyses of observational studies, which vary between 13% and 17%.<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr"><sup>38</sup></xref> Using UK population data from 2007, Loberg and colleagues<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr"><sup>38</sup></xref> reported that for 1000 women invited to biennial mammography screening for 20 years from 50 years of age, two to three women are prevented from dying of breast cancer. Findings from this trial suggest that for 641 women screened annually using the multimodal strategy for 14 years, one ovarian cancer death is prevented.</p><p>The only directly comparable trial with this trial is the ovarian component of the PLCO Cancer Screening Trial.<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> However, some differences exist between the two, including, in this trial, use of ROCA (as opposed to a CA125 cutoff) and detailed screening algorithms. We centrally managed implementation of the entire screening protocol with predefined pathways for all women detected to have abnormalities, fail-safe monitoring, and quality assurance. In the PLCO Cancer Screening Trial, no difference was noted in ovarian and peritoneal cancer deaths between the screening and control groups at a median follow-up of 12&#x000b7;4 years. In our secondary outcome analysis, we noted a mortality trend that was in keeping with our primary analysis and different to that noted in the PLCO Cancer Screening Trial. This finding follows on from the higher sensitivity and stage shift noted earlier in the MMS group of this trial.</p><p>Both venepuncture and transvaginal ultrasound were associated with minor complications and very low complication rates. Most postmenopausal women found transvaginal USS acceptable, with 3&#x000b7;5% reporting moderate or severe pain during the scan.<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr"><sup>39</sup></xref> As previously reported from the UKCTOCS psychosocial study,<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> screening did not increase general anxiety. The number of women having surgery for false-positive screen results was as predicted in the trial design and for MMS, was much fewer than the upper acceptable limit, whereas for USS, it was on the border of acceptability. The small number of operations associated with MMS has been noted in previous trials.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> During the course of this trial, the ratio of women who had surgery for which ovaries had benign pathology or were normal to those diagnosed with ovarian and peritoneal cancer was 2&#x000b7;3-times higher in the MMS group and 5&#x000b7;3-times higher in the USS group than in the no screening group. Complication rates of false-positive surgery of 3&#x000b7;1% in the MMS group and 3&#x000b7;5% in the USS group were similar to the major complication rate of 2&#x000b7;9% reported for benign surgery undertaken in NHS gynaecological oncology centres in a recent multicentre audit.<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr"><sup>41</sup></xref></p><p>Key strengths of this trial include scale, with more than 202&#x02008;000 participants, more than 670&#x02008;000 annual screening episodes, and more than 2&#x000b7;19 million women-years of follow-up; the multicentre setting within the UK NHS; central management of screening protocols with use of a bespoke web-based trial management system; high compliance; low contamination in the no screening group; completeness of ascertainment of deaths through linkage to national registries; an outcomes review committee masked to group assignment; and treatment of all women within the NHS. The healthy volunteer effect, noted initially, waned over time, such that by the end of the trial, age-standardised cancer incidence and all-cause mortality rates in the no screening group were similar to the UK population, as were ovarian cancer survival rates (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 23</xref>).</p><p>The main limitation of this trial was our failure to anticipate the late effect of screening in our statistical design. Had we done so, the weighted log-rank test could have been planned in line with many other large cancer screening trials, including the ovarian component of the PLCO Cancer Screening Trial.<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> As a result, we report, as planned, the Cox test as the primary analysis balanced by a significant preplanned analysis with exclusion of prevalent cases, with support from a sole post-hoc WLR test in the MMS group. Generalisability of the results will depend on central implementation of the screening protocols, with accompanying quality assurance processes. This implementation, although challenging, is achievable through the processes used in the NHS national screening programme. Further follow-up is needed to assess the extent of the mortality reduction before firm conclusions can be reached on the long-term efficacy and cost-effectiveness of ovarian cancer screening.</p><p><boxed-text id="cetextbox10a"><p><bold>This online publication has been corrected.
