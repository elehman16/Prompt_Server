stimuli as well as for sine-wave gratings in adults under the effect of acute
ingestion of alcohol. We measured the contrast sensitivity function (CSF) for
gratings of 0.25, 1.25, 2.5, 4, 10, and 20 cycles per degree of visual angle (cpd) as
well as for angular frequency stimuli of 1, 2, 4, 24, 48, and 96 cycles/360&#x000b0;. Twenty
adults free of ocular diseases, with normal or corrected-to-normal visual acuity, and
no history of alcoholism were enrolled in two experimental groups: 1) no alcohol
intake (control group) and 2) alcohol ingestion (experimental group). The average
concentration of alcohol in the experimental group was set to about 0.08%. We used a
paradigm involving a forced-choice method. Maximum sensitivity to contrast for
sine-wave gratings in the two groups occurred at 4 cpd sine-wave gratings and at 24
and 48 cycles/360&#x000b0; for angular frequency stimuli. Significant changes in contrast
sensitivity were observed after alcohol intake compared with the control condition at
spatial frequency of 4 cpd and 1, 24, and 48 cycles/360&#x000b0; for angular frequency
stimuli. Alcohol intake seems to affect the processing of sine-wave gratings at
maximum sensitivity and at the low and high frequency ends for angular frequency
stimuli, both under photopic luminance conditions.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Visual perception</kwd><kwd>Contrast sensitivity function</kwd><kwd>Alcohol intake</kwd><kwd>Angular frequency</kwd><kwd>Psychophysical method</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="1"/><table-count count="1"/><ref-count count="40"/><page-count count="7"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The literature on alcohol intake and systemic effects, mainly in the central nervous
system (CNS), is extensive. The sensory system seems to be particularly sensitive to
acute and chronic intoxication (<xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). There are, however, a limited number of studies
of the effects of alcohol on sensory processing.</p><p>Although drinking alcohol promotes loss or impairment in visual functions such as visual
acuity, contrast sensitivity, motion processing, short-term visual memory, oculomotor
mechanisms, and stereoscopic depth perception, there are some divergences among studies
(<xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>-<xref rid="B07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).
These differences may be due to methodological issues related to the perceptual aspects
investigated, and the amount of alcohol or the manner in which it was administered.</p><p>Some studies have posed hypotheses attempting to better understand the mechanisms
related to the observed changes in visual and oculomotor functions. Among those is the
suggestion that the effects of alcohol intake may result from depressant effects on the
inhibitory control mechanisms and the action of neurotransmitters and neuromodulators,
more specifically, the dampening effect of alcohol on the GABAergic system (i.e.,
gamma-aminobutyric acid) (<xref rid="B07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>-<xref rid="B09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p><p>The action of alcohol on the CNS has a dose-dependent biphasic character. The
stimulatory effects are characteristic of the first phase, while a second phase
characterized by toxic or pharmacological effects related to depressant activity
predominate with increased dose. These effects of alcohol are probably determined by
such well-established pharmacological mechanisms as the blockade of neurotransmitter
receptors and signaling pathways and some others (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p><p>The attenuation induced by alcohol in the excitatory system seems to play a relevant
role in mediating changes on neuronal activity. Chen et al. (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) evaluated the response properties of neurons of the primary
visual cortex (A17) in adult cats, and found changes in the selective activities of
neurons for orientation and direction (i.e., related to the perception of form and
movement).</p><p>Psychophysical and behavioral studies related to alcohol intake may advance our
knowledge of mechanisms of action of alcohol and the affected areas in the CNS (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>-<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).
However, few studies have been performed with this theme. A systematic review of
articles published between 2000 and 2010 relating to alcohol intake and changes in
neuro-perceptual vision identified nine articles that found changes in visual perception
after alcohol intake. The results are controversial, but evidence was found that alcohol
has a potentially neurotoxic effect in the visual system, and that it impairs the
spatial vision functions in several brain areas through different mechanisms (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t01">Table 1</xref>
(<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>-<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>)).</p><p>

</p><p>The present study examined the visual perception of contrast using the contrast
sensitivity function (CSF), which is a useful tool for assessing visual functions in
visual disorders, neurological conditions and associated with substance use (<xref rid="B02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>-<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). The CSF is an essential property of contrast
processing, an important aspect of visual function associated with object detection and
recognition and perceptual decision making. The spatial luminance CSF represents the
activity of several selective cortical channels at spatial frequency bands that may
represent, at least in part, the activity of retinoic-geniculo-ribbed, parallel channels
M and P. Many studies have investigated the existence of a certain priority functional
impairment of spatial processing channels. Its use as a tool for the study of visual
dysfunction is a good example of how research, initially motivated by the desire to
understand the workings of the visual system, can be used in medical applications.
Moreover, this kind of knowledge has been used in industry to guide the design of
optical and optoelectronic devices such as televisions with high spatial and temporal
resolution (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>).</p><p>The possibility of relating sensitivity levels or the contrast threshold with spatial
frequencies allows evaluation of the mechanisms and pathways that process visual
contrast. However, most research related to CSF uses elementary stimuli in Cartesian
coordinates as the standard (vertical sine-wave gratings). No results related to alcohol
intake and elementary stimuli in polar coordinates (angular frequencies) are available.
Stimuli defined in polar coordinates are preferably processed by areas of the
extra-striate cortex V2, V4, and the inferotemporal cortex, unlike stimuli defined in
Cartesian coordinates, which are processed in the V1 area. The primary objective of this
study was to evaluate the effects of acute alcohol ingestion on contrast sensitivity for
elementary visual stimuli of spatial frequencies in both Cartesian and polar
coordinates, using sine-wave gratings and angular frequency stimuli.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec><title>Participants</title><p>Twenty volunteers with normal or corrected vision (19-31 years of age, mean age &#x000b1; SD
= 21.75 &#x000b1; 2.95 years; 10 females and 10 males) participated in the experiments. All
participants were tested for visual acuity with Rasquin's chart of optotypes &#x0201c;E&#x0201d;, and
Ishihara's color test. They had no personal or family history of alcoholism, did not
use psychotropic substances and were nonsmokers. Participation was voluntary, by
signing a clear, free consent form. This research was approved by the ethics
committee of the Center for Health Sciences of Universidade Federal de
Pernambuco.</p></sec><sec><title>Equipment and stimuli</title><p>The equipment included a 19-inch cathode ray tube video monitor (LG, Brasil) with VGA
and DVI inputs, connected to a digital video processor, BITS++ (Cambridge Research
Systems, United Kingdom). We also used a mouse for the participant response to the
presented visual stimuli. A ColorCal photometer (Cambridge Research Systems) and a
model BFD-50 (Instrutherm, Brasil) ethyl meter were used to measure the blood alcohol
level. We set photopic luminance conditions to 41.05 cd/m<sup>2</sup>.</p><p>We used elementary visual stimuli of spatial frequencies in Cartesian coordinates of
0.25, 1.25, 2.5, 4, 10, and 20 cycles per degree of visual angle (cpd), and in polar
coordinates of 1, 2, 4, 24, 48, and 96 cycles/360&#x000b0;, as well as a neutral stimulus at
mean luminance, to measure contrast sensitivity curves. All stimuli were static,
generated in gray scale, circularly symmetric, with a diameter of about 7 degrees of
visual angle and presented at 300 cm distance between the monitor and the volunteer.
Other details about these procedures have been previously described (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Procedures</title><p>All volunteers were subjected to both conditions: alcohol intake (experimental
condition, EC), and no alcohol ingestion (control condition, CC), on different days,
with an interval of at least 24 h. A counterbalancing technique was employed to
monitor the effect of order. The volunteers expected to consume alcohol in both
conditions. The experiments always began at 9:00 am or at 2:00 pm, and all volunteers
were instructed to consume a light meal 2 h before the experiments. They were
instructed not to consume alcohol within 24 h of the experiment.</p><p>The alcohol was administered as vodka with a concentration of 40% alcohol by volume,
diluted with passion fruit juice 1/3 v/v. In the CC sessions, volunteers received the
same amount of liquid. The only modification made was the replacement of alcohol with
lemon juice.</p><p>The amount of alcohol administered to each volunteer was calculated based on
adaptations of previously published mathematical formulas (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>), using weight, height, age, amount of body water, and
gender.</p><p>The current Brazilian Traffic Code (&#x0201c;C&#x000f3;digo Brasileiro de Tr&#x000e2;nsito&#x0201d;) established a
limit of zero tolerance for alcohol intake by drivers (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Thus, in this study, we adopted the U.S. legal limit of
0.08-0.10% blood alcohol concentration (BAC) (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>) for standardization purposes. The desired alcohol level was 0.08%
BAC.</p><p>The volunteers had 15 min to drink the amount required, and the experiments began 30
min after they had finished. The ethyl meter BFD-50 was used to estimate the blood
alcohol level before the experimental session, at 30 and 50 min after ingestion, and
at the end of each session.</p><p>The forced-choice psychophysical method was used to measure the CSF of all
participants in both conditions (with and without the ingestion of alcohol). In this
method, the volunteer had to choose which of two stimuli contained the test stimulus
(<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). The forced-choice method is based on
the probability of consecutive hits by the volunteer. The criterion used to measure
contrast sensitivity to spatial frequencies was that after three consecutive correct
choices, contrast was reduced by 20%, and after an error contrast was increased by
the same amount. We measured 10 peaks and valleys as contrast estimate values for
each of the 12 spatial frequencies used. Thus, the number of presentations varied
among both spatial frequencies and volunteers. The experimental session was finished
as soon as 10 maximum and minimum values were obtained.</p><p>During each experimental session, stimulus pairs were presented in sequence. The
session began with a high pitch beep, followed immediately by the presentation of the
first stimulus for 2 s. After a delay of 1 s, the second stimulus was presented for
another 2 s and was followed by the response of the volunteer. The two stimuli were
always presented in random order. When the volunteer's answer was correct, it was
followed by a low pitch beep, and an interval of 3 s preceded the next pair
presentation.</p><p>Before the session, the volunteers were told to press the left mouse button when they
thought the test stimulus (spatial frequency) was presented in the first 2-s
interval, and right-click if they thought that it was presented in the second 2-s
interval - that is, after the neutral stimulus. The volunteer's task was always to
choose the stimulus that contained one of the spatial frequencies.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>On average, all volunteers presented an alcohol level intake corresponding to M=0.07115%

in the midrange frequencies and decreased sensitivity at low and high frequencies.
Contrast sensitivity in the EC was of the order of 1.0 and was 1.0 times more sensitive
than CC at the frequencies 2.5 and 4 cpd. On the other hand, the CC contrast sensitivity

P&#x0003c;0.05), as well as for the interaction between experimental conditions and spatial
frequencies (F<sub>5,1995</sub>=3.626, P&#x0003c;0.05). Analyses with the <italic>post
hoc</italic> Newman-Keuls test showed significant differences between the CC and EC
only in the spatial frequency of 4 cpd (P&#x0003c;0.0001). Thus, alcohol intake increased
sensitivity at 4 cpd where maximum sensitivity occurred in both experimental
conditions.</p><p>With the use of angular frequency, alcohol increased the sensitivity at low frequencies
and increased sensitivity at medium and high frequencies. Contrast sensitivity of EC was
1.2, 1.0, and 1.0 times more sensitive than that of the CC at the frequencies 1, 2, and

the EC at frequencies 24, 48, and 96 cycles/360&#x000b0;, respectively. The range of greater
sensitivity in both conditions was at frequencies of 24 and 48 cycles/360&#x000b0;.</p><p>ANOVA for repeated measures, with two within factors, showed a significant difference in
effect between conditions (F<sub>1,399</sub>=14.393, P&#x0003c;0.05), between spatial
frequencies (F<sub>5,1995</sub>=1023.820, P&#x0003c;0.05), and between the interaction

significant differences between the CC and EC in the frequencies 1, 24, and 48
cycles/360&#x000b0;. Thus, alcohol intake increased sensitivity at an angular frequency of 1
cycle/360&#x000b0; and decreased sensitivity at the range of maximum sensitivity, i.e., at 24
and 48 cycles/360&#x000b0; angular frequencies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study focused on basic issues related to processing of visual contrast and alcohol
intake. Two contrast sensitivity functions were used to describe changes in the human
visual system performance related to alcohol intake. The results using sine-wave
gratings and angular frequency stimuli showed that the CSF for both classes of spatial
frequencies were affected by alcohol drinking. These changes were expected, considering
the main findings in the literature for spatial frequencies in Cartesian coordinates
(<xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>).</p><p>In a previous study (<xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>), the visual contrast
sensitivity (VCS) was measured in 30 alcohol and tobacco abuse patients and 52 controls.
They used eight vertical sinusoidal gratings with spatial frequency ranging from 0.1 to
9 cycles/degree (c/d). In patients, the mean reduction of VCS at all spatial frequencies
was 2.49 dB below the level of the control group. But the VCS deficit was larger for
high spatial frequencies (9, 6, and 4 c/d) and low frequencies (0.1 and 0.3 c/d) than
for medium frequencies (1 and 2 c/d).</p><p>In another study (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>), the separate and combined
effects of the detrimental factors of low luminance, alcohol consumption, stimulus
motion, and glare on contrast sensitivity (CS) for 1.5, 3.0, and 6.0 cycles per degree
sine-wave gratings were investigated in twelve participants. Results related loss in CS
for stationary and moving sine-wave gratings as a function of BAC that ranged from 0.044
to 0.088%. The effects were not limited to intermediate spatial frequencies (3.0 and 6.0
cpd); large losses were also found at 1.5 cpd. Furthermore, the contrast sensitivity
loss was immense (0.92 log unit) at the spatial frequency to which humans are most
sensitive during daytime, namely 3.0 cpd.</p><p>The influence of acute ingestion of alcohol was previously investigated using three
breath measurement levels of blood alcohol (0.00, 0.05, and 0.1% BAC) on distant visual
acuity, stereoacuity, contrast sensitivity, accommodation, resting focus of
accommodation and binocular vision (<xref rid="B07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Contrast
sensitivity, stereoacuity and binocular vision were affected at both 0.05 and 0.1% BAC,
but only the higher spatial frequencies of contrast sensitivity (18 cpd) were affected.
Significant reductions were observed between placebo and 0.05 and 0.1% BAC at this
frequency. The investigators concluded that the impairment of oculomotor control,
stereocuity and contrast sensitivity, even in the low dosage condition, might be
explained in part by not employing a more sensitive technique and by the depressant
effect exerted by alcohol upon the reticular formation.</p><p>In order to gain a more complete picture of the influence of alcohol on visual
performance, CS was measured for a range of spatial (0.5, 0.75, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and
14 cycles per degree) and temporal frequencies (1, 3, 6, and 12 Hz) in individuals with
moderate blood alcohol concentration (0.06% BAC) (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). The average sensitivity loss over all spatial frequencies was
approximately 43%. The largest effects were observed at the lowest and highest
frequencies, with the smallest effect in the middle range.</p><p>The effects of alcohol on contrast discrimination have been measured in a study (<xref rid="B02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) that explored whether the deficits could be
explained as a consequence of reduction in contrast gain. Detection thresholds and
contrast increment thresholds under placebo and alcohol (0.06% BAC) conditions were
measured in six volunteers. Alcohol was found to impair both detection and
discrimination only at high spatial frequencies.</p><p>In our study, we expected a reduction over the whole range of spatial frequencies
related to alcohol intake. We did not expect a significant increase in sensitivity to
the low angular frequency of 1 cycle/360&#x000b0;.</p><p>The results of a significant reduction of sensitivity in vertical sine-wave gratings of
0.5 cpg and angular frequencies of 24 and 48 cycles/360&#x000b0; are consistent with studies
that found a reduced sensitivity to high spatial frequencies (<xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). However, only one
study (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>) reported the levels of luminance used
(0.129 and 12.9 cd/m<sup>2</sup>), and assigned to such luminance levels the effect of
greater loss of sensitivity in the high spatial frequencies.</p><p>On the other hand, some studies found no change in contrast sensitivity with the use of
static stimuli at 0.08% BAC (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). This difference from the results of the above
studies may be due to differences in the methodological aspects (luminance, and stimuli
alcohol concentrations) used in each study.</p><p>Some hypotheses found in the literature may explain these results. The inhibitory neural
mechanisms of interaction are more affected by alcohol than excitatory mechanisms (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Alcohol would promote decreased activity of
inhibitory mechanisms; as stated earlier, a major inhibitory mechanism in the visual
system involves the organization of the receptive fields of cells through lateral
inhibition. This mechanism is important for the perception of spatial information with
high levels of detail (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>), and confirms the
findings of reduced sensitivity in the high spatial frequencies and an increase in low
frequencies.</p><p>The magnocellular pathway, related to spatial location, may be more affected by alcohol
than the parvocellular pathway, which is related to the detection of texture and detail
(<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). We found no evidence of impairment in
the magnocellular pathway. However, it is a luminance condition, and not the spatial
frequencies that determines which system is changed.</p><p>This study used a luminance level of 41.05 cd/m<sup>2</sup>. The measurement of CSF in
terms of photopic luminance provides an indication of the responsiveness of the
parvocellular pathway, which receives afferents mainly from the fovea and is specialized
in processing fine details of objects, namely at middle and high frequencies (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>).</p><p>At high luminance levels, the range of maximum sensitivity for spatial frequencies
vertical sine-wave gratings occurs around 3 to 4 cpd (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). For the angular frequency stimuli, maximum sensitivities occur in the
range of 24 to 48 cycles/360&#x000b0;. In this sense, alcohol altered maximum sensitivity in
both patterns of spatial frequencies when using photopic luminance conditions. Similar
results have been found with vertical sine-wave gratings (<xref rid="B02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>), leading to the conclusion that the observed changes in
discrimination might simply have been a result of a shift in detection threshold after
alcohol ingestion, rather than any changes in contrast gain mechanisms.</p><p>The data discussed so far show that the sensitivity of the visual system to certain
stimuli depends on the spatial, physical, mathematical model, and the coordinate system
(Cartesian or polar) that define them. Taking into account these considerations, the
results of the present study, and the data in the available literature, we can infer
that the visual system uses different mechanisms or pathways for processing sine-wave
gratings and angular frequency stimuli, and that alcohol possibly affects both systems.
