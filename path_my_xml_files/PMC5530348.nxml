Year 2 results show that the efficacy of TCZ<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> was maintained for extended treatment periods; patients with early RA who received 8&#x02005;mg/kg TCZ+MTX or 8&#x02005;mg/kg TCZ monotherapy exhibited sustained improvement in disease activity and maintained inhibition of joint damage during their second year of treatment. In both 8&#x02005;mg/kg TCZ groups, week 52 improvements were maintained through week 104 for DAS28-ESR remission and LDA, ACR 20/50/70 responses and radiographic progression. The best responses were consistently observed in the 8&#x02005;mg/kg TCZ+MTX group, particularly for radiographic endpoints. Maintenance of response with 8&#x02005;mg/kg TCZ monotherapy suggests that early TCZ therapy is a viable option for patients intolerant of MTX. Some patients in the TCZ groups who did not achieve DAS28-ESR LDA by week 52 achieved remission by week 104 in a post hoc analysis, suggesting that longer treatment may be required to observe efficacy in some patients.</p><p>In escape patients who received 4&#x02005;mg/kg TCZ+MTX or placebo+MTX in the first year and 8&#x02005;mg/kg TCZ+MTX in the second year, further efficacy improvements were generally observed from escape through week 104 for DAS28-ESR, ACR and radiographic endpoints. Although comparable DAS28-ESR remission rates were observed between escape patients who received 8&#x02005;mg/kg TCZ+MTX in the second year and patients who received 8&#x02005;mg/kg TCZ+MTX throughout, ACR response rates were lower and the overall degree of joint damage was greater in escape patients, highlighting the importance of early initiation of therapy.</p><p>Improvements in the placebo+MTX escape group were comparable to those of patients receiving 8&#x02005;mg/kg TCZ throughout. Serum TCZ concentrations were maintained at similar levels between the 8&#x02005;mg/kg TCZ+placebo and 8&#x02005;mg/kg TCZ+MTX groups, indicating that, in contrast to adalimumab,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> MTX does not appear to have an additive effect on serum drug levels. Only nine patients tested positive for neutralising anti-TCZ antibodies, none of whom withdrew because of insufficient therapeutic response or loss of efficacy, consistent with previous reports.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
</p><p>Because of the complexity of multiple comparisons, all week 104 analyses were exploratory, which is a limitation of this study. Post-week 52 data for the 4&#x02005;mg/kg TCZ+MTX and placebo+MTX groups should be interpreted with caution given the large number of patients switching to escape therapy. This meant the data were enriched for patients who achieved DAS28 LDA at week 52 for endpoints at which escape patients were set to missing and possibly underestimated for endpoints at which they were considered non-responders.</p><p>The most common AEs/SAEs in all groups were infections. Although there was no clear difference in the rate of infections between the TCZ and placebo+MTX groups, the rate of serious infections was numerically higher with TCZ (95% CIs overlapping). Rates of infection and serious infection did not appear to increase over time. Safety was consistent with the known TCZ safety profile. The low incidence of gastrointestinal perforations may reflect less exposure to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and corticosteroids. No new safety signals were identified in this MTX-naive patient population with early RA.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The first draft of the manuscript was prepared by the authors, with professional writing and editorial assistance provided by Jennifer Adlington, PhD, Sara Duggan, PhD, and Meryl Mandle, who provided writing services on behalf of F.
