Evidence shows disease management programmes are one of the most cost-effective measures to prevent re-hospitalisation for COPD exacerbation, but lack implementation and economic appraisal in China. The aims of the proposed study are to determine whether a hospital outreach invention programme for disease management can decrease hospitalisations and medical costs in patients with COPD in China. Economic appraisal of the programme will also be carried out.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>A randomised single-blinded controlled trial will be conducted. 220 COPD patients with exacerbations will be recruited from the Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, China. After hospital discharge they will be randomly allocated into an intervention or a control group. Participants in the intervention group will attend a 3-month hospital-based pulmonary rehabilitation intervention and then receive a home-based programme. Both groups will receive identical usual discharge care before discharge from hospital. The primary outcomes will include rate of hospitalisation and medical cost, while secondary outcomes will include mortality, self-efficacy, self-management, health status, quality of life, exercise tolerance and pulmonary function, which will be evaluated at baseline and at 3, 12 and 24&#x02005;months after the intervention. Cost-effectiveness analysis will be employed for economic appraisal.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The study has been approved by the institutional review board (IRB) of the Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University (IRB2014-S159). Findings will be shared widely through conference presentations and peer-reviewed publications. Furthermore, the results of the programme will be submitted to health authorities and policy reform will be recommended.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p>Chi CTR-TRC-14005108; Pre-results.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Strengths and limitations of this study</title></caption><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>This study will be the first randomised controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of a hospital outreach intervention programme to prevent re-hospitalisations and decrease medical costs in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in China.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Economic appraisal of the hospital outreach intervention programme will be carried.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The aim of the study is to develop a disease management model suitable for COPD patients in China.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Recruitment of participants from a single clinic will limit the generalisability of the study findings to patients in similar hospitals.</p></list-item></list></boxed-text><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and results in an economic and social burden.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> The WHO and World Bank reported that COPD is the fourth leading cause of death and has the fifth highest disease burden globally.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> The prevalence of COPD is 4.96% in the USA.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> The problem is even more severe in China, which has over 300 million cigarette smokers.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> The prevalence of COPD in China is 8.2%,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> accounting for 1.28 million deaths annually, which is higher than for coronary heart disease (1 million). It is the only major disease whose mortality rate is increasing.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Exacerbation of COPD is defined as an acute event characterised by a worsening of the patient's respiratory symptoms that is beyond normal day-to-day variations and leads to a change in regular medication.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5&#x02013;7</xref> Exacerbations have a significant impact on COPD patients such as increasing the long-term decline in lung function and resulting in a deterioration in health status and risk of death.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8&#x02013;12</xref> Furthermore, exacerbation is a major cause of COPD patients requiring hospital admission,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> which hospitalisations account for 70% of the treatment costs for this disease.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13&#x02013;15</xref></p><p>Researchers have previously explored the interventions used in disease management programmes for patients with COPD, such as pulmonary rehabilitation, outreach nursing, multidisciplinary care, patient self-management, patient counselling and education, and case management.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> The effectiveness of these interventions has also been investigated: original studies reported that these programmes improved exercise capability and health-related quality of life, and decreased hospitalisations for COPD exacerbation in patients.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18&#x02013;20</xref></p><p>Implementing an outreach system has been generally accepted as an effective means of providing support services to improve chronic disease management in the outpatient setting.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></p><p>Currently, COPD patients in China receive healthcare only in hospitals with no outreach follow-up or services provided after discharge, although hospital outreach interventions have been a focus of public hospital reforms undertaken by the Ministry of Health since 2009. Some hospital&#x02013;community integrated programmes for COPD have been conducted in China and their effectiveness verified.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> In these programmes, care was primarily provided by community healthcare providers, so the intervention is suitable for patients with mild to moderate disease but not patients with severe disease. Patient adherence to treatment is very important and includes taking the correct medication, pulmonary rehabilitation, smoking cessation, and self-management. It is therefore key to develop a hospital outreach system to ensure a continuum of hospital care and maintain patients&#x02019; motivation regarding adherence to healthy behaviour.</p><p>Economic analyses of healthcare interventions are increasingly necessary, especially since skilled allocation of scarce healthcare resources is particularly important in a developing country. Cost-effectiveness analysis of several COPD disease management programmes has been carried out previously.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>
<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> A recent meta-analysis showed that such programmes can lead to significant savings in hospital costs and total healthcare costs.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> However, prior to our study, no randomised controlled trials of the effect and the costs of hospital outreach intervention programmes for patients with COPD in China were available.</p><p>The proposed study seeks to develop, deliver and evaluate a hospital outreach invention programme for patients with COPD, aiming at preventing exacerbations and thus reducing readmissions and medical costs. It is hypothesised that the hospital outreach intervention programme will provide cost-effective disease management by improving adherence to medication, physical exercise, self-management and smoking cessation in patients with COPD, resulting in fewer exacerbations, less hospitalisations and lower medical costs. This will be tested in this study.</p><sec id="s1a"><title>Goal and objectives</title><p>The overall goal of the project is to develop, deliver and evaluate a hospital outreach intervention for patients with COPD.

Recruitment will be undertaken among patients with COPD hospitalised for exacerbations in the Third Xiangya Hospital of the Central South University. Two main recruiting approaches will be used. First, potentially eligible patients will be identified through a review of electronic medical records in the hospital information system. The physicians of eligible patients will be notified of their patients' eligibility, and then asked for permission to enrol these patients in the study. Thereafter, the physician and researcher will approach the patients for screening, consent and a baseline visit. Second, physicians will be asked to identify patients with COPD on the wards. Study investigators will explain the study rationale, significance and procedures to the physicians each month. At this time, physicians will be given a business card that lists the eligibility criteria and contact information for the researcher. Once a patient fulfilling the inclusion criteria is identified, the researcher will approach the patient and complete the eligibility screen, consent and baseline data collection.</p><fig id="BMJOPEN2015009988F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>CONSORT diagram of trial study flow and participant numbers.

Cost and outcomes will be modelled individually as dependent variables. The following will be used: a dummy variable to indicate 1 as the intervention (I) and 0 as control as a key independent variable, a pre-post (P) dummy variable (1 is post, 0 is pre) and an interaction variable (I&#x000d7;P) to account for the pre/post difference, plus other confounding factors such as stage of COPD, age, gender, education, as other independent variables.

Equivalence will be examined at group assignment to the intervention and control groups using the Mann-Whitley U test, &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test, t-test or ANOVA. Clinical outcomes will include the indicators of self-efficacy, self-management, 6MWT, pulmonary function, perceived health status and quality of life. For the intervention and control groups, the indicators at baseline and at 3, 12 and 24&#x02005;months will be compared with repeated measures ANOVA. Comparison of these outcome indicators between the intervention and control groups will be conducted using the t-test. The primary outcomes will include hospitalisation and medical costs. The rate of hospitalisation will be calculated as follows: rate=hospitalised persons&#x000d7;hospitalised days/observed persons&#x000d7;observed days. The effects on hospitalisation rate will be tested with the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test. The effects on medical cost will be tested with the t-test.</p></sec><sec id="s2j"><title>Intention to treat</title><p>Outcome will be analysed on the basis of intention to treat (ITT). First, the principles of ITT will be applied to test the effects of attrition, meaning that all patients who have been randomised will be included in the analysis. Missing endpoints will be imputed using the expectation-maximisation (EM) algorithm. To gauge the robustness of the outcomes, this analysis will be repeated using the multiple-imputation approach. Second, propensity score analysis will also be employed using a logistic model (1 for adherence and 0 for attrition; 1 for intervention and 0 for control) to predict the probability of being in adherence/intervention. The predicted variable will then be used to replace the attrition/control dummy variable.</p></sec><sec id="s2k"><title>Data management</title><p>Only the principal investigator and the research coordinator will have access to the database during the study period. All data will be recorded by remote data entry into a web-based electronic case report form developed for the study by the Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University. The electronic case report form data will be anonymous and will identify study participants by their assigned study numbers only. All missing data, possible duplications and data outside preset limits for each parameter will be queried by the management centre, and will be internally validated before database lock. Participant files will be maintained in storage for 3&#x02005;years after completion of the study. The data manager will respond by checking the original forms for inconsistency, checking other sources to determine the correct data, and modifying the original (paper) form by entering a response to the query. Note that it will be necessary for data managers to respond to each query received in order to obtain closure on the queried item.</p></sec><sec id="s2l"><title>Study steering committee</title><p>The study steering committee will consist of one principal investigator, three physicians and two representatives from the data monitoring centre, and will be responsible for all quality control activities, assessing adherence to the trial protocol, enrolment, adverse events and compliance reports, and making the final decision to terminate the trial.

This study will address an important problem: although awareness of COPD is increasing in China, healthcare management still focuses on the acute stage during hospitalisation and relies primarily on pharmacological treatment while the management of stable disease is neglected.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> We hope to offer some strategies to strengthen disease management in COPD patients.</p><p>Original studies and systematic review have analysed the cost-effectiveness of many disease management programmes for COPD.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36&#x02013;38</xref> However, as our programme will be different from previous projects, a specific economic evaluation will need to be carried out. First, we will analyse the consumption of health services by 220 patients with COPD over 24&#x02005;months. In most previous studies, the follow-up period for assessing the effectiveness of disease management in COPD lasted 12&#x02005;months or less,<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> so we will have a relatively long observation period. Second, the cost estimates are based on reliable sources. Third, all costs associated with the intervention programme will be identified and measured.</p><p>This study will allow us to ascertain whether the hospital outreach intervention programme can prevent exacerbations, reduce re-hospitalisation, decrease medical costs, be cost-effective, increase self-efficacy, facilitate self-management, promote exercise tolerance, improve health status and lung function, and increase the quality of life of COPD patients in China.</p><p>The results of our study will contribute information on the effectiveness of a hospital outreach intervention programme for patients with COPD, provide better understanding and management of COPD, and raise the question of whether the programme could be extended to other chronic diseases. A summary report of the programme will be submitted to the health authorities and policy reform will be recommended.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to acknowledge the entire staff of the respiratory ward and rehabilitation centre of the Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University for their help.
