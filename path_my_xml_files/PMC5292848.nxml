Patients experiencing an initial seizure duration of &#x0003c;15 s or &#x0003e;120 s achieve a less favorable response to ECT.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Initially, lack of adequate anesthesia or muscle relaxation during ECT lead to bone fractures, dislocation of joints, biting of tongue, and tearing of muscle fibers. In addition, lack of knowledge about the dose parameters of the electric stimulation leads to more adverse cognitive effects.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] ECT can produce severe disturbances in the cardiovascular system, most commonly a transient period of hypertension and changes in the heart rate (HR).[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] When an electrical current is applied to the brain, the resultant EEG spike and wave activity is accompanied by a generalized motor seizure and an acute cardiovascular response, which results in marked increase in cerebral blood flow and intracranial pressure.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] The hemodynamic response to ECT can produce myocardial ischemia and even infarction,[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] as well as transient neurologic ischemic deficits, intracerebral hemorrhages, and cortical blindness.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Due to trauma caused to the patient physically and psychologically with unmodified direct ECT in the past, it has now been modified with anesthesia.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] These cardiovascular changes may be altered using various anesthetic drugs and the violent muscular contractions occurring during the convulsions can be reduced by the use of muscle relaxants.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] This study was undertaken to compare the effects of intravenous (IV) sodium thiopentone, propofol, and etomidate, used as IV anesthetic agents in modified ECT as regards, induction time and quality of anesthesia, alteration of hemodynamics, seizure duration, and recovery time.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>After approval from the Institutional ethical committee and written consent from the patient and relatives, the study was conducted in the department of anesthesiology at our Institute. A total of 90 patients in the age group of 16&#x02013;60 years of either sex, who had to undergo ECT therapy were enrolled in the study. Patients with full stomach, neuromuscular disorders, hypertension and other cardiovascular disorders, epilepsy, hypopituitarism, drug allergy and major illnesses like bronchial asthma and tuberculosis, were excluded from the study. Patients were divided randomly into three equal groups, consisting of thirty patients each, Group A, Group B and Group C. Group A received propofol 1% &#x02013; 1.5 mg/Kg, Group B received etomidate &#x02013; 0.2 mg/Kg and Group C received thiopentone 2.5% &#x02013; 5 mg/Kg. All the patients were kept fasting for 6 h and continued antipsychotic treatment until the day of the procedure (1 h before ECT).</p><p>After entering the procedure room, patients were attached to the baseline monitor for continuous monitoring of HR, electrocardiogram, noninvasive blood pressure and oxygen saturation (Spo<sub>2</sub>). An IV line was established, and all the patients were premedicated with IV glycopyrrolate 0.2 mg. Patients were preoxygenated with 100% oxygen for 3 min. General anesthesia was induced with IV anesthetic agent as per the group allocated, till loss of eyelid reflexes. IV succinylcholine 0.5 mg/kg was administered to all patients for neuromuscular relaxation. When fasciculations subsided and adequate neuromuscular relaxation was obtained, an adequate sized bite block was inserted to prevent tongue bite. A brief pulse stimulus for about 1&#x02013;3 s, frequency 60&#x02013;90 Hz and pulse width of 1 was given to produce seizures. Seizure duration was monitored by isolated limb method. Subsequently, all the patients were ventilated with face mask with 100% oxygen at a rate of 14&#x02013;18 breaths/min until spontaneous breathing returned and patient recovered clinically from the state of anesthesia. All the patients were monitored for changes in HR, respiratory rate, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and Spo<sub>2</sub> at basal, after induction and 1 min, 2 min, 3 min, 5 min, 10 min, 20 min, and 30 min following ECT. Duration of recovery was recorded from injection of anesthetic agent to time taken to obey vocal commands such as opening of eyes, time for ability to sit unaided and time taken to meet discharge criteria.

In patients with severe cardiovascular disease, acute increases in arterial pressure and/or HR may be hazardous, and indeed, the most common causes of mortality following ECT are myocardial infarction and ventricular dysrhythmias.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] During our study, we found that increase in the systemic arterial pressure following ECT, with propofol, was comparatively less than that with etomidate and thiopentone. Change in the mean SBP, in propofol group, was 25&#x02013;30 mmHg above the preinduction value in the first 2 min and reached to the preinduction value at 30 min. With etomidate, mean SBP increased by 40&#x02013;45 mmHg above the preinduction value in the first 2 min while with thiopentone, change in the mean SBP was 45&#x02013;50 mmHg above the baseline value in the first 2 min. Propofol also caused a little increase in mean DBP (compared to etomidate and thiopentone), with the mean change being around 9&#x02013;13 mmHg above the preinduction value in the first 2 min. With etomidate, the mean DBP increased by 15&#x02013;20 mmHg above the preinduction value in first 2 min and with thiopentone, an increase of 24&#x02013;26 mmHg was observed. HR changes following propofol was significantly lower than that following etomidate and thiopentone in first 2 min of ECT. The mean change in HR after ECT varied from 40 to 45 beats/min above preinduction values with etomidate and thiopentone. While with propofol the HR change was 15&#x02013;18 beats/min above the pre-induction values in the first 2 min followed by a decrease in the HR over the next 10 min.

The increase in HR, SBP, and DBP after ECT was observed in all the three groups but it was statistically highly significant in thiopentone group and etomidate group. Propofol blunt the sympathetic response, so there was less increase in HR, SBP, and DBP. In this study propofol seemed superior to thiopentone and etomidate in attenuating the physiological response to ECT with minimal hemodynamic changes. No dysrhythmias were seen during ECT, in our study.</p><p>Although all the three drugs used in this study showed a very short time for recovery, the best one was propofol (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). This correlates well with the study conducted by Rosa <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] Clinical superiority for practical purposes could not be proved, as time differences detected were around only about 2 min between drug groups. An important point is that higher charges given are commonly associated with more frequent post-ictal confusion. The significantly higher mean charge used with propofol did not prevent it to show the best post anesthetic recovery profile.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The present study concluded that there were individual advantages of all three inducing agents over one another when the study parameters were individualized. Propofol had the advantage of smooth induction, stable hemodynamic parameters, and rapid recovery as compared to etomidate and thiopentone. However it was associated with shorter seizure duration. Thiopentone sodium had the advantage over propofol of having longer seizure duration at the cost of a relatively prolonged recovery period. Etomidate had a definite advantage of a longer seizure duration which could be used for better clinical efficacy over thiopentone sodium and propofol. However it was associated with myoclonic jerks during induction.</p><p>There was no clear advantage of any drug over another when all the study parameters were considered.
