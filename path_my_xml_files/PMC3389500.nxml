Worldwide, more than 600 patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) have been treated with HSCT, most of them having been recruited in small, single-centre, phase 1&#x02013;2 uncontrolled trials. Clinical and magnetic resonance imaging outcomes from case series reports or Registry-based analyses suggest that a major response is achieved in most patients; quality and duration of response are better in patients transplanted during the relapsing&#x02013;remitting phase than in those in the secondary progressive stage.</p></sec><sec><title>Objectives:</title><p>An interdisciplinary group of neurologists and haematologists has been formed, following two international meetings supported by the European and American Blood and Marrow Transplantation Societies, for the purpose of discussing a controlled clinical trial, to be designed within the new scenarios of evolving MS treatments.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Objectives of the trial, patient selection, transplant technology and outcome assessment were extensively discussed. The outcome of this process is summarized in the present paper, with the goal of establishing the background and advancing the development of a prospective, randomized, controlled multicentre trial to assess the clinical efficacy of HSCT for the treatment of highly active MS.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation</kwd><kwd>prospective clinical trial</kwd><kwd>multiple sclerosis</kwd><kwd>consensus</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="section1-1352458512438454"><title>Introduction</title><p>Current treatments of multiple sclerosis (MS) include high-dose corticosteroids for the treatment of exacerbations and long-term immuno-modulation/-suppression to reduce the number and severity of relapses, and slow down the progression of disability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458512438454">1</xref></sup> The intensity of the immunosuppression is to some extent proportional to the risk of side effects and to the clinical response, expressed in terms of capacity to reduce the frequency of relapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1352458512438454">Figure 1</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458512438454">2</xref></sup> However, no disease-modifying agent (DMA) has been conclusively shown to significantly alter long-term outcomes; moreover, a subset of patients presents with aggressive disease which responds poorly to conventional treatments.

The risk of treatment-related mortality (TRM) in HSCT, conventionally perceived to be unacceptably high, has decreased since 2001 to 1.3%, according to an analysis of the European Blood and Marrow Transplantation Group (EBMT, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ebmt.org">www.ebmt.org</ext-link>) Registry,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1352458512438454">7</xref></sup> likely due the avoidance of aggressive regimens which resulted in frequent toxicity. In particular, the use of busulfan was found to be significantly associated with higher TRM in multivariate analysis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1352458512438454">21</xref></sup> and high doses of rabbit anti-T-lymphocyte globulin (ATG), associated with ex-vivo T-cell depletion and an intense conditioning regimen (CR), resulted in unexpected occurrence of EBV-associated lymphomas.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1352458512438454">22</xref></sup> In 2004, the EBMT launched a prospective, randomized phase 2 trial (ASTIMS, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.astims.org">www.astims.org</ext-link>) comparing autologous HSCT with mitoxantrone, with new MRI lesions as the primary endpoint (number of new T2 lesions at 1 and 2 years after the randomization). In total, 21 patients were randomized to the two trial arms and the follow-up analysis is currently ongoing. Two phase 2, single-arm trials were carried out in the USA (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.halt-ms.org">www.halt-ms.org</ext-link>; or <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov">www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>, id.

NCT01099930), respectively; both trials closed accrual in 2010. The Canadian trial has reported results in preliminary form showing complete suppression of relapses and of new MRI lesions in 23 evaluable patients over a median follow-up of 5 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1352458512438454">12</xref></sup> The US HALT-MS trial preliminary results in 25 patients with highly active, treatment-refractory RRMS have reported a 77% event-free survival at 2 years post-HSCT utilizing a stringent composite endpoint that included relapses, new MRI lesions and progression of neurological disability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1352458512438454">23</xref></sup></p><p>The cumulative experience described above is highly suggestive of a strong treatment effect of HSCT on inflammatory manifestations of MS, but the efficacy and safety of HSCT compared with currently available therapies has not yet been established. In November 2008 a meeting of experts in MS and bone marrow transplantation was held in Minneapolis under the auspices of Center for International Blood &#x00026; Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR), the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), and the EBMT in order to establish shared criteria for the assessment of efficacy of HSCT in MS and evaluate the feasibility of a new prospective, multicentre trial.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1352458512438454">24</xref></sup> One year later EBMT and NIAID supported an international meeting in Florence, aimed to update knowledge and strategies of HSCT for AD. Panels of specialists were appointed for each major AD (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.adflorence.org">www.adflorence.org</ext-link>) and the MS panel included neurologists, haematologists and statisticians from both Europe and North America.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1352458512438454">25</xref></sup> There was uniform agreement about the need for a prospective, controlled trial aimed at investigating the role of HSCT in the treatment of aggressive MS. This report describes the progress to date of this interdisciplinary group of specialists in the design of such a trial.</p></sec><sec id="section2-1352458512438454"><title>Choice of trial</title><p>Two approaches to a prospective trial were considered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1352458512438454">Figure 2</xref>): a cohort trial, where patients fulfilling homogeneous criteria of disability and unsatisfactory response to approved treatments are registered, treated according to the policy of each participating centre (including the transplantation option) and prospectively followed-up. This approach would likely find higher acceptance and easier implementation; however, it would be expected to add little knowledge to the existing data. Therefore, all panellists agreed that a large, international, phase 3, randomized trial with a clinical endpoint is currently needed. This should be a phase 3 study where patients are randomized between autologous HSCT and the appropriate non-HSCT comparator.</p><fig id="fig2-1352458512438454" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Prospective clinical trials for HSCT in MS.

Although some discussants favoured a single agent (e.g. natalizumab), there were prevailing concerns that some agent/s might not be available in all participating countries. Approval of an additional 3&#x02013;4 new therapies for RRMS is foreseen in the next 2 years,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458512438454">1</xref></sup> with differences in their introduction expected in different countries due to regulatory issues. Furthermore, there is no standard of therapy for patients failing approved treatments for MS who are eligible for HSCT, therefore they are treated differently according to centre policy and local regulations on drugs and reimbursement policies. As a result of these considerations, a consensus view emerged that the trial should be designed with randomization between autologous HSCT and Best Available and Approved Treatment (BAAT). The BAAT is defined as, and will consist of, the treatment available as licensed therapy to the individual patient in his/her country of residence and approved under the applicable healthcare scheme.</p></sec><sec id="section4-1352458512438454"><title>Trial goals</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>To establish the safety and efficacy of autologous HSCT in comparison with approved therapies in a specific subset of highly active RRMS;</p></list-item><list-item><p>To address questions related to the immunopathogenesis of MS by accompanying mechanistic studies;</p></list-item><list-item><p>To create a comprehensive repository of biosamples for planned and future mechanistic studies.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec id="section5-1352458512438454"><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>The definition of inclusion criteria was felt to be a key point. The aim of the panellists was to capture a subset of patients with relatively early MS who are at high risk of suffering early disease progression based on their high inflammatory activity. Prognostic predictions are difficult in MS, and three domains were considered important to formulate criteria that select subjects at greater risk of poor prognosis and potential eligibility for the trial: (1) clinically significant relapses; (2) MRI activity; and (3) treatment failure. The following specific criteria were selected:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Patients aged 18&#x02013;45 years with Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score between 2.5 and 5.5, who are within 5 years from initiation of the first therapy with DMAs and who fulfil the criteria for highly active RRMS within the past 2 years.<list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>&#x025cb; The definition of &#x02018;highly active&#x02019; RRMS includes:<list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>&#x025a0; &#x02265;1 severe relapses (&#x00394;EDSS &#x02265;1 and Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) of &#x02265;2 in motor, cerebellar or brain stem deficit (or documented changes in neurological examination consistent with these magnitudes) and/or incomplete recovery from clinically significant relapses;</p><p><bold>and</bold></p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x025a0; &#x02265;1 gadolinium-positive (Gd+) lesion of diameter &#x02265; 3 mm <bold>or</bold> accumulation of &#x02265; 0.3 T2 lesions/month in two consecutive MRI 6&#x02013;12 months apart.</p></list-item></list></p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x025cb; Patients are eligible after failure of conventional treatment.</p></list-item></list></p></list-item></list><p>The upper limit of 45 years was chosen for the following reasons: (1) the low probability of older patients to fulfil the inclusion criteria; (2) their faster shift to the secondary progressive phase of disease;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1352458512438454">26</xref></sup> and (3) one report of a worse outcome after HSCT in patients aged over 40 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1352458512438454">21</xref></sup></p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>&#x025cb; Patients must have failed at least one and up to three subsequent lines of BAAT.

Taking all these considerations into account, it was decided to allow, but not to require, the inclusion of patients after a first-line treatment failure only.

Such response could be defined as PFS lasting 5 years free from further immunosuppressive treatment. A long-term follow-up, such as the proportion of patients still progression-free at a given interval (e.g. 3 or 5 years), would greatly increase the discrimination power between the two treatment arms; however, there was consensus that a follow-up duration longer than 2 years before assessing the primary outcome would not be feasible for the core trial. In the ASTIMS trial, randomization prior to HSCT hampered recruitment, due to the rapidly evolving clinical course of patients; this concern should be carefully considered in the trial design. For this reason, we favoured a &#x02018;time to event&#x02019; endpoint, allowing patients initially randomized to BAAT who continue to deteriorate to cross-over to HSCT once they have reached the &#x02018;time to&#x02019; endpoint.</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The primary outcome is the time to treatment failure, compared between treatment arms.<list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>&#x025cb; Definition of treatment failure is the occurrence of a severe relapse (see above) or sustained EDSS worsening (i.e. increase by 0.5 for any EDSS &#x02265;5.5 or 1.0 for any EDSS &#x0003c;5.5, confirmed after 3&#x02013;6 months), or a new (Gd+) lesion &#x02265;3 mm or accumulation of &#x0003e;0.3 mm T2 lesions/month in two consecutive MRI 6&#x02013;12 months apart.</p></list-item></list></p></list-item></list><p>Patients reaching the primary endpoint will be given the chance to receive the treatment of the other arm (i.e. HSCT in case of failure of the control treatment; and vice versa).</p><p>This primary endpoint optimizes the trial design, in that it requires a shorter follow-up as compared with a 2-year trial based on a relapse rate endpoint, and preserves a similar statistical power, especially in case of early post-treatment treatment failure events.

However, the choice of the CR for a large, prospective, multicentre trial needs to be based on published data either from prospective studies and/or from Registry analysis, and therefore BEAM was considered the best choice at the current time.

However, many questions remain regarding the therapeutic mechanisms of autologous HSCT, and these should be examined during the prospective phase 3 trial. Therefore, a comprehensive repository of biomaterials should be created in order to allow interested investigators to address important questions in parallel with the trial and later. An assessment of immune reconstitution will be integrated in the trial and will be carried out on freshly collected blood specimens. A policy will regulate the utilization of the stored biological samples for qualified research projects, and its implementation will be overseen by a specific study committee.</p></sec><sec id="section10-1352458512438454"><title>Logistics and funding</title><p>The target population of the trial constitutes a relatively small subset of all patients with RRMS, and in order to meet patient accrual within a period of 2 years a large number of countries and participating centres need to be involved. Currently a clear sign of interest has been received from groups in Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Switzerland, the USA, and the UK. Other centres in Brazil, Spain, and the Czech Republic might follow. Each centre will need an established team of MS neurologists and bone marrow transplanters, as well as access to facilities including MRI and a laboratory infrastructure for the collection, characterization and storage of the biological samples for research. Criteria will be established to select centres with the required capacity and experience. Nursing care will require interaction between neurological and haematological nursing staff. A comprehensive plan for data collection, management, quality control and analysis for this complex international study will need to be developed.</p><p>Conducting a phase 3 controlled multi-centre trial comparing a treatment such as autologous HSCT with other treatments will not only be a major organizational effort, but will also be expensive. We do not expect a high level of interest in autologous HSCT for treatment of MS from pharmaceutical companies, which may even consider the treatment as market competition. Therefore, funding will have to be sought from public funding bodies and charitable foundations. A strategy for funding should consider and coordinate public resources at the international (NIH, EU FP-7 or later framework programmes), national (MS societies, national research foundations, governmental funding calls, others), and local (at the respective centres, their universities, cities or states) level.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="section11-1352458512438454"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We believe that the proposed outline protocol represents a solid foundation for the development of a randomized controlled phase 3 trial of HSCT for MS.
