Now-a-days, several experimental studies and to a lesser extent, clinical trials have also emphasized the role of herbs in the treatment of a variety of disorders.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] <italic>Rhus coriaria</italic> L. is a shrub known as &#x0201c;sumac,&#x0201d; belonging to the family of Anacardiaceae.

The methanolic extracts of <italic>R. retinorrhaea</italic> Steud. showed a remarkable radical scavenging effect even at low concentrations. A crude extract of <italic>R. coriaria</italic> exhibits interesting antioxidant properties, expressed by the capacity to either scavenge superoxide radical or uncompetitively inhibit xanthine oxidase.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] One of the main constituents of sumac is GA,[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] which possesses potent antioxidant properties.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Sumac contains various substances, and exactly tannin and GAs may be responsible for the antioxidant ability of this plant.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] <italic>Rhus verniciflua stokes</italic> contains six compounds that this extract could contribute to the antioxidant activities and inhibition of intracellular ROS level.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] <italic>R. coriaria</italic> L., which contains many polyphenols, may prevent diabetes by inhibiting ROS, but further studies are required to show the most active constituent of sumac fruit.</p><p>The significant decrease in hs-CRP in our study can prevent individuals at high risk of developing ischemic heart disease (IHD).[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Choi <italic>et al</italic>. study was consistent with our results that oral administration of the extract of <italic>R. verniciflua</italic> slightly decreased CRP factor in rats and also oral administration (30 mg/kg) of sulfuretin and fustin, which were isolated from the extract significantly decreased CRP factor.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Elevated plasma hs-CRP has also been associated with obesity, IR, and hyperglycemia, suggesting that IR, type 2 diabetes, and IHD may be consequences of the ongoing acute phase response, reflecting a chronic adaptation of the immune system.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] In our study, it seems that the hs-CRP-reducing effect of sumac was due to the decrease of insulin level.

The studies have demonstrated that dietary interventions with flavonoids modulate PON1 activity.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Polyphenols from pomegranate juice increase the stability of binding of PON1 to HDL, thus preserving its activity[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and the grape seed extract increased paraoxonase activities in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Moreover, recent investigations of human cell lines have revealed upregulation of PON1 expression and increased arylesterase activity in hepatic cells exposed to resveratrol, an ingredient of common red wine.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] Similarly, rats fed quercetin showed upregulation of PON1 hepatic expression and increased paraoxonase activity, which was associated with improved protection against LDL oxidation.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] Overall, both paraoxonase and arylesterase were lower in diabetic patients and a flavonoid-rich diet is positively associated with PON1 arylesterase activity in them.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Flavonoids can achieve this beneficial effect via several mechanisms. <italic>In vitro</italic> copper-induced loss of PON1 arylesterase activity in micellar solution is prevented by coincubation with the flavonoids quercetin and glabridin, but not with &#x003b1;-tocopherol.
