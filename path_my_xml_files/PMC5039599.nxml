Despite that, however, few studies have tested such effect on cariogenic bacteria. This is due to the complexity of oral flora and difficulties of measuring such effect. The aim of this study is to examine the effect of Miswak products in comparison with ordinary toothpaste on <italic>S. mutans</italic> and Lactobacilli.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Methods</title><p>The study was approved by the Scientific Committee of Duhok college of Medicine and by the Ethical committee of Duhok General Directorate of Health. A search on website was conducted to find prior related works. The study was carried out in Zakho city, Kurdistan region, Iraq. The study period was from the beginning of October 2013 to the end of January 2014. A sample of 40 students (20 males and 20 females) was taken at random from participants in a cross sectional study of 402 secondary school students; who were also selected at random by the same authors for estimation of dental caries index.<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> An inclusion and exclusion criteria were settled for the selection of the 40 students. The inclusion criteria were: age 16-18 years, presence of at least 2 carious teeth, and being with the habit of tooth brushing. The exclusion criteria were: presence of systemic diseases, receiving any kind of antibiotics or mouth washes for the last 2 weeks before initial examination, tobacco smokers, and history of allergy to any component of the products being used. The study was according to the principles of Helsinki declaration. At the start, an oral consent was taken from the selected 40 students who were then allocated by simple random allocation, according to gender, to be in one of the 4 groups. We chose blocks at random to create the allocation sequence. Accordingly, 4 groups of 10 students (5 males and 5 females) were generated as follows: group 1 - Miswak toothpaste group: instructed to use Miswak toothpaste twice daily (morning and before sleeping) for 2 weeks; group 2 - Miswak mouthwash group: instructed to use ordinary toothpaste and to rinse after that with Miswak mouthwash twice daily (morning and before sleeping) for 2 weeks; group 3 - Ordinary toothpaste group: instructed to use ordinary toothpaste twice daily (morning and before sleeping) for 2 weeks; and group 4 - Normal saline group: instructed to use ordinary toothpaste and to rinse after that with normal saline twice daily (morning and before sleeping) for 2 weeks. All randomization and allocations to the groups were carried out by the department statistician. The materials used were: Miswak toothpaste (Siwak. F, toothpaste with Siwak and fluoride, 190 G, Saudia Arabia), Miswak mouthwash (Sarakan antiplaque mouth wash with natural extract of <italic>Salvadora persica</italic>, S. G, R. Lane Health Products Ltd, UK), and ordinary toothpaste (Doctor Toothpaste, 120 G, China). All subjects were supplied with specified tooth brush type (medium size bristle) and taught to use same technique, frequency and duration of brushing or rinsing (3 minutes). All groups were also asked not to rinse with any preventive solution during the study period other than that specified. From each group a pre intervention saliva samples were first collected (2 ml) by stimulation using paraffin chewing wax gum and sterile glass test tube at least 2 hours, or more after the last meal. All participants were asked to use the specified method of intervention then second saliva samples were immediately collected. For the normal saline group the second sample was collected after rinsing with normal saline for 3 minutes. All groups were instructed to keep on using the specified method of cleaning and a third sample was then collected 2 weeks after following the same procedure; also 2 hours, or more after the last meal, but with no rinsing. <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic> and Lactobacilli counts in saliva were measured by caries risk test (CRT) kit (Ivoclar Vivadent AG, FL-9494 Schaan, Liechtenstein, Europe, Exp. 2014-09). The counts were evaluated according to the kit instructions; where the results expressed quantitatively as colonies per ml. The kit included 2 selective medias incorporated together on each side of the slide: Rogosa agar for Lactobacilli and <italic>S. mutans</italic> agar enriched with sucrose for <italic>S. mutans</italic>. Carbon dioxide tablets were used to increase the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration to favor bacterial growth. Each part of the slide was covered with saliva by pipette and the slide was then inculpated for 2 days at 37&#x000b0;C. Two distinguished morphology were obtained: small black colonies for <italic>S. mutans</italic> and white colonies for Lactobacilli. The bacterial growths were also further confirmed by gram stain and biochemical reactions. Growth density of the bacteria was evaluated by the naked eye according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. Bacterial growth was then scored by comparing with standards expressed in colony forming units (CFU) provided by the manufacturers. For the purpose of this study, a modification of the scores used by Almas and Al-Zeid<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> was adopted. The growth intensities were sub divided into 4 scores for both bacteria as follow: 1= No growth, or very few colonies are detected &#x02264;10<sup>2</sup> CFU; 2= Scanty growth are detected &#x02264;10<sup>4</sup> CFU; 3= Moderate growth are detected &#x02264;10<sup>5</sup> CFU; and 4= Confluent growth are detected &#x0003e;10<sup>5</sup> CFU.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Statistical analyses were conducted by using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 22 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA).

Most of clinical in vivo studies were on gingival health; due to the practicability of measuring gingival indices in a relatively short time intervals.<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Studies of Miswak effect on dental caries and cariogenic bacteria were mainly conducted in vitro.<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> This is mainly due to the complexity of oral bacteria and the difficulty of isolating cariogenic bacteria by conventional culture, which is tedious and time-consuming due to the huge diversity of different normal bacterial flora of the mouth.<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> This necessitates the purification of Lactobacilli and <italic>S. mutans</italic> from the anerobic flora, which usually constitute approximately 99% of the total oral flora.<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> The impotance of this study relies on being an in vivo survey conducted on a relatively extended period on cariogenic bacteria using a non conventional technique by using CRT. This method is easy, simple and has been shown to be as accurate and reliable as the conventional culturing. The in vivo antibacterial effect of miswak on cariogenic bacteria has been scarily conducted.<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> A relatively similar study has been carried out in Kingdom of Saudi Arabia among 40 males aged 20-45 years to measure the immediate anti bacterial effect of Miswak products. The study found that Miswak had an immediate antimicrobial effect with <italic>S. mutans</italic>, and to a less extend on lactobacilli. No further follow up was conducted to evaluate the long term effect of Miswak on cariogenic bacteria.<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> This study revealed that the bacterial counts were similar in the 4 randomized groups. This indicates that the randomization was reliable and no baseline variation was present between the groups. The study showed that Miswak mouthwash was more effective in reducing Lactobacilli in comparison with all other methods. A significant difference in reduction was observed between Miswak mouthwash and ordinary toothpaste immediately and after 2 weeks of use. It was also superior to Miswak toothpaste, which was significantly less effective in reducing Lactobacillus after 2 weeks of use. This is in agreement with results reported by other studies.<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Miswak mouthwash was also more effective than normal saline used usually with ordinary toothpaste immediately, but the difference did not reach a statistical difference after 2 weeks of use. This might be due to the effect of normal saline in preventing bacterial growth by inhibiting bacterial growth.<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Miswak mouthwash usually penetrates deeply between teeth with increase in exposed surface area. Also, 2 cleansing methods are used, one for the ordinary toothpaste, which students asked to use and the other for Miswak mouthwash itself. Using 2 methods for cleaning is usually more effective.<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Miswak toothpaste was significantly more effective in reducing Lactobacill than ordinary toothpaste both immediately and after 2 weeks. This may be due to the strong antibacterial effect of Miswak.<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> This is in agreement with results reported by other studies.<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>-<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p><p>The limitation of the study was in its open non-blind nature. This is because participants will eventually have to know the type of paste, or mouthwash used. Normal saline was used initially as an isotonic solution to standardize for the dilution effect of other 3 methods in the first post intervention sample. However, it was not ethical to ask this group to use saline rinse alone with no tooth brushing. No immediate difference was observed when normal saline was used instead of tap water with ordinary toothpaste. While after 2 weeks, a significant reduction was detected; and this might be due to the long effect of salt on bacterial growth.<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> As for <italic>S. mutans</italic> the study showed that Miswak mouthwash was also more effective in reducing it in comparison with all other methods. A significant difference in reduction was observed between Miswak mouthwash and both Miswak toothpaste and ordinary toothpaste immediately and after 2 weeks of use. Miswak mouthwash was also more effective than normal saline used with ordinary toothpaste immediately, but this difference did not reach a statistical significance after 2 weeks of use. This again might be due to the extended effect of normal saline in preventing bacterial growth.<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Miswak toothpaste was significantly more effective in reducing <italic>S. mutans</italic> than ordinary toothpaste both immediately and after 2 weeks of use. This is also attributed to the antibacterial effect of Miswak.<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> No significant difference in means <italic>S. mutans</italic> was observed when normal saline was used instead of tap water with ordinary toothpaste immediately and after 2 weeks of use. This indicates that normal saline has been more effective on Lactobaclli than <italic>S. mutans</italic>. The mean bacterial growth for both types of cariogenic bacteria was almost similar, or lower within each group between the 2 times of detection; immediately and after 2 weeks of use. This indicates the powerful antibacterial effect of Miswak as the samples collected after 2 weeks has no dilution effect of water, or saline. Indeed, the bacterial counts after 2 weeks of using Miswak mouthwash was even lower than those detected immediately after use despite the lack of dilution effect. The importance of this study based on being in vivo assessment of Miswak products on cariogenis bacteria followed up for 2 weeks. Despite that it is highly recommended to extend the period of follow up in future studies to measure the long term effects on Miswak products.</p><p>In conclusion, Miswak products were more effective in reducing the growth of cariogenic bacteria than ordinary toothpaste.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p>
