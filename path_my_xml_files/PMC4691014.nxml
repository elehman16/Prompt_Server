Research suggests that approaches that include spiritual concepts and are delivered through an online platform are a potentially beneficial approach to treating/managing depression in this population. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of an 8-week online spirituality informed e-mental health intervention (the LEAP Project) on depression severity, and secondary outcomes of spiritual well-being and self-concept, in adolescents and young adults with major depressive disorder of mild to moderate severity.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A parallel group, randomized, waitlist controlled, assessor-blinded clinical pilot trial was conducted in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. The sample of 62 participants with major depressive disorder (DSM-IV-TR) was defined by two age subgroups: adolescents (ages 13 to 18&#x000a0;years; <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;31) and young adults (ages 19 to 24&#x000a0;years; <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;31). Participants in each age subgroup were randomized into the study arm (intervention initiated upon enrolment) or the waitlist control arm (intervention initiated after an 8-week wait period).

Worldwide, depression during adolescence is common, estimated to affect from 1 to 10&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and up to 20&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] of the population before the age of 18. In Canada, its prevalence is most common in those under 20&#x000a0;years of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], and unlike comparable countries, it has remained relatively unchanged in the adolescent and young adult populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Reasons for attention and concern regarding depression in the adolescent population are related to potentially negative consequences related to interruption in the development process, interpersonal conflicts, academic under-performance, low self-esteem, and suicide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Furthermore, development of adulthood depression is associated with youth onset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>In Canada, there is a wide range of youth mental health services, however most focus on a particular aspect (e.g. addiction, abuse), intervention/prevention programs and are often only available to those in crisis. Key youth services that address general distress and/or depression are challenged to meet the growing needs. Other barriers to access include transportation, particularly in rural areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], long wait times [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] as well as, youth&#x02019;s reluctance to seek help due to perceived stigma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] inability to recognize a problem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], and preference for self-reliance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Considering these limitations and the significant individual and societal burden of the condition, there is a critical need for development of treatment options that are effective and acceptable to this patient demographic.</p><p>Research in the area of depression and spirituality suggests that certain spiritual beliefs or experiences may play a beneficial role in the management of adolescent depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Forgiveness, spiritual support, daily spiritual exercises, hopefulness (or having faith), and self-ranking as religious or spiritual have been identified as specific factors which reduce depressive symptoms in adolescents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Given these potential benefits, some authors have called for the inclusion of spiritual concepts in mental health interventions for youth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>The term e-mental health refers to &#x02018;mental health services and information delivered or enhanced through the internet and related technologies such as videoconferencing, web-based interventions, or social media, to name a few [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. E-mental health interventions are increasingly recognized as potentially useful and constructive mental health enhancing approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], with potential applicability in the treatment and/or management of depression or depressive symptomatology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. E-mental health has been identified as a key strategy for access to and provision of mental health services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Given the high use, access, and acceptance of the internet in youth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], internet-based programming may be highly suitable to this population.</p><p>Existing online programs, however, tend to primarily focus on diagnosis and resource identification and do not directly engage youth. Those that do provide some help are generally workbook/DVD based and/or provided support through online/phone interaction with a therapy provider. It is important to consider that in an era where instant access is preferred and youth are not always comfortable discussing inner struggles with an adult stranger, although aimed at helping, these may also pose access barriers.</p><p>Although potentially beneficial, many of these online programs lack sufficient evidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] and are not readily available. In response to the need for appropriate and accessible services for depressed youth, the project team at the Canadian Institute of Natural and Integrative Medicine (CINIM) designed an online spirituality-informed intervention specifically targeting adolescents (13&#x02013;18 years of age) and young adults (19&#x02013;24 years of age). To our knowledge, this is the first clinical trial of an online spirituality-informed intervention for depression, specifically targeting adolescents and young adults.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>The LEAP project</title><p>The trial intervention was an eight-week online program called the LEAP Project (LEAP). It aims to treat and/or manage depression by empowering depressed youth with new perspectives and practical strategies to better manage life&#x02019;s challenges. The label, LEAP, aims to capture the idea of leaping or moving forward in one&#x02019;s life. This is achieved by guiding participants through an exploration of spiritually informed principles (e.g. forgiveness, gratitude, compassion) that are presented in eight modules (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). These principles were selected through an extensive literature review and were identified to be consistent across a wide range of spiritual practices and religious beliefs. The intervention is non-denominational and does not place emphasis on any one specific religious practice or tradition.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Description of the eight LEAP project modules</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td>

The program length was chosen because psychotherapeutic depression interventions are commonly eight weeks in duration which appears to be sufficient to produce significant improvements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The content is presented by a professional host who introduces and guides participants through the program materials. The host is an award winning writer, performer and producer. She was selected based on her ability to openly relate her own experience with clinical depression to the program content, contribution to script writing, and overall passion for the project.</p><p>LEAP takes an experiential and non-linear approach in order to facilitate independent and active participation rather than passive observation. The modules include fresh graphic designs with a multimedia format; video clips to illustrate the teaching content, including insights from a medical expert that have helped others move forward in their lives (Mastermind Sessions); music clips to validate teen&#x02019;s emotions; youth autobiographical stories of personal struggle; off-line activities that allow participants to apply their newly obtained insights; relaxation techniques including downloadable visualizations; online journal and moderated comment boxes to share thoughts and experiences; extras section that includes humorous clips and jokes, and movie and book suggestions to reinforce the teachings; and links to resources such as depression information and support.</p><p>LEAP was created through a collaboration of researchers with content expertise at CINIM, the University of Calgary and Mount Royal University, and health professionals and educators from Alberta Health Services. To ensure its relatability and suitability to a youth audience, we also engaged twenty-five youth volunteers, aged 15 to 25, four of whom had previously experienced clinical depression. These volunteers attended focus groups and completed online assignments where they provided constructive input on all program content and design and suggested new program materials. Their feedback was used to further revise and refine the intervention.</p><p>This paper reports on the results of a waitlist controlled clinical pilot trial, which aimed to evaluate an innovative approach for managing depression in adolescents and young adults using a non-faith based spirituality program presented through an online platform.

A waitlist design was considered to be appropriate given the lack of a suitable placebo or sham intervention. It is also a commonly used design in the evaluation of psychotherapeutic interventions for depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. In addition, offering the intervention to all participants reduces the potential of dropout in the control group.</p><p>The trial was conducted at CINIM, located in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Ethics approval was obtained from the Conjoint Research Ethics Board at the University of Calgary (Ethics ID: E22549); Child Health Research Office, Alberta Health Services, (Ethics ID: 22549); Human Research Ethics Board, Mount Royal University (Ethics ID: 2011&#x02013;39). The trial was also registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier: NCT00985686).</p><sec id="Sec4"><title>Recruitment</title><p>All participants were recruited in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Recruitment and all follow-up was completed between January 2010 and September 2012. Multiple recruitment strategies used included emails, presentations, mail outs, poster displays, local media (radio, television, print), and social media (Facebook). Local educational institutions (high schools, post-secondary), health professionals (physicians, psychologists, social workers, counsellors), and over 30 community organizations that provide services to youth were targeted. Neutral recruitment slogans were used (e.g. &#x0201c;Need help with depression? The LEAP Project might help&#x0201d;) in order to minimize potential selection bias in relation to the concept of spirituality.</p><p>Interested youth and/or their parents/guardians contacted the study coordinator by telephone and/or email. The coordinator explained the study details via telephone and confirmed the inclusion criteria (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). If these criteria were met, youth were then screened using a two-step process. The initial screening was conducted by a registered nurse via telephone. The nurse asked questions to identify any exclusion criteria (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). If no exclusion criteria were present, the potential participant was invited to attend an in-person screening with a physician and a registered nurse. The physician conducted a psychiatric assessment, which confirmed the diagnosis of major depressive disorder based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Psychiatry (DSM-IV-TR) and ruled out exclusion criteria (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). A registered nurse administered the age appropriate depression assessment scale (Children&#x02019;s Depression Rating Scale Revised (CDRS-R) for 13&#x02013;18 year olds or Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD) for 19&#x02013;24 year olds), which determined depression severity. Individuals 13 to 24&#x000a0;years of age were eligible if they met the DSM-IV-TR criteria for major depressive disorder (mild to moderate severity) and obtained a raw baseline score of 40 to 70 on the CDRS-R or 12 to 24 on the HAMD. In addition, study participation required agreement to committing two to three hours per week to complete each module and attending four to five in-person study visits.<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Protocol &#x02013; eligibility criteria</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td>Inclusion criteria:</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02022; 13 to 24&#x000a0;years of age</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02022; Suspicion he/she might be suffering from depression</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02022; Stabilized on anti-depressants, if applicable</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02022; Currently under the care of a health care professional</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02022; Agreeable to having the study team contact the health professional prior to enrollment, at completion of study and if it was evident additional support was needed for the participant during the course of the study</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02022; Interested in study participation</td></tr><tr><td>Exclusion criteria:</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02022; High suicide risk</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02022; History of multiple suicide attempts</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02022; Recent death in the family</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02022; History of Bipolar disorder, Psychotic disorder or Psychotic episodes</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02022; Personality disorder traits that may impede participation in the study</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02022; History of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (permitted if stabilized for at least 2&#x000a0;months on a long-acting medication, signs/symptoms/behaviours are well controlled, and participant agrees to continue)</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02022; DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of substance dependence (except nicotine and caffeine) within the past 12-months</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02022; Uncontrolled medical conditions in the last 3&#x000a0;months (assessed by qualified physician)</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02022; Change in use of pharmacotherapy or herbal treatment for depression (St. John&#x02019;s Wort) in the last 3&#x000a0;months OR during the first 2&#x000a0;months of trial participation (Eligible if no change in medication or dosage in the last 3&#x000a0;months and it is foreseeable that their current treatment will continue unchanged for the first 2&#x000a0;months of participation)</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02022; Change in the use of medications that have mood altering effects in the last 3&#x000a0;months OR during the first 2&#x000a0;months of trial participation</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02022; History of treatment resistance to&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;2 antidepressant medications when treated for an adequate period with a therapeutic dose</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02022; Patients currently undergoing a specific psychotherapeutic treatment that has been shown to be effective for depression (such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) or Interpersonal Therapy (IPT)) or planning to start such therapy in the next two months</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p>Individuals who did not meet study criteria, such as those whose depression severity exceeded study eligibility, and required additional support, were encouraged to follow-up with their health professional and given a list of community resources.

Outcomes for depression, spiritual well-being, and self-concept were measured using standardized outcome measures with established psychometric properties and considered suitable for research purposes (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Outcome measures differed for the younger and older participants; as such, the study sample consisted of two age subgroups: younger (13 to 18&#x000a0;years of age) and older (19 to 24&#x000a0;years of age). All outcomes were measured at four time points in both study groups. Baseline measures were completed at enrolment during visit 1. Data was then collected at week 8 (visit 2), when the study arm had completed the intervention; week 16 (visit 3) when the waitlist arm had completed the intervention; and, week 24 (visit 4) (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>).

One participant was randomized, however, dropped out after baseline data was collected but before the intervention was initiated (reason undetermined).

However, there is a lack of high quality empirical evidence to support the effectiveness and overall benefit of e- mental health programs. In a recent review of e-mental health programs, Christensen and Petrie (2013) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] report that of the 15 depression specific programs identified internationally, around half were supported by any evidence and only one third were examined through a randomized controlled trial. To our knowledge, the results presented here are the first rigorous evaluation of a Canadian spirituality-informed e-mental health intervention targeting depressed youth.</p><p>The results of this study indicate that the LEAP Project is effective in significantly decreasing depression severity in adolescents and young adults diagnosed with major depressive disorder of mild to moderate severity. The reduced severity was also maintained after the intervention was completed during the follow-up period, suggesting the potential longer term impact of what was learned through the LEAP modules. For the younger participants, LEAP also had a positive effect on spiritual well-being and self-concept.</p><p>The effect of the intervention on reducing depression severity in both the younger and older participants is also considered to be clinically significant. A treatment response using the CDRS-R has been defined as a reduction in mean scores 30&#x000a0;% to 50&#x000a0;% from baseline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. For the younger participants, the response was over 30&#x000a0;% in the study group during the follow-up period (36&#x000a0;% at 16&#x000a0;weeks and 40&#x000a0;% at 24&#x000a0;weeks). Similarly, in the waitlist group, severity decreased by 27&#x000a0;% (16&#x000a0;weeks) and 31&#x000a0;% (24&#x000a0;weeks). It is important to emphasize that the decrease was not short term; on-going effects are observed weeks after the intervention had been completed, suggesting the potential long term benefits of this intervention. Further, in the study group, at weeks 16 and 24, the CDRS-R mean score was below 40, indicating that the change is not only a reduction in depression severity but a potential shift towards alleviation of depressive symptomology altogether [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. In the waitlist group, a similar trend is apparent, however, scores hover around 40. This may be related to the fact that the follow-up period after the intervention in the waitlist control group was shorter. A decrease in scores below 40 may have been observed if follow-up had taken place at 32&#x000a0;weeks. In the older age sub-group, the decrease in depression severity in both the study and waitlist control groups at 16 and 24&#x000a0;weeks ranged from 49&#x000a0;% to 60&#x000a0;%, which is recognized as a clinically significant change in the depression severity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. In addition, in both arms, the difference in mean scores from baseline to each of the follow-up points differed by more than 3 points, which is a common measure of clinically significant change based on mean scores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p><p>The improvement in self-perceived spiritual well-being of the younger participants was approaching statistical significance (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.10), however it is important to note that the interpretation of the mean scores indicates that the change was from &#x0201c;very low&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;low&#x0201d; spiritual well-being. Therefore, this may not be considered a clinically meaningful improvement. However, such a finding is acceptable, and to some degree even expected. Several models of spiritual development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] identify it as progressive, evolutionary process during adolescence that is marked by reflection and is closely linked to identity formation. As such, the modest improvement is important; it suggests that exposure to the concepts and ideas presented had some positive effect. The continued improvement observed at 24&#x000a0;weeks in the study arm is also indicative of the fact that integration of the concepts may occur over time and continue after exposure.</p><p>Psychological development during adolescence consists of many overlapping tasks. These include the development of emotional and psychological independence that ends with a stable identity formation or conceptualization of self. In his developmental theory, Erik Erikson [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] discussed how we need to negotiate psychosocial crises at each stage of development. Identity formation versus role confusion is this crisis that occurs during the teenage years. The spirituality-informed modules contained many topics that led participants to ask key questions that contribute to identity formation (e.g. who am I? what is my purpose?). This may speak to the influential role this online spirituality-informed tool played in helping youth explore and develop their concept of self. In the case of our older participants, it is plausible they may have already gone through the stage of identity formation and, thus, this intervention had less of an effect on improving thoughts related to who they are, how they relate to others and their purpose.</p><p>Spirituality is increasingly recognized as an important consideration in mental health and mental health interventions, yet we found that the use of the term in labelling or describing the LEAP Project problematic in several ways. First, spirituality as a concept is quite difficult to define in a cohesive way that is acceptable to different groups of stakeholders. Although we drew a distinction between spirituality and religion, to the lay public, the two concepts are closely connected and often used synonymously. Second, there is a range of personal perceptions, negative and positive, attached to the concept of spirituality, which then impacted how LEAP is received. For example, inclusion of the term in a descriptive label resulted in recruitment challenges, where we were unable to recruit at one school district, parents of potential participants expressed apprehension/caution, and questions were raised as to whether or not LEAP would challenge one&#x02019;s existing belief systems or religious values. To overcome this challenge, we created guest accounts so that the program could be previewed. In addition, a significant amount of time was also committed to responding to concerns, explaining the neutral orientation of LEAP in context of religious beliefs, and attention was drawn to how the intervention explored foundational life principles. These efforts led to building relationships with potential referral sources, participants and parents, which helped to establish credibility of the program and facilitated recruitment.</p><p>There are several limitations of the study that require attention. The early stage of this evaluation warranted a pilot study with a design that precluded the inclusion of a comparison placebo arm. We also opted to use a waitlist trial design given its advantages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], particularly in relation to psychotherapeutic interventions. However, it is important to recognize that concerns have been raised in the research community regarding the potential for over estimation of intervention effects using such a design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. The explanation provided for this possible outcome is that participants in the waitlist control arm improve less than controls in non-waitlist designs as there is an expectation they are to &#x0201c;wait to change&#x0201d; until they receive the intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. In our study, it is expected that such an effect would be minimal given that participants in our waitlist control arm were not restricted from continuing existing care or treatment for their depression during the wait period. As such, it is anticipated this supported a mind-set of continued effort for self-improvement. An additional design related issue is that of blinding. Although assessor blinding was achieved, participants were not blinded to the intervention. Given the nature of the intervention and study design, a suitable control group was not possible. This may bias the results, particularly given that outcomes are based on patient self-reports. We aimed to present LEAP in a neutral manner in relation to the concept of spirituality; however, it cannot be ruled out that participants with an open or accepting attitude towards spirituality (and related concepts) may have self-selected for participation, thus creating a potential for selection bias. The use of standardized outcome measures resulted in the need to create two age sub-samples, reducing the sample size (each group to n&#x02009;=&#x02009;31). This limited our ability to conduct a stratified analysis to identify potential confounders to our findings. However, the small size of the groups was sufficient for the purposes of this pilot trial. Lastly, seasonal effects, which may have had an impact on observed outcomes, were not controlled for in this study.</p><p>As e-mental health interventions are embraced and likely to continue developing, there are several areas that require attention in future evaluations of such programs. The amount of time spent on a website or specific online module (or the dosing effect) is an important factor which needs to be considered in association to the observed outcomes. The key issue around dosing is to be able to assess whether it is any or a certain level of exposure that has an effect. Although e-mental health programs may provide opportunity for greater access to services, the digital nature of the intervention may also present its own barriers. Jorm et al., (2013) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] points out that access to the internet or devices (e.g. smart phones) is not necessarily equal for all individuals (at the local, national and international levels). There is also some evidence suggesting that most users of e-interventions are those who have access to other services and are health literate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Future evaluations of such approaches should therefore include data collection on specific participant characteristics such as the level of health literacy and types of services that have or are being accessed by the individuals opting to use or sign up for e-mental health programs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The LEAP Project pilot trial makes an important contribution to our knowledge about the potential effectiveness of spiritually-informed e-mental health interventions for mild to moderate major depressive disorder in adolescents and young adults. The good compliance supports the possibility that the program could be successfully implemented in a community setting. The LEAP Project also presents a promising tool that addresses many of the barriers faced by individuals seeking resources to address mental health problems or issues, including location, access, and stigma. Given that the majority of youth use the internet and the average Canadian spends over 40&#x000a0;h online per month, the program&#x02019;s online delivery method may help overcome some of the challenges accessing mental health care. The findings of this pilot study also illustrate how the internet can be harnessed to positively impact the mental health of adolescents and young adults.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>The CINIM development team included JT, BR, SMo, PS and PP.
