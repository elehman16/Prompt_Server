However, the normal anatomical changes of pregnancy and labour pain pose a great challenge to anaesthesiologists for a successful subarachnoid block.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Use of ultrasound for the central neuraxial block is still underappreciated mainly because of difficulty in perceiving the image through the narrow acoustic windows produced by the bony framework of the spine.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>We hypothesised that the routine use of pre-procedural ultrasound-guided midline approach of spinal technique at L3&#x02013;L4 interspinous space would result in fewer attempts to enter the subarachnoid space when compared to the conventional landmark-based midline approach for elective caesarean section. The primary objective was to study the number of insertion attempts and the secondary objectives were to study the number of passes, space identification time and time for successful lumbar puncture.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>After getting institute ethics committee approval and written informed consent, the current study was done between September 2016 and June 2017. One hundred parturients scheduled to undergo elective caesarean section under spinal anaesthesia were included in this prospective randomised control trial. Selection of participant was done by simple random sampling technique. Parturients with spinal deformities, history of past spinal surgery, coagulopathy and those who refuse spinal anaesthesia were excluded from this study. All patients were randomised into two groups: Group L &#x02013; landmark-guided technique (<italic>n</italic> = 50) and Group U &#x02013; Ultrasound-guided technique (<italic>n</italic> = 50) by a computer-generated random number sequence using simple randomisation technique [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. Group allocation and concealement was done by a closed envelope technique. Spinal anaesthesia was performed by anaesthesiologists who had the experience of more than 50 cases of ultrasound-guided identification of the subarachnoid space. All patients were given pre-medication as per departmental protocol and shifted in the left lateral position. In the operation theatre, after attaching all standard monitors (non-invasive blood pressure, pulse oximetry and electrocardiogram) and recording baseline parameters, intravenous access was established and the patients were positioned in sitting posture. In Group L, L3&#x02013;L4 interspace was identified by traditional landmark technique (intersection between the midline and Tuffier's line) and time taken for the identification of the interspace (time from which the anaesthesiologist started palpating to identify the landmark to completion of palpation) was noted. In Group U, curvilinear probe (3&#x02013;6 MHz) of portable ultrasound machine (Sonosite M Turbo&#x02122;) was used for pre-procedural marking. A sagittal oblique view of the spine was obtained, and the L3&#x02013;L4 interspinous space with best image of the anterior complex (anterior dura mater, posterior longitudinal ligament and body of corresponding vertebra) and posterior complex (ligamentum flavum and posterior dura mater) was obtained. At this selected interspace, the probe was positioned in transverse view and a skin marker was used to mark the midpoint of the long and short borders of the probe. The point of intersection of both lines was identified as the needle entry point.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Time taken for identification of the interspace (the time from which ultrasound probe is placed on the patient to completion of marking), the distance between skin and posterior complex and the angulation of the probe were noted in transverse view. Ultrasound depth (UD), i.e., the distance between skin and the ventral border of posterior complex was measured in Group U only.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials flow diagram showing patient progress through the study phases. Group L: Landmark group, Group U: Ultrasound group</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJA-62-280-g001"/></fig><p>Strict asepsis was maintained throughout the procedure in both the groups. Spinal anaesthesia was given with 25-G Quincke 90-mm needle. Needle depth (ND), that is the distance from tip to the skin level was measured after removing the spinal needle. During the procedure, parameters such as insertion attempts (defined as the number of times the spinal needle was withdrawn from the skin and reinserted), passes (defined as the number of advancements, that is withdrawal and redirection of the spinal needle without exiting the skin) and time taken for performing the procedure (time from insertion of the needle to getting free cerebrospinal fluid [CSF] flow) were recorded in both the groups.</p><p>Sample size was calculated based on the previous study by Kim <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] which showed that the average number of attempts per spinal anaesthetic for an experienced anaesthesiologist would be 3.3 &#x000b1; 3.1 (mean &#x000b1; standard deviation). We hypothesised that using a pre-procedural ultrasound, the number of attempts could be reduced to 1.3. It was found that a total of 44 patients in each group will be needed to achieve a power of 90% and type 1 error of &#x0003c;0.05. We included 50 participants in each group to compensate for attrition. Statistical analysis was done using SPSS software version 16 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinosis, USA). All data were analysed for normal distribution using the Shapiro&#x02013;Wilk test. Categorical data were analysed using the Chi-square test or Fisher exact test as appropriate. Normally distributed parametric data were analysed using Student <italic>t</italic>-test. All tests were two-tailed. <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Demographic profile such as age, weight, height and body mass index was comparable between the groups [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>]. Time taken for identification of interspinous space was significantly more in Group U (56.70 &#x000b1; 13.08 s) as compared to Group L (47.10 &#x000b1; 10.45 s.) (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). However, other parameters such as number of attempts for needle insertion, number of passes in the same interspinous space and the total time for successful lumbar puncture were significantly less in Group U as compared to Group L [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>]. Successful lumbar puncture in the first attempt [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>] and in one pass [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>] was significantly high in Group U that is 96% and 74%, respectively, whereas in Group L, it was 30% and 18%, respectively (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). In Group U, only 2% patients had paraesthesia, whereas in Group L, 28% patients had paraesthesia during the procedure (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0001).

This is in contrary to study done by Ansari <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] which showed no significant difference in the total number of attempts. This could be due to the difference in the study population as they included only easily palpable spine patients. Perlas also showed that ultrasound is more accurate than palpation for correct identification of lumbar interspaces and also decreases the number of attempts required to perform the block.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>In our study, one pass success rate was 74% in ultrasound group which was similar to study done by Lim <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Grau <italic>et al</italic>. have also shown that use of real-time ultrasound guidance for combined spinal&#x02013;epidural insertion in a younger obstetric population significantly reduced the number of needle passes required when compared to a traditional landmark-based approach.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] In our study, we found that the time taken for identification of the L3&#x02013;L4 interspinous space was less in landmark-based technique as compared to ultrasound-guided identification of the interspinous space. This may be due to difficulty in identifying a satisfactory acoustic window in ultrasound technique. Although the identification time was long in ultrasound group, the procedural time was significantly less in ultrasound group. Sahin <italic>et al</italic>. also showed that the total duration of the spinal procedure was shorter in the ultrasound group.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>In our study, we also found that ultrasound imaging in the transverse plane in parturients provides a reasonable estimation of the depth of the subarachnoid space from the skin puncture site. Wallace <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and Grau <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] also showed that ultrasonography estimation of depth to the epidural space was reliable in obese parturients; however, they measured the distance from the skin to the lamina in the longitudinal paramedian plane, rather than the distance from the skin to the ligamentum flavum in the transverse plane. We preferred transverse plane as the study conducted by Sahota <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] showed that the estimates of the ultrasound determined the distance to the epidural space in the transverse median view were comparable to those in the parasagittal oblique view.</p><p>We measured the distance between skin puncture site and posterior complex in the transverse scan and correlated it with the depth of needle insertion after the procedure. We found that the ultrasound-estimated depth to the subarachnoid space correlated highly with the actual depth of needle in parturients. The regression analysis showed that the estimation of the depth by ultrasound differs minimally from the ND as the ND increases [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>]. It was also found that the UD underestimates the ND by about 0.08 cm which may be attributed to the greater subcutaneous tissue compression by the ultrasound probe.</p><p>In our study, paresthesia during the procedure and bloody tap were also found to be significantly less in ultrasound group as compared to landmark group which can be attributed to the accurate identification of interspace by ultrasound technique. Limitations of our study include the difficulty of blinding of anaesthesiologists for the study group, as the patients belonging to ultrasound group will have skin markings. Further randomised, controlled trial with a big sample size is necessary to confirm the utility of ultrasound in this patient population.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"
