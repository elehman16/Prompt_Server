Addiction is threatening the human societies to collapse. According to the diagnostic and statistical of mental disorders fourth edition guide (DSM-IV), the fundamental sign of drug dependency is a set of recognition-behavioral and physiological symptoms. The addict, despite having significant problems associated with narcotics continues its consumption. For the prevention of addiction, the law and fight for supply cannot be effective alone. The most appropriate approach is to reduce demand. The most important element of planning (training) is exposed to threats. Inaccurate beliefs and positive attitudes towards drug abuse1 among individuals and families is one of the determinants of high demand and the tendency toward addiction. Therefore, one of the ways to control the demand is changing the attitude to drug abuse.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-AH-03-068">1</xref></p><p>One of the most important strategies in the prevention of addiction is changing the positive attitudes and stabilizing the negative attitudes towards narcotics. Attitudes are the reasons of logical behaviors in any specific person. Many factors influence the individuals' attitudes. One of these factors is the individual's knowledge and information in different fields. Therefore, numerous studies indicate that people with positive attitudes and beliefs about narcotics have more potential in consumption and addiction than the individuals with negative or neutral attitudes. Accordingly, the change from neutral to negative attitude is easier than changing from positive to negative attitude. For this reason, the non-smokers are concerned more than the smokers to cigarette disadvantages. The most direct interventions to enhance mental-social capabilities are the interventions that strengthen the people coping resources and their personal-social abilities. With respect to children, adolescents and youth population, this type of interventions can be provided through life skills training in a supportive educational environment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-AH-03-068">2</xref></p><p>Tarmyan conducted an unequal controlled research project as pretest-posttest. It was entitled as "effectiveness of life skills training to prevent drug abuse for the first year high school students in Tehran." The results showed that the students, who participated in life skills training classes, were found a more negative attitude towards narcotics than the control group.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-AH-03-068">2</xref> Rahmati performed a research in the field of the impact of preventive training on the probability of drug abuse in high school adolescents in Isfahan. The obtained result was that the prevention skills training are involved in reducing the risk of addiction in male and female students. It was also found that increasing the parental awareness about the probability of drug abuse has been effective in their children.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-AH-03-068">3</xref> Rashid carried out a research entitled "the efficiency of recognition-behavioral approach in preventing and reducing cigarette smoking". It was determined that recognition-behavioral approach was effective in the following cases: increasing restraint to reduce anxiety and depression, changing beliefs about narcotics and increasing personal abilities to the components of emotional intelligence (interpersonal ability, stress tolerance, compatibility and general mood). Recognition-behavioral approach has been effective in the reduction of cigarette smoking and preventing its consumption.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-AH-03-068">4</xref></p><p>A previous study showed that systematic motivation consultation and recognition-behavioral therapy were effective in the creation of negative attitude towards the narcotics.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-AH-03-068">1</xref> Meichenbaum and Cameron indicated in another research that the optimistic, flexible, self-vulnerable people with high self-esteem rely more on active coping and planning. Less desirable qualities are related with dysfunctional coping tendencies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-AH-03-068">5</xref> Lazarus and Launier conducted a research entitled "evaluation of coping strategies and the use of narcotics". 4500 youth people participated in this study as the subjects. These researchers were sought to identify and predict the tendency to drug use. In that research, thinking about narcotics and coping strategies were followed up. They concluded that the type of strategies being used can be the predictor of future drug use by taking advantage of the multiple regression statistical models.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-AH-03-068">6</xref></p><p>Teesson et al. performed a research in this field. The research title was: "the students' attitude towards narcotics". It was shown that the attitude towards cigarette smoking, alcohol and other narcotics were associated with their consumptions. People, who have a more positive attitude towards narcotics, also show higher consumption.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-AH-03-068">7</xref></p><p>Lazarus and Folkman in a study paid attention into the role of beliefs in the attitudes and expectations of the drugs consumers. The results showed that the addicts feel the drugs can help them cope with personal and social problems such as the social anxiety.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-AH-03-068">8</xref> Botvin and Griffin conducted a study for investigation on the effect of training of life skills on knowledge, attitudes and abilities of middle school students in the selection of healthy lifestyles. This study showed that the students who participated in life skills training program, smoked less compared with those that were not involved in the training.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-AH-03-068">9</xref> Taramian and Mehryar in a research entitled: "the role of attitudes in high-risk behaviors such as addiction" showed a positive and meaningful relationship between positive attitudes to drug use and long-term multiple use.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-AH-03-068">10</xref> There are primary themes for anti-social patterns and emotional attitudes in alcoholics. A research on assessing psychodrama impact (psychological impressiveness) in changing the attitudes of male and female high school students in Khoramabad towards drug abuse indicated that psychological impressiveness was effective in the change of students' attitude towards the drug abuse. But, there was no significant difference between students' demographic characteristics such as gender and age and the changing attitudes of students towards drug abuse.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-AH-03-068">11</xref></p><p>Yarmohammadian and Ghaderi Dehkordi carried out a study in the field of preventive training impact on the probability of drug abuse in male and female students in Isfahan. He has come to this conclusion that prevention skills training have played an important role in reducing the risk of addiction in male and female students.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-AH-03-068">12</xref> Female students have negative attitudes towards drug use. Female students in south of Tehran had a more active approach to the problem of drug abuse. They reported religious identification in this regard.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-AH-03-068">12</xref></p><p>Classrooms, school and university atmosphere are among the places where people are affected more by their peers. Most of the time of the students is spent in these places. The students are under direct and indirect influence of the teachings of their peers in most of issues and in their personal and social situations. The present study was conducted in order to investigate among the factors influencing the role of recognition-behavioral factors coping with stress in drug abuse. In fact, the researcher sought to answer the question that whether recognition-behavioral group training and stress management training group practices are effective on changing the positive attitude towards drug abuse. Therefore, the researcher in the present study was looking after the following objectives: determining the effectiveness of the recognition-behavioral group training in changing the students' positive attitude towards drug abuse in both genders and determining the effectiveness of stress surmounting group training in changing the students' positive attitude towards drug abuse in both genders.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The present study was a pilot project with three groups and pretest-posttest design. In these plans, each of the groups was measured twice. The first measurement was performed with the implementation of a pre-test and the second measurement was done by running a post-test. The statistical population of this research was all male and female students of Islamic Azad University in Rasht. They were studying in academic year of 2010-11 (Persian). The sample size included 90 students (45 girls and 45 boys).</p><p>Initially, the necessary permission was obtained from the Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs. The following courses were selected by using stratified random sampling method: accounting, literature, management, elementary education, and English language teaching. Then, the questionnaire of addiction attitude detector was conducted over 500 male and 500 female students. Those students were selected who gained higher scores (had more positive attitudes towards opiate abuse) in the test (250 boys and 250 girls). 90 students were randomly selected among them (45 males and 45 females). Different test conditions were randomly assigned with the gender breakdown in the groups of 15 students (two test and one control group).</p><p>Then, the test groups learned the recognition-behavioral training and stress management techniques in eight 90-minute sessions. The control group received no training. After the training, the groups were measured by the addiction attitude detector scale again. Training recognition-behavioral sessions were included briefing and referrals, self-confidence, familiarity with the drugs, applied relaxation in reducing anxiety, decision making and problem solving skills, self-controlling the emotions following failure and frustration, preventing to escape from responsibility and how to say no. Training sessions for coping with stress were included the followings: stress definition, coping with stress, distraction, changing interests, self-learning techniques, muscle relaxation, bio-feedback, self-expression, how to combat with irrational beliefs, problem solving, decision making and homework providing.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-AH-03-068">12</xref></p><p><bold>Study tools</bold></p><p>The questionnaire of addiction attitude detector was used for gathering and collecting the required data. The questionnaire is made in Likert range in two forms of A and B.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-AH-03-068">12</xref> In the Likert method for measuring attitudes toward addiction, initially a large number of favorable and unfavorable items related to attitudes towards a particular topic, such as addiction, run on a particular group of subjects. The subjects presented their opinions in the range of quite agree to quite disagree. Grading of the favorable items represented positive numbers to any of the answers of quite agree, agree, no comment, disagree and quite disagree. The scores of 5, 4, 3, 2 and 1 were given to the mentioned items, respectively. Grading unfavorable questions were marked with (*) specified in the questionnaire. They were represented negative attitudes. Thus, in form A and form B, the minimum score was 32 and the maximum was 160. The validity of the mentioned questionnaire was approved by the experts in the field of educational science and psychology. The reliability of the questionnaire by citing the Cronbach's alpha coefficient has been reported 0.81 for form A and 0.86 for form B.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-AH-03-068">12</xref></p></sec><sec sec-type="result"><title>Results</title><p>Based on the results of <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-AH-03-068">table 1</xref>, considering the meaningful difference between the averages in the recognition behavioral group training with 99% confidence, the above presented objective is accurate.

According to calculated F = 38.002 at the level of P &#x0003c; 0.01 for stress surmounting group training was meaningful. Thus, the objective of the study was approved. These findings were consistent with the results of some other researches.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-AH-03-068">12</xref> The adolescence is a dangerous period for young people towards drug addiction. Most of vulnerable young people do not have the needed skills to tackle against the traumatic causes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-AH-03-068">13</xref> Therefore, the importance of prevention programs and early primary considerations will be more apparent. Thus, due to the performed researches and the current study, recognition-behavioral group training and group training methods of surmounting stress have been changed the attitude towards opiate abuse. Namely, it has been created negative attitudes toward drug use in the students.</p><p>The second objective exploratory analysis of the results and calculated F according to F = 7.703 (1 and 29) at the level of P &#x0003c; 0.0005 for recognition-behavioral group training was meaningful. According to the calculated F = 57.09 at the level of P &#x0003c; 0.0005 for stress surmounting group training was meaningful. Thus, the objective of the study was approved. These findings were consistent with the results of some other researches.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-AH-03-068">12</xref> The third objective exploratory analysis of the results and calculated F according to F = 11.925 (1 and 29) at the level of P &#x0003c; 0.01 was meaningful and these findings indicated the difference between the two groups of students. Thus, these findings were confirmed with 99% confidence. Unfortunately, no studies were found that directly compared the two treatment groups. But, generally it was consistent with previous results<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-AH-03-068">6</xref> in which the female students had negative attitudes towards addiction and they were selected active surmounting practices. Therefore, the recognition-behavioral group training has specific skill features, unique effects and plays an important role in effective relationships between the individuals. Moreover, it will give the ability to resist pressure from the friends and other people to surmounting against the drug offers. It also provides the person to have reasonable behavior when faced with various problems in life. The individual avoids from dealing with indecent and traumatic behaviors. The fourth objective exploratory analysis of the results and calculated F according to F = 11.925 (1 and 29) at the level of P &#x0003c; 0.01 was meaningful and these findings indicated the difference between the two groups of students. Thus, these findings were confirmed with 99% confidence.</p><p>Unfortunately, no studies were found that directly compared the two treatment groups. The following disorders are more common in boys than in girls in the childhood period: mental disorder, conduct disorder, attention deficit disorder and gender identity disorder. Nevertheless, the girls much more than the boys show emotional problems and anxiety. The girls are more vulnerable than the boys to the disturbances in the adolescence. The girls, in the adolescence and young age show more negative reactions to psychological pressures than the boys. The gender difference in the vulnerability to psychological pressures is probably rooted in the different methods of emotions socialization.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-AH-03-068">14</xref> In a previous study, the girls used surmounting social support methods more than the boys.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-AH-03-068">15</xref> The women prefer to select emotional practices in dealing with problems and psychological pressures. There are significant differences between the women and the mothers in the adoption of problem-focused coping strategies. Therefore, the surmounting stress group training methods helped the female college students to use more effective approaches in coping with stress. Thus, they were more successful than boys. The girls showed more negative attitudes towards narcotics in comparison with the boys after receiving the surmounting stress methods group training in the present study. Therefore, the surmounting stress methods group training changed the negative attitudes towards opiate abuse. In other words, the positive attitude of students (girls and boys) was changed after receiving the recognition-behavioral group training and learning methods to cope with stress. Their attitude was negative. The impact of education on female college students has changed more positive attitude to opiate abuse than male students. The female college students found a more negative attitude towards narcotics in comparison with male students. Therefore, in prevention of drug addiction, we need to pay more attention to psychological factors such as psychological tendencies, personality, perceptions, beliefs, attitudes, goals, values, feelings of inferiority, emotional and mental deficiencies. Indispensable attention is necessary to the cultural affairs, ideological-mental dimensions and strengthening the will of restraint education for attitude change. Accordingly, it is assumed that the methods and programs to develop personal and social characteristics can help adolescents and young adults. Thus, they can overcome the defects which increase the risk of opiate abuse trends. In other words, is necessary to develop such features of high self-esteem, self-awareness, responsible decision making, coping skills, healthy relationships and existing tools. These cases can increase the skills and awareness of adolescents and youth against high risk factors and situations. In this respect, training programs as "recognition-behavioral group training" and "surmounting stress methods group training" can be very effective (with emphasis on personal and social skills growth). These programs can play an important role in strengthening and reinforcement of the preventive interventions against the opiate abuse.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>
