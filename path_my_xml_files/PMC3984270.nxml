Eight Danish landrace pigs served as DBD donors. After four hours of brain death both kidneys were removed and stored for 18 hours at 4&#x000b0;C in Custodiol preservation solution. Sixteen recipients were randomized in a paired design into two treatment groups, transplanted simultaneously. &#x003b1;-MSH or a vehicle was administered at start of surgery, during reperfusion and two hours post-reperfusion. The recipients were observed for ten hours following reperfusion. Blood, urine and kidney tissue samples were collected during and at the end of follow-up. &#x003b1;-MSH treatment reduced urine flow and impaired recovery of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) compared to controls. After each dose of &#x003b1;-MSH, a trend towards reduced mean arterial blood pressure and increased heart rate was observed. &#x003b1;-MSH did not affect expression of inflammatory markers. Surprisingly, &#x003b1;-MSH impaired recovery of renal function in the first ten hours following DBD kidney transplantation possibly due to hemodynamic changes. Thus, in a porcine experimental model &#x003b1;-MSH did not reduce renal inflammation and did not improve short-term graft function following DBD kidney transplantation.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was supported by Aarhus University stipendium for W.

In 2012, 64% of all renal transplants in Europe were from DBD donors <xref rid="pone.0094609-Rahmel1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Despite significant advances in recipient management, delayed graft function (DGF) and primary non-function (PNF) remain as serious complications of DBD donor renal transplantation occurring in 18&#x02013;28% and 2&#x02013;4% of recipients respectively <xref rid="pone.0094609-Snoeijs1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0094609-Wadei1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. DGF is associated with additional burden to the patient and with increased rejection risk, reduced graft survival and higher costs associated with extended hospital admission. Thus, outcome from DBD donation remains inferior to living donation. Preventing injury to the DBD kidney allograft may improve short-term kidney function and also influence longer term graft survival.</p><p>Brain death induces a systemic, inflammatory state. This is caused by hemodynamic changes and neuronal injury. Cytokines such as IL-6 and MCP-1 mediate leukocyte infiltration that occurs alongside systemic complement system activation <xref rid="pone.0094609-deVries1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0094609-vanderHoeven1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. This systemic response results in inflammatory activation of the donor end organ, which is increased by hemodynamic instability <xref rid="pone.0094609-vanderHoeven1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Overall, brain death results in injured organs even prior to organ retrieval. This injury is worsened by the additive effects of preservation and ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury <xref rid="pone.0094609-Watts1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. As the major part of I/R injury arises during the reperfusion phase, renoprotective treatment of recipients is an attractive therapeutic option.</p><p>&#x003b1;-melanocyte stimulating hormone is a pleiotropic neuropeptide with renoprotective capacities demonstrated in several models of acute kidney injury including cyclosporine induced nephrotoxicity <xref rid="pone.0094609-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, ureteral obstruction <xref rid="pone.0094609-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> and I/R injury <xref rid="pone.0094609-Chiao1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0094609-Simmons1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. In renal I/R models &#x003b1;-MSH administered up to six hours post-reperfusion improved renal function and resulted in reduced acute tubular necrosis and neutrophil influx <xref rid="pone.0094609-Chiao1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. The protective effect is not fully dependent on inhibition of neutrophil activation, as &#x003b1;-MSH was still protective in renal I/R in ICAM-1 knock-out mice <xref rid="pone.0094609-Chiao2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. In addition, &#x003b1;-MSH prevented the down-regulation of aquaporins and sodium transporters involved in tubular reabsorbtion of water following acute kidney injury <xref rid="pone.0094609-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094609-Gong1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p><p>As DBD donor kidney allografts are affected by the brain death process and I/R injury, &#x003b1;-MSH treatment of the recipient may post-condition kidneys to improve short-term renal function following transplantation and reduce the incidence of DGF and PNF. We therefore hypothesized that &#x003b1;-MSH treatment of the recipient protects against renal inflammation and I/R injury in a porcine model of DBD kidney transplantation leading to improved early graft function.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Animals and ethics statement</title><p>Twenty-four Danish Landrace pigs (50&#x02013;65 kg.) were used. The pigs were fasted overnight before surgery with free access to water. The animal experiments were performed in strict accordance with international and Danish guidelines of animal research. The study protocol was approved by the Danish Animal Experiments Inspectorate and included moving, sedation and surgery of the animals (permit number: 2012-15-2934-00122). All surgery was performed under anesthesia and all efforts were made to minimize suffering. Samples size of eight animals per treatment group was calculated based on a 2-sided &#x003b1; of 0.05, a power of 0.9 and an effect size of 1.92.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Study design</title><p>To test our hypothesis, we used a randomized, paired design. Eight pigs were used as DBD donors and both kidneys were transplanted. After four hours of brain death both kidneys were removed and cold storage lasted nineteen hours. Donor kidneys derived from the same donor were transplanted simultaneously to one &#x003b1;-MSH- and one vehicle treated recipient. The follow-up was ten hours following reperfusion. The study was investigator-blinded and recipients were randomized in a paired design into two treatment groups. Surgeons and right- and left kidneys were also randomized into the two treatment groups. &#x003b1;-MSH (Bachem, Bubendorf, Switzerland) was dosed at 200 &#x000b5;g/kg and saline (0,9%) served as vehicle treatment. 200 &#x000b5;g/kg was chosen based on its protective effect against renal I/R injury as shown by Gong et al. and Simmons et al. <xref rid="pone.0094609-Gong1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094609-Simmons1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.

After intubation continuous anesthesia was maintained using propofol (8 mg/kg/hr) and fentanyl (25 &#x000b5;g/kg/hr). Animals were ventilated with 40% oxygen and a tidal volume of 10 ml/kg. Expiratory CO2 was controlled between 4.5- and 5.5 kPA by adjusting respiratory rate. Ringer acetate was infused continuously (donors: 10 ml/kg/hr; recipients: 15 ml/kg/hr). The carotid artery and jugular vein were catheterized. Blood pressure was monitored via a pressure catheter in the carotid artery. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) was maintained above 60 mmHg. If MAP decreased below 60 mmHg a bolus infusion of one liter Ringer's acetate was given and if not sufficient to maintain MAP above 60 mmHg an intravenous bolus of adrenalin (0.05 mg) was administered. Cefuroxime (750 mg) was administered as antibiotic treatment before start of surgery and repeated after six hours. A bolus of 20 ml 50% glucose was administered if the blood glucose level dropped below 4.0 mmol/l.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Deceased brain dead kidney donation</title><p>For brain dead induction two holes were drilled in the cranium.

Antigens were retrieved by boiling sections for 15 minutes in Tris/EGTA buffer (pH 9.0). Endogenous biotin was blocked using a ready-to-use blocking kit (X0590, DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark). Unspecific binding of free aldehyde groups was blocked by 30 minutes incubation in 50 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl followed by blocking of unspecific antibody binding by 30 minutes incubation in 1%BSA, 0,2% gelatin and 0,05% saponin.

Surprisingly, &#x003b1;-MSH treatment impaired recovery of GFR following DBD transplantation. Furthermore, no anti-inflammatory capacities of &#x003b1;-MSH were observed after ten hours follow-up. Urinary excretion of markers of acute kidney injury, AAP and NAG, were reduced by &#x003b1;-MSH treatment, but only in the first 30 minutes post-reperfusion and urinary NGAL excretion was not affected. Besides, &#x003b1;-MSH administration was associated with a slightly increased AQP-2 protein expression in renal cortex. However, it is uncertain whether these small changes in urinary markers of acute kidney injury and aquaporin expression are clinically relevant.</p><p>&#x003b1;-MSH impaired GFR recovery after DBD kidney transplantation. This may be explained by changes in hemodynamics following each dose of &#x003b1;-MSH. Heart rate increased by approximately ten beats per minute in the hour following &#x003b1;-MSH administration, while &#x003b1;-MSH administration was associated with 10 mmHg reduction of MAP. In the literature, the effects of &#x003b1;-MSH on hemodynamics are variable. In particular the hemodynamic effect of intravenous administration of &#x003b1;-MSH is debatable and mainly based on studies in rodents <xref rid="pone.0094609-Rinne1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0094609-DysterAas1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. However, in sheep &#x003b1;-MSH (75 &#x000b5;g/kg) decreased MAP, while heart rate and aortic flow increased directly following treatment suggesting a decrease of systemic vascular resistance. Blood flow to lungs and heart increased, but renal blood flow was not significantly affected <xref rid="pone.0094609-Llanos1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.</p><p>In this study, 200 &#x000b5;g/kg &#x003b1;-MSH was used, which was chosen based on the previously shown protective effect against renal I/R injury <xref rid="pone.0094609-Gong1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094609-Simmons1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Gong et al. demonstrated the protective effect of &#x003b1;-MSH in renal I/R injury in rats <xref rid="pone.0094609-Gong1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Furthermore, Simmons et al. tested the protective effects of 200 &#x000b5;g/kg AP214, which is a synthetic analogue of &#x003b1;-MSH with 6 lysine residues added to its amino terminus, in renal I/R in pigs <xref rid="pone.0094609-Simmons1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. However, in both the rodent- and porcine I/R model the effect of &#x003b1;-MSH or AP214 on hemodynamics was not investigated. It was therefore unexpected that &#x003b1;-MSH seemed to directly affect hemodynamics. Possibly, the hemodynamic changes counteracted the proposed renoprotective effect of &#x003b1;-MSH.</p><p>Recently, it has been shown that &#x003b1;-MSH is able to induce vasodilatation by endothelial derived nitric oxide (NO) via activation of melanocyte receptor-1 (MCR1) <xref rid="pone.0094609-Rinne2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Based on this mechanism one could speculate that &#x003b1;-MSH might increase GFR due to the expression of MCR1 in renal glomeruli <xref rid="pone.0094609-Lindskog1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. However, we did not observe this in our model. A potential stimulative effect of &#x003b1;-MSH on GFR might be counteracted by systemic vasodilatation and subsequent decreased MAP. As a consequence, this would lead to production of catecholamines and activation of the renin angiotensin aldosterone system, activation of which would result in increased sodium retention and renal vasoconstriction <xref rid="pone.0094609-Brewster1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Our results indeed show reduced sodium excretion, however we acknowledge the precise hemodynamic effects of &#x003b1;-MSH still have to be unraveled including the possible differential effects on afferent and efferent glomerular arterioles. We speculate the hemodynamic changes observed as a consequence of &#x003b1;-MSH administration caused impaired GFR in this model.</p><p>The follow-up of ten hours after transplantation is relatively short, which is a limitation. Based on the protective effect of &#x003b1;-MSH against acute kidney injury, the short follow-up was chosen specifically to study the effects of &#x003b1;-MSH on immediate graft function and acute inflammation following DBD transplantation <xref rid="pone.0094609-Chiao1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0094609-Simmons1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. The effect of &#x003b1;-MSH on long-term renal function after transplantation and structural injury was not investigated and cannot be deducted from our present results. However, &#x003b1;-MSH impaired recovery of GFR and failed to show any reduction of inflammatory qRT-PCR markers. We believe it is rather unlikely that the short follow-up period masked the capacity of &#x003b1;-MSH to improve early graft function following DBD transplantation.</p><p>&#x003b1;-MSH can bind to four different melanocortin receptors (MCR1, MCR3, MCR4, MCR5). These different receptors are responsible for pleiotropic function of &#x003b1;-MSH, like regulation of pigmentation, hemodynamics, glucose metabolism and immunomodulation <xref rid="pone.0094609-Catania1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094609-Kohda1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. The anti-inflammatory effect is mainly mediated by MCR1, but also by MCR3 and MCR4. The anti-inflammatory capacities of &#x003b1;-MSH are based on modulation of antigen presenting cells and reduced production of cytokines such as IL-1&#x003b2;, TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-6 <xref rid="pone.0094609-Catania1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094609-Brzoska1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094609-Spaccapelo1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Although MCR1 and MCR3 expression in the kidney is slightly decreased after renal I/R, renal expression of these receptors suggests &#x003b1;-MSH treatment might be locally protective <xref rid="pone.0094609-Catania1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094609-Lee2" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Chiao et al. showed using isolated perfused kidneys after renal ischemia that addition of &#x003b1;-MSH to the perfusion solution improves renal function indicating that &#x003b1;-MSH mediated renoprotection is based on a renal binding to MCR's <xref rid="pone.0094609-Chiao2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. In our study, no differences in cortical expression of several markers of inflammation was found between controls and &#x003b1;-MSH treated animals. The local anti-inflammatory effects, as shown in models of acute kidney injury <xref rid="pone.0094609-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094609-Chiao1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094609-Jo1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, might be counteracted by systemic effects of MCR1,3&#x02013;5. The hemodynamic effects and the effect on blood glucose levels suggest systemic activity of &#x003b1;-MSH in this porcine transplantation model. Selective agonists of MCR1, MCR3 or MCR4 might induce anti-inflammatory effects without possible adverse effects of activating the complete MCR system.</p><p>Renal I/R injury results in down-regulation of aquaporins and sodium transporters <xref rid="pone.0094609-Kohda1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094609-Hussein1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Aquaporins and sodium transporters are important for the renal reabsorptive capacity of water and sodium. In models of acute kidney injury, prevention of down-regulation of aquaporins and sodium transporters is associated with reduced sodium and water excretion and improved renal function <xref rid="pone.0094609-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094609-Kwon1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094609-Gong1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094609-Jensen1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. In this study &#x003b1;-MSH seemed to slightly increased cortical AQP-2 protein expression. Clinically, urine flow was halved and sodium excretion reduced, but recovery of GFR was impaired. These functional renal effects are presumably caused by changes in hemodynamics and not by the small changes in AQP-2 expression.</p><p>The anti-inflammatory effects and improvement of renal function observed after &#x003b1;-MSH treatment in various models of acute renal injury suggested &#x003b1;-MSH could prevent DGF and PNF following DBD kidney transplantation.
