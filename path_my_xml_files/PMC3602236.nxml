There is uncertainty among clinicians as to whether a &#x02018;compensating extraction&#x02019; (removal of the upper first permanent molar to prevent it over erupting) is necessary despite current guidelines recommending this. As a result, unnecessary dental extractions may be carried out or children may be failing to receive extractions required to achieve optimal long-term oral health. In addition, the decision to extract fewer or more teeth affects management options (local anesthetic injections alone, inhalation sedation or general anesthesia) needed to support the child with the surgical procedure(s).</p><p>The SIXES (Should I eXtract Every Six) dental trial investigates clinical effectiveness and quality of life for conventional treatment (following the guideline of compensation extraction of the upper first permanent molar) compared with the alternative intervention (removal of lower first permanent molars but no extraction of the upper).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>This is a multicenter, two-arm parallel group randomized clinical trial. Allocation will be web-based randomization. Practitioners in primary and secondary care settings, reflecting the points of presentation and treatment of eligible patients, will recruit 400 children, aged 7 to 11 years requiring extraction of lower first permanent molars but who have upper first permanent molars of good prognosis. Baseline measures (prior to treatment) and outcome data (at one and five years, or when the patient reaches 14 years of age) will be assessed through study models and child/parent questionnaires.</p><p>The primary outcome measure is degree of tipping of the lower second permanent molar, (favorable outcome is tipping less than 15&#x000b0;).</p><p>The secondary outcomes are type of anesthetic/sedation used, residual spacing (between lower second premolar and second permanent molar), orthodontic treatment requirement, quality of life, and over-eruption in the intervention group. Assessors will be blinded where possible.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>SIXES dental trial investigates whether compensating extraction of upper first permanent molars should be carried out following loss of lower first permanent molars. Currently dentists and orthodontists face a dilemma in clinical decision-making, relying on the lowest level of evidence - expert opinion. SIXES will provide evidence to support decision-making and inform practices and may result in reduced tooth extractions.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Clinical Trials.gov Identifier: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01591265?term=NCT01591265&#x00026;rank=1">NCT01591265</ext-link></p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>First permanent molar</kwd><kwd>Compensating extraction</kwd><kwd>Orthodontics</kwd><kwd>Pediatric dentistry</kwd><kwd>Primary care</kwd><kwd>Randomized control trial</kwd><kwd>Dental</kwd><kwd>Oral health-related quality of life</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>The first permanent molars (FPMs) are the permanent teeth most commonly assessed as having a poor prognosis due to them being the permanent teeth most susceptible to dental caries in childhood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] and the high prevalence of molar-incisor hypomineralization (MIH) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. It is accepted that while forced extraction of FPMs is rarely ideal, with appropriate timing and case selection, it can result in an acceptable occlusion for the child [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Preferably, all cases where planned loss of FPMs is anticipated should be managed jointly with an orthodontist, but this is not always possible. Treatment planning is complicated by the need to consider other factors alongside occlusal aspects such as the possible absence of other permanent teeth, the prognosis of the remaining molars, the anticipated cooperation of the child with any proposed restorative treatment, and socioeconomic factors. In addition, FPM teeth are the largest in the dentition, and their successful extraction places demands on both the child and the clinician.</p><p>To assist dentists in treatment planning, a national guidance document is available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. As well as advice on timing of extractions, this guidance recommends that in Class I and Class II cases, the extraction of a mandibular FPM should be compensated by the extraction of the opposing maxillary FPM. The rationale for compensating the extraction of a lower FPM is that an unopposed maxillary FPM may over-erupt and prevent mesial migration of the erupting lower second permanent molar. However, it has been suggested that there is little evidence to support this being a significant risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Furthermore, the extraction of an additional FPM places an increased burden on both the child and the dental team providing care for them, and may tip the balance of decision as to whether the extractions can be carried out under local anesthesia, towards favoring dental general anesthesia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>In summary, current clinical guidelines state that when a lower FPM is extracted, the upper FPM should also be extracted, yet this recommendation is based on little or no evidence. This randomized clinical trial will provide the evidence to answer this question: Is it necessary to extract the upper FPM routinely when extracting the lower FPM in the mixed dentition in order to prevent over-eruption of the upper FPM, which can cause occlusal problems?</p><p>Should this study find the procedure to be unnecessary, it will result in a reduction in the number of teeth extracted. The impact of the study would then be significant for children and their carers, as well as providers and purchasers of dental treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Rationale for the study</title><sec><title>Do unopposed molar teeth over erupt?</title><p>There is good evidence that unopposed permanent molar teeth can over erupt. Kiliaridis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] reported on 84 permanent molar teeth, which were known to have been unopposed for a minimum of 10 years, in 53 adults (mean age 65, range 40 to 89). While 18% of the molars showed no over-eruption (to visual examination of study models), 58% had over-erupted by up to 2 mm, while 24% had over-erupted in excess of 2 mm. There was no difference detected between maxillary and mandibular molars.</p><p>One cross-sectional study of 100 adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] with unopposed molar teeth, and a matched control group of 100 adults with opposing molars, reported over-eruption in 92% of unopposed molar cases. There was a mean value of 1.44 mm more over-eruption in the unopposed molar group than in the control group with opposing molars. This was less than 2 mm in 73% of cases. The extent of over-eruption was significantly greater in maxillary unopposed teeth than in mandibular unopposed teeth.</p><p>In a study of 91 adults who had molars which had been either partially or completely unopposed for a minimum of five years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] partial occlusal contact did not inhibit overeruption but did increase the likelihood of tipping. Smith [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] looked at overeruption of lower second permanent molars in 42 patients following loss of maxillary second molars, comparing them with 42 matched control patients. Overeruption of the unopposed mandibular second molars was found to occur, but this was largely confined to the distal aspect (which was unopposed by the maxillary FPM), with a mean value of less than 1mm. Christou [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and Compagnon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] both reported overeruption of unopposed posterior teeth over time but, again, these studies involved adults.</p></sec><sec><title>Is potential overeruption of a maxillary first permanent molar a significant risk to the development of a healthy occlusion?</title><p>For patients within the age range for consideration for planned loss of FPMs, there are two possible complications of over-eruption of an unopposed maxillary FPM: 1) prevention of desired mesial movement of the mandibular second permanent molar and 2) the development of occlusal interferences, leading to temporo-mandibular joint dysfunction syndrome (TMDS).</p></sec><sec><title>Prevention of mesial movement of mandibular second molar</title><p>The Royal College of Surgeons of England (RCS) national guidance document [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] cites Holm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] as the main data source for supporting compensating extractions following loss of lower FPMs. This paper is a conference report, reviewing 1,119 cases involving loss of one or more FPMs over a 10-year period at the Hamburg Public Orthodontic Institute. The review was carried out principally to assess the proportion of cases involving loss of FPMs, and the patterns of extraction. Although the poorest outcomes were found in cases of uncompensated extraction of lower FPMs, no data were presented to support this. In contrast, Mejare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] reviewed 32 patients (mean age 18 years) who had loss of one or more FPMs in childhood (mean age 10 years) due to molar incisor hypomineralization (MIH). Of this sample, five patients had an uncompensated extraction of a lower FPM, and in none of these patients was over-eruption of the upper FPM noted. In addition, in a longitudinal study of 27 children who had one or more FPMs extracted due to MIH, Jalevick [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] reported no significant occlusal problems with the four children with uncompensated extractions of lower FPMs, and recommended against the need for compensating extractions. Patient satisfaction was also investigated in this study, and it was reported that of the five children assessed as having need of orthodontic correction of their occlusion, three of them declined treatment as they felt there was no need for it.</p></sec><sec><title>Development of occlusal interferences</title><p>Craddock, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] in a cross-sectional study of 100 adult patients with at least one unopposed posterior tooth, and 100 control subjects, reported that 53% of the patients in the unopposed molar group had retruded contact position contacts or excursive interferences, compared with 12% of the controls. However, Agerberg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] reported in a study of 140 teenagers and young adults that 89% of all subjects showed at least one occlusal interference, and that no correlation between the number of missing teeth and the number of interferences could be found. Heikinheimo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], in a longitudinal study of 167 adolescents, found that none had a functionally optimal occlusion at 15 years of age, and that although around 30% of the sample had some tenderness to palpation of the muscles of mastication, none was found to have significant symptoms of TMDS.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec><title>Trial Purpose</title><p>The purpose of this trial is to provide reliable evidence for clinicians as to whether compensating extraction of upper FPMs (as per current guidelines) should be carried out following loss of lower FPMs.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Objectives</title><p>The objective of this trial is to determine whether compensating extraction of upper FPMs following loss of lower FPMs in children is of benefit. The particular benefits being investigated are related to the resulting occlusion and oral health-related quality of life.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><sec><title>Overview</title><p>The SIXES Trial is a multicenter, two-arm parallel group randomized controlled trial using a superiority framework (see Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Measurements will be taken at one year after treatment and then again at either five years after treatment or when the patient reaches 14 years of age, whichever occurs first. The trial will be set in both primary and secondary care settings, reflecting the points of presentation and treatment of eligible patients.

This study design is based around routine care as practitioners use both the current guidelines and the proposed intervention in their treatment of patients. It aims to assess these practices relative to one another and, as such is a low-risk study assessing current practice.</p><p>Study recruitment is taking place over a 24-month period commencing in July 2012, with the coordinating site being the Dundee Dental Hospital Orthodontic and Paediatric Dentistry Departments. Other sites will be recruited to the trial.</p><p>Dentists are considered eligible to participate if they treat child patients and are willing to undergo good clinical practice (GCP)/research governance framework (RGF) training. Tailored training relevant to dental studies involving children for study GCP and RGF is being delivered by Tayside medical Science Centre (TASC).</p><p>Prior to study recruitment at any individual site, there will be a site initiation visit and site staff will receive training on the study design, methodology, clinical intervention and on maintaining trial documentation, including the CRFs, questionnaires and investigator site file.</p></sec><sec><title>Participant inclusion criteria</title><p>Age:&#x02003;7 to 11 years</p><p>Dental History:&#x02003;Able to cooperate with dental treatment Regular attender or considered likely to return for follow-up</p><p>Social History:&#x02003;Child and carer able to understand study documentation and give consent to participate in study</p><p>Dental condition:&#x02003;One or two lower FPMs requiring extraction Upper FPMs are sound or restorable/restored with good long term prognosis (that is, has or requires a single surface restoration with caries less than half-way into dentine, restoration with a simple restoration)Confirmed presence of all second premolars and all second molars</p></sec><sec><title>Participant exclusion criteria</title><p>Medical history:&#x02003;Medical contraindication to dental extractions</p><p>Dental condition:&#x02003;Poor prognosis of premolars or permanent second molar teethAll four upper incisors in crossbite Poor prognosis of upper FPM Confirmed absence of one or more second premolars and second molarsDeclines to have impressions taken.</p></sec><sec><title>Interventions</title><p>The patient will continue to have all other treatment planned and carried out as normal. The only difference in treatment will be related to the FPM extractions (one side only per patient will be entered into the trial). For patients allocated to the control arm, both the upper FPM and lower FPM will be extracted. For patients in the intervention arm, only the lower FPM will be extracted.</p><p>Only one side of the mouth will have data collected for the study. For patients who require extraction of lower FPMs on both sides of the mouth, the decision of which side to include in the study will be taken through randomization.</p><p>The control group will have the normal standard intervention according to the current standard guidelines, and will receive routine patient care with the normal practice of compensation extraction, while the intervention group will have removal of their lower FPMs but no compensation extraction of the upper FPM will be carried out.</p></sec><sec><title>Training in intervention</title><p>As the proposed intervention is removing a tooth, which is standard clinical practice, no specific training on that procedure is required.</p></sec><sec><title>Participant timeline</title><p>Patients will be identified by clinicians participating in the trial from either the patients&#x02019; own dentist or orthodontist; or a secondary care orthodontic or pediatric department.</p><p>Patients who are found, during routine dental examination or assessment, to require extraction of a lower FPM will be assessed by their dentist or orthodontist for meeting the inclusion criteria. Patients who meet the inclusion criteria will have the study discussed with them and their parents/guardians by their clinician. A participant information leaflet will be given. Patients will be given a further appointment for the extractions, at least 24 hours after receiving the information and at this time, the study will be discussed again. However if treatment is to be carried out at the same appointment (for example, where patients are in pain), there will be time allowed for the patient and parent/carer to read the documentation and ask any questions to ensure they have sufficient time and information for consent to be informed. Consent/assent processes will be carried out and then randomization undertaken. Extraction(s) will be carried out as per randomization and the remaining treatment plan.</p><p>The patient will complete the first questionnaire and have upper and lower impressions taken for study models to be cast. When the patient returns for 1-year follow-up, they will complete the Year 1 Follow-up Questionnaire and have upper and lower impressions taken for study models to be cast. When the patient returns for final follow-up (at five years or when the patient has reached 14 years of age), they will complete the Final Follow-up Questionnaire and have upper and lower impressions taken for study models to be cast.</p></sec><sec><title>Target sample size</title><p>The sample size calculation is based on the primary outcome of tipping of the lower molar tooth. There are no published data on which to base the calculation, therefore local audit data were used. These data indicated that tipping of the molar (a dichotomous outcome of either less than or more than 15 degrees tipping in the vertical direction) lies somewhere between 50:50 and 60:40 for good to poor outcome in a representative group. A finding of a difference in this proportion of 10 percent between the two groups, for example proportions of 50:50 and 40:60, in the two comparison groups would be deemed to be clinically significant.</p><p>Sample size calculation for a power of 0.8 and an alpha of 0.05 indicated a sample of 124 in each group if the true population proportion is 60:40, or 171 if the proportion is 50:50. It was therefore decided to set the required sample size at 150 in each group, requiring 300 in total. Allowing for a drop-out rate of 25% our target sample size is therefore 400.</p></sec><sec><title>Dentist recruitment and retention strategies</title><p>Recruitment of dentists has begun and will continue to take place in the settings from which participants will be recruited:</p><p>1. Secondary care (NHS Tayside): at Dundee Dental Hospital and School, in the Orthodontic and Paediatric Department, all clinicians who see children for routine check-up appointments or non-urgent secondary care assessments, have been invited to participate in the recruitment and follow-up of children in the study. Good clinical practice (GCP) trained staff will be able to consent patients.</p><p>2. Primary care practices (including NHS Tayside practices) and orthodontic practices: in Scotland, General Dental Practitioners (GDPs) who are part of the SDPBRN Rapid Evaluation Network and dentists who have participated in other trials will be invited to participate.</p><p>It is expected that up to 40 sites will be recruited to participate in this trial. Sites will be initiated in batches of 5 to 10 sites per recruitment period. A batch of sites in an area will be started and recruitment targets reviewed before a new set of sites is initiated (See Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Projected recruitment and study site enrollment.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1745-6215-14-59-3"/></fig><p>To help with retaining dentists in the study, the following strategies are being employed:</p><p>1. The trial manager will maintain contact with the practitioners, manage any non-clinical queries and refer clinical problems to the dental staff.</p><p>2. Continuous Professional Development points will be made available for attendance at any meetings.</p><p>3. Newsletters will be issued during the 2 years of patient recruitment, then at 3 years and 4 years (to mark the 1 year review) and at the final 6 and 7 year time points to update dentists on trial progress and help to maintain engagement with the study.</p><p>4. A final report will be issued to all of the participating dentists.</p></sec><sec><title>Participant recruitment and retention</title><p>Patients who meet the inclusion criteria will receive an invitation to take part in the trial will be identified during attendance at appointments with clinicians participating in the trial.</p><p>It is anticipated that the majority of patients will be attending for a six monthly routine check-up appointment (primary care GDP or community dentist) or a non-urgent secondary care assessment (practice-based specialist orthodontist, hospital-based orthodontic service and pediatric department).</p><p>Patients attending for routine check-up appointments or non-urgent assessments, who meet the inclusion criteria, will be assessed by the dentist for eligibility, and asked whether they wish to participate when they return for treatment at their next appointment. The patients and parents will be given information on the study to take home with them. Consent will be taken at the subsequent appointment by a dentist participating in the trial as a principal investigator (PI). Randomization will be carried out prior to this appointment and treatment.</p><p>For children who attend for urgent appointments, presenting in pain, the patients and their parents will also be approached at the time of their appointment about whether they wish to participate in the study. Because there is the need to alleviate the child&#x02019;s symptoms as soon as possible, usually involving extraction of the tooth, there is no scope for 24 hours to reflect on the trial information. For this reason some patients will be invited to participate at their assessment appointment. Consent and randomization will still follow best practice, and parents and patients will still be given time to look at the patient information sheets and consider the study. The intervention in this study (extraction of a single tooth compared with extraction of two teeth) still allows the patient to return for conventional treatment (extraction of the upper FPM) should they be allocated to the intervention arm but change their mind about participation at a later date.</p><p>On enrollment to the SIXES trial, parents and patients will be given &#x02018;calling cards&#x02019; saying that they are participating in the study, with details of their dentists and who to contact regarding the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Participant allocation</title><p>Sequence generation and randomization will be via a centrally controlled web-based GCP compliant randomization system, run by Tayside Clinical Trials Unit (TCTU). Randomization will be stratified by site.

Patients attending the Dundee Dental Hospital and receiving treatment there will give consent to one of the trial team wherever possible. If this is not possible, a suitably trained dentist will obtain consent. Regardless of location, consent of the patients will be performed by dentists who will be conversant with the study design and protocol, and be GCP trained in line with the Research Governance Framework (RGF).</p><p>The parent(s)/legal guardian(s) of all children in the study will provide written informed consent before any study procedures are carried out and a participant information sheet will be provided to facilitate this process. Where possible, and with the agreement of the parent(s)/legal guardian(s), participating children will also be asked to provide written or oral assent. Those not competent in English will be invited to bring an interpreter with them to the subsequent treatment appointment or to request an NHS interpreter, where this service is available.</p><p>As part of the consent process parent(s)/legal guardian(s) must agree to researchers and regulatory representatives having access to their medical records for monitoring and audit purposes. Parent(s)/legal guardian(s) may withdraw their consent to participate at any time during the study.</p><p>The investigator or delegated member of the trial team and the child should sign and date the Assent form whereas the parent and investigator should sign the Informed Consent form(s) to confirm that consent has been obtained. The participant should then receive a copy of this document and a copy should be filed in the investigator site file (ISF).</p></sec><sec><title>Withdrawal procedures</title><p>Parent(s)/legal guardian(s) will be informed that they have the right to withdraw their child from the study at any time. The right to refuse to participate without reasons will be respected. After the participant has entered the study the clinician remains free to give alternative treatment to that specified in the protocol at any stage if he/she feels that it is in the participant&#x02019;s best interest, but reasons for doing so will be recorded. In these cases the participants remain within the study for the purposes of follow-up and data analysis. All participants will be free to withdraw at any time from the study without giving reasons and without prejudicing further treatment.</p><p>Due to the extended follow-up period for this trial (5 years), some children may be lost to follow-up. If a patient withdraws due to geographical reasons or because he or she is receiving treatment elsewhere, it may be feasible to send the review questionnaire to that patient, as we will attempt to track all patients using their CHI number by contacting their GP or GDP. Attempts will be made to continue data collection from the patient through the new GDP.</p><p>If the level of withdrawn participants is high it may be necessary to extend the recruitment period.</p><p>For participants who withdraw and do not wish to receive study related interventions, then no further contact will be made by the study team.</p><p>The study team can not foresee any incidences where a participant would be withdrawn for safety reasons as this is considered to be a one-off low risk intervention and involves routine dental practice of a common procedure (that is, dental extraction).</p></sec><sec><title>Confidentiality</title><p>All evaluation forms, reports, and other records will be identified in a manner designed to maintain participant confidentiality.
