The primary endpoint was objective response rate (sum of complete response and partial response). Secondary endpoints, ie, overall survival and progression-free survival, were estimated using the Kaplan&#x02013;Meier method. Efficacy was evaluated on the intent-to-treat and efficacy-evaluable sets. Safety was assessed from adverse event and serious adverse event data.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The objective response rate was significantly higher in the nimotuzumab group than in the control group in the intent-to-treat population (54% versus 34.5%; <italic>P</italic>=0.04).

Patients were randomly assigned to receive nimotuzumab plus chemotherapy (nimotuzumab group) or chemotherapy alone (control group), based on a centerwise, 1:1, permutated block randomization scheme. The study comprised concomitant, maintenance, and follow-up phases, and was conducted at eleven centers across India (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ott-7-1051">Figure 1</xref>). Patients were moved to the next stage only if they demonstrated an objective response (complete response/partial response/stable disease) according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 at the end of each stage.<xref rid="b24-ott-7-1051" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Patients showing progressive disease at any stage were discontinued from the study drug but were followed up for survival until the end of the trial. When disease progression was recorded at any stage of the trial, further treatment was administered at the investigators&#x02019; discretion. The participants or observers were not blinded because the study endpoints were objective parameters and bias was considered minimal. Ethical approval was obtained from their respective institutional ethical review boards. The study was conducted according to the ethical principles laid down in the Declaration of Helsinki, and was consistent with the ethical guidelines for Biomedical Research on Human Subjects issued by the Indian Council of Medical Research and the guidelines for Clinical Trials on Pharmaceutical Products in India-Good Clinical Practice Guidelines, issued by the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization, Ministry of Health, Government of India.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title><p>Indian patients of either sex and aged $18 years who had unresectable stage IIIB/IV NSCLC with at least one lesion that had not been irradiated previously and could be measured by RECIST, who were treatment na&#x000ef;ve, and met all inclusion criteria were enrolled in the study. Detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria are provided as supplementary material. All patients provided their written informed consent.</p></sec><sec><title>Intervention</title><p>Nimotuzumab 200 mg in 250 mL saline was administered intravenously over 30 minutes once weekly, and docetaxel 75 mg/m<sup>2</sup> was administered intravenously over one hour followed by carboplatin over 30 minutes every 3 weeks. The 200 mg dose of nimotuzumab was selected because this dose is reported to be as effective as 400 mg.<xref rid="b22-ott-7-1051" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> The dose of docetaxel was adjusted to 65 mg/m<sup>2</sup> for patients whose nadir platelet count during previous therapy was &#x0003c;25,000 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>, those who experienced febrile neutropenia, and those who had grade 3 or higher nonhematologic toxicities. In patients who required further dose reduction, a dose of 50 mg/m<sup>2</sup> was administered. The carboplatin dosage was determined by the Calvert formula based on the patient&#x02019;s pre-existing renal function. During the concomitant phase, patients in the nimotuzumab group received nimotuzumab weekly for 13 weeks along with chemotherapy, whereas the control group received chemotherapy alone. In both groups, chemotherapy was administered once every 3 weeks for a maximum of four cycles or until the development of progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity. In the maintenance phase, patients in the nimotuzumab group continued to receive the study drug weekly until development of progressive disease or the end of the study. No active treatment was administered in the control group. In the follow-up phase, patients showing disease progression during the concomitant or maintenance phase were contacted by telephone every 2 months for assessment of survival.</p></sec><sec><title>Assessments</title><p>The primary endpoint was objective response rate, defined as the sum of complete response and partial response, and was a direct measure of the drug&#x02019;s antitumor activity. Response was assessed using RECIST.<xref rid="b24-ott-7-1051" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Secondary endpoints included overall survival, progression-free survival, and the safety and tolerability profiles of each regimen. Safety was assessed based on the incidence of adverse events, serious adverse events, laboratory parameters, electrocardiograms, vital signs, and clinical parameters.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The objective response rate was calculated as the proportion of patients showing a complete response or partial response during the study. The Kaplan&#x02013;Meier method was used to estimate the 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of overall survival and progression-free survival. Overall survival was calculated from the date of randomization to the date of death from any cause. Progression-free survival was defined as the time from the start of treatment to the time of disease progression or the last scheduled visit. Survival distributions of both groups were compared using a log-rank test. The mean and standard error for overall survival and progression-free survival were also recorded. Continuous variables were summarized using mean, standard deviation, median, and range (minimum and maximum), while categorical variables were summarized using proportions (counts and percentages). The tests were two-sided, and were considered significant at <italic>P</italic>&#x02264;0.05. In total, 110 patients were to be recruited to obtain 100 evaluable patients (50 in each study group), considering a dropout rate of 10%. Sample size for this study was not calculated statistically. Efficacy was evaluated from two population sets, ie, the intent-to-treat set including all patients who were exposed to at least one dose of the study drug and returned for at least one visit after initiation of treatment, and the efficacy-evaluable set including patients who received at least two cycles of chemotherapy and had one assessment of tumor response. Subgroup analysis was conducted based on prognostic criteria.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 134 patients were screened; 110 were randomized and 24 were screening failures. The study was completed by three (5.7%) and four (7.0%) patients in the nimotuzumab and control groups, respectively, without disease progression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ott-7-1051">Figure 2</xref>). Demographic and baseline characteristics were similar between the two groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-ott-7-1051">Table 1</xref>). Of the 110 patients, 109 were included in the intent-to-treat population, ie, 53 (100%) and 56 (98.2%) in the nimotuzumab and control groups, respectively. Further, 94 of the 110 patients were included in the efficacy-evaluable population, ie, 45 (84.9%) and 49 (86%) in the nimotuzumab and control groups, respectively.</p><sec><title>Efficacy</title><sec><title>Primary endpoint</title><p>The primary efficacy endpoint was the objective response rate. In the intent-to-treat population, a complete response was achieved in two patients each in the nimotuzumab (4%) and control (3.6%) groups, while a partial response was achieved in 25 (50%) and 17 (30.9%) of patients in the nimotuzumab and control groups, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ott-7-1051">Figure 3</xref>). Statistically significant differences in objective response rate were observed between the nimotuzumab and control groups (54%, 95% CI 40.2&#x02013;67.8 versus 34.5%, 95% CI 22&#x02013;47.1; <italic>P</italic>=0.04). The trend in the efficacy-evaluable population was similar, with a significant difference in objective response rate between the nimotuzumab and control groups (60%, 95% CI 45.7&#x02013;74.3 versus 38.8%, 95% CI 25.1&#x02013;52.4; <italic>P</italic>=0.04). Subgroup analyses for the objective response rate were conducted by including known prognostic variables such as sex, tobacco use, stage of NSCLC, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, histopathology, and age. In the intent-to-treat population, the objective response rate was higher in the nimotuzumab group than in the control group for all subgroups, with the exception of the subgroup for undifferentiated histopathology (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-ott-7-1051">Table 2</xref>). However, no subgroup, except for the non-tobacco user group (<italic>P</italic>=0.01), showed a statistically significant difference. Similar results were observed in the efficacy-evaluable population.</p></sec><sec><title>Secondary endpoints</title><p>The secondary efficacy endpoints included overall survival and progression-free survival, which were evaluated during a median follow-up period of 26.17 months. In the intent-to-treat population, the difference in median overall survival was not statistically significant between the nimotuzumab and control groups (10.1 months, 95% CI 8.1&#x02013;13.6 versus 10.4 months, 95% CI 7.4&#x02013;13.7; <italic>P</italic>=0.48). The hazard ratio was 0.844 (95% CI 0.529&#x02013;1.35) in the nimotuzumab group relative to the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ott-7-1051">Figure 4</xref>). A similar trend was noted in the efficacy-evaluable population. The median overall survival was 10.1 months (95% CI 8.8&#x02013;13.6) in the nimotuzumab group versus 12.8 months (95% CI 8.8&#x02013;15.9) in the control group (<italic>P</italic>=0.66). The hazard ratio for the nimotuzumab group was 0.892 (95% CI 0.537&#x02013;1.482) relative to the control group. Like the overall survival results, the difference in progression-free survival in the intent-to-treat population was not statistically significant (<italic>P</italic>=0.31) between the nimotuzumab (4.9 months, 95% CI 4.5&#x02013;6.9) and control (4.8 months, 95% CI 2.8&#x02013;5.8) groups. The hazard ratio was 0.807 (95% CI 0.533&#x02013;1.222) for the nimotuzumab group relative to the control group. There was a similar trend in the efficacy-evaluable population, with a median progression-free survival of 6.5 months (95% CI 4.6&#x02013;8.3) in the nimotuzumab group and 5 months (95% CI 4.6&#x02013;6.1) in the control group (<italic>P</italic>=0.54).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Safety</title><p>All patients who received at least one dose of the study drug were included in the safety analysis. The median cumulative dose and duration of exposure to the study drug was 3,800 (range 600&#x02013;10,400) mg and 135 (range 15&#x02013;359) days, respectively, up to the end of the study. A total of 781 adverse events were reported during the study, of which 402 occurred in the nimotuzumab group and 379 in the control group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t3-ott-7-1051">Table 3</xref>). At least one adverse event was reported by 43 (81.1%) and 47 (82.5%) patients in the nimotuzumab and control groups, respectively. In the nimotuzumab arm, the most commonly reported adverse events overall were decreased appetite (28.3%; 15 patients) and cough (24.5%; 13 patients). The most common nimotuzumab-related adverse events were vomiting (5.7%; three patients), diarrhea (3.8%; two patients), fatigue (3.8%; two patients), pain (3.8%; two patients) and rash (3.8%; two patients). The majority of events in the nimotuzumab group were mild in severity (66.17%; 266 events). Life-threatening events were reported in eleven (20.8%) patients, and events that led to an outcome of death were reported in four (7.5%) patients. Of the 62 serious adverse events reported, two (febrile neutropenia and gastroenteritis) were considered related to the study drug. At least one mild adverse event was reported by 15 (28.3%) and 26 (45.6%) patients in the nimotuzumab and control groups, respectively. Laboratory parameters were similar between the nimotuzumab and control groups.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This Phase II trial showed that nimotuzumab was safe and well tolerated when used together with chemotherapy comprising docetaxel and carboplatin in patients with stage IIIB/IV NSCLC. Furthermore, the primary efficacy variable, objective response rate, was significantly higher in the nimotuzumab group (54%, 95% CI 40.2&#x02013;67.8) than in the control group (34.5%, 95% CI 22&#x02013;47.1). The objective response rate was also higher for most subgroups by prognostic criteria, although the differences were not statistically significant. No statistically significant between-group difference in overall survival or progression-free survival was observed. The incidence of adverse events was comparable between the groups. Decreased appetite and cough were the most common adverse events in the nimotuzumab group; also reported were vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, pain, and rash, and each of these was seen in &#x02264;6% of the nimotuzumab-treated patients. These results indicate a better safety profile for nimotuzumab compared with other monoclonal antibodies, given that previous studies of monoclonal antibodies such as cetuximab, matuzumab, and panitumumab have demonstrated a higher (60%&#x02013;80%) incidence of skin toxicities.<xref rid="b15-ott-7-1051" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p><p>The objective response rate achieved in our study (54%) is higher than that reported in some previous studies conducted in NSCLC patients administered a combination of EGFR monoclonal antibodies and chemotherapy.

The docetaxel and carboplatin combination when administered to patients with stage IIIB/IV NSCLC resulted in an overall survival of 9.2 months<xref rid="b27-ott-7-1051" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> and 9.4 months<xref rid="b28-ott-7-1051" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> in two separate studies. Nimotuzumab in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin as second-line therapy offered a median overall survival of 9.8 months.<xref rid="b23-ott-7-1051" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> In our study, like overall survival, there were no significant between-group differences in progression-free survival (<italic>P</italic>=0.31); the median progression-free survival of 4.9 months achieved in the nimotuzumab group was comparable with that of 4.44 months observed in another study using cetuximab in combination with a taxane.<xref rid="b26-ott-7-1051" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></p><p>Based on our study results, nimotuzumab seems to produce a higher response rate than other monoclonal antibodies, but does not significantly change overall survival. Previous studies have reported that various factors, such as genetic mutations and nonoptimal administration of EGFR antagonists, may influence the direct effects of EGFR- targeted therapies on overall survival.<xref rid="b19-ott-7-1051" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="b29-ott-7-1051" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Perhaps future studies examining the impact of nimotuzumab on survival in greater detail are warranted. Previous clinical trials have already demonstrated the safety and tolerability of nimotuzumab in NSCLC in combination with radiotherapy<xref rid="b21-ott-7-1051" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="b22-ott-7-1051" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> and a different chemotherapy regimen.<xref rid="b23-ott-7-1051" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Our results demonstrate that nimotuzumab in combination with docetaxel and carboplatin is safe. In addition, consistent with earlier studies, the incidence of skin rash was low, presenting in only 3.8% of patients in the nimotuzumab group. The advantage of nimotuzumab over other anti-EGFR antibodies is its benign side effect profile.<xref rid="b16-ott-7-1051" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> This can be attributed to its bivalent binding to the EGFR<xref rid="b30-ott-7-1051" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> and possibly to the fact that it does not disrupt the basal level of EGFR signalling.<xref rid="b31-ott-7-1051" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></p><p>The low toxicity and high response rate associated with nimotuzumab suggest that it could be a promising monoclonal antibody for patients with advanced NSCLC. The standard first-line treatment for patients with advanced NSCLC is chemotherapy consisting of a platinum analog combined with either vinorelbine, gemcitabine, pemetrexed (in patients with nonsquamous disease), or a taxane, such as paclitaxel or docetaxel.<xref rid="b32-ott-7-1051" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Maintenance therapy is administered to patients whose tumor growth has been controlled after a specified number of chemotherapy cycles. This therapy is continued until the occurrence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression, and requires agents causing minimal toxicity.<xref rid="b32-ott-7-1051" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> While nimotuzumab fits into this definition, further optimization to improve overall survival is warranted.</p><p>This study has some limitations. First, the sample size was not calculated statistically. Second, the partici pants and the observers were not blinded. Although observer bias was considered minimal because the endpoints were objective parameters, a potential for bias might exist. Third, the response of patients to the study drug was evaluated by the investigator but was not confirmed by a radiologist, and this could have led to some bias in the results. Fourth, this is not a histopathologically directed study and randomization was not stratified according to histopathological type. It is possible that a study of nimotuzumab in a histopathologically directed trial would obtain a different result. Finally, it is possible that the second-line treatment may have exerted an effect on overall survival, and this was not taken into account. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that nimotuzumab in combination with chemotherapy comprising docetaxel and carboplatin improved the objective response rate significantly as compared with chemotherapy alone, and the combination was well tolerated without any meaningful safety concerns in patients with stage IIIB/IV NSCLC.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary information</title><sec><title>Inclusion criteria</title><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Subjects who have a histologically or cytologically confirmed unresectable stage IIIB/IV non-small-cell lung cancer.</p></list-item><list-item><p>At least one evaluable lesion which is not irradiated, that can be measured using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Subjects who are treatment-na&#x000ef;ve.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Should have completed at least 4 weeks from last major surgery and prior radiation therapy to the pelvis, spine, or long bones and recovered from side effects.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Subjects must have Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 to 1.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Subjects of either sex aged &#x02265;18 years.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Subjects with life expectancy &#x02265;12 weeks.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Subjects who are willing to use effective methods of contraception starting with visit 1 and for at least 30 days after the last dose of study medication.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Laboratory parameters within normal ranges that are defined for this study by:
