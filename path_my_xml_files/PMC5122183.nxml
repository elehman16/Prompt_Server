Exacerbation of COPD has negative effect on quality of life. Therapeutic effect of nebulized antibiotics in pulmonary infections has been reported previously. Hence, we evaluated the effect of nebulized gentamicin in acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD).</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>In this clinical trial study, 86 hospitalized patients with AECOPD were divided into two groups for using nebulized gentamicin twice daily (case group) and placebo (control group) for 5 days in addition to standard treatment. On admission and on the 6<sup>th</sup> day, respiratory rate (RR), white blood cell (WBC), spirometry, and SPO<sup>2</sup> (arterial O<sup>2</sup> saturation by pulse oxymetry) were measured in groups. The severity of dyspnea was evaluated by the Medical Research Council scale.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>In both groups, changes of SpO<sub>2</sub>, RR, forced an expiratory volume of first second (FEV1), and forced vital capacity (FVC) were significant during the times of intervention (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). However, changes of FEV1 and FVC were significantly different between two groups (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). So that increments of FEV1 and FVC were higher in the case group than control group. WBC decreased significantly in the case group (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) compared to control group.

Exacerbations and comorbidities contribute to the overall severity in individual patients.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] COPD, the fourth leading cause of death in the world,[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] represents an important public health challenge that is both preventable and treatable. Globally, the COPD burden is projected to increase in coming decades because of continued exposure to COPD risk factors and aging of the population.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD) is triggered by infection with bacteria or viruses (which may coexist), environmental pollutants, or unknown factors. During respiratory exacerbations, there is increased hyperinflation and gas trapping, with reduced expiratory flow, thus accounting for the increased dyspnea.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Although the infectious agents in COPD exacerbations can be viral or bacterial,[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] the use of antibiotics in exacerbations remains controversial. In several studies, colonization and infection with <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (PA) have been shown.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Different studies have been done on the effect of nebulized antibiotics on different chronic lung diseases,[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] but there are controversy results and the data are not conclusive to prove the therapeutic effect of this treatment. Therefore, we evaluated the effect of nebulized gentamicin in AECOPD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was a double-blinded placebo-controlled clinical trial conducted on a sample of hospitalized patients with AECOPD. All patients older than 40 years and known case of COPD were included in the study. Patients with a history of heart failure (ejection fraction &#x0003c;40%), renal failure, ongoing ischemia (based on electrocardiography), hearing problems, lung cancer, lung abscess, bronchiectasis, lung resection surgery, and hypersensitivity to aminoglycosides were excluded. The sampling method was based on convenience sampling. The sample size was calculated based on the result of a pilot study to obtain a 95% of confidence and a power of 80% to see a difference between two groups equal to 60% of standard deviation in the mean increasing of forced expiratory volume (FEV) parameter during the intervention. The sample size obtained as 43 patients in each group. The study was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Shahrekord University of Medical Sciences and was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number IRCT2015081723659N1. Informed consent was obtained from all participants.</p><p>Participants were randomly assigned to two groups of placebo (control) and gentamicin (case). Both patients and investigators were blinded to study groups. In all patients after hospitalization, on admission, SpO<sub>2</sub> (oxygen saturation), respiratory rate (RR) and white blood cell (WBC) were measured and spirometry was performed. Patients in case group received gentamicin (Osveh factory, Iran) 80 mg (2 cc) plus 1 cc sodium chloride 0.9% nebulization[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and patients in control group received 2 cc distilled water plus 1 cc sodium chloride 0.9% nebulization twice daily for 5 days were used. Both groups were under treatment with supplemental O<sub>2</sub>, tablet amoxicillin-clavulanic acid 625 mg every 8 h, capsule doxycycline 100 mg twice a day, salbutamol nebulization, ipratropium bromide nebulization, and tablet prednisolone 30 mg daily. On the 6<sup>th</sup> day, RR, SpO<sub>2</sub>, WBC, and spirometry were repeated in two groups. Spirometry in all patients was done by spirometer custo vit m R 2010.</p><p>To evaluate the effect of treatment on dyspnea in both groups, the Medical Research Council (MRC) scale [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>] was used.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] The best value of forced vital capacity (FVC) and FEV of first second (FEV1) and FEV1/FVC ratio were recorded.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Medical research council scale</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JRMS-21-56-g001"/></table-wrap><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Data analysis</title><p>For continuous variables, data are given as means &#x000b1; standard deviation (SD) and for categorical ones, as number with percent.
