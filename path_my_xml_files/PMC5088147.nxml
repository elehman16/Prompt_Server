[Subjects and Methods] This research evaluated 20 rotator cuff repair patients divided
randomly into groups of 10 as the control group and the experimental group. The
experimental group performed combined exercise with slings and a Flexi-Bar. Both the
experimental and control groups were treated with a transcutaneous electrical nerve

assess the differences in the degree of change between the two groups before and after the
experiment. [Results] Subjects of both the experimental group and control group showed
significant differences in muscle activity and pain. However, as compared with the control

minor, and subscapularis muscles; therefore, rupture of the rotator cuff implies rupture of
these four muscles<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. The rotator cuff suture is generally used for repair, and it
maximizes the contact area between the bone and tendon, thereby creating normal spaces
between anatomical structures<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. To provide
an efficient rehabilitation program for patients with an impaired rotator cuff and to enable
recovery from malfunction of the shoulder joint, management includes muscular strength and
endurance management, pain reduction in the shoulders, improvement of the range of motion
within which the shoulder joint can move as much as possible, and focusing on recovery of
the ability that controls balance among stabilizing muscles<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Among many other
therapeutic methods for stabilizing the shoulders, sling exercise is a method that can cause
an integrated effect on both sense and motion through performance of active movements on an
uneven surface and slings attached to a moving rope<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Moreover, it also has an effect on soft tissue release, increases
joint range of motion, stabilizes muscular tissue, and enhances muscular strength<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Rotator cuff repair patients need what they can do actively<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. The vibration stimuli typically used in training does not cause any
particular side effect, and anyone can get used to it easily<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. An active vibration stimulus causes simultaneous contraction in
stimulated muscle groups and can develop muscular ability and nerve control. In addition, it
can restrict abnormal tension of muscle, thereby allowing patients with a muscular imbalance
to adapt to it<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Vibration stimuli
produced using a Flexi-Bar enhance muscular strength, coordination, and balance<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, there is an insufficient amount
of research on the effect of the Flexi-Bar exercise on patients with shoulder problems and
on the combination of Flexi-Bar exercise with active vibration stimuli and stabilization
exercise that uses a sling. Therefore, this study aimed to find out if complex exercise
using slings and a Flexi-Bar has an effect on muscle activity and pain in patients after
rotator cuff repair. In addition, it aimed to provide reasons for any observed effects and
basic clinical data.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study included 20 participants who were diagnosed with rupture of the rotator cuff and
had undergone joint surgery in the past 6 weeks. The participants who understood the purpose
of this study were assigned randomly into groups of 10 as the experimental group and the
control group. Subjects who had undergone surgery for rupture of the rotator cuff or other
indications and who were diagnosed with other conditions such as mental disease or other
nerve disorders were excluded. All subjects provided written informed consent prior to
participation in the study according to the ethical standards of the Declaration of
Helsinki. The average age, weight, height, and body mass index (BMI) of the experimental

continuous passive motion (CPM) for 40 minutes a day, 6 days a week, for 3 weeks. The
experimental group was asked to perform the combined exercise using slings and Flexi-Bar.
The sling exercise was conducted with the effect of gravity removed using slings. The sling
exercise program consisted of the following movements: scapula setting conducted in a prone
position with a sling on the affected arm, shoulder protraction and retraction conducted in
a sitting position with a sling on both arms, shoulder flexion conducted in a side-lying
position with the sling on the affected arm, shoulder abduction conducted in a supine
position with a sling on the affected arm, and shoulder horizontal abduction and horizontal
adduction conducted in a sitting position with a sling on the affected arm. The Flexi-Bar
exercise was conducted in a sitting position while the effect of gravity was removed by
flexing both shoulders to 90 degrees and strapping them into slings. The Flexi-Bar exercise
program consisted of up-down oscillation exercise of the forearm conducted in pronation and
supination positions and left-right oscillation exercise conducted in a neutral position.
The experimental group conducted the exercise programs for 50 minutes a day, 3 day a week,
for 3 weeks. Surface electromyography (EMG; BTS FREEEMG 300, BTS S. p. A., Milan, Italy) was
used to measure muscle activity. We attached an electrode to the upper trapezius, lower
trapezius, infraspinatus, and serratus anterior. The collected electromyography data were
normalized to the percentage of reference voluntary contraction (%RVC) and further processed
and expressed as the root mean square (RMS). To record the reference voluntary contraction
(RVC) value of subjects, the subjects were asked to sit comfortably on a chair with their
arms at their sides and to ensure that they sat with an even posture to enable correct
measurement. For the voluntary contraction standard, the subjects were asked to sit on a
chair with their elbows straight and shoulder joints curved at 90&#x000b0; for measurement.</p><p>The visual analogue scale (VAS) was used for pain measurement. The VAS is a 10&#x02005;cm straight
line scale marked with numbers indicating the degree of pain felt. The left-hand side of the
scale signifies &#x0201c;no pain,&#x0201d; and the right-hand side signifies maximum pain. We measured the
outcome in centimeters.</p><p>The collected data were statistically processed using IBM SPSS Statistics 22.0 (IBM Corp.,
Armonk, NY, USA) for Windows. Subjects&#x02019; overall characters were evaluated by descriptive
statistics. The paired t-test was used to compare groups before and after the experiment.
The independent t-test was used to assess the difference in the degree of change between the
two groups before and after the experiment. The significance level was set to &#x003b1;=0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The changes in muscle activity and pain are shown in <xref rid="tbl_002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>Comparison of the results of muscle activity and pain between the experimental

and Flexi-Bar on muscle activity and pain in rotator cuff repair patients. The subjects in
both the experimental group and control group showed a significant difference in muscle
activity of the upper trapezius, lower trapezius, infraspinatus, and serratus anterior.
However, the upper trapezius of the experimental group showed significantly reduced muscle
activity compared with the control group, whereas the muscle activity of the lower
trapezius, infraspinatus, and serratus anterior increased significantly in the experimental
group compared with the control group. In a pilot study, patients with shoulder problems had
lower muscle activity in stabilizing muscles such as the serratus anterior or middle and
lower trapezius and an over-activated upper trapezius. This caused an imbalance in the
shoulder muscles and even caused pain<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.
According to a study by Hong et al.<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>,
the torque of motion in shoulder joints significantly increased after vibrations were
applied their subjects via a vibration platform. According to a study by Kirkesola<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>, when a sling was used for vibration
exercise, it was found that incorrect neuromuscular control could be corrected, thereby
reducing muscle imbalance. The present study was consistent with the abovementioned pilot
study, and it was found that combined exercise using both slings and a Flexi-Bar has a
positive effect on the activation of muscle activity.</p><p>The subjects of both the experimental group and control group showed a significant
difference in pain. In addition, shoulder pain in the experimental group was significantly
reduced compared with that in the control group. In a study by Bakhtiary et al.<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>, it was found that shoulder pain
significantly decreased as a result of vibration exercise using a vibrator. In a study by
Jung<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>, it was found that pain was
significantly reduced after patients with shoulder problems performed shoulder-stabilizing
exercise. Burkhart et al.<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup> found that
middle-aged women felt less pain as a result of performing sling exercise. The results of
prior research and this study are consistent. Combined exercise with slings and a Flexi-Bar
improved muscle activity and pain in rotator cuff repair patients.</p><p>This research has a limitation with respect to generalization of the findings to all
rotator cuff repair patients, as it was conducted on a small group. Furthermore, the
experimental period was short due to the period of hospitalization of the patients. In
addition, follow-up was not performed; therefore, the duration of the effect is unknown.</p><p>In conclusion, combined exercise using slings and a Flexi-Bar is effective for improving
muscular imbalance and decreasing pain in rehabilitation after rotator cuff repair.
Therefore, combined exercise using slings and Flexi-Bars will offer clinical guidelines for
early return of patients to daily life after rotator cuff repair and will be useful for many
patients.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Matava</surname><given-names>MJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Purcell</surname><given-names>DB</given-names></name><name><surname>Rudzki</surname><given-names>JR</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Partial-thickness rotator cuff tears</article-title>.
