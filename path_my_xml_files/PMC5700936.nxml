The main objective was to investigate the neural correlates of abovementioned effects using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Behavioural results showed that the more materialistic people are, the more they choose and like items labelled with luxury brands. Neuroimaging results revealed the implication of a neural network including the dorsolateral and ventromedial prefrontal cortex and the orbitofrontal cortex that was modulated by the brand label and also by the participants&#x02019; preference. Most importantly, items with randomly assigned luxurious brand labels were preferentially chosen by participants and triggered enhanced signal in the caudate nucleus. This effect increased linearly with materialistic tendencies. Our results highlight the impact of brand-item association, although random in our study, and materialism on preference, relying on subparts of the brain valuation system for the integration of extrinsic cues, preferences and individual characteristics.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Research on consumer preferences has revealed the importance of extrinsic cues when evaluating the quality of an item<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Extrinsic cues refer to any piece of information about the item that is not directly part of the item itself<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, such as its price or the label displayed on it. When evaluating strictly identical items displayed with different prices, consumers prefer high-priced items<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Similarly, items with a green label are preferred over items that are intrinsically identical, but presented with a regular label: consumers choose them more often, accept to pay more for them, and &#x02013; in the case of food items - report them to taste better<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Other studies showed that consumers&#x02019; expectancies associated with a brand impacted experienced pleasantness when consuming the item<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Specifically, when participants drank Coke and Pepsi without knowing which one they were drinking, their experienced pleasantness was equal for both drinks. However, when drinks were labelled with their brand, participants reported increased preference for Coke over Pepsi<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Thus, labels and brand information, by assigning a value to an item, can have a large impact on consumers&#x02019; preferences.</p><p id="Par3">Preference is a subjective value that refers to the worthiness and pleasantness associated with the stimulus that is evaluated and, with respect to behaviour, typically leads to the choice of one option over another<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. The neural network underlying the computation of subjective values has been described in numerous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies. Key regions of this &#x0201c;brain valuation system&#x0201d; are the ventral striatum (VS), ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC), orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), insula, amygdala, and the posterior cingulate cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Crucially, in their meta-analysis, Bartra <italic>et al</italic>. revealed that subjective values were reliably correlated with neural activity in the VS and VMPFC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. The aforementioned regions are part of a network that computes appetitive and aversive values<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> as well as primary and secondary rewards<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> such as food or money<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, cars<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, faces<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, and social cues (e.g. one&#x02019;s reputation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>). Previous experiments have revealed that activity in the brain valuation system can be modified by information that is extrinsic to the stimulus. For instance, tasting wine presented with a higher price tag increased medial OFC and VMPFC activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>; displaying the brand of an item modified dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and hippocampus activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>; displaying an organic label increased activity in the striatum and in the DLPFC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. However, Kirk <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> demonstrated that when participants were viewing works of art, the neural impact of extrinsic information was dependent on the participant&#x02019;s expertise in art. Specifically, extrinsic information increased activity in the DLPFC in experts and VMPFC in non-experts. Therefore, activity in the brain valuation system has been shown to be dependent on both extrinsic information about the stimuli and individual characteristics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. When it comes to choices and purchase decisions, previous studies suggest that individual characteristics of the consumer may lead to increased interest and attention toward brands<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. More specifically, materialism is positively related to brand connection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, brand dependence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> and leads to higher consideration of luxury brands<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">In the present study, we specifically aimed at investigating a &#x0201c;luxury brand effect&#x0201d;, namely the extent to which certain types of brand labels (luxurious/non-luxurious) displayed with items may have an impact on the brain valuation system and on choices. We further wanted to test whether this process may be modulated by materialism. Participants were presented with items displayed either with a luxurious or with a non-luxurious brand label and were asked to assess how much they liked them while lying in a magnetic resonance imaging scanner. In an independent offline task, participants were asked to choose between items displayed either with a luxurious or with a non-luxurious brand label. Critically, items were <italic>randomly</italic> associated with either a luxurious or a non-luxurious brand across participants in order to avoid any association between a specific object and a brand. In line with the abovementioned body of work revealing the impact of extrinsic cues on preference, we hypothesized that brands would have an impact on preferences. More specifically, we hypothesized that items displayed with a luxurious brand, as opposed to a non-luxurious brand label, would be evaluated more positively and chosen more often. We additionally hypothesized that, the more materialistic participants are, the more often they would like and choose items displayed with luxurious brands. Regarding neuroimaging results, we aimed at testing whether brand labels (luxurious vs non-luxurious) have a differential impact on brain activity depending on the liking ratings (preference; Most vs Least liked). More specifically, we predicted that the evaluation (Most vs Least liked) of luxury brands as compared to non-luxury brands would trigger enhanced activity in the brain valuation system, namely in the VS and VMPFC. Finally, we predicted that materialism would enhance activity in the striatum (ventral and/or dorsal) and VMPFC when choosing items displayed with a luxurious as opposed to a non-luxurious brand label.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Behavioural results: Liking task</title><p id="Par5">Analyses revealed a significant main effect of the brand label (b&#x02009;=&#x02009;25.794, CI95%&#x02009;=&#x02009;[10.547; 41.054], t(37.890)&#x02009;=&#x02009;3.309, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.002), suggesting that items displayed with luxury brand labels were preferred to those displayed with non-luxury brands, although the items were exactly the same across conditions with brand labels randomly assigned.

</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par10">In the present study, we aimed at investigating the extent to which extrinsic cues (i.e., brand labels), preference (i.e., item liking) and individual characteristics (i.e., materialism) may interact to further impact on activity patterns of the so-called &#x0201c;brain valuation system&#x0201d;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Crucially, our manipulation consisted in the mere randomized association of items with either luxurious or non-luxurious brand labels across participants. Behavioural results showed an impact of the brand label manipulation, which was modulated by participants&#x02019; materialism, on preference and choice. Neuroimaging data revealed a neural modulation of the brain valuation system by the participants&#x02019; preference (i.e., item liking) together with the brand manipulation, most notably in the DLPFC, cuneus and bilateral caudate head. Further analyses revealed that the more participants were materialistic, the more enhanced the activity in the caudate nucleus for luxury-labelled items that were later chosen.</p><p id="Par11">Behavioural results revealed that, on average, participants preferred, and chose more often, items displayed with luxurious brand labels, although the items were physically identical across conditions (luxurious and non-luxurious brand labels were randomly assigned to the presented items across participants). Hence, this first result provides evidence for our hypothesized &#x0201c;luxury brand effect&#x0201d; and highlights the importance of the label associated with an item or event: the mere and random association with a luxury brand label was sufficient to influence the participants&#x02019; preference. Moreover, our results revealed that materialistic tendencies could modulate the importance of brand labels during preference evaluation and choices, as the impact of brand labels increased with materialism. These results provide a replication of previous evidence for such an effect<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, while extending them to a forced-choice task. Taken together, these results add further weight for the importance of extrinsic cues when making decisions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Importantly, our behavioural results revealed that sensitivity toward extrinsic cues also depends on individual characteristics, as previously pointed out in the literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par12">Neuroimaging results highlighted the importance of both preference and brand labels (which varied randomly across participants and stimuli in the present study). This experimental manipulation impacted on cerebral regions involved in visual attention (i.e., the cuneus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>) for most liked items displayed with a luxurious label, suggesting a potential facilitated attentional toward such items. Interestingly, a similar pattern of activation was observed in the anterior part of the cingulate cortex (ACC), which was previously shown to underlie relevant stimulus attribution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Our manipulation also yielded enhanced activity in regions linked to subjective value assessment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> and reward processing (i.e., the caudate head<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>; the cuneus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>; the orbitofrontal cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>; the VMPFC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> and the amygdala<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>). Interestingly, our results further highlight the implication of the DLPFC for most liked stimuli displayed with a luxurious brand. This result echoes the findings of McClure <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> who pointed out that brand knowledge had an impact on activation in the DLPFC. More generally, this region may also be recruited in cognitive control of affective states<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par13">The interaction between liking and luxury observed in the VMPFC is in accordance with previous evidence highlighting an interaction between sensory processes and top-down information in this region<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Our results are thus in line with previous accounts showing the importance of the VMPFC as a hub, integrating affective and conceptual information<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. In our case, affective information may refer to the evaluation of the presented item associated with a brand, while conceptual information may refer to the processing of the luxury dimension of the brand (and to the sense of quality and social status it implies). Our results also pointed out the implication of the hippocampus. This region, crucially related to memory, is involved in contextual information integration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, valuation of imagined outcomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup> and more generally in value-based decision-making<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>, this latter result being in-line with our study design and findings. Finally, activation in the PCC was highlighted as well. The role of this structure has received less attention for encoding value, but studies suggest that the PCC is functionally coupled with the VMPFC, even though these regions may have independent functions in valuation computation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. This interpretation should however be tested and future studies should investigate the specific importance of PCC in value-based decision-making.</p><p id="Par14">More generally, our results for model 1 and 2 (interaction between liking and luxury) emphasize the role of the DLPFC and the hippocampus in valuation, which is potentially related to the necessity of integrating brand knowledge for preference computation. Crucially, our results point out that information about the brand is also integrated in the caudate nucleus. While this region is known to be strongly linked to preference ratings (i.e., liking<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>), we show that it also integrates information such as brand knowledge. This suggests that, despite evolutionary ancient, the caudate nucleus integrates modern cultural cues (brands), echoing results from previous research suggesting that activity in the mesolimbic reward system is modulated by culture<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par15">Moreover, our last model revealed that the more materialistic participants were, the more active the bilateral caudate nucleus was (caudate body) for luxurious compared to non-luxurious items that would later be chosen (as opposed to not-chosen). This result suggests that more materialistic participants recruit reward-related areas when acting congruently with their materialistic values (i.e., when they choose items associated with luxury brand labels, as materialistic people tend to value luxury<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>). To summarize, our data provide evidence for the importance of individual characteristics in modulating the activation and involvement of the &#x0201c;brain valuation system&#x0201d;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>, in addition to the impact of the context (i.e., item labelled as luxurious vs. non luxurious in our study) and the individual&#x02019;s behavioural preference (i.e., choosing an item or discarding it).</p><p id="Par16">While the abovementioned data address our hypotheses, our results still reveal some discrepancies between neuroimaging and behavioral results. In fact, although we showed that the impact of liking was modulated by the brand label in the fMRI results, we observed no interaction between brand and liking in the behavioral results regarding choice. Interestingly, Sharot <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup> also faced a difference between BOLD signal and overt measures of preferences. In their experiment, they observed differences in the BOLD signal associated with a choice, but no such result was observed behaviorally. As they suggest, &#x0201c;the very fact that a preference was not expressed behaviorally [&#x02026;] does not mean that it was not experienced&#x0201d; (Sharot <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>, p. 3764). Future studies may specifically test how neural activation observed in the situation of automatic evaluation may predict future choice or decisions, for instance on a trial-by-trial basis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Other limitations of our study have to be considered as well. First, we studied the impact of brands, thus focusing our interest and experimental manipulation on one single extrinsic cue. While this was necessary to address our &#x0201c;luxury brand effect&#x0201d; hypothesis, preference and choices are usually made based on more than one extrinsic aspect. People usually take into account other extrinsic cues (e.g., price, expert ratings, information about the country of origin). Thus, future studies should integrate and assess the importance of several extrinsic cues on preference and on the activation of the brain valuation system. Second, product pictures and brand labels were presented together and at the same time to the participants, thus making it difficult to dissociate the processing of intrinsic cues (i.e., product-specific preference) from the processing of extrinsic cues (i.e., the brand). An interesting future study could first present the product, later followed by the brand. This may help to assess measurable differences in preference based first on intrinsic and then on extrinsic cues. Finally, our sample was exclusively constituted of female students. While it was motivated by the products we chose (i.e., exclusively designed for women), future studies should evaluate how such results may apply to male and/or other participants who would be more familiar with luxury consumption.</p><p id="Par17">The purpose of the present study was to assess how individual preferences (i.e., item liking and choice), extrinsic cues (i.e., brand labels) and personal values (i.e., materialism) could modulate activity in the &#x0201c;brain valuation system&#x0201d;. Our results highlight the extent to which extrinsic cues such as brand labels can, even when randomly assigned to certain items, modulate preferences at the behavioural and brain levels. In particular, brand processing and individual preferences were found to interact in regions typically involved in subjective value processing such as the DLPFC, the caudate head, the OFC, and the VMPFC. Crucially, our results suggest an important role played by the bilateral caudate nucleus for integrating the luxury dimension associated with the brand, the individual preferences, and the personal materialistic values.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Participants and procedure</title><p id="Par18">Participants were recruited among students of the University of Geneva.

Each item was presented with 1 out of 8 brand labels: 4 luxurious and 4 non-luxurious<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. All the brands principally manufactured clothing. Their luxurious vs. non-luxurious categorization was based on rankings such as the GenY Prestige Brand Ranking<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>, which ranks the top luxurious clothing brands for women. Thus, brands appearing in this ranking were categorized as luxurious whereas brands which did not appear in this ranking were categorized as non-luxurious. The luxurious and non-luxurious brands were pseudo-randomized between participants so that each item was seen once with each of the brands. The task consisted in 80 trials (stimuli selected following the pre-test study), 40 of which were presented in the luxurious condition while 40 others were presented in the non-luxurious condition. Each trial started by a fixation cross. Afterwards, an item and a brand were displayed on the screen during 4&#x02009;seconds. After these 4&#x02009;seconds, a scale was displayed below the item and participants were asked to rate the item by moving the slider either toward the &#x0201c;I don&#x02019;t like it&#x0201d; end, or toward the &#x0201c;I really like it&#x0201d; end. Once participants had made their evaluation, they clicked on a button to start the next trial. A fixation cross appeared and the time of presentation of this cross was adjusted with the time participants spent giving their answer so that each trial lasted 10&#x02009;seconds. Responses were made using a four button MR-compatible response box (Current Designs Inc., Philadelphia, PA, USA), where the first button allowed participants to move the slider toward the left, the last button allowed them to move the slider toward the right and the two buttons in the middle allowed them to confirm that they had rated the item and that they were ready to rate the following item.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Description of the experimental task.

They could answer during maximum 5&#x02009;seconds.

Specific brain targets for this MID functional localizer were the ventral striatum and the caudate (nucleus/body/head). Sixteen repetitions of each of the 4 types of trials were presented in a fully randomized order. Participants first read the instructions and completed a practice session of 8 trials before beginning the experimental session. During each trial, participants first viewed a fixation cross which was followed by a 2-s incentive valence (i.e., gain or loss) with different magnitude (+&#x02215;&#x02212;0.1 CHF, +&#x02215;&#x02212;2 CHF). This part of the trial was followed by a fixation cross (2 to 2.5&#x02009;s; &#x0201c;anticipation phase&#x0201d;). After this part, a star was rapidly displayed on the screen (the duration of presentation of this star was initially set to the averaged time response observed in the practice session). If the participants pressed the button before the target offset, they either earned or avoided losing the amount of money previously displayed on the screen. After the initial trial, the duration of the presentation of the star was adapted in the following way: when participants managed to answer on time for three consecutive trials, the presentation of the star for the following trial was reduced by 30 ms. If participants were not fast enough, the duration of the star presentation was increased by 30 ms. Feedback indicating the trial outcome was then presented (2&#x02009;s; &#x0201c;outcome&#x0201d; phase). Trials were separated from one another by an inter-trial interval ranging from 2 to 6&#x02009;s. Hit rate was targeted to 66% for each participant by a function that adaptively changed target durations, depending on the performance of the participant within each condition.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Experimental procedure: Forced-choice task (outside the MRI scanner)</title><p id="Par24">Once outside the scanner, participants went through a binary choice paradigm (forced-choice task) on a computer in a cubicle. In this task, two items with their brands were presented side by side and participants were asked to select the item they would like to get. No information was given about the price of the items. Participants could take as much time as they wanted to make their choices. Each trial consisted in the presentation of one item with a luxurious brand and another item with a non-luxurious brand, with each item displayed with the same brand as during the liking task. The pairing of the items was pseudo-randomized across participants. The side of appearance on the screen of the luxurious vs non-luxurious condition was randomized across participants. Finally, participants completed a brand knowledge evaluation task where each brand logo was presented on the screen and participants were asked to assess whether they knew the brand (&#x0201c;1&#x0201d;) or not (&#x0201c;0&#x0201d;). The total mean proportion of knowledge between participants was computed and included in a regression analysis with materialism as covariate, revealing a weak tendency (b&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.023, t(35)&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.741, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.090).

Brand label (luxurious vs. non-luxurious) was introduced as a fixed effect factor, Materialistic tendencies as covariate. Participants and stimuli were introduced as random effects. Moreover, as advised by Barr<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup> and Winter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>, we introduced a random slope for the brand for each participant, as this allows the effect of brand to differ between participants. Participants and stimuli were introduced as random effects. A second model was computed on the choice variable (offline choice task), where the dichotomic dependent variable referred to the choice of the item displayed on the left for each trial (i.e. chosen &#x0201c;1&#x0201d;, non-chosen &#x0201c;0&#x0201d; as in Krajbich &#x00026; Rangel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>). Participants chose slightly more often products displayed on the right, thus making the proportion of luxurious and non-luxurious chosen items slightly different from one (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). In our model, brand (luxurious vs. non-luxurious) and liking (most vs. least liked) were introduced as factors and materialism as a covariate. Intercepts for the participants as well as for the left pictures of each choice were introduced as random intercepts. We did not include random slopes in this model due to convergence issues. In all models, we assigned the coding &#x02212;1/+ 1 for fixed effects as advised by Judd <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>, which allowed us to interpret the effects as main effects.

Preprocessing steps included realignment to the first volume of the time series, slice timing, normalization to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup> space using the DARTEL toolbox<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup> and spatial smoothing with an isotropic Gaussian filter of 8&#x02009;mm full width at half maximum. To remove low frequency components, we used a high-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 128&#x02009;s.

For this fMRI liking task, we used a first-level general linear model, in which each stimulus display was modeled by using a stick function and was convolved with the hemodynamic response function. Events were time-locked to the onset of the display of stimuli (duration 4&#x02009;seconds) because it most likely reflects the automatic evaluation process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> and the evaluation phase was included in the model as well. Separate regressors were created for each experimental condition (i.e., luxurious vs. non-luxurious brand label) and were merged with regressors assessing the Liking of each participant for each trial (i.e., most liked vs. least liked). We performed a median split for each participant&#x02019;s evaluations for both luxurious/non-luxurious items, and further tagged the evaluations above this median as &#x0201c;most liked&#x0201d; while evaluations lower than the median were tagged as &#x0201c;least liked&#x0201d;. We thus had four regressors of interest (luxurious most liked, luxurious least liked, non-luxurious most liked, non-luxurious least liked) including 20 trials each and 80 trials in total in addition to an identical number of conditions with the onset locked to the Liking phase, as non-interest regressors. Moreover, six motion parameters were included as regressors of no interest to account for movement in the data. The neuroimaging data were analyzed using three different models in order to accurately characterize neural networks of subjective value and to address our hypotheses as accurately and reliably as possible.</p><p id="Par28">In a first model, the four regressors of interest were used to compute linear simple contrasts for each participant and were then taken to a second-level, flexible factorial analysis.

We computed the interaction between luxury and Liking factors because we were specifically interested in the contrasts [most liked&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;least liked&#x02009;*&#x02009;luxurious&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;non-luxurious; least liked&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;most liked&#x02009;*&#x02009;luxurious&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;non-luxurious]. The impact of materialism was not tested in this model, as it was strictly designed to answer to our first hypothesis (i.e. how brands randomly displayed with items may have an impact on the brain valuation system).</p><p id="Par29">In a second model, a functional localizer designed to localize reward-related brain areas (MID task<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>) was used to define group-level regions of interest (ROIs) used for each participant, based on significantly higher activations for High than Low reward, thresholded to <italic>p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;</italic>0.05, with voxel-wise family wise error (FWE) correction, and an arbitrary cluster extent of k&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;10 voxels. ROIs were defined in the left and right caudate nucleus, the global maxima of High reward&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;Low reward. These ROIs were defined independently of the liking task, and were hence specific to our sample. Because the ROIs were extracted for data of model 1, the number of trials (N<sub>t</sub>) was balanced for the four regressors (Most liked luxurious: N<sub>t</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;20; Least liked luxurious: N<sub>t</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;20; Most liked non-luxurious: N<sub>t</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;20; Least liked non-luxurious: N<sub>t</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;20). A posteriori percentage of signal change analysis (for each peak separately and each condition) was performed by using repeated-measure ANOVAs, and post hoc correction for multiple comparisons was applied by using a Tukey HSD correction following normality estimation.</p><p id="Par30">In a third model, we took into account information related to the choices performed outside the scanner. This model was based on the following regressors of interest: &#x0201c;Choice&#x0201d; (chosen; not-chosen), &#x0201c;Brand label&#x0201d; (luxurious; non-luxurious). The first-level design matrix included hence 4 columns (luxurious chosen, mean number of trials&#x02009;=&#x02009;21, range 16&#x02013;26; luxurious not-chosen, mean number of trials&#x02009;=&#x02009;19, range 14&#x02013;24; non-luxurious chosen, mean number of trials&#x02009;=&#x02009;21, range 14&#x02013;24; non-luxurious not-chosen, mean number of trials&#x02009;=&#x02009;19, range 16&#x02013;26). The 2-way interaction between these regressors was computed at the first-level of analysis for all participants. Then, &#x0201c;Materialism&#x0201d; was used as a second-level covariate in the model (second-level analysis) to test our second hypothesis. &#x0201c;Materialism&#x0201d; was set to interact with Factor 1 in this second-level analysis, namely the factor including the 2-way interaction between &#x0201c;Choice&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Brand label&#x0201d; that was computed at the first-level.
