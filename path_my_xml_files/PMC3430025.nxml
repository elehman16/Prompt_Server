We compared the efficacy of meperidine and two low doses of ketamine with placebo to prevent postanesthetic shivering after general anesthesia.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>METHODS:</title><p>This was a prospective, randomized double-blind placebo controlled clinical trial involving 120 ASA I-II patients aging 20-50 years, undergoing endoscopic sinus surgery with general anesthesia. Patients were randomly allocated to receive meperidine 0.4 mg/kg (Group M, n = 30), ketamine 0.3 mg/kg (Group K<sub>1</sub>, n = 30), ketamine 0.5 mg/kg (Group K<sub>2</sub>, n = 30), or normal saline (Group N, n = 30) 20 minutes before completion of the surgery. Tympanic temperature, blood pressure, and heart rate were measured before and immediately after induction of anesthesia, 30 minutes after induction, and before administration of the study drugs. The drugs were prepared and diluted to a volume of 2 ml and presented as coded syringes. An investigator, blinded to the groups, graded postanesthetic shivering using a four-point scale. Statistical analyses were performed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) Windows version 16. A p-value &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>RESULTS:</title><p>Patient characteristics of the four groups were similar. The number of patients with observed shivering in groups was 0, 3, 1, and 9 in Groups M, K<sub>1</sub>, K<sub>2</sub> and N, respectively. The difference between groups M, K<sub>1</sub>, and K<sub>2</sub> with Group N was statistically significant. However, differences between groups M and K<sub>1</sub>, M and K<sub>2</sub>, and K<sub>1</sub> and K<sub>2</sub> were not significant. The number of patients with a shivering score of 2 or 3 was higher in Group N compared with other groups.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>Prophylactic use of low doses of intravenous ketamine (0.3 or 0.5 mg/kg) was found to be effective to prevent postanesthetic shivering. However, administration of 0.3 mg/kg ketamine lowered the rate of hallucination as compared with 0.5 mg/kg.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>KEYWORDS</title><kwd>Postanesthetic Shivering</kwd><kwd>Meperidine</kwd><kwd>Ketamine</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Postanesthetic shivering is a very unpleasant experience occurring in 5-65% of patients recovering from general anesthesia and 57% of volunteers undergoing regional anesthesia.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref> It causes physiological stress resulting in increased oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production, cardiac output, intraocular and intracranial pressure and other complications of sympathetic stimulation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref> Thus, prevention and treatment of postanesthetic shivering is an important aspect of patient care.

All patients were American Society of Anesthesiologist class I or II and underwent endoscopic sinus surgery under general anesthesia. Before the study was performed, it was approved by the Ethics Committee and written informed consents were obtained from all patients. Patients with hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, hypertension, cardiopulmonary disease, psychological disorders, body mass index &#x0003e; 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, a history of convulsions or addictions, multiple allergies, duration of anesthesia &#x0003c; 1 hour or &#x0003e;3 hours, initial tympanic temperature &#x0003e; 38 &#x000b0; C or &#x0003c; 36.5 &#x000b0; C, and those who received blood products or metoclopromide were excluded from the study.</p><p>Patients were randomly (using table of random numbers) allocated to receive normal saline (Group N, n = 30), meperidine 0.4 mg/kg (Group M, n = 30), ketamine 0.3 mg/kg (Group K<sub>1</sub>, n = 30) or ketamine 0.5 mg/kg (Group K<sub>2</sub>, n = 30) intravenously 20 minute before the end of surgery. The study drugs were diluted to a volume of 2 ml and presented as coded syringes by an anesthetist who was not involved in the management of patients or in the grading of patients&#x02019; shivering. There was a 1:1 ratio for randomization. The patients and the rater were blind to the groups.</p><p>Heart rate, non-invasive systolic blood pressure and oxygen saturation were monitored during the surgery and automatically recorded every 10 minutes. The temperature of intravenous (IV) fluids administered was equal. Tympanic membrane temperature was measured using a digital ear thermometer (an aural canal thermometer, OMRON 510, Germany) and recorded before anesthesia, immediately after induction of anesthesia, 30 minutes after induction, and before administration of the study drugs. In the operating room, patients were covered with a cotton blanket.</p><p>The ambient temperature, in the operating and recovery rooms, was measured by a wall thermometer and maintained at 23 &#x000b1; 0.5&#x000b0;C.</p><p>In all patients, the anesthesia was induced with fentanyl 1.5 &#x003bc;g/kg IV, propofol 2 mg/kg, and pancuronium 0.1 mg/kg. Anesthesia was maintained with nitrous oxide 70% in oxygen and isoflurane 1-1.5%. Repeated doses of pancuronium 0.03 mg/kg were given when train-of-four (TOF) visible twitches were &#x02265; 2.</p><p>Approximately 20 minutes before completion of the surgery, patients were randomly assigned to receive the study drug using a simple randomization method. Residual neuromuscular blockade was reversed using neostigmine 0.03 mg/kg and atropine 0.01 mg/kg. Then, the trachea was extubated. The duration of the surgery, anesthesia and Post-Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) stay were recorded.</p><p>In the recovery room, the patients were monitored and covered with a cotton blanket. No patient was warmed actively and all patients received oxygen 4 lit/min via a face mask.</p><p>The shivering was graded using a four-point scale (0 = no shivering, 1 = mild fasciculation of face or neck, 2 = visible tremor involving more than one muscle group, 3 = gross muscular activity involving the entire body).</p><p>An anesthetist unaware of the study observed the patient for shivering, nausea, vomiting, hallucination, pain, and time of first analgesia request after admission to the recovery room. The possible side-effects of the study drugs including nausea, vomiting, hypotension or hypertension (&#x0003c; or &#x0003e; 30% baseline), tachycardia, respiratory problems, oxygen desaturation, and hallucination were recorded.</p><p>Patients with shivering were treated with meperidine 20 mg IV if the shivering grade was &#x02265; 2. Postoperative pain in the endoscopic sinus surgery was assessed by visual analogue scale (VAS) 60 minutes postoperatively and treated with morphine 0.05 mg/kg IV if VAS &#x02265; 3 in the recovery room. If tympanic temperature was &#x0003c; 36 &#x000b0; C active warming was used. Postoperative analgesia required and time to first analgesia required were recorded. Moreover, sedation level was assessed using The Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) 30 minutes after PACU entrance. PACU stay time (min) was also assessed.</p><p>The sample size was calculated for one way analysis of variance with four levels and a power of 80% which indicated a minimum of 28 cases in each groups.</p><p>Statistical analyses were performed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) Windows version 15. Chi-square, Kruskal-Wallis, and Mann-Whitney tests were used where they were appropriate. A p-value &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The difference between the shivering grades in different groups was assessed using Kruskal-Wallis test. The difference between the numbers of patients with observed shivering in every two groups was evaluated using Dunn's test (GraphPad Prism software). The difference between the number of patients with nausea, hallucination and postanesthetic shivering in the recovery room was analyzed using chi-square test.
