Postoperative analgesia is an important step in improving the quality of patients&#x02019; life during perioperative period. Proper handling of postoperative pain can reduce the incidence of complications. Oxycodone is currently the only double receptor agonists of pure opioid &#x003bc; and &#x003ba;, featuring rapid onset, strong analgesic effect, and small effect on hemodynamics. It is suitable for patient-controlled intravenous analgesia, especially effective on visceral pain and neuropathic pain,<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup> but over dosage can lead to drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, and other adverse reactions. Flurbiprofen axetil is a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug with lipid microspheres as a carrier, with targeted analgesic effect.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> Oxycodone hydrochloride combined with flurbiprofen axetil is safe and effective for postoperative multimodal analgesia.<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup> This study was to observe the efficacy and safety of different doses of oxycodone hydrochloride combined with flurbiprofen axetil in postoperative abdominal surgeries, providing references for further clinical application.</p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Subjects and methods</title><sec><label>2.1</label><title>Subjects</title><p>This study was approved by the Human Research Ethics Board of Zhejiang Cancer Hospital, Hangzhou, with the patients or family members&#x02019; signing of the written consent form prior to participation.</p><p>The inclusion criteria were American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I and II patients, aged between 18 and 64 years old, weighing from 50 to 75 kg, scheduled for lower abdomen general anesthesia surgeries. Exclusion criteria included patients who had hepatitis and renal failure, existence of severe blood system dysfunction, chronic respiratory disease or psychiatric history, and long-term use of opioids or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory analgesics. Patients who were allergic to oxycodone hydrochloride, or flurbiprofen axetil or other drugs were also excluded from this study. This study included surgeries of colorectal cancer, cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, and prostate cancer.</p><p>Using random number table method, subjects were divided into 3 groups, 30 cases in each group. Group I: oxycodone hydrochloride 0.5&#x0200a;mg/kg + flurbiprofen axetil 150&#x0200a;mg; group II: oxycodone hydrochloride 0.75&#x0200a;mg/kg + flurbiprofen axetil 150&#x0200a;mg; and group III: oxycodone hydrochloride 1.0&#x0200a;mg/kg + flurbiprofen axetil 150&#x0200a;mg. Dilute them with 0.9% saline to 150&#x0200a;mL, respectively, with the background dose of 2&#x0200a;mL/h, patient-controlled analgesia 2&#x0200a;mL per time, with an interval of 10&#x0200a;min, and the loading dose of 0.1&#x0200a;mL/kg.</p></sec><sec><label>2.2</label><title>Methods</title><p>On the first day of this study, demographic and medical data, including the patients&#x02019; age, body mass index (BMI), and history of diseases were collected. The subjects were not given any sedative, analgesic, or antiemetic drugs 24&#x0200a;h before the operation. Solids and liquids were fasted in patients 8&#x0200a;h before the operation.</p><p>On the second day, all selected patients were under monitoring of arterial blood pressure (by way of invasive automated sphygmomanometer), heart rate (by way of electrocardiography), and arterial oxygen saturation (by way of pulse oximetry) before anesthesia induction and after the operation, as well as the recovery period, recording operation types and time. Infusion of compound sodium lactate 300 to 500&#x0200a;mL was applied, through internal jugular vein. Intravenous injection of midazolam 0.05&#x0200a;mg/kg, sufentanil 4&#x0200a;&#x003bc;g/kg, propofol 1.0 to 2.0&#x0200a;mg/kg, and rocuronium 0.6&#x0200a;mg/kg administered through the induction of anesthesia in the operation room. Tracheal intubation or laryngeal mask placement was administered 3 min later, and then mechanical ventilation was administered, tidal volume 8&#x0200a;mL/kg, respiration rate 12&#x0200a;beats/min. During the operation, remifentanil 0.15 to 0.30&#x0200a;&#x003bc;g/kg per min and propofol 4 to 8&#x0200a;mg/kg per h were delivered to maintain the depth of anesthesia, with discontinuous injection of cisatracurium to keep muscle-relaxing. The doses of drugs were adjusted according to different intraoperative blood pressure (basical value &#x000b1;20%): rapid rehydration or intravenous injection of ephedrine 6 to 10&#x0200a;mg/time was administered if mean arterial pressure (MAP) was lower than 60 mm Hg; atropine 0.3 to 0.5&#x0200a;mg was administered if heart rate was fewer than 50&#x0200a;times/min; 30 min before the end of surgery, cisatracurium was discontinued and azasetron 10&#x0200a;mg was injected intravenously. Upon closing up the peritoneal cavity, patient-controlled intravenous analgesic pump was started and the loading dose of 0.1&#x0200a;mL/kg was given. The propofol and remifentanil was stopped after the surgery. The TOF value (train of 4 stimulation) was observed with a nerve monitor during the whole operation. When the patient regained consciousness and spontaneous breathing, and TOF value reached 90%, muscle-relaxing antagonist was injected, then the tracheal tube was pulled out. The patient was transferred into the anesthesia recovery room after observation for 3 to 5 min in the operation room.</p><p>Comparisons of the following aspects among the 3 groups were recorded, at the time of 24&#x0200a;h before surgery, 1, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48 and 72&#x0200a;h after surgery: the mean arterial blood pressure, heart rate, arterial oxygen saturation, static numerical rating scale (NRS) scores (the degree of pain when lying still) and dynamic NRS scores (the degree of pain when coughing, turning over and moving the body) (0: pain free; 1&#x02013;3: mild pain, does not affect sleep; 4&#x02013;6: moderate pain; 7&#x02013;9: severe pain, cannot sleep or wake up from pain; and 10: sharp pain), Ramsay sedation scores (1: anxious, restless, irritable; 2: cooperative, oriented, tranquil; 3: only responsive to instructions; 4: asleep, with a brisk response to stimulus; 5: asleep, with a sluggish response to stimulus; and 6: asleep, with no response), the pressing ratio (the ratio of effective pressing times, which can reduce the pain, to the total pressing times, which is the sum of effective pressing times and noneffective pressing times), patient satisfaction, and occurrence of adverse reactions.</p><p>Adverse reactions include somnolence (defined as not easily wake up), respiratory depression (defined as respiratory rate &#x0003c;8 breaths/min), nausea, and vomiting. A score from 0 to 10 was given for the level of nausea and vomiting. If the patient had no nausea or vomiting, a score of 0 was given; and if the patient had severe nausea and vomiting, a score of 10 was given.</p></sec><sec><label>2.3</label><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis SPSS 17.0 was adopted.

The reason lies in the body's complex psychological and physiological responses to the tissue damage and repair process. Preventions and treatments should be timely carried out in clinical work. Therefore, reasonable and effective postoperative analgesia can reduce breathing, circulation, and endocrine dysfunction caused by pain, and can significantly reduce the patient's mental trauma.</p><p>At present, the acute pain after abdominal surgeries is mainly manifested as mixed body aches and visceral pain. Opioids are currently commonly used drugs for acute pain after surgeries, among which oxycodone especially has a better effect of inhibiting visceral pain.<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> Compared with morphine, although oxycodone has lower intrinsic activity with respect to the &#x003bc;-type receptor, it has a stronger analgesic effect.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> This is due to the fact that the concentration of unbound oxycodone in the brain is 6 times higher compared with morphine, though concentrations in the blood of both opioid analgesics is comparable. Hence, the oxycodone has a higher safety and efficacy than other opioid analgesics, and minimal immunosuppressive activity.<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> But Amri and others&#x02019; studies<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup> found that oxycodone had caused dose-dependent respiratory depression. In order to achieve good analgesia effect while reducing adverse reactions, this study designed 3 different doses of oxycodone and observed the efficacy.</p><p>In this study, hemodynamics of the patients was relatively stable at each time point, indicating that oxycodone combined with flurbiprofen axetil had resulted in a good analgesic effect, which was related to the fact that oxycodone did not lead to histamine release, without inhibiting parasympathetic or leading to bradycardia.<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup></p><p>In this study, the NRS score was used to evaluate the analgesic effect of oxycodone. The study showed that 3 different doses of oxycodone had all relieved acute pain after surgeries to a certain degree. This is because oxycodone can achieve analgesic purposes via stimulation of the peripheral and central opioid receptors of the &#x003bc; and &#x003ba; types, it is reported that &#x003ba; receptors play a crucial part in the analgesic mechanism of activity of oxycodone,<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> especially the &#x003ba;2b receptor agonism.<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> The mechanisms of visceral pain constitution involved opioid receptors of the &#x003ba; type. Besides, by interacting with the G-protein, oxycodone promotes the potassium channels to open and hinders activation of voltage-dependent calcium channels. The described effects lead to the result of a decline of the excitability of nerve cells. Hence, it has a stronger analgesic effect on the visceral pain than other opioids.</p><p>Affected by different doses, the 3 groups exhibited different analgesic effects: compared with a dose of 0.5&#x0200a;mg/kg oxycodone, doses of 0.75&#x0200a;mg/kg and 1.0&#x0200a;mg/kg oxycodone significantly reduced the NRS scores, while the pressing ratios were significantly higher and patient satisfaction was improved, indicating that analgesic effect with a low dose of 0.5&#x0200a;mg/kg oxycodone was not ideal, which may be associated with hyperalgesia and central sensitization.<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup></p><p>In this study, the Ramsay score was used to evaluate the sedative effect of oxycodone. The study found that with the increase in the dose of oxycodone, the incidence of somnolence increased, most obviously in the 1&#x0200a;mg/kg group, which may be related to the larger dose of oxycodone achieving sedative effect through &#x003ba; receptor agonism in the central nervous system.</p><p>No respiratory depression occurred in this experiment. This may be because oxycodone takes pharmacological effects mainly through the &#x003ba; receptor, being less sensitive to the &#x003bc; receptor agonism, thereby reducing respiratory depression while achieving the purpose of analgesia through the &#x003bc; receptor agonism. Meanwhile, as the analgesic effect was good, the patient's respiration extent increased. In addition, opioid analgesics can lead to nausea, vomiting, and other adverse reactions, but this study showed that oxycodone did not increase the incidence of nausea or vomiting. Because a combination usage with NSAIDS drugs can reduce the amount of opioids and may mitigate the reaction of nausea and vomiting caused by &#x003bc;-receptor agonism.<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup></p><p>In the treatment of the pain, oxycodone is featured with the most ideal pharmacokinetic characteristic and a high safety characteristic in patients simultaneously treated with other drugs. The interactions, which is caused by inhibition of CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 activity by other drugs, have practically no clinical implication.<sup>[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup></p><p>In summary, a dose of 0.75&#x0200a;mg/kg oxycodone hydrochloride combined with flurbiprofen axetil can provide safe and effective postoperative analgesia for lower abdominal patients, with fewer adverse reactions.</p><p>The results of this clinical trial are open to further discussion and more precise analysis in the future due to the study limitation of a moderate number of enrolled patients.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: ASA = American Society of Anesthesiologists, BMI = body mass index, MAP = mean arterial pressure, NRS = numerical rating scale, SpO<sub>2</sub> = peripheral oxygen saturation, TOF = train of 4 stimulation.</p></fn><fn fn-type="equal"><p>Xiaobing Xiang and Yingli Wu contributed equally to this work.
