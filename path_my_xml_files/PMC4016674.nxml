In Norway, MCI and dementia represent major health concerns, which will be even more pronounced in the future because of the demographic shift that is resulting in an increased number of elderly citizens. The economic burden of these disorders both for the individual and for society is a heavy one [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Currently, no treatment is available for enhancing memory function or preventing further decline in patients with MCI. Impairment of memory and learning, including the working memory (WM) capacity, characterizes an MCI condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>WM is a theoretical construct referring to the structures and processes associated with our ability to keep information in mind, while we actively use and respond to the information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Individuals with WM deficits have trouble remembering information even for a few seconds, find it difficult to keep track of what they are doing as they work, or forget what they are supposed to retrieve when sent on an errand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Previously, a person&#x02019;s WM capacity was presumed to be constant and unmodifiable by stimulation or other external factors. Recently, the 'neuroplasticity paradigm' has gained support, and a growing body of research has focused on the brain&#x02019;s modification capabilities. The notion that mentally stimulating activities may affect cognitive processes, including memory, has also been linked to a 'use it or lose it' hypothesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Different interventions have been developed to try to enhance or preserve cognitive function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Strategic interventions (by which an individual learns strategies to circumvent and compensate for the cognitive deficits) may be difficult for patients with MCI patients because of their memory problems. We use the definition suggested by Jolles and Crone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] of cognitive training as the process of improving cognitive functioning by means of practice and/or intentional instruction. The intervention method in this study can be classified as a process-based approach, which involves repeated performance (that is, practice) of demanding (WM) tasks, for which an underlying change in neural correlates is hypothesized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. WM capacity is associated with the organization of the white matter tracts that constitute the network between the parietal and the frontal lobes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. This assumption has been supported by the finding that adaptive WM training causes structural changes of the nerve tracts in the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. It is plausible to expect that performance gain in WM would improve various everyday activities that place high demands on WM capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>Positive effects of WM training have been reported in diverse clinical groups, including children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (AD/HD), as well as preschool children and youths born preterm with very low birth weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Reviews have reported moderate to large beneficial effects of cognitive exercises on memory-related outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Enhancing the function in specific domains by training the impaired skill(s) demonstrate the greatest overall effect on functioning compared with non-training methods such as memory strategies and compensatory strategies in patients with Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Several studies have reported improved performance on tasks included in the intervention (trained tasks) as well as improvement on non-trained WM tasks and other cognitive tasks that require spatial skills and involve complex problem-solving skills. However, there is a lack of studies on effective training interventions for MCI patients, and the few randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that exist have shown divergent results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. In addition, the existing studies have the limitations of non-standardized intervention methods and low statistical power, rendering conclusions on these matters challenging. It is therefore of great importance to perform RCTs investigating the effects of specific cognitive interventions in elderly patients with MCI who are at high risk of developing dementia. In addition, the proposed study seeks to investigate individual differences in training outcome and its relation to dementia biomarkers such as tau, phospho-tau, and &#x003b2;-amyloid proteins as well as candidate genes such as <italic>APOE</italic> and <italic>LMX1A</italic>. A recent study by Bellander <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] indicates that certain combinations of the different alleles of the <italic>LMX1A</italic> gene might predict those healthy adults most likely to benefit from WM training. This gene is involved in both development and maintenance of dopamine-producing neurons, which are related to WM function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. If this applies to the MCI group, such a biomarker could be a marker for the effects of the intervention and thereby correlate with the feasibility of this particular intervention. This article describes a study that it aimed to increase knowledge of the neuropsychological status in patients with MCI, as well as the feasibility and possible effects of a cognitive training intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><sec><title>Objectives</title><p>The primary objective of this blinded RCT is to evaluate the hypothesis that standardized computer-based WM training is effective in improving WM capacity over time in patients diagnosed with MCI. Second, we want to assess whether computer-based adaptive WM training in patients with MCI has transfer effects to other cognitive functions, including memory, attention, and executive functions, as well as activities of daily living, measured by a battery of neuropsychological tests. Third, any effects of WM training on the structural changes in white and gray matter of the brain will be investigated, measured by multimodal magnetic resonance imaging. Finally, possible genetic biomarkers (<italic>LMX1A</italic> and <italic>APOE</italic> genotypes) related to a positive effect or lack of effect of the training will be examined.</p><p>Study approval was given by the Norwegian regional committee for medical and health research ethics, south-eastern region (reference number 2013/410/REK S&#x000f8;r-&#x000f8;st).

Patients who have had head trauma with post-traumatic loss of consciousness for at least 30&#x000a0;minutes during their lifespan, or who have loss of senses (blindness, deafness) or photosensitive epilepsy or who are unsuitable for magnetic resonance imaging because of implanted metal foreign bodies or severe claustrophobia will be excluded from the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Outcome measures and assessment procedures</title><p>Baseline assessment will be completed prior to randomization and the first intervention session.</p></sec><sec><title>Neuropsychological assessment</title><p>The neuropsychological/cognitive evaluation includes the administration of several commonly used measures (tests, interview, and questionnaires) of cognitive abilities and daily functions. Measures of the patient's cognitive status (intelligence, memory, processing speed, attention, and executive functions) will include a wide range of standardized neuropsychological tests, as well as tests assessing prefrontal functions, as these may mediate WM decline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>].

Klingberg at the Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Both the adaptive and the 'placebo' training groups will use the program approximately 30 to 40&#x000a0;minutes a day, 5&#x000a0;days a week for 5&#x000a0;weeks. The training is considered 'adaptive', which means that the difficulty level of the tasks increases during the sessions according to the individual level of mastering for each participant, making the patient work at their maximum capacity at all times [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. This is the core element of the hypothesized effectiveness of the intervention. The placebo group will use a non-adaptive (fixed low-level training) version of the training program. The interface of both the placebo and the training version is identical, but the difficulty level in the placebo version does not increase adaptively as the patient performance improves.

For all analyses, &#x003b1; levels will be set to 0.05 and effect sizes refer to partial &#x003b7;-square values. With regard to cerebral MRI, the DTI images will be analyzed using the software FSL with [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>] to provide information on any changes in white matter microstructure with training. Automated morphometry to evaluate cortical thickness and surface area, total gray and white matter volumes, and deep nuclei volumes will be performed using the freely available FreeSurfer software program, v5.1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. Complete-case analysis will be used where missing data are excluded from the analysis. A fully detailed statistical analysis will be performed before unmasking of the data.</p><sec><title>Dissemination plan</title><p>The dissemination plan includes five scientific papers that will be submitted to peer-reviewed medical journals:</p><p>1. Computer-based adaptive working memory training on cognitive functioning in elderly patients with mild cognitive impairment assessed by neuropsychological tests. A randomized double-blind controlled study.</p><p>2. Does cognitive training in patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment relate to structural changes in the white and gray matter of the brain?</p><p>3. Do patients with MCI with a particular genotype for the <italic>LMX1A</italic> gene (i.e, AA alleles) or for <italic>APOE</italic> (i.e. non-&#x003f5;4) have stronger training effects after adaptive working memory training?</p><p>4. Does computer -based working memory training have secondary effects on executive function and activities of daily living in elderly patients with MCI? A randomized, double-blind controlled study.</p><p>5. Long-term follow-up of elderly patients with mild cognitive impairment after completion of an adaptive, computerized, standardized, and intensive working memory program: neuropsychological and daily-life functioning.</p><p>The first publication will be submitted at the end of 2014, and the other articles will be submitted before the project ends in 2017. In addition, the results will be disseminated at international conferences and national forums, and in the popular press to target a wide range of groups, including researchers, healthcare providers, and health-care professionals, as well as the general public. The results will be disseminated regardless of the magnitude or direction of effect.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>At present, there is no known cure for memory decline in the elderly or other cognitive deficits that follows MCI. Discovery of a method capable of enhancing memory, or postponing further decline in WM function in patients in the early stages of dementia, would be of great importance for a large and growing patient group.</p><p>The strengths of this trial are the extensive assessment of the participants on several levels, including gene samples, quantitative brain imaging, and neuropsychological testing. We hope the assessment will provide new and important information on the memory abilities and daily life functioning in elderly patients with MCI. This extensive assessment is relevant because of the complex nature of the etiology and behavioral outcomes of memory decline in elderly patients, and the heterogeneity of the cognitive phenotypes seen in memory clinics. The proposed study will be the first to investigate the possible mediating influence of biomarkers on the effects of cognitive training in patients with MCI. Such biomarkers may contribute in prediction of training effects. Furthermore, identification of a genetic marker to assess WM trainability would be an important finding that would allow cognitive intervention to be offered to those best able to benefit from it. This would also be of benefit to society.</p><p>Participating in this study involves no negative effects for the patients; but it may help the patients to improve their everyday functioning, and perhaps also to postpone further decline in WM function. The study also seeks to identify cognitive reserves in these patients, as such reserves seem to play an important role in the development of cognitive impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. Currently, there is a lack of knowledge of the effects of adaptive, standardized and intensive computerized WM training on individuals with MCI, and this study will be able to provide new and unique knowledge. If WM training can be shown to have positive effects on cognitive and daily-life functioning in people with MCI, a new approach to treatment of memory decline may be feasible.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial status</title><p>The trial started in August 2013, and is currently enrolling participants.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>BRIEF-A: Brief Rating Inventory of Executive Functions Adult version; CVLT-II: California Verbal Learning Test, second edition; D-KEFS: Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System; DEX: Behavioral assessment of the Dysexecutive Syndrome Questionnaire; IGT: Iowa Gambling Task; MCI: Mild Cognitive Impairment; Vineland: The Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, second edition (interview edition); WAIS-IV: Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, fourth edition; WMS-III: Wechsler Memory Scale, third edition.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>MMF: conception and design, data collection and analysis, manuscript writing, and final approval of the manuscript.
