As such, novel control strategies are urgently needed. Focusing on managing leprosy patient contacts, the most susceptible to contracting the disease, has been seen as a potential strategy in limiting the spread of leprosy as shown by a number of recent epidemiological studies. Immunoprophylaxis with Bacillus Calmette-Gu&#x000e9;rin (BCG) has been seen as an effective preventive measure due to its ability to stimulate the development of cellular immunity which is essential in controlling the disease, especially in its multibacillary (MB) forms. The association of immunoprophylaxis with chemoprophylaxis in a single dose of rifampicin has been shown to be a promising preventive strategy, although a variety of studies have found instances of early case detection just a few months after BCG vaccination.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p id="Par2">The present study is a phase IV chemoprophylactic clinical trial consisting of administration of a single dose of rifampicin in MB leprosy patient contacts under care at the Souza Ara&#x000fa;jo Outpatient Clinic/FIOCRUZ as part of a randomized (2:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled study. It is comprised of two groups: 1) rifampicin + BCG; and 2) placebo + BCG.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">The aim is to evaluate whether the use of chemoprophylaxis with a single dose of rifampicin in MB leprosy patient contacts prior to the BCG vaccine would be able to prevent the onset of leprosy in those cases that may occur just a few months after vaccination. Contact subclinical infections (polymerase chain reaction) and the immunological parameters (anti-PGL-1, anti-LID-1, and IFN-&#x003b3;) will be evaluated and the results will be compared after 12&#x000a0;months of follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par4">The Brazilian Registry of Clinical Trials (ReBEC), <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ensaiosclinicos.gov.br/rg/RBR-69qk5p/">RBR-69QK5P</ext-link>.

Likewise, over the last 10&#x000a0;years or so, the number of new global cases has markedly decreased from 299,036 in 2005 to 210,758 in 2015 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. According to Lockwood and coworkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], the near-term goal regarding the elimination of leprosy needs to be revised primarily since India and Brazil continue showing high detection rates notwithstanding major advances in detection strategies, more easily accessible treatment, and constant innovation. The goal must above all be realistically achievable and based on proven scientific evidence and constant updating as new information emerges.</p><p id="Par23">Brazil ranks second worldwide in the total number of leprosy cases, with India being the first. Brazil, however, takes first place in the Americas, where it was responsible for a full 92% of all new patients in 2015 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. According to Brazilian Ministry of Health (MH) data, 28,761 new leprosy patients were detected (14.7/100,000 inhabitants) in 2015. However, state-wide detection rates varied widely from 1.08/100,000 inhabitants in the State of Rio Grande do Sul to as high as 93.0/100,000 inhabitants in Mato Grosso State [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par24">The pillars that sustain disease control measures are the administration of MDT to all newly detected leprosy patients along with close surveillance of their contacts. The prime objectives are early detection and timely treatment. Since 1991, the MH has recommended that the Bacillus Calmette-Gu&#x000e9;rin (BCG) vaccine be administered to all intradomiciliary contacts within 5&#x000a0;years of their index (primary) case diagnosis.</p><p id="Par25">A study conducted in Brazil by Duppre and coworkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] showed that, despite the protection conferred by the BCG vaccine, a significant number of cases have occurred within a short period of time afterwards, mostly among contacts of multibacillary (MB) patients. Another study by Duppre et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], using anti-PGL-I serology to assess the risk of becoming ill, found an excess of new leprosy cases within the first few months after vaccination, mainly among those positive for anti-PGL-1, indicating the presence of prior subclinical infection.</p><p id="Par26">In 1989, Bagshawe et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] reported that previous immunity to mycobacterial antigens was primarily responsible for the clinical manifestations of paucibacillary (PB) leprosy and that the nonspecific immune stimulation induced by BCG vaccination might precipitate clinical manifestations of leprosy in individuals with subclinical infection.</p><p id="Par27">Another proposed measure of control is chemoprophylaxis among leprosy contacts via a single dose of rifampicin. The COLEP, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in Bangladesh, observed a 57% risk reduction during the first 2&#x000a0;years of follow-up in conjunction with a higher protective chemoprophylactic effect among contacts of nonconsanguineous social contacts of MB index cases. Moreover, childhood BCG had a complementary effect on rifampicin, thereby reducing the number of contacts that became ill after vaccination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. These findings clearly indicate the need to evaluate the combined effect of BCG immunoprophylaxis and rifampicin chemoprophylaxis in contacts of new index cases.</p><p id="Par28">In this same vein, a study by Richardus et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] evaluated the protective role of BCG at the initial contact examination and 8&#x000a0;weeks later, in association with a single dose of rifampicin. Among the 5196 contacts included in the above study, 21 became ill (0.40%) 12&#x000a0;weeks after BCG, 12 of whom (57%) had no previous BCG scar, while 18 (87%) developed tuberculoid leprosy. These results are in line with those published by Duppre and coworkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par29">In the area of serodiagnostics, the detection of IgM antibodies against phenolic glycolipid (PGL-1) represents the most reliable and highly evaluated standardized leprosy test available to date [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Nevertheless, leprosy IDRI (Infection Disease Research Institute) diagnostic-1 (LID-1), a novel protein (<italic>Mycobacterium leprae,</italic> ML0405, and ML2331), is considered to have diagnostic potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In parallel, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has demonstrated greater sensitivity than bacilloscopy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. It may be that the PGL-1, LID-1, and PCR combination is able to identify the most susceptible leprosy contacts.</p><p id="Par30">Nonetheless, the immunoregulatory mechanisms involved in the early stages of the disease that could be targeted for the development of new tests have not yet been established. Moreover, the understanding of the impact of chemoprophylaxis on contacts is also limited due to the insufficiently described immunological profile of those who have been administered chemoprophylaxis, whether associated or not with immunoprophylaxis.</p><p id="Par31">Besides, it is worth noting that the lack of a cell-mediated immune response to <italic>M. leprae</italic> antigens in individuals exposed to the infectious agent may be predictive of susceptibility. The production of interferon (IFN)-&#x003b3; in peripheral blood mononuclear cells has been used as a measure of cellular responsiveness. A previous study by our group showed that the five contacts who developed leprosy during follow-up belonged to the group that was negative to or had reduced levels of IFN in response to mycobacterial antigens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par32">We report an ongoing study set out to assess the effectiveness of leprosy chemoprophylaxis with rifampicin among contacts of MB patients. The study will also assess the effect of rifampicin on laboratory parameters, namely anti-PGL-I, anti-LID-I, IFN-&#x003b3;, and PCR, thought to indicate susceptibility to leprosy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par33">This is a phase IV, randomized (2:1), double-blind clinical trial involving either a single dose of rifampicin or placebo for the chemoprophylaxis of leprosy. Immunoprophylaxis with BCG as recommended by the Brazilian Leprosy Control Program was conducted in both comparison groups.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study site</title><p id="Par34">The clinical trial will be carried out at the Ambulatory Souza Ara&#x000fa;jo (ASA) Outpatient Clinic associated with the Leprosy Laboratory of the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation. In partnership with the Leprosy Laboratory, the ASA is known for its clinical, laboratory, educational, and research activities in the areas of immunology, pathology, molecular biology, microbiology, and clinical practice, in addition to providing ready access to basic care and complex diagnostic tests. As a leprosy reference center, the ASA can optimize the performance of chemoprophylaxis and guide its future use in other health care units.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Study population</title><p id="Par35">Study participants are recruited from index case contacts already registered at the ASA who either live in the city of Rio de Janeiro or its metropolitan area. The clientele is mostly comprised of referrals from local health care services (both public and private) and those who arrive spontaneously.</p><p id="Par36">After a leprosy diagnosis (clinical and/or bacteriological and/or histopathological), patients are informed about their clinical form, treatment regimen, mode of transmission, preventive measures, and the importance of presenting their contacts for clinical evaluation. All referrals made by the patient, whether consanguineous or not, household contacts, or those having close familial and/or social ties, are scheduled for a dermatoneurological examination as soon as possible after their index case diagnosis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Inclusion and exclusion criteria</title><p id="Par37">The eligibility criteria are sufficiently broad to encompass most potential beneficiaries and yet protect the study from any selective or informational bias. The inclusion criteria are: 1) contacts of MB leprosy patients who agree to undergo chemoprophylaxis; 2) ages 6&#x000a0;months to 70 years; 3) an expressed willingness to undergo both clinical and anti-PGL-1 evaluations; 4) availability for follow-up; and 5) a firm commitment to return for vaccination within 2 months and be clinically evaluated at the end of 12&#x000a0;months. The minimum period for detecting the postulated effect will be 12&#x000a0;months.</p><p id="Par38">Exclusion criteria are: 1) clinical or laboratory confirmation of leprosy at baseline; 2) BCG vaccination within the preceding 12&#x000a0;months (to prevent vaccine-related changes in the immune response), except for infants between 6 and 12&#x000a0;months of age (leprosy detection in infants indicates active transmission and the possibility of having other MB cases in the contact cluster); 3) contacts with immunosuppression and/or a history of tuberculosis in any of its forms; 4) pregnancy at any stage or refusal to undergo a urine pregnancy test; and 5) refusal to sign the informed consent form (ICF).</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Randomization and blinding</title><p id="Par39">The allocation of the participants into groups is based on random sequence generation via computer software (WINPEPI program, version 11.18). The ratio is 2:1 with two intervention groups and one control group for the purpose of expanding the pool of information generated by chemoprophylaxis. Participants will be randomly assigned to intervention or placebo in permuted blocks of variable sizes defined by the statistician, concealed from team members. Blocked randomization guards against any imbalance in the number of participants assigned to each group, a major concern for interim analysis, and also protects against the temporal variations in individual characteristics as well as in study procedures that may arise in long enrollment phases.</p><p id="Par40">The intervention code (rifampicin/placebo) for each patient is placed in sealed opaque envelopes and numbered sequentially (natural numbers). The envelopes are only opened after each contact has voluntarily signed the ICF to avoid foreknowledge of the allocated group. The number printed outside the envelope identifies the participant and the opened envelopes are saved to ensure traceability. Self-adhesive tags identifying the code of each volunteer are pasted onto the recruitment form, ICF, blood collection tubes, and each patient identification card. Group assignment will be concealed from study participants and from the researchers, physicians, and research assistants performing the study procedures (double-blind) as a way of protecting it from any unconscious biases or expectations as to the outcome. Two nonblinded team members that do not participate in data collection and analyses are responsible for dispensing rifampicin and the placebo, opening and storing envelopes for randomization, labeling study documents, and administrating the medications. The allocation ratio (2:1) will make the intervention group twice the size of the control group, thus hampering the blinding of the statistical analysis of the data.</p><p id="Par41">Besides preventing informational bias, blinding may additionally avert adherence problems in the placebo group. During follow-up, unblinding will be allowed whenever the clinical management of adverse events requires disclosure of the individual&#x02019;s group to the attending physician and to the independent monitoring committee.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Intervention</title><p id="Par42">All contacts included in the study receive a single supervised dose of rifampicin or placebo. Either rifampicin or placebo is administered during the initial visit, but only after each contact has signed the ICF, undergone anamnesis, been clinically examined, and had their data collected.</p><p id="Par43">The rifampicin dose consists of 600&#x000a0;mg, or 10&#x000a0;mg/kg body weight in contacts weighing less than 40&#x000a0;kg. Infants and children receive the dosage in a solution determined by weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. All contacts must receive the BCG vaccine a maximum of 2&#x000a0;months after the single dose of rifampicin or placebo.</p><p id="Par44">Maintaining the blinding poses some challenges because rifampicin often leads to reddish-colored urine, tears, and sweat. Rifampicin and placebo capsules have identical organoleptic properties even though starch placebos do not mimic the reddish coloration in the urine and elsewhere.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Outcomes</title><p id="Par45">The primary outcome of the present study is the development of new leprosy cases during follow-up.</p><p id="Par46">The assessment of clinical disease is based on the identification of cutaneous lesions, with observed changes in sensitivity and thickened nerves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Clinical diagnoses are ascertained by professionals with leprosy expertise and include a dermatologist and a nurse responsible for the dermatological, clinical, and previous history evaluations, as well as a physiotherapist in charge of neurological assessment.</p><p id="Par47">When the contacts return for evaluation, those with suspected clinical leprosy will be submitted to bacteriological and histopathological testing and then classified according to the Ridley and Jopling scale (1966) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] as: borderline-borderline; borderline-lepromatous; lepromatous-lepromatous; tuberculoid; borderline-tuberculoid tuberculoid; or undetermined. Confirmed cases will also be grouped according to their grade of disability and bacilloscopic index (BI) as MB if BI-positive, or PB if BI-negative.</p><p id="Par48">Secondary outcomes are: 1) the serological status of anti-PGL-1 prior and subsequent to chemoprophylaxis and before immunoprophylaxis; 2) the serological status of anti-LID-1 prior and subsequent to chemoprophylaxis and before immunoprophylaxis; 3) the PCR positivity, which is considered a marker of increased risk for developing leprosy; 4) IFN-&#x003b3; production in response to <italic>M. leprae</italic> before and after chemoprophylaxis; 5) adverse events potentially associated with rifampicin; 6) intercurrent clinical conditions due to intervention; and 7) concordance between rapid test and serology for anti-PGL-1.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Follow-up</title><p id="Par49">Recruitment strategies for the study include adapted routine ASA procedures that are recorded on the appropriate forms. Initially, identification, demographic, and socioeconomic variables are recorded along with type and length of time of index case cohabitation. The contacts are duly informed concerning the clinical forms of the disease, incubation periods, signs and symptoms, modes of transmission, and treatment regimens.</p><p id="Par50">The contacts are submitted to a detailed physical examination including verification of a BCG scar, sensitivity testing, and a traditional dermatological examination to identify suspected leprosy lesions. The neurological evaluation covers inspection and palpation/percussion, together with the functional evaluation of the peripheral nerves and identification of deformities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The cases detected in the initial evaluation are considered coprevalent contacts of their index cases, thus becoming index cases themselves and triggering a contact search.</p><p id="Par51">After this first stage, signed informed consent is obtained from all participants aged 18 and over in addition to the parents/guardians of those up to 17&#x000a0;years of age. A signed assent form is also required for the 12- to 17-year-old participants.</p><p id="Par52">The informed consent form includes: a medical description of leprosy; the role played by contact surveillance in disease control; the study objectives; the risks and benefits related to intervention; the commitment to participate in the study, including an initial evaluation, another after 2&#x000a0;months, and a third upon completing 1 year; concealed randomization of group participation; the possibility of the occurrence of adverse events; and the procedures to be followed if further assistance is needed accompanied by the data necessary to contact team members.</p><p id="Par53">After signing the forms, 16&#x000a0;ml of blood is collected from adults and contacts aged 12 to 17 years for the baseline identification of the following immunological markers: anti-PGL-1, anti-LID-1, and IFN-&#x003b3; during the first evaluation, at the end of the second month (prior to BCG immunization), and 12&#x000a0;months subsequent to the initial intervention. All participants will undergo digital pulp blood sampling for rapid anti-PGL-1 testing during the initial evaluation and after 12&#x000a0;months following intervention. Children under 12&#x000a0;years of age will have only a digital pulp blood sample collected for rapid anti-PGL-1 test. This test has been validated by B&#x000fc;hrer-S&#x000e9;kula et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], and a simple verification of the agreement with the results of the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (anti-PGL-I) in adults will be conducted in this study to inform of the limitations of the results in children, for whom ELISA (anti-PGL-I) will not be available.</p><p id="Par54">Lymph from the right earlobe is obtained by dermal scraping for DNA/ML molecular investigation (PCR) during the first evaluation, but only from the participants over 12 years of age, since children under 12 years of age are less able to bear the discomfort. Another lymph sample is collected at the end of the second month in the event the result of the first examination is either positive or inconclusive. Lymph collection follows MH guidelines, according to which the specimen is stored in a sterile bottle immersed in a 70% alcohol solution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par55">The BCG vaccine is administered 2&#x000a0;months after the first clinical assessment has been made in contrast to the MH recommendation in that regard [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. This alteration makes it possible to evaluate the immunological parameters of each participant in response to rifampicin alone on the one hand, and the placebo alone on the other. Since rifampicin has a significant bactericidal effect, a 2-month interval between the administration of rifampicin and BCG is planned to avert interference of the antibiotic in the immune response to this attenuated live vaccine. Because of the slow progression of leprosy disease, however, the postponement of BCG vaccination for up to 2&#x000a0;months after receiving rifampicin should not substantially interfere with the protection conferred by BCG. Contacts under 1 year of age will be administered BCG only if they have not been vaccinated before. We clarified that participants are encouraged to seek care at the ASA Outpatient Clinic any time they present signs or symptoms indicated in the baseline interview.

The balanced distribution of covariates across comparison groups achieved by randomization could be lost as a result of violations in protocol.</p><p id="Par71">The main explanatory variable defined by the study design is the intervention (rifampicin/placebo). Whereas univariate analyses will be performed to describe their baseline characteristics, bivariate analyses will explore the association between intervention and outcomes (response variables). Multivariate analyses (Cox regression) will be conducted to adjust the association estimates (hazard ratio for new cases) for covariates with any imbalance in group distribution. Subgroup analyses of effectiveness (derivatives of the measures of association) according to age, along with the BI and type of cohabitation with the index case, will be carried out.</p><p id="Par72">Cox regression is used to estimate the conditional hazard ratio and the survival function based on longitudinal data from a dynamic cohort of individuals under surveillance for different periods. The hazard ratio estimates the magnitude of the association between chemoprophylaxis and leprosy. The measurement takes into account the different time periods that have elapsed between exposure (treatment/placebo) and the outcome (illness) for each participant until disease develops or follow-up is discontinued [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The survival curve will be required to handle open and continuous recruitment as well as censorship, and the survival rates can be estimated by conditional probability according to the strategy proposed by Kaplan and Meier.

This analysis will verify whether the cessation of participant recruitment is warranted by the data collected thus far and will be an opportunity to revise sample calculations according to the results. Interim analysis will seek evidence of the effectiveness, or lack thereof, of chemoprophylaxis or any clear indications that the postulated effect is so unlikely that recruitment is no longer justified. The assessment will be based on the number of events accumulated thus far and the trend in the difference between comparison groups, and the discontinuation of the trial will be submitted to the Data Monitoring Committee.</p><p id="Par75">The critical level of a <italic>z</italic> score to reject the null hypothesis in the interim analysis will be adjusted to 2.782 (<italic>p</italic> = 0.005) in line with the O&#x02019;Brien-Fleming protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].

For the occurrence of this outcome a minimum follow-up time was set at 1 year.</p><p id="Par82">Sample size calculations were based on the proportion of contacts that would likely develop leprosy per intervention group, currently estimated at 5% for the placebo group and 2% for the rifampicin group. With an allocation ratio of 2:1, the difference of 3 percentage points, a statistical power of 80%, and a significance level of 5%, (corrected to 0.025 to account for the interim analysis), the study requires 829 participants in the intervention group and 415 controls for a total 1244 participants. Estimating a 20% loss during follow-up (based on previous ASA data), the total sample size would total 1493 participants (995 in the treatment group and 498 controls). This sample size is appropriate for the analysis of time to failure enabling the study to detect more subtle effects (hazard ratio 0.67). Assuming a 30% seropositivity for PGL-1 among controls, this sample size will provide 85% power to detect an 8 percentage point difference from the treatment group. For 2.5% LID-positive controls, the study has 77% power to detect a 2 percentage point difference. For 35% IFN-&#x003b3;-based susceptibility the study has an 80% power to detect an 8 percentage point difference. The calculations were performed via PASS11 software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par83">The proposed study seeks to generate clinical and laboratory evidence that chemoprophylaxis combined with immunoprophylaxis may alter the natural course of subclinical infection by <italic>M. leprae</italic> by reducing the incidence of new cases and altering the laboratory parameters of infection. It is hoped that the results of the present study broaden the theoretical basis of the leprosy control program in Brazil.</p><p id="Par84">The MH started a pilot project, referred to as PEP-hans, in a number of defined areas in the states of Pernambuco, Mato Grosso, and Tocantins in June 2015 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The objective was to evaluate as closely as possible the effectiveness of postexposure chemoprophylaxis with one dose of rifampicin. The intervention is expected to reduce the risk of leprosy among contacts who present themselves to any health care facility nationwide under the Unified Health System (UHS), while keeping in mind the operational aspects involved in that initiative. Although PEP-hans evaluates the effectiveness of single-dose rifampicin in a population similar to the one in the present study, it differs in several methodological aspects such as the administration of rifampicin to contacts of index cases diagnosed up to 12&#x000a0;months beforehand and who received the BCG vaccine at baseline.</p><p id="Par85">The authors consider that one of the advantages of the present study over PEP-hans is the evaluation of the immunological parameters before and after the administration of rifampicin (again, prior to the BCG vaccine) in the presence or absence of <italic>M. leprae</italic>. This strategy may expand our knowledge of the immune mechanisms that identify the contacts most susceptible to illness and may also contribute to the future development of diagnostic kits.</p><p id="Par86">The ongoing MALTALEP clinical trial developed by Richardus et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] also aims to evaluate the combined effect of single-dose rifampicin chemoprophylaxis and BCG immunoprophylaxis in new leprosy contacts. The present study shares the hypothesis that there is a combined effect of chemoprophylaxis and immunoprophylaxis but objectifies the gathering of information on the immunological parameters that have been influenced by the separate interventions in the same individual.</p><p id="Par87">The above study and ours will carry out immunological and genetic analyses but at different times. MALTALEP will collect blood from 150 contacts in each randomized group within an 8-week period and within 1 and 2&#x000a0;years of follow-up. In our trial, however, blood collection will take place upon recruitment and then 2 and 12&#x000a0;months later. The results of these studies may be complementary to each other and, if so, be able to identify more effective strategies to manage contacts at greater risk and elaborate secondary preventive measures with rifampicin.</p><p id="Par88">Research settings, particularly for experiments, may distance themselves from the &#x0201c;real world&#x0201d;, so that results may not be reproducible under typical operational conditions prevailing in average public health care units. In this regard, the proposed intervention is simple enough to be easily incorporated into routine practice. Conversely, the laboratory tests may pose additional difficulties for the public health care services. The present study addresses day-to-day medical issues, but the limitations of the external validity of the results should be acknowledged.</p><p id="Par89">Leprosy is a millennial disease and, although it shows a low mortality rate in recent times, it continues to present high morbidity with the loss of the capacity to work accompanied by pernicious social stigmatization, often making it difficult to approach possible leprosy patient contacts.</p><p id="Par90">Chemoprophylaxis represents an opportunity to increase the impact on contact control to prevent the rise of new cases while infection markers will allow the contacts with the highest potential to benefit from this intervention. The results of this trial could make a considerable contribution to the prevention and containment of leprosy and to a more robust clinical management of contacts who become infected<bold>.</bold> With the additional resources available for clinical investigation and prophylaxis, it may be possible to more readily engage leprosy contacts to fully comply with all medical recommendations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par91">The recruitment started in July 2015; participants are currently being recruited, and we expect to close in July 2020.
