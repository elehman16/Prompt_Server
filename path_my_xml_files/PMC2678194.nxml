Unfortunately, the case detection rates remain low in many countries. Thus, we need interventions to find and treat sufficient number of patients to control TB. We investigated whether involving health extension workers (HEWs: trained community health workers) in TB control improved smear-positive case detection and treatment success rates in southern Ethiopia.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Finding</title><p>We carried out a community-randomized trial in southern Ethiopia from September 2006 to April 2008. Fifty-one kebeles (with a total population of 296, 811) were randomly allocated to intervention and control groups. We trained HEWs in the intervention kebeles on how to identify suspects, collect sputum, and provide directly observed treatment. The HEWs in the intervention kebeles advised people with productive cough of 2 weeks or more duration to attend the health posts. Two hundred and thirty smear-positive patients were identified from the intervention and 88 patients from the control kebeles. The mean case detection rate was higher in the intervention than in the control kebeles (122.2&#x00025; v<italic>s</italic> 69.4&#x00025;, p&#x0003c;0.001). In addition, more females patients were identified in the intervention kebeles (149.0 <italic>vs</italic> 91.6, p&#x0003c;0.001). The mean treatment success rate was higher in the intervention than in the control kebeles (89.3&#x00025; <italic>vs</italic> 83.1&#x00025;, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.012) and more for females patients (89.8&#x00025; <italic>vs</italic> 81.3&#x00025;, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.05).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>The involvement of HEWs in sputum collection and treatment improved smear-positive case detection and treatment success rate, possibly because of an improved service access.

As a result of the interaction between TB and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, TB incidence is rising in sub-Saharan Africa. It has also led to an increase in drug resistance and poor treatment outcomes <xref rid="pone.0005443-Harries1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>.</p><p>Information from South India shows that directly observed treatment, short-course (DOTS) reduces TB incidence <xref rid="pone.0005443-Subramani1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. However, in many other countries, the case detection rates are too low to reduce the incidence of TB. The main obstacles are low health service coverage, shortage of health workers and poor programme performance <xref rid="pone.0005443-Dye1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p><p>Epidemiological models show that active case finding might reduce TB incidence and avoid TB deaths. Although active case finding is effective in contact tracing on a small scale, high cost and poor treatment adherence limit its use <xref rid="pone.0005443-Murray1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0005443-Golub1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. We therefore need alternative methods to improve TB case finding.</p><p>In Ethiopia, the National TB and Leprosy Control Programme (NTLCP) started to implement DOTS in 1992. NTLCP is responsible for policy formulation, resource mobilisation, monitoring and evaluation. Under the NTLCP, three levels of function exist in the regions, zones and districts for coordinating TB control activities. TB control is also integrated into the general service at health facilities. The district TB programme coordinator is responsible for supervision of the general health workers involved in patient care in hospitals and health centres. However, community DOTS was not started.</p><p>Ethiopia has the seventh highest TB burden in the world. In 2006, the estimated number of new smear-positive cases was 168 per 10<sup>5</sup> for Ethiopia. Unfortunately, the case detection rate was 27&#x00025;, far below the target <xref rid="pone.0005443-Federal1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. In 2004, the government of Ethiopia launched a community-based initiative to provide essential health services to the community under a health extension programme (HEP) to ensure equitable access to health services. The aim of the HEP is to prevent major communicable diseases and promote health in the community. A new cadre of community level health workers, health extension workers (HEWs), was trained for 1 year at an undergraduate level. With the aim of preventing major communicable diseases, HEWs are trained on how to identify and refer TB suspects, trace defaulters, and provide treatment and health education <xref rid="pone.0005443-Federal1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0005443-Federal2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. However, their role in TB control has not been evaluated. The aim of the present study was to establish whether involving HEWs in TB control improved smear-positive case detection and treatment success rates in southern Ethiopia.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005443.s001">Checklist S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005443.s002">Protocol S1</xref>.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Study area and population</title><p>This study was conducted in Dale and Wonsho, rural districts of Sidama zone in southern Ethiopia from September 2006 to April 2008. There were 51 kebeles (lowest administrative units) in the two districts. Fifty-five per cent of the population live within two-hour walking distance of health facilities. There were 21 health posts (operational unit for HEWs), two health stations, two nucleus health centres (health stations upgrading to health centres) and one health centre. Three health facilities (one health centre and two health stations) conducted sputum microscopy, and DOT was provided in the health centre, nucleus health centres and health stations. None of the health posts provide DOT.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Health service and HEP</title><p>The Government of Ethiopia has a four-tier health service, and the lowest level is a primary health care unit (a health centre and five satellite health posts). On average, a health post serves a kebele with 5000 people. The health policy focuses on provision of preventive and promotive health care to the population under the HEP, which involves prevention and control of diseases, including TB. The local health authorities in consultation with kebele leaders select two female residents, who have completed tenth grade, from each kebele. The women receive training for 1 year and are placed as HEWs in their respective kebele. They receive a salary from the government and they are accountable to the health centre <xref rid="pone.0005443-Federal2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Participants</title></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>TB case finding and treatment outcome</title><sec id="s2d1"><title>Case finding</title><p>TB suspects, who had cough for two weeks or more, were referred for further investigations.

HEWs, in the in the intervention kebeles, received on job training about how to collect sputum samples and support patients to adhere to treatment. HEWs collected sputum specimens once a month. An ice box was used to keep the sputum specimens in the health post and during their transportation on foot to diagnostic units. The intervention included sputum collection and providing DOT.</p><p>During health education sessions at health posts, HEWs informed people living in the kebele about TB and advised them to come to a health post if they had productive cough of 2 weeks or more duration. TB suspects who came to the health posts were told about community-based TB care. HEWs collected spot-morning-spot sputum specimens, and labelled and transported them to the diagnostic units every month for examination for acid-fast bacilli by direct microscopy.

The increase in CDR was lower for children compared to those aged 15 years and above. This could be explained by an inability to produce sputum specimens, low disease burden, or the low number of children enrolled in the study <xref rid="pone.0005443-Shargie2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Patients from the intervention kebeles were older than those from control kebeles for both sexes.

However, in our study, the CDR was higher for females in the intervention group. This could be explained by the improved geographic and socioeconomic access to the service as sputum collection was done in the intervention kebeles. As expected, the number of TB cases detected was greater than that estimated. This may have resulted from underestimation of TB incidence as reported from Myanmar <xref rid="pone.0005443-World1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, the backlog of TB cases that were not reached by the health service <xref rid="pone.0005443-Shargie1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0005443-World3" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, or underestimation of the population in the study area. Further study is required to determine the magnitude of TB in the community.</p><p>Studies have shown that using different treatment supervisors for DOT has improved the TSR for passively detected TB cases <xref rid="pone.0005443-Wandwalo1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0005443-Singh1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0005443-Kangangi1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. However, poor treatment adherence remains a challenge for patients identified by active and enhanced case finding <xref rid="pone.0005443-Golub2" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. In our study, decentralisation of the treatment to the kebele improved the TSR for TB patients detected by enhanced case finding. Similar to CDR, the TSR was higher for women aged above 14 years because of improved access created by DOT provision in the kebele.</p><p>Our findings suggest seasonal variation in CDR and TSR. In the intervention kebeles, the rates peaked in spring (September&#x02013;November) and winter (December&#x02013;February) possibly as a result of the economic gain from the harvest in spring. However, in the intervention and control kebeles, the rates were low in autumn (March&#x02013;May) when farmers prepare for the farming season, and this was followed by another peak in early summer (June&#x02013;August). Previous studies have suggested that overcrowding and staying indoors during the rainy season favour transmission of TB, which results in greater seasonal variation in children <xref rid="pone.0005443-Leung1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0005443-Thorpe1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0005443-Luquero1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. In our setting, further study is required to establish more about the seasonal variation and its associated factors.</p><p>Although cluster randomized controlled trials are considered valid studies, their methodological limitations should be addressed. The baseline demographic and clinical characteristics were similar in the two groups. We kept potential for bias to a minimum by comparing and analysing information from complementary sources. Although we did not blind the sputum samples sent to the diagnostic units, the laboratory technicians received the standard information for sputum analysis, and were not informed if the sputum specimens were from an intervention or control kebele. In addition, external quality control was performed for the slides examined in health facilities at the Centre for Health and Research Laboratory in the southern Ethiopia. In our sample size calculations, the intraclass correlation was small. The CDR and TSR in the control group was 45&#x00025; and 83&#x00025;, respectively, which was similar to the CDR of 40&#x00025; in the intervention and 42&#x00025; in the control kebeles, and TSR of 78&#x00025; in the intervention and 74&#x00025; in the control kebeles (unpublished review of 3 years of DOTS in the study area), which suggests the completeness of our data collection. However, as control and intervention kebeles were neighbouring each other and health facilities delivered the service to both groups, we cannot rule out the effect of the intervention in the control kebeles. This might have reduced the effect size in the intervention kebeles.</p><p>Our intervention used enhanced case finding, a variant of active case finding, in which HEWs encouraged TB suspects to visit health posts for sputum collection, and provided DOT. The strength of the study was that it included a sufficient number of clusters to address an important challenge of DOTS strategy, namely low CDR, and improved treatment adherence of patients identified by enhanced case finding by providing DOT. It also explored a practical way of involving HEWs in TB control under the community-based initiative of HEP in Ethiopia.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Generalizability</title><p>The results of our study could be applied in settings with low health service coverage (low DOTS coverage and limited number of TB laboratories), where HEWs have the first contact with the people to provide health education, and collect and transport sputum specimens to diagnostic units. This makes the service patient-centred, to improve case finding and treatment adherence <xref rid="pone.0005443-World2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Our study area is a densely populated agrarian community, typical of the rural population on the Ethiopian highlands. It could also be applied in areas with a shortage of health workers, especially laboratory technicians, with or without adequate health service coverage. The findings of the study were disseminated to managers of TB programmes in the southern region and at national level. We believe our findings are relevant for policy formulation on community TB care in Ethiopia. With limited health care coverage and shortage of health workers, similar to that in many developing countries, we believe that our findings are applicable to similar settings.</p><p>In conclusion, involving HEWs in TB control improved the CDR and TSR for smear-positive patients and females in particular. It could be used as an option to improve the trend in low CDR and provide patient-centred services in high-burden countries. However, the cost-effectiveness of enhanced case finding and treatment outcome needs further study.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0005443.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>CONSORT Checklist</p><p>(0.06 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0005443.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0005443.s002"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><p>Trial Protocol</p><p>(0.27 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0005443.s002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are grateful to Regional Health Bureau, Sidama Zone Health Department, Dale and Wonsho Woreda Health Office and TB programme coordinators for their technical and material support.
