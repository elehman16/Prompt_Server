exercise and Kendall exercise on forward head posture. [Subjects and Methods] Thirty
elderly college students with a forward head posture were randomly divided into two groups
for 15 persons each, a horse-riding simulator group and Kendall exercise group, and
performed exercise for eight weeks. [Results] The horse-riding simulator group and Kendall
exercise group showed significant differences after the intervention in New York state
posture rating, craniovertebral angle, and cranial rotation angle. The horse-riding
simulator group showed a significantly smaller value than the Kendall exercise group for
New York state posture rating evaluation after the intervention. [Conclusion] The results
of this study indicate that horse-riding simulator exercise is more effective on forward
head posture than Kendall exercise. Therefore, horse-riding simulator exercise can be used
as a new simple treatment method for the ever-growing forward head posture.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Neck pain</kwd><kwd>Posture</kwd><kwd>Horse-riding simulator</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>People today frequently experience neck-related diseases due to simple repetitive jobs and
incorrect posture resulting from industrialization. An incorrect posture causes stress on
the neck structure, and continuous stress on the neck leads to FHP (forward head posture)
accompanied by neck pain and headache<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Major symptoms caused by FHP are abnormal scapula movement<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>, abnormality of the temporomandibular joint<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>, neck pain<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>,
pain in the interscapular band<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>, and
migraine, and it also causes problems such as decreased inhalation capacity and decreased
maximum oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide discharge volume. Kendall exercise is
generally used as physical therapy for FHP and induces proper neck alignment generally using
strengthening methods for two muscles (deep cervical flexors and retractors of the scapula)
and stretching methods for two muscles (neck extensor muscles and pectoralis) to help with
FHP, which is a state of imbalance of muscles<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Normal Kendall exercise requires accurate movements but incorrect
posture only has a bad influence on the spine. Unlike Kendall exercise, HRS (horse-riding
simulator) exercise is a promising therapy generating interest as a means of accurately
inproving posture through horse riding<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Horse riding provides the rider with physical movements 500&#x02013;1,000 times over the course of
10 minutes according to the horse&#x02019;s movement. The physical movements resulting from the
horse&#x02019;s gait are a form of three-dimensional exercise (front and back, left and right, and
up and down) and triggers the same exercise effect as human gait because they are similar to
those of the human pelvis during gait. However, horse-riding therapy with a live horse has
budgetary and spatial constraints that prevent its widespread use. Therefore, horse-riding
exercise with a simulator, as a simple indoor treatment, can increase accessibility to this
therapy and decrease its cost<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
purpose of this study was to access the effect of HRS exercise, which has the advantages of
horse-riding exercise, and Kendall exercise, which is a general treatment method for FHP, on
postural alignment and spine alignment in FHP.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The study population was 30 college students with FHP randomly divided into two groups of
15 persons each, an HRS group and Kendall exercise group. The subjects performed exercise
for 8 weeks; the selection criteria for the subjects were as follows: (1) mild or higher
symptoms of FHP according to the New York State Posture Rating Chart (Harman et al., 2005);
(2) CVA (craniovertebral angle) less than 53&#x000b0;; (3) no orthopedic disease that might affect
testing; and (4) no visual impairment, visual field defect, or mental or perceptional
problem that might affect testing. All subjects understood the purpose of this study and

in 5 sets of consisting of 12 repetitions of postures, each taking 30 seconds, based on
Kendall exercise<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. The Kendall exercise methods were as follows: (1) Strengthening
the deep cervical flexors, lying flat on the back with the chin down and then lifting the
head and holding this position for 2&#x02013;8 seconds to strengthen deep cervical flexors; (2)
Stretching the cervical extensors, placing both hands on the occipital area in a sitting
position followed by a flexed neck posture with the head down to stretch the cervical
extensors; (3) strengthening shoulder retraction, putting a TheraBand around a secure object
and pulling the band back with both hands as far as possible to move the shoulder blades
toward each other in a standing position; and (4) stretching the pectoralis muscle, placing
both hands on theoccipital area and pulling the elbows back up (bilateral) and performing
arm abduction and external rotation (unilateral).</p><p>The NSPR (New York State posture rating), CVA, and CRA (cranial rotation angle) were
evaluated to assess joint angle in FHP. A weight was hung from the ceiling on a string and
kept perpendicular to the floor, forming a plumb line. Marks were attached to the areas of
the 7th cervical vertebra, auricular tragus, and acromion when each subject reached the NHP
(neutral head position).

science, technology, and industrialization and suffer from musculoskeletal abnormalities and
pain caused by FHP<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. The physical
therapy methods that have been used to cure FHP and to correct posture are preservation
therapies, such as thermotherapy, electrical stimulation therapy, and traction therapy, and
therapeutic exercise, such as McKenzie&#x02019;s posture exercise and Kendall&#x02019;s muscle strengthening
and stretching exercise<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Recently, horse-riding exercise is being focused on as a new treatment method inducing a
correct posture through use of the irregular movements of horse riding. Particularly, HRS
can be simply applied without spatial constraint. Therefore, Kendall exercise, the
conventional method, and HRS exercise, the new method, were comparatively analyzed to assess
the effect of HRS exercise on FHP correction and posture. Previous research showed that
horse-riding exercise in children with cerebral palsy improved weight shifting and postural
control and especially decreased neck hyperextension through enhanced midline head
control<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the postural
alignment evaluation in the present study, NSPR decreased, CVA increased, and CRA decreased
the HRS exercise. These results are consistent with the outcomes in previous research, and
HRS exercise is considered to have a positive influence on FHP.</p><p>Kendall exercise is a stretching method used to strengthen cervical muscles and is
frequently used for improvement of neck stability and postural control, for which it has
been proven to be effective<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. The Kendall exercise group showed a decreased NSPR,
increased CVA, and decreased CRA, which indicate improvement of neck stability. However,
there were statistically significant differences between the Kendall group and HRS group
after the intervention. These results show that HRS exercise is more effective on FHP than
Kendall exercise. Therefore, the HRS can be a new simple treatment method for the
ever-growing FHP. A limitation of this study is that representativeness could not be
guaranteed because of small number of subjects. The duration of improved posture from
Kendall exercise and HRS exercise should be evaluated through follow-up testing.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Hickey</surname><given-names>ER</given-names></name><name><surname>Rondeau</surname><given-names>MJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Corrente</surname><given-names>JR</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Reliability of the cervical range of motion (CROM) device
