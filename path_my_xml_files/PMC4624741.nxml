It occurs in approximately 25% of the population each year, but most affected people do not seek medical care [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Approximately 25% of patients with dyspepsia have an underlying organic cause. However, up to 75% of patients have functional (idiopathic or non-ulcer) dyspepsia with no underlying cause on diagnostic evaluation.</p><p>Functional dyspepsia (FD), one of the most common gastrointestinal disorders, has prevalence rates of 11% to 29.2% worldwide [<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. According to the Rome III criteria, FD is defined as the presence of one or more of the following: postprandial fullness, early satiation, epigastric pain or burning and no evidence of structural disease (including on upper endoscopy) that is likely to explain the symptoms [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. While patients with these symptoms and a negative diagnostic evaluation likely have FD, according to the Rome III guidelines, the criteria should be fulfilled for the last 3 months with symptom onset at least 6 months before diagnosis.</p><p><italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> (<italic>H. pylori</italic>) is an important risk factor for the development of peptic ulcer disease, gastric adenocarcinoma, and primary B cell lymphoma of the stomach. A possible role for <italic>H. pylori</italic> in the pathogenesis of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) has also been suggested in a growing number of studies. The association between <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection and FD is unclear, although a minority of patients (from 1% to 15%) may improve after eradication treatment [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Dyspepsia continuing after treatment of <italic>H. pylori</italic> is more likely the result of GERD or FD. Whether patients with FD should receive <italic>H. pylori</italic> eradication therapy remains controversial. The present study was designed to evaluate the effects of <italic>H. pylori</italic> eradication therapy on dyspeptic symptoms of patients with FD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="material|methods" id="S0002"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="S20003"><title>Patients</title><p>This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Ardabil University of Medical Sciences. This was a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled study.

Physical examination and laboratory tests (complete blood cell count, renal and liver function, fasting blood glucose, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate) were carried out at baseline and showed normal results, excluding organic diseases. All studied patients signed an informed consent form and declared their willingness to allow the application of their anonymous data for research purposes.</p></sec><sec id="S20004"><title>Study design</title><p>All of the patients eligible for the study underwent gastroscopy with conscious sedation. Endoscopic samplings were performed with a Pentax EG-2990K Video Gastroscope (Pentax Medical Company, Tokyo, Japan) after overnight fasting, and biopsies were done at one antral site and one corpus site for histological examination (by modified Giemsa staining), and biopsy at another antral site was performed for RUT (Kimberly-Clark, CLO test, Rapid Urease Test Gel, GA 30076-2199 USA). Patients who were positive in both the RUT and histological examination were considered suitable candidates for the proposed <italic>H. pylori</italic> eradication therapy. Patients were blinded to this study and randomly assigned by an independent investigator using a computer-generated random number table to one of the two groups, the treatment group or control group. The allocation ratio was 1 : 1.</p><p>Given that the best results of <italic>H. pylori</italic> eradication in Iran are obtained with 2 weeks of furazolidone-based quadruple therapy or clarithromycin-based quadruple therapy [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], patients in the treatment group were administered with omeprazole, 20 mg twice daily; amoxicillin, 1000 mg twice daily; bismuth subcitrate, 240 mg twice daily and clarithromycin, 500 mg twice daily for 14 days. Patients in the control group were administered with placebo antibiotics for 2 week. The placebo consisted of similar-looking capsules as the treatment drugs. Neither the investigators nor the patients were aware of the treatment assignments. The patients returned 6 weeks and 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after the cessation of treatment. <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> eradication was evaluated by <sup>13</sup>C-urea breath test (UBiT-IR300; Otsuka Electronics, Osaka, Japan), at least 4 weeks after the completion of treatment.

However, studies have not found an association between <italic>H. pylori</italic> and abnormal gastric motor function in patients with FD [<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Many studies have tried to show increased prevalence of <italic>H. pylori</italic> in patients with FD, but the results have been conflicting. Based on the hypothesis that <italic>H. pylori</italic> has a role in FD, the infection should be more frequent in patients with dyspepsia. Indeed, many epidemiological studies have tried to show such higher prevalence, but the results have been conflicting. In a population-based study of <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection, the results seem to support a role of <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection in dyspeptic symptoms [<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Dyspeptic symptoms were reported by 44% of the evaluated population. The prevalence of <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection, evaluated using the urea breath test (UBT), was 72% in individuals reporting dyspeptic symptoms and 64% in the asymptomatic population (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.005). The prevalence of <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection was significantly higher in dyspeptic than in asymptomatic individuals [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>The symptomatic benefit of eradicating <italic>H. pylori</italic> in patients with non-ulcer dyspepsia may be related to the background prevalence of <italic>H. pylori</italic>-related ulcer disease in the population being studied. Northern Ireland, southern Ireland, and Scotland have high prevalence of <italic>H. pylori</italic>-related ulcer disease. Studies in each of these countries have shown a symptomatic benefit of eradicating <italic>H. pylori</italic> in patients with normal endoscopic findings. Because of geographic and national differences in the causes of both ulcer disease and non-ulcer dyspepsia, treatment that is beneficial in one country may be ineffective in another [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. A meta-analysis of randomized controlled studies with 12-month follow-up found that <italic>H. pylori</italic> eradication therapy is associated with improvement of dyspeptic symptoms in patients with FD, which is consistently demonstrated in the Asian (OR = 1.54; 95% CI: 1.07&#x02013;2.21), European (OR = 1.49; 95% CI: 1.10&#x02013;2.02), and American (OR = 1.43; 95% CI: 1.12&#x02013;1.83) populations [<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>In 1998, Blum <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] conducted a double-blind, multicenter trial of patients with <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection and dyspeptic symptoms. Patients were randomly assigned to seven days of treatment with omeprazole, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin or with omeprazole alone and then followed up for 1 year. After 12 months, gastritis had healed in 75% of the patients in the group given omeprazole and antibiotics and in 3% of the patients in the omeprazole group (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001); the respective rates of <italic>H. pylori</italic> eradication were 79% and 2%. In the group given omeprazole and antibiotics, the rate of treatment success among patients with persistent <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection was similar to that among patients in whom the infection was eradicated (26% vs. 31%). There were no significant differences between the groups in the quality of life after treatment. They concluded that in patients with non-ulcer dyspepsia, the eradication of <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection is not likely to relieve symptoms [<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>In 1999, Talley <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] studied the effect of <italic>H. pylori</italic> eradication in patients with non-ulcer dyspepsia. They randomly assigned 170 <italic>H. pylori</italic>-infected patients with non-ulcer dyspepsia to receive twice-daily treatment with omeprazole, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin for 14 days and 167 such patients to receive identical-appearing placebos; all patients were then followed through regular visits for 12 months. At 12 months, there was no significant difference between groups in the rate of successful treatment (46% in the active-treatment group and 50% in the placebo group; <italic>p</italic> = 0.56). There was also no significant difference in the rate of successful treatment at 12 months between patients who were <italic>H. pylori</italic>-negative and those who were <italic>H. pylori</italic>-positive (48% vs. 49%). The rates of successful treatment were also similar when patients were analyzed according to the type of dyspepsia (ulcer-like, reflux-like, or dysmotility-like) and changes in the quality of life. There was no significant association between treatment success and histologic improvement in chronic gastritis at 12 months (<italic>p</italic> = 0.68). They found no evidence that curing <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection in patients with non-ulcer dyspepsia leads to relief of symptoms [<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In the same year, Talley <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] conducted a multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (ORCHID study) of 278 patients infected with <italic>H. pylori</italic> who had FD. <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> was eradicated in 85% in the treatment group and 4% in the placebo group. At 12 months follow-up there was no significant difference between the proportion of patients treated successfully by intention to treat in the eradication arm (24%, 95% confidence interval 17% to 32%) and the proportion of patients treated successfully by intention to treat in the placebo group (22%, 15% to 30%). Changes in symptom scores and quality of life did not significantly differ between the treatment and placebo groups [<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>The inflammatory response induced by <italic>H. pylori</italic> may lower the discomfort threshold to gastric distension by causing alterations in the enteric or central nervous system [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, in at least one study, <italic>H. pylori</italic> positive and negative patients with FD had no difference in the perception of mechanically induced gastric distension [<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. There is evidence from randomized controlled trials that eradication of <italic>H. pylori</italic> results in relief of dyspepsia in a minority of patients. However, studies have failed to establish a temporal relationship between <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection and FD, or the association of <italic>H. pylori</italic> with a specific symptom complex [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Therefore, relief of dyspepsia may reflect other factors such as cure of unrecognized peptic ulcer disease in patients misdiagnosed with FD.</p><p>Previous double-blind, randomized studies performed elsewhere in the world have shown a significant benefit in that direction. In 1998, McColl <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] performed a randomized, placebo-controlled trial comparing the efficacy of treatment for 2 weeks with omeprazole, amoxicillin, and metronidazole (160 patients) with that of omeprazole alone (158 patients) for resolving symptoms of dyspepsia in patients with <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection but no evidence of ulcer disease on upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. One month after the completion of treatment, 88% of the group assigned to receive omeprazole and antibiotics had a negative test for <italic>H. pylori</italic>, as compared with 5% of the group assigned to receive omeprazole alone. One year later, dyspepsia had resolved in 21% of the group given omeprazole and antibiotics, as compared with 7% of the group given omeprazole alone (95% confidence interval for the difference, 7 to 22%; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). Among the patients in the group given omeprazole and antibiotics, the symptoms resolved in 27% who had had symptoms for 5 years or less, as compared with 12% who had had symptoms for more than 5 years (<italic>p</italic> = 0.03). They concluded that in patients with <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection and non-ulcer, or functional, dyspepsia, treatment with omeprazole and antibiotics to eradicate the infection is more likely to resolve symptoms than treatment with omeprazole alone [<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>A systematic review of 17 randomized controlled trials included 3566 patients with functional dyspepsia. Eradication of <italic>H. pylori</italic> was associated with a small but significant benefit, with treatment of 14 patients needed to cure 1 case of functional dyspepsia (relative risk reduction (RRR) = 10%, 95% CI: 6&#x02013;14) [<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In a subsequent randomized control trial, 404 patients with functional dyspepsia and <italic>H. pylori</italic> were randomized to treatment of <italic>H. pylori</italic> or placebo [<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. At 12-month follow-up, patients treated with <italic>H. pylori</italic> eradication therapy were significantly more likely to have symptomatic improvement as compared with controls (49% vs. 36%) [<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>Another possibility for evaluating the role of <italic>H. pylori</italic> in FD is to consider symptom improvement resulting from cure of both the infection and associated inflammation of the gastric mucosa after eradication treatment [<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Functional dyspepsia treatment trials, due to suboptimal design or unclear presentation of data, have rarely been able to provide unequivocal evidence of the efficacy of a given treatment. Based on a systematic overview of published studies, Veldhuyzen van Zanten <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] evaluated drug treatment of patients with FD (including <italic>H. pylori</italic> positive individuals) and provided guidelines for future trials. Fifty-two eligible studies were evaluated. Many studies suffered from important weaknesses in study design and execution. Only 5 studies used previously validated outcome measures. They concluded that because of suboptimal design and/or unclear presentation of the data, none of the trials provided unequivocal evidence that there is efficacious therapy for the treatment of FD [<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Of the 16 trials included in the analysis by Talley, eight indicated that <italic>H. pylori</italic> eradication treatment had a beneficial effect on FD, but the other eight studies did not show any important benefit [<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>In conclusion, in this study, we assessed the clinical benefits of the eradication of <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection in patients with FD. The results of our study provide no evidence that <italic>H. pylori</italic> eradication leads to relief of symptoms 12 months after treatment, and there is a need for further studies.</p></sec></body><back><sec id="S0009"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>The authors declare no conflict of interest.</p></sec><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="CIT0001"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Tack</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Talley</surname><given-names>NJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Camilleri</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Functional gastroduodenal disorders</article-title><source>Gastroenterology</source><year>2006</year><volume>130</volume><fpage>1466</fpage><lpage>79</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16678560</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CIT0002"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Mahadeva</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Goh</surname><given-names>KL</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Epidemiology of functional dyspepsia: a global perspective</article-title><source>World J Gastroenterol</source><year>2006</year><volume>12</volume><fpage>2661</fpage><lpage>6</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16718749</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CIT0003"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Talley</surname><given-names>NJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>American Gastroenterological Association.
