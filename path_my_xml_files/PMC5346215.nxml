The majority of cases are detected at a late stage when prognosis is poor. The EarlyCDT&#x000ae;-Lung Test detects autoantibodies to abnormal cell surface proteins in the earliest stages of the disease which may allow tumour detection at an earlier stage thus altering prognosis.</p><p>The primary research question is: Does using the EarlyCDT&#x000ae;-Lung Test to identify those at high risk of lung cancer, followed by X-ray and computed tomography (CT) scanning, reduce the incidence of patients with late-stage lung cancer (III &#x00026; IV) or unclassified presentation (U) at diagnosis, compared to standard practice?</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A randomised controlled trial of 12 000 participants in areas of Scotland targeting general practices serving patients in the most deprived quintile of the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation. Adults aged 50&#x02013;75 who are at high risk of lung cancer and healthy enough to undergo potentially curative therapy (Performance Status 0&#x02013;2) are eligible to participate. The intervention is the EarlyCDT&#x000ae;-Lung Test, followed by X-ray and CT in those with a positive result. The comparator is standard clinical practice in the UK. The primary outcome is the difference, after 24&#x000a0;months, between the rates of patients with stage III, IV or unclassified lung cancer at diagnosis. The secondary outcomes include: all-cause mortality; disease specific mortality; a range of morbidity outcomes; cost-effectiveness and measures examining the psychological and behavioural consequences of screening.</p><p>Participants with a positive test result but for whom the CT scan does not lead to a lung cancer diagnosis will be offered 6 monthly thoracic CTs for 24&#x000a0;months. An initial chest X-ray will be used to determine the speed and the need for contrast in the first screening CT. Participants who are found to have lung cancer will be followed-up to assess both time to diagnosis and stage of disease at diagnosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The study will determine the clinical and cost effectiveness of EarlyCDT&#x000ae;-Lung Test for early lung cancer detection and assess its suitability for a large-scale, accredited screening service. The study will also assess the potential psychological and behavioural harms arising from false positive or false negative results, as well as the potential benefits to patients of true negative EarlyCDT lung test results. A cost-effectiveness model of lung cancer screening based on the results of the EarlyCDT Lung Test study will be developed.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>

It is often diagnosed at an advanced stage with 85% of patients undiagnosed until the disease is symptomatic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Scotland has one of the highest rates of lung cancer in the world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Around 2 460 men and 2 340 women are diagnosed with lung cancer in Scotland every year, which is 16% of the total UK cases, despite Scotland having only 8% of the UK&#x02019;s population. Survival from lung cancer is poor with less than 9% of patients still alive at 5&#x000a0;years after diagnosis, due primarily to the late stage of presentation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Early detection and diagnosis of cancer improves prognosis - the current 5-years survival rate is approximately 60% for stage I lung cancer but is only 1% for those with stage IV disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>The first studies evaluating screening for lung cancer utilised chest X-ray and/or sputum cytology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. While these showed increased numbers of earlier-stage, resectable cancers and improved survival rates in the screened groups, not all studies were randomised. The lack of trial strength data means that differences in lung cancer mortality between those screened and those not are difficult to interpret.</p><p>The National Cancer Institute National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) reported that CT screening reduced lung cancer mortality by 20% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. This has led to a number of guidelines in the United States which advocate lung cancer screening with low dose CT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However as a primary screening modality CT is expensive and leads to a significant percentage of false positives (&#x0003e;90% of nodules are found to be benign) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. There was a substantial increase in morbidity associated with further investigation. More recently the UK Lung Cancer Screening Trial reported successful early detection of lung cancer using low dose CT scans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>The EarlyCDT&#x000ae;-Lung Test is a novel Autoantibody(AAB) diagnostic test for the early detection of lung cancer allowing stratification of individuals according to their risk of developing lung cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. This could permit a targeted approach to CT scanning for early lung cancer detection which may be a more cost-effective and potentially less harmful approach to population screening.</p><p>The EarlyCDT&#x000ae;-Lung Test measures seven AABs; p53, NY-ESO-1, CAGE, GBU4-5, HuD, MAGE A4 &#x00026; SOX2. It identifies 41% of lung cancers with a high specificity of 90% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. This compares to CT scanning, which when used alone as a prevalence screening test, identifies 67% of lung cancers developing over the following 12&#x000a0;months, but has a low specificity of around 49% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The autoantibodies detected in the test have not been shown to vary with age, gender and ethnicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>In a large group of patients (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;3 376) with newly diagnosed lung cancers there was no difference in positivity rate for the test in early or late stage disease lung cancers, and this applied to all lung cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Thus, while autoantibodies are present in early stage they are not simply a biomarker of early stage disease. While preliminary data shows promise there is insufficient evidence, as yet, to support the introduction of this test for cancer screening or a case finding program.</p><p>Consequently, the primary research question is: &#x02018;Does using the EarlyCDT&#x000ae;-Lung Test, followed by X-ray and CT scanning, to identify those at high risk of lung cancer reduce the incidence of patients with late-stage lung cancer (III &#x00026; IV) or unclassified presentation (U) at diagnosis, compared to standard clinical practice?</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>AIMS</title><p>To assess the effectiveness of the test in increasing early stage lung cancer detection, thereby reducing the rate of late stage (III/IV/U) presentation compared to standard practice; to assess the cost-effectiveness of the test compared to standard practice; to assess the impact of the test on quality of life, positive and negative affect, illness perceptions, lung cancer risk perception, health anxiety, lung cancer worry, subjective stress related to screening, smoking behaviour and health service use.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Design</title><p>This is a randomised controlled trial involving 12,000 participants recruited through primary care and community based recruitment strategies in Scotland.&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;h3&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;Setting.</p><p>General practices who serve patients in the lowest quintile of deprivation in Scotland, as measured by the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation, will be targeted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].

For participants randomised to the intervention arm the EarlyCDT&#x000ae;-Lung test will be performed and patients followed up according to their result (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: study flowchart).</p><p>At the initial visit, participants are told that those with a positive EarlyCDT&#x000ae;-Lung Test result will be invited to a follow-up visit to discuss the test results and explain what happens next. Those with a negative EarlyCDT&#x000ae;-Lung Test result will receive a letter explaining the test results and will be offered a follow-up visit or a telephone call if they wish.

These will be offered a chest X-ray in accordance with local requirements for prioritisation and will be referred for a non-contrast thoracic CT scan. If there is a suspicious opacity on the chest X-ray or initial CT scan a contrast enhanced staging CT will be undertaken. As a quality control measure no participant undergoing CT screening in the test positive arm will have all their 5 CTs reported by same radiologist. Nodule size will be currently reported as the mean of 2 diameters at 90&#x000b0; angles, volumetric analysis is starting soon on both sites with diameter and volume to be reported. If the initial CT scan reveals no evidence of lung cancer then subsequent CT scans will be offered 6 monthly for 24&#x000a0;months. An appointment window of&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;4&#x000a0;weeks will be initiated for each scheduled CT scan.</p><p>If a test positive participant has had a chest X-ray in the previous 1&#x000a0;month, or a CT scan in the previous 3&#x000a0;months, these can be reviewed as part of the study. With the participant&#x02019;s consent chest X-rays or CT scans prior to study entry will be retrospectively coded. The participant will proceed to have the series of up to 5 CTs.</p><p>Participants will receive appointments via post/email, according to patient preference. Participants will be called 2&#x02013;4 days before each CT scan appointment. Individuals with abnormalities as classified by the radiology/respiratory physician&#x02019;s study panel on baseline CT scan or subsequent CT scan will be followed up over the study period or referred for NHS clinical care as appropriate. All individuals entering the study will be flagged and followed-up via the Scottish Cancer Registry in the Electronic Data Research and Innovation Service (eDRIS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Participants who develop lung cancer will be followed-up via their medical records to assess both time to diagnosis and stage of disease at diagnosis. If no histological stage is available, stage will be assessed by a panel of three respiratory physicians blind to allocation status of the study subjects from chest X-rays or CT, or if no imaging is available, medical assessment of stage will be carried out.</p><p>Prior to sending CT scan appointment dates, the Scottish Community Health Index national register will be checked for vital status. All participants in the test- Positive test groups known to have died will be removed from the CT scan appointment schedule register. If patients (positive test) fail to attend for any imaging assessment during the study, they will receive two reminders (one letter, one phone call). On the third non-attendance, a letter will be sent to the participant&#x02019;s GP to inform them of non-attendance.</p><p>Participants will receive results letters in relation to their initial chest X-ray and CT scan and subsequent CT scans.

Deprivation is associated with a significantly higher risk of lung cancer. Living in the most deprived quintile is associated with an increased risk of 1.8 times compared to the middle quintile of deprivation; this gives an estimated annual lung cancer rate of 336/100,000 among the practices taking part in the study. A high risk group within this population will be selected using similar entry criteria (outlined above) as the Mayo screening study which had a 2% prevalence rate of lung cancer and a further 2% incidence rate over the following 5&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The baseline rate of late stage presentation for the particular high risk population envisaged in this study is uncertain, as is the size of the reduction in late stage presentation likely to be achieved through use of EarlyCDT&#x000ae;-Lung Test. Using an estimated late stage presentation rate of 1,200/100,000 per year in the control arm i.e. 2.4% over the 2-years follow-up period, provides 85% power at 5% significance (two-sided) to detect an estimated reduction of 35% in late stage presentation rate in the intervention arm i.e. as low as 780/100,000 per year or 1.56% over the 2-years follow-up period. This corresponds to an estimated event rate over the 24&#x000a0;months of follow-up of 120 events in the control arm and 78 events in the intervention arm and implies a required sample size of 5,000 per arm i.e. a total of 10,000 participants.</p><p>The anticipated 35% reduction in event rate between the control arm and the intervention arm was justified by current estimates of the capability of the test to identify cases together with current estimates of the sensitivity of CT scanning (67%). The assumed event rate in the study participants of 1.2% per year was an estimate and the sample size would be modified if the observed event rate proves to be markedly different, acknowledging the a priori possibility that we will employ a prospective adaptive design. No Interim analysis of efficacy is planned.</p><p>The sample size calculations are based upon standard methods for time to event data using the c power function in R and st power exponential procedure in Stata and assuming exponential survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. They were also confirmed using standard approaches for detecting a change in binomial probabilities, and confirmed using approaches to detect a change in Poisson rates (with essentially identical results as loss to follow up is expected to be low due to completeness of Scottish Morbidity Register data).</p><p>The study aims for a short recruitment period and so no allowance has been made for accrual. With such an allowance, say to 1&#x000a0;year, the power will increase to 91% to identify a 35% reduction provided the minimum follow up period of 2&#x000a0;years is observed.</p><p>The initial assumptions of the rate of late stage presentation rate of 1,200/100,000 per year among the study participants was too optimistic and in January to May 2015 investigations were carried out to inform an increase in the sample size. Baseline information on the 8639 participants recruited to March 2015 (18&#x000a0;months from first randomisation) was used to derive an estimate of lung cancer risk based upon the Spitz Model. A number of variables in this model were not recorded in the study data base and low risk values were used in the risk calculation implying that the risk estimates should be underestimates. This suggested that the with 10,000 participants the rate of lung cancer would be expected to be around 680/100,000 and 540/100,000 for stage T3/T4/Unknown lung cancer using ISD cancer statistics figures of 80% lung cancers in Scotland are late stage. A sensitivity analysis around the missing data assumptions suggests that a late stage rate of around 600/100,000 may not be unreasonable, though is likely to be at the upper limit.</p><p>Using an assumption of 600/100,000 for late stage lung cancer, increasing the sample size to 12,000 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], and acknowledging that recruitment is over a 2&#x000a0;years period the study has a power of 80% to detect a 35% reduction associated with the use of the EarlyCDT-Lung test to identify cases, provided that analysis takes place after all randomised patients have been followed up for 2&#x000a0;years. While an 80% power is at the lower end of acceptable powers this is the power level which has been used in a number of lung cancer screening trials.</p><p>The power of the study is sensitive to the assumptions about the rate of late stage cancer and the recruitment rate. A power in excess of 90% could only realistically be achieved by recruiting 15,000 patients or by changing the primary endpoint to 3&#x000a0;years post randomisation for all patients. If the recruitment phase extends past 2&#x02013;2.5&#x000a0;years to recruit 12,000 participants then the power will increase slightly to 83%.</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Substudies</title><p>For the follow-up analysis of behavioral and psychological outcomes, 200 participants in each group (test-positive, test-negative and the control arm) will allow detection of a mean difference of 3.00 (SD 15.04 (unpublished data comparing pre and post prostate biopsy scores from the ProtecT prostate cancer study)) in the Impact of Events Scale between baseline and follow up measurements.

Assuming 80% of participants are current smokers, this will provide 80% power at 5% significance level to detect a 13% point difference in the prevalence of smoking between each of the test groups and the control arm (i.e. from 80 to 67%) To allow for attrition, we will recruit 300 participants in each group.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Proposed analyses</title><p>Characteristics of participants will be compared informally between treatment arms at baseline. The main analysis of the primary outcome will be intention-to-treat. Cox proportional hazards models which will be used to estimate the hazard ratio of the rate of late stage lung cancer in the intervention arm compared to the control arm. Participants who are lost to follow up will be censored. The models will adjust for age, gender smoking history, socioeconomic status and practice. If appropriate, random cluster effects will be included rather than fixed effects for practices. A similar methodology will be used for the secondary outcomes of comparisons of mortality rates. A subsequent analysis will compare the outcomes of those with a positive test in comparison to those in the intervention group with a negative test (primary contrast for this analysis) and those in the control group. Comparisons of proportions will be carried out using chi square tests. Fisher&#x02019;s exact test will be used if the number of events is small.</p><p>Psychological and behavioral outcomes will be compared between the three groups (Test-positive, Test-negative and the control group) at baseline using analysis of variance (or non-parametric tests if there is evidence of non-normal distribution of scores) for continuous measures and <italic>&#x003c7;</italic>

A longer term analysis will employ a decision analytic model to link the short term outcomes measured within the trial to potential longer term impacts on health, in terms of impacts on morbidity and mortality of early detection and treatment, to allow the estimation of cost-per Quality Adjusted Life Years gained.

Early diagnosis of treatable disease is likely to be the major way of changing outcomes for the foreseeable future. The study will assess the EarlyCDT&#x000ae;-Lung Test&#x02019;s clinical suitability and cost effectiveness for a large-scale, accredited screening service for early lung cancer detection. It will also assess potential morbidity arising from the test and potential psychological and behavioural harms and benefits of test results.</p><p>The major strength of this trial lies within its design. By being both randomised and controlled many of the inherent biases that affected many of the previous screening studies will be removed. Our trial will also be able to investigate the effect of either a positive or negative result on participants&#x02019; lifestyle decisions to explore whether a negative result reinforces harmful behaviour, such as smoking, or a positive result reduces harmful behaviour. To date, screening with low dose CT scanning does not appear to have a beneficial effect on smoking behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. As in many screening studies a potential weakness is that the study population may be different to the usual clinical populations in terms of age, smoking status and education. Our eligibility criteria ensure participants have a high risk of lung cancer over the subsequent 24&#x000a0;months and our findings should be generalisable to populations with a similar level of risk. Our focus on areas with high levels of deprivation for recruitment should help ensure our participants reflect the social gradient in lung cancer incidence and our collection of demographic data will enable us to compare the characteristics of our trial population with those at risk of lung cancer.</p><p>One potential weakness is that participants randomised to the control arm may change their behaviour to decrease their risk of lung cancer e.g. by stopping smoking in a way that they would not have done had they not been participating in our study. The lack of impact of screening using CT scanning on smoking behaviour suggests this may not occur to an important extent, but measurement of smoking behaviour at repeated follow up time points will enable us to quantify this and assess its impact on our findings.</p><sec id="Sec35"><title>Trial status</title><p>Recruitment began the 7<sup>th</sup> of August 2013.</p></sec></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec36"><title>Additional file</title><p>
