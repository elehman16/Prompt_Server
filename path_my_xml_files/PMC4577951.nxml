<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p><p>The 2011 European School Survey Project on Alcohol and Other Drugs report revealed that a higher percentage of 16-year-old pupils from Germany claimed to have smoked in the past 30&#x02005;days (33%) than pupils from Denmark (24%), Greece (21%) and Sweden (21%).<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Additionally, the use of water pipes has increased in the past few years in German adolescents and was described to have similarly deleterious effects on human health.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>A popular school-based tobacco prevention programme, which has been implemented in many countries in the European Union, is the Smoke-free Class Competition (called &#x02018;Be Smart Don't Start&#x02019;) in Germany.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6&#x02013;8</xref> However, a Cochrane systematic review from 2012 concluded that this programme was not effective for primary or secondary smoking prevention in adolescents.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><p>Less popular secondary school programmes that involve physicians as health educators have already been evaluated showing significantly positive effects.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> However, they are not broadly available.</p><p>Recent studies from prestigious international and national medical faculties indicate that tobacco addiction is drastically undertreated by physicians in comparison with other chronic conditions, mainly because of lack of motivation, skills and knowledge.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11&#x02013;13</xref> Novel ways of engagement of prospective physicians were demanded.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> A key advantage of the Education Against Tobacco (EAT) programme is that medical students learn to take tobacco-related responsibilities in their role as health educators in schools and to discuss tobacco-associated diseases in an understandable way. These aspects facilitate school-based prevention and also provide education for cooperative decision-making in inpatient settings.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> The multinational programme EAT is currently enrolled in over 40 medical schools in Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Uruguay, Pakistan, Sudan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bangladesh and the USA.</p><p>The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of the school-based EAT intervention in smoking initiation prevention and smoking cessation in Germany.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> The primary end point was the difference from t1 to t2 of the smoking prevalence in the intervention group versus the difference from t1 to t2 in the control group (difference of differences approach).<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> In addition, we aimed to assess whether the programme is equally effective for participants of different gender, social and cultural backgrounds.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Design</title><p>As defined in our protocol, the survey was designed as a quasi-experimental prospective evaluative study with two measurements (baseline and 6&#x02005;months postintervention).<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> The period of data collection was October 2013 to July 2014. Participants in the two study groups (intervention and control groups) were questioned up to 2&#x02005;weeks in advance of the intervention (t1) and 6&#x02005;months thereafter (t2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2015008093F1">figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="BMJOPEN2015008093F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Study design.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen2015008093f01"/></fig><p>Randomisation was impossible as schools refused to participate when informed that intervention classes would be randomly externally selected. Thus, we asked the participating schools in advance to split their grades themselves into two class groups (intervention vs control classes) with the same performance levels (parallel classes). All intervention classes in our sample had parallel classes.</p><sec id="s2a1"><title>Participants</title><p>A total of 1689 eligible secondary school students from eight eligible schools were recruited from November 2012 to October 2013. All participants fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Students aged 10&#x02013;15&#x02005;years attending grades 6&#x02013;8 of a secondary general, intermediate, grammar or comprehensive school were eligible.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Baseline data of 1474 participants were collected from October 2013 to January 2014. Follow-up data were collected from April to July 2014. In total, 1200 participants provided data at both time points (t1+t2) that were used for analysis. The loss to follow-up effect was 18.6% (N=274; intervention group: 9.0%=132; control group: 9.6%=142).</p></sec><sec id="s2a2"><title>Attrition analysis</title><p>The participants who dropped out at follow-up (t2) were analysed with logistic regression analysis and showed no systematic bias with regard to the interaction between study group and smoking status (p=0.19) or study group and gender (p=0.725) or study group and school type (p=0.082). However, it showed a systematic bias for study group and age (p=0.045; OR=0.709; 95% CI 0.51 to 0.99), meaning that significantly more young people dropped out of the intervention group versus the control group.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Intervention</title><p>The intervention consisted of two interactive 60&#x02005;min modules. The first part was presented by 2&#x02013;6 medical students and a patient with a tobacco-related disease to all pupils at the same time inside a large room within the school. It consisted of a PowerPoint (Microsoft; Redmond, Washington, USA) presentation in which the participants were encouraged to make their own well-informed decisions (social competence approach). The university hospital patient with a smoking-related disease was interviewed about his reasons for starting to smoke and the influence tobacco consumption had on his life. Again, the students were encouraged to ask the patient their own questions.</p><p>The second part took place in an interactive classroom setting in which two medical students (usually a man and a woman) tutored one class. As reported in our study protocol, both modules focused on educating adolescents about the strategies of the tobacco industry to influence their decision in a non-objective manner (social influence) and on peer pressure (social influence), decision-making and skills for coping with challenges in their life in a healthy way (social competence).<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> The participants also discussed information relevant for their age group, for example, why non-smokers usually look more attractive, have more money to buy things, or succeed in sports. The programme focused on not scaring but educating its participants in an interactive manner. Accordingly, EAT used a combined social influence and social competence approach, which has been described as the most effective approach in the recently published Cochrane review.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Data collection</title><p>We used a paper-and-pencil survey questionnaire that was developed to collect data in the classroom via the class teachers at both time points (t1 and t2).<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> In addition to the sociodemographic data (age, gender, school type), it captured the smoking status of the school students concerning water pipe use and cigarette consumption.</p><p>The questionnaire contained numerous items that have already been included in similar investigations. The questions about the smoking status and the frequency of smoking referred to the evaluation of the school-based smoking prevention programmes in Heidelberg titled &#x02018;ohne kippe&#x02019; (no butts) and in Berlin titled &#x02018;Students in the Hospital&#x02019;, as well as to the results of the German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents published by Lampert and Thamm.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>

To maximise the confidentiality of the intervention, the questionnaires were placed in envelopes that were instantly sealed and cosigned by the responsible class teachers immediately after completion. The envelopes were shipped to the Goethe University of Frankfurt where they were opened and the data entry and analysis was performed under the supervision of two of the authors (DAG and DK).</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Outcomes</title><p>The primary end point was the difference from t1 to t2 of the smoking prevalence in the control group versus the difference from t1 to t2 in the intervention group (difference of differences approach). The percentages of former smokers and new smokers in the two groups were studied as secondary outcome measures. A smoker was defined as a pupil who claimed to smoke at least &#x02018;once a month&#x02019; within the survey. Non-smokers were defined as pupils who claimed to smoke less than &#x02018;once a month&#x02019; within the survey.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>To examine baseline differences, we used &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> tests (categorical variables) and Student t tests (continuous variables). The effects of predictors (gender, culture and social characteristics) of smoking cessation were calculated by robust panel logistic regression analysis. The significance level was 5% for Student t tests (double-sided) and 95% for CIs (double-sided). Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS Statistics V.23 by IBM (Armonk, USA) and STATA 14 by StataCorp (Texas, USA). In our sample, the group allocation was not on the individual level but on the class level. In order to take into account this clustering statistically, we used robust panel logistic regression (xtlogit procedure with vce(cluster) option). This procedure was also used to calculate the difference from t1 to t2 of the smoking prevalence in the control group versus the difference from t1 to t2 in the intervention group (our primary end point) with the help of STATA 14 by StataCorp (Texas, USA).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Legal approval</title><p>In accordance with Good Epidemiologic Practice guidelines, an ethics waiver and all legal permissions were obtained from the responsible institutions before data collection started as described in our study protocol.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>

<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> In this study, we report a significant effect to reduce smoking prevalence of a widespread intervention delivered by volunteer medical students to secondary school students (11&#x02013;15&#x02005;years); at 6&#x02005;months of follow-up, the OR was 5.63 to stop smoking in the intervention versus the control group (CI 2.01 to 15.79; p&#x0003c;0.01). To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first evaluation of a medical-student-delivered school-based tobacco intervention.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Interpretation</title><p>Our data reveal that motivating students to quit smoking using EAT works significantly better at a young age (p&#x0003c;0.01), which suggests that younger smokers are not as addicted as older smokers but are more likely to be in the phase of experimentation. Accordingly, most of the smoking participants in the survey claimed to smoke less than once a day. The participants who started smoking also showed experimentation characteristics (most of them smoking less than once a day). Thus, we hypothesise that in this young age group it may be more difficult to reduce curiosity and to avoid experimentation behaviour in the short term than it is to convince those who have already experimented with cigarettes to stop smoking. This hypothesis is supported by numerous publications addressing this age group, which show no primary preventive effect at half year follow-up with various approaches.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Another explanation for the short-term result of no primary prevention effect can be found within the recent Cochrane review: combined social competence and social influence programmes such as EAT did not show primary preventive effectiveness at less than 1&#x02005;year follow-up within the meta analysis.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Thus, our intervention might also show a primary preventive effect at longer follow-up. In addition, we hypothesise that the effect on reducing smoking prevalence in the intervention group would have been larger in a randomised experimental setting as we found two biases both potentially shrinking the effect of the intervention (see below).</p><p>The implementation of cost-effective measures to prevent smoking in adolescents and, moreover, the sensitisation of prospective physicians to tobacco-attributable diseases, tobacco prevention and improved communication of these issues in medicine is addressed by our programme.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>

The teachers probably insisted on choosing classes at higher risk for smoking as intervention classes, which is also illustrated by a significantly higher number of pupils visiting classes with a lower education level within the intervention group (p&#x0003c;0.01), as smoking correlates with low education.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Accordingly, our robust panel logistic regression analysis on our prospective smoker subgroup revealed that students from comprehensive schools have a significantly lower likelihood of quitting smoking (p=0.03). Since young age is also a significant predictor of quitting in our sample (p&#x0003c;0.01), the reported attrition bias showing that systematically more young students dropped out in our intervention group (p=0.045) might have lowered the effect of the intervention. Thus, we report two systemic biases in our quasi-experimental design considering age (attrition bias; p=0.045) and school type (selection bias; significantly more comprehensive school students and less grammar school students in our intervention group at baseline; p&#x0003c;0.01), both of which rather decrease the measured effect in reducing smoking prevalence of the intervention. In addition, cluster effects could not be excluded because the intervention and control groups attended the same schools.</p><p>Our study relies on self-reports obtained from adolescents via questionnaire; therefore, there is a risk that the actual prevalence of smoking may be different from the reported prevalence, possibly because of social desirability bias. This bias could only be excluded by using expensive methods such as testing for cotinine (a metabolite of nicotine) in the saliva, blood or urine of the students. However, recent publications indicate that self-reports via questionnaire are relatively precise in tobacco research excluding pregnant women and patients with tobacco-related diseases.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Generalisation</title><p>The participants came from the two most prevalent German school types (comprehensive and grammar schools), which makes our results transferable to the majority of German students in the age group 11&#x02013;15&#x02005;years.

It is enrolled in over 40 medical schools in Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Uruguay, Pakistan, Sudan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bangladesh and the USA.
