Chest computed tomography (CT) is superior to conventional chest radiography for detecting lesions and determining their position and qualitative aspects, making it the prime choice for lesion detection. However, the radiation associated with the process is becoming a problem. The ICRP advocates the principle of &#x0201c;as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA),&#x0201d; which requires CT examination be on the premise of image quality to meet the demand of diagnosis as far as possible to reduce the radiation dose.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup> Previously, the chest low-dose scanning techniques mainly used a fixed pipe and voltage, low current, and real-time dynamic exposure dose to regulate the tube current, but methods to further reduce the radiation dose are being studied. The CARE kV technique combined with iterative reconstruction is a new technique with lower radiation dose that the conventional techniques, which has attracted the attention of medical radiation workers. In this paper, we discuss the application of the CARE kV technique combined with iterative reconstruction to chest CT scanning for health examination patients.</p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><label>2.1</label><title>General information</title><p>A total of 130 patients suspected with chest disease undergoing a chest CT examination from Dec, 2012 to April, 2013 in our hospital were randomized into two groups: the experimental group and control group.

Artifacts, calcification, and other regions of interference were excluded. The measurement area was &#x0223c;60 mm<sup>2</sup>; hence, each ROI area was set at the maximum and location was equal.

Currently, dose-reduction includes the use of real-time dynamic exposure dose adjustment tube current, fixed low tube voltage, fix low tube current, and big pitch heart switch control technology, which lower the radiation dose in different levels.<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> CARE kV technology and SAFIRE iterative reconstruction&#x02014;new methods to reduce radiation dose&#x02014;are breaking new ground for radiation dose control.</p><p>CARE kV technology can automatically lower the radiation dose by setting conditions corresponding to the areas and purpose of different settings, which in turn can be used to set the standard quality reference voltage according to the image quality. CARE kV technology can automatically calculate the reference values and variation curve for different tube voltages according to the automatically defined body type, calculate the CTDIvol, compare, vary the tube voltage from low to high, and chose the lowest voltage scanning if CT ball pipe system hardware is allowed.<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> To guarantee and improve the image quality, a constant or increased CNR as the standard in CARE kV technology must be used to lower the tube voltage and increase the tube current simultaneously. Reduction of the tube voltage will result in an increased photoelectric effect of x-rays on patients, which will increase the absorption by organs with different densities, especially tissues with a high atomic number will increase the contrast of blood vessels and the CT values of image, significantly reduce the radiation dose, and improve the image quality.<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> Winklehne et al<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> scanned the head and chest of which body mass index (BMI) in the same level using CARE kV scanning technology. Their results showed that the contrast of the image increased by 21%, the CNR increased by 17.3% without the increase of image noise of background. Meanwhile, the radiation dose reduced by 58% and 25.3%. Although lowering the tube voltage can significantly reduce the radiation dose, a low tube voltage reduces x-ray penetration; hence, fewer photons reach the detector, which results in increased image noise. In order to reduce the image artifacts caused by noise, which can affect the image density resolution, this study combined CARE kV scanning technology with the SAFIRE iterative reconstruction technique. SAFIRE iterative reconstruction technology uses a support noise model of the original data, which can be applied into the image noise and inhibit and eliminate it in each iteration. The image is a combination of iterative reconstructions; hence, the technique can improve the image quality and reduce the image noise with the potential of reducing the radiation dose.<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> This study used CARE kV scanning technology for the chest scanning, but SAFIRE iterative reconstruction techniques were applied to the experimental group. The SD of the experimental groups is lower than that of the control group and the SNR is higher than that of the control group, indicating that the SAFIRE iterative reconstruction algorithm can reduce the noise level and improve the SNR simultaneously. Furthermore, the CT value and image quality score of the lesions of the experimental group and control group showed no statistical differences. All the image scores were greater than 4.5 points, which meets the diagnosis requirements. The reason for this is that the lung is a gas-filled organ, which results in a tissue natural contrast, and structural differences and overlapping within intrathoracic tissues lead to density distribution, making it a good anatomical basis for CARE kV chest scanning technology.</p><p>The differences in the CTDIvol, DLP, and ED for the experimental group and control group all have statistical significance. The radiation dose with the CTDIvol of the experimental group was &#x0223c;2.01 mGy (38%) less than that of the control group. In the experimental group, all 60 patients were subjected to 100-kV scanning, while the control group did not use CARE kV technology and all 70 patients were subjected to 120-kV scanning, further proving that CARE kV scanning technology can significantly reduce the radiation dose.</p><p>In conclusion, in chest CT scanning of health examination patients, CARE kV scanning technology alone will cause increased noise and reduced SNR, and scanning dose reduction without improving the algorithm may lead to diagnostic information loss and enhance increase the risk of incorrect diagnosis. However, SAFIRE iterative reconstruction alone can result in higher quality images with the potential of reducing the radiation dose, even though the reduction it limited. Hence, for chest CT scanning, CARE kV technology combined with SAFIRE iterative reconstruction technology can significantly reduce the radiation dose and improve the image quality, which has potential clinical application.</p><p>However, this study has some limitations. For example, no measurement and analysis of the detailed morphology of lesions and CT value were performed. In addition, the results were not classified according to the features of the lesions. Finally, group studies on the relationship between the BMI and voltage were not included, which needs to be further investigated.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: ALARA = as low as reasonably achievable, BMI = body mass index, CNR = contrast-to-noise ratio, CT = computed tomography, CTDIvol = CT dose index of the volume, DLP = dose length product, ED = effective dose, ICRP = International Commission on Radiological Protection, SAFIRE = sinogram-affirmed iterative reconstruction, SNR = signal-to-noise ratio.</p></fn><fn fn-type="equal"><p>BY and Z-LL contributed equally to this work.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p>Sources of funding: Medical Imaging Department, the First Affiliated Hospital, Kunming Medical University, key subjects for medical imaging</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>[1]</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Slovis</surname><given-names>TL</given-names></name></person-group>
