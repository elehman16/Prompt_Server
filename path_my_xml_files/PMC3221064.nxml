According to Ayurveda health is a combination of a healthy body and mind, the <italic>Atma</italic>, and the <italic>Indriyas</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] In Ayurveda, various psychological conditions like greed, grief, fear, anger, envy, excessive attachment, etc., have been considered to play a role in the precipitation of diseases. It is advised that one must control these emotions (<italic>Manas Bhavas</italic>) or else it may lead to various <italic>Manasika Rogas</italic>. Many such <italic>Manas Bhavas</italic> affect the menopausal woman due to various reasons and lead ultimately to various somatic and psychological disturbances.</p><p>The propagation of the species is a basic aim of nature. In the multiplication of the human race &#x02018;woman has a pivotal role to play.&#x02019; In the fashioning of a woman's bodily structure nature has proved its great capacity and efficiency in a very astonishing manner.</p><p>The phase of &#x02018;menarche&#x02019; and &#x02018;menopause&#x02019; have important influences on the physical, psychological, social, and emotional aspects of a woman. The menopause is a natural phenomenon and one of the life's important milestones. As both menarche and menopause are related to post-birth changes, both should be tackled with the same caution and care; however, sometimes increasing age and diminishing qualities from life make the menopausal condition more difficult to handle in the lack of proper understanding, sound medical advice, and good social support. Not every woman passes through a torrid time during this phase but every female surely knows about the negative changes associated with the onset of the menopause. Hot flushes, lack of energy, vaginal dryness, irregular periods, backache, depression, etc., are some of the symptoms which may accompany this stage due to the changes in hormonal activity. The period of menopause is a time of tremendous changes in lifestyle. These changes may cause loss of equilibrium and discipline in her day-to-day life.</p><p>There has been extensive research on menopause in the West, but in India only a few research institutes have recognized the potential of research on this subject. Being a common and distressing problem, it needs effective and safe treatment. In modern medicine, the management of menopausal syndrome is through hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Often there is spectacular relief from the symptoms of the disease but there is an associated risk of serious side effects such as increased probability of developing breast cancer, uterine cancer, venous thromboembolism, stroke, etc. HRT, however, is not very effective in managing the psychological symptoms associated with menopause. An effort to manage this with long-term use of sedatives, hypnotics, and anxiolytic drugs leads to side effects like drowsiness, impaired motor function, loss of memory, antisocial behavior, allergic reactions, etc. Thus modern science mainly concentrates on tackling the physical problems of menopause, but the psychological aspect is often neglected. Therefore, here we have made an attempt to focus on the other side of the coin, i.e., the psychological aspects of menopause. There is a great scope for research in Ayurveda to find a cure for the management of menopause.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-2"><title>Aims and Objectives</title><p>

Although anatomically there is no difference in the structure of the brain between males and females, the emotional makeup of a female is different; certain <italic>Manobhavas</italic> are peculiarly more common in females, e.g., <italic>Sukumarta, Lajja, Ekanistha, Bhavukta, Vishvasniyata, Sahansheelta, Udarata, Tyaga, Ardrachitta, Bhakti, Dhairya, Moha</italic>, etc.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] Due to this and other factors, females are likely to be affected to a greater extent by any change occurring in their physical or psychological milieu. Hence, she is to be handled with great care and should be helped to sail through any emotional turmoil. During the perimenopause and menopause, emotions can bubble to the surface in a way similar to that seen in the premenstrual syndrome or during the postpartum period. Hence it is very important for a physician to appreciate the psychological state of the female before undertaking the task of managing her menopausal condition.</p><p><italic>Rajonivritti</italic> is a consequence of <italic>Jaraawastha</italic>, and <italic>Vata</italic> is the dominant <italic>Dosha</italic> during this stage; it is therefore very important to understand the interrelationship between <italic>Vata</italic> and <italic>Manas</italic>.

Colloidal gold has a balancing and harmonizing effect on all levels of body, mind, and spirit. It is used to improve mental attitude and emotional states.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] It has been reported to increase energy, will power, mental focus, and libido. According to many studies, colloidal gold increases mental acuity and the ability to concentrate. It may help to combat feelings of depression and inferiority and to calm excitation and states of anger. It is said to alleviate stress and help stabilize emotions. It is thought to be helpful for arthritis and heart and vascular diseases. Hence, it is a very important component of this drug.</p><p>All the drugs in <italic>Saraswatarishta</italic> are different from one another, having different properties and actions, e.g., <italic>Medhya, Balya, Dhatupushtikara Brimhaniya, Jivaniya, Agnivardhaka</italic> etc. The drugs may be adaptogens; antioxidants (minimize oxidation); immunostimulants (which heighten the resistance); antistress; nootropics (which improve higher integrative brain functions like memory learning, thinking, understanding); anabolics (which promote growth); tonics (which mitigate weakness); or may have other geriatric benefits (helping to prevent the diseases of old age).</p><p>In a nutshell, <italic>Saraswatarishta</italic> is believed to comprise antioxidant, nootropic, adaptogenic, immunomodulatory, and intellect-promoting drugs, all of which enhance the <italic>Rasayana</italic> property of this drug.

It was selected in the present context to deal with the psychic problems occurring in menopause. The rationality behind using <italic>Tarpana</italic> or <italic>Snehana</italic> type of treatment in <italic>Manas Vikaras</italic> is that it is the preferred treatment to control <italic>Vayu</italic>, which plays the main role in creating pathology at the level of the psyche.

</p></sec><sec id="sec3-3"><title>Physical effect</title><p>The symptoms like tension, headache, and muscular tension caused due to sustained contraction of skeletal muscles can be relieved by the physical effect of <italic>Shirodhara</italic>. Various muscle stress and stiffness can be relieved by <italic>Shirodhara</italic>. It is well recognized that for relieving this type of tension, oil is the most effective.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-4"><title>Effect on blood supply</title><p>Due to warm effect of the oil used for <italic>Shirodhara</italic> there is local vasodilatation. <italic>Shirodhara</italic> lasts for 45 min; the continuous flow of warm fluid on the forehead for such a long period will cause mild vasodilatation. The region where Shirodhara is performed overlies mainly the cortex arterial branches, venous sinuses, venous reservoir of the brain, the superior sagittal and the cavernous venous sinuses. <italic>Shirodhara</italic> improves the circulation in these areas and helps in regularizing the blood supply of brain.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-5"><title>Effect on central nervous system</title><p>The hypothalamus controls many body activities and is one of the major regulators of homeostasis. Sensory input from the external and internal environments ultimately comes to the hypothalamus via sensory pathways originating in somatic and visceral sense organs. Other important functions include: control of the autonomic nervous system, control of the pituitary gland, control of body temperature , regulation of eating and drinking, regulation of diurnal rhythms and states of consciousness, regulation of emotional and behavioral patterns (acting together with the limbic system), control of corticotrophin releasing hormone (CRH), increasing serotonin concentration in the synaptic cleft, etc. It can be postulated that <italic>Shirodhara</italic> has some effect on the hypothalamus, with resulting relief of most of the psychic and somatic disorders.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-6"><title>Effect on anxiety</title><p>It may decrease anxiety by facilitating the inhibitory presynaptic action of GABA and sedative activities in limbic system.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-7"><title>Effect on depression</title><p><italic>Shirodhara</italic> may have an anti depressant effect like Mono Amine oxidase inhibitors. The enzyme MAO is present intra-cellularly in most of the tissues. Inhibition of the MAO-A decreases the deamination of Nor-Adrenaline (NA) and to a lesser extent of 5-HT which is associated with the antidepressant action. Drugs used in <italic>Shirodhara</italic> may inhibit the reuptake and cause a localized increase in active NA in the synaptic gap.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-8"><title>Effect on endocrine system</title><p>An effect of <italic>Shirodhara</italic> on hormone secretion has also been postulated considering the effect on the hypothalamus (as hypothalamus is the main controller of endocrine secretions, acting through the pituitary gland, i.e., the hypothalamus&#x02013;pituitary axis).</p></sec><sec id="sec3-9"><title>Effect on autonomic nervous system</title><p><italic>Shirodhara</italic> may also have an alpha-adrenergic blocking effect and thus block certain actions of adrenaline and noradrenaline. It may produce moderate inhibition of actions of acetylcholine and 5-hydroxytryptamine. It may have a central depressant action on the hypothalamic center controlling sympathetic activity. It may also act on the catecholamine uptake mechanism, acting as sympathomimetic amine. <italic>Shirodhara</italic> may also act on the adrenergic neurons, probably producing their effects by modifying the synthesis, storage, and uptake mechanisms of noradrenaline.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-10"><title>Effect on Marmas</title><p><italic>Sushruta</italic> regards <italic>Marma</italic> as the seat for the soul, mind, <italic>Vata</italic>, and others (Su.Sha.6/30). Out of the 37 <italic>Marmas</italic> in the supraclavicular region, 23 are situated in the head. Hence, it can be believed to have effects on mainly <italic>Sthapani, Utkshepa, Shankha</italic>, and <italic>Adhipati Marmas. Shirodhara</italic> stimulates these <italic>marmas</italic> and improves their <italic>Pranic</italic> circulation, as the oil used for <italic>Shirodhara</italic> is always warm and therefore causes vasodilatation of all the channels, improving their circulation and thus improves the blood circulation of the brain. As a result there is improvement of the higher intellectual functions, which are related to the hypothalamus, frontal area, etc.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-11"><title>Effect on Chakras</title><p><italic>Chakras</italic> are those regions where there is higher congregation of energy.

Many women experience emotional and spiritual challenges during the menopause &#x02013; a female mid-life crisis &#x02013; that may or may not be due to changing hormone levels, but which needs to be addressed just as urgently. This includes disturbances in <italic>Manas Bhavas</italic> like <italic>Moha, Krodha, Shoka</italic>, etc. All these patients when subjected to the <italic>Panchakarma</italic> procedure <italic>Shirodhara</italic> showed better effect in combating the disturbances of <italic>Manas Bhavas</italic> and the psychic symptoms of menopause. <italic>Saraswatarishta</italic> also showed encouraging results in the associated somatic symptoms also.
