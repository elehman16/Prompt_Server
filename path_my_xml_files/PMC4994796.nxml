Vildagliptin treatment (50 mg qd or bid) for 24 weeks resulted in modest but highly significant reductions in both systolic (2.70 mmHg) and diastolic (1.64 mmHg) BP. Fasting triglycerides (TG), very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol, and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol decreased by 0.2, 0.07, and 0.13 mmol/L, respectively. Similarly, total cholesterol and non-high density lipoprotein (non-HDL) cholesterol decreased by 0.18 and 0.21 mmol/L from baseline, respectively. HDL cholesterol increased by 0.03 mmol/L and weight decreased by 0.48 kg (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-vhrm-12-337">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>A linear regression model was used to analyze the relationship between the aforementioned BP and fasting lipid levels with weight changes, degree of adiposity as assessed by baseline BMI, and degree of insulin resistance as assessed by HOMA-IR.

Total cholesterol, LDL, and non-HDL cholesterol did not correlate with weight change, with or without adjusting for BMI or HOMA-IR. Changes in HDL cholesterol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-vhrm-12-337">Figure 1E</xref>) at 24 weeks relative to changes in weight showed a negative slope of 0.005 (<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup>=0.009; <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001), and this value did not improve by adjusting for BMI and HOMA-IR.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have previously shown that, on an average, weight neutrality is essentially observed at higher baselines with vildagliptin, while a weight loss of ~1 kg was observed in patients with baseline HbA1c &#x0003c;8% (64 mmol/mol).<xref rid="b1-vhrm-12-337" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> The current analysis also demonstrated significant reductions in BP with a favorable fasting lipid profile. The slopes of these parameters versus weight change suggest that these changes are at least partially explained by weight reduction. Because weight reduction is greatest at glycemic levels where patients are most often treated,<xref rid="b1-vhrm-12-337" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> BP and fasting lipid benefits may actually be therapeutically greater than those indicated by the averages in this pooled analysis. There is no mechanistic basis for predicting that similar results would not be seen with other DPP-4 inhibitors.</p><p>Both vildagliptin 50 mg qd or bid are indicated as mono-therapy in many countries and clinical trials were carried out with both dosing frequencies. We have previously shown that when baseline HbA1c levels were below 8% there was no additional HbA1c reduction benefit to the twice daily dosing frequency with monotherapy.<xref rid="b7-vhrm-12-337" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Sixteen percent of the patients in the current analysis were on the 50 mg qd dose; notably the 50 mg qd group was 4 years older and had baseline HbA1c levels 1.2% lower than the 50 mg bid group. Weight loss was greater in the 50 mg qd group (&#x02212;1.2 kg in the 50 mg qd group versus &#x02212;0.4 kg in the 50 mg bid group) as predicted previously by the lower baseline HbA1c and presumably lower degree of glycosuria<xref rid="b1-vhrm-12-337" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> in the 50 mg qd group; the reduction in diastolic BP was ~50% greater and the TG reduction was ~50% lower (from a lower TG baseline of 1.8 versus 2.0 mmol/L) in the 50 mg qd group versus the 50 mg bid group; the correlations were not driven by inclusion of the 50 mg qd dose (data not shown). None of the differences were considered notable enough to justify reporting the data in independent pools and thus we have chosen to report the BP and fasting lipids results in a single pool as we did previously with the weight.<xref rid="b1-vhrm-12-337" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></p><p>The BP and fasting lipids results are associated with some caveats. The average weight change is small (approximately &#x02212;0.5 kg), and the measurements of BP and weight in the large clinical trials utilized for the current pool are expected to be associated with a high degree of variability, which presumably explains the reason for low correlation coefficient (<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup>). In contrast, the n value is very high, hence yielding significant slopes. Partial correlation analysis suggests that the changes in TG and VLDL cholesterol are also partially explained by the degree of adiposity and insulin resistance. These effects of adiposity and insulin resistance or the lack thereof must be interpreted with some caution due to the limitations of the BMI and HOMA-IR surrogates of adiposity and insulin resistance measured in these clinical trials. Furthermore, the studies pooled for this analysis were designed to assess BP and fasting lipids as secondary endpoints, and no data on confounding BP and lipid medications were collected.</p><p>Thus, therapeutically, DPP-4 inhibitors yield modest benefits of unknown clinical importance on BP and fasting lipids. Although these BP and fasting lipid benefits of DPP-4 inhibitors have not translated into cardiovascular risk reduction over 3 years,<xref rid="b8-vhrm-12-337" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> it is possible that a primary prevention trial of longer duration might contribute to a cardiovascular benefit after a longer follow-up. Notably, hypotension has not been identified as a side effect with vildagliptin.<xref rid="b9-vhrm-12-337" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was funded by Novartis Pharma AG.
