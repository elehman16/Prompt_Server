Another common post-transplantation complication is poor cardio-metabolic health, which plays a main role in long-term outcomes in renal transplant recipients (RTR). It is increasingly recognized that weight gain in the first year after transplantation, especially an increase in fat mass, is a highly common contributor to cardio-metabolic risk. The aim of this study is to compare the outcomes of usual care to the effects of exercise alone, and exercise combined with dietary counseling, on physical functioning, quality of life and post-transplantation weight gain in RTR.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">The Active Care after Transplantation study is a multicenter randomized controlled trial with three arms in which RTR from 3 Dutch hospitals are randomized within the first year after transplantation to usual care, to exercise intervention (3&#x000a0;months supervised exercise 2 times per week followed by 12&#x000a0;months active follow-up), or to an exercise + diet intervention, consisting of the exercise training with additional dietary counseling (12 sessions over 15&#x000a0;months by a renal dietician). In total, 219 participants (73 per group) will be recruited. The primary outcome is the subdomain physical functioning of quality of life, (SF-36 PF). Secondary outcomes include other evaluations of quality of life (SF-36, KDQOL-SF, EQ-5D), objective measures of physical functioning (aerobic capacity and muscle strength), level of physical activity, gain in adiposity (body fat percentage by bio-electrical impedance assessment, BMI, waist circumference), and cardiometabolic risk factors (blood pressure, lipids, glucose metabolism). Furthermore, data on renal function, medical history, medication, psychological factors (motivation, kinesiophobia, coping style), nutrition knowledge, nutrition intake, nutrition status, fatigue, work participation, process evaluation and cost-effectiveness are collected.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">Evidence on the effectiveness of an exercise intervention, or an exercise + diet intervention on physical functioning, weight gain and cardiometabolic health in RTR is currently lacking.

Physical activity levels decline already in the early stages of chronic kidney disease, and reach a nadir at end-stage renal disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. This low physical activity aggravates the catabolic state that is common in patients with renal disease, which leads to deconditioning and reduced physical functioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Spontaneous recovery of physical activity level after transplantation is modest, and limited physical functioning remains common [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Likewise, low cardiorespiratory fitness and muscle weakness are also common after renal transplantation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. This may be improved with exercise and physical activity, however, RTR experience barriers to engage in exercise and physical activity such as fear of movement, lack of motivation, and fatigue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par25">The incidence and prevalence of cardiovascular disease is estimated to be 4 to 6 times higher in RTR compared to the general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Various factors may explain poor post-transplantation health in RTR, including the legacy of end-organ damage due to the prior medical history (e.g. cardiovascular damage), that may not be fully reversible by restoring renal function. Importantly, the common substantial post-transplantation weight gain, which is primarily due to an increase in body fat mass, is a major trigger for the poor cardio-metabolic profile in the RTR, including post-transplant diabetes and the metabolic syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Furthermore, post-transplantation BMI is an important risk factor for graft failure and premature death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. A poor diet post-transplantation may be related to pre-transplantation dietary prescriptions such as low intake of vegetables to avoid hyperkalemia and a high intake of energy rich drinks to ensure adequate energy intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Additionally, glucocorticoid use after transplantation often promotes overeating, so a healthy diet without an excess of calories is frequently required [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Data from a previous study showed that RTR gain an average of 5.7&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;5.0 Kg of body weight in the first year after transplantation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Interestingly, the rise in body weight was related to low physical activity and poor diet rather than increased energy intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Changes in body weight and body composition after renal transplantation.

</p><p id="Par26">From the above, it may be clear that both physical activity and diet are important targets for lifestyle intervention in RTR. The importance of physical activity and exercise for health outcomes is well-acknowledged in the general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In RTR however, high level evidence on the effects of physical activity and exercise on physical functioning and cardiometabolic health is limited and comes from few small RCTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The available studies however, including single group interventions, show promising results. Dietary intervention after renal transplantation was shown to reduce body weight and improve lipid profile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], whereas intensive lifestyle intervention improved glucose metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Importantly, it was also shown that a supervised exercise program lead to similar improvements in muscle strength and aerobic capacity in RTR compared to healthy individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].The first year after transplantation may provide a window of opportunity to improve physical functioning and quality of life, and to prevent post-transplantation weight gain and its cardiometabolic consequences. Assuming that muscle disuse is a major factor in muscle weakness and low aerobic capacity in RTR, exercise rehabilitation and increased daily physical activity may be of great benefit to this patient population. For physical activity and exercise to result in a favourable shift from a catabolic to an anabolic state, proper consideration of nutritional status, in particular energy and protein intake, and metabolic status is necessary. Furthermore, dietary counseling directed at restoring a healthy eating pattern may prevent post-transplant weight gain and improve dietary quality.</p><p id="Par27">The Active Care after Transplantation (ACT) study is a pragmatic randomized controlled trial designed to evaluate the effects of an exercise intervention, and an exercise + dietary intervention, on physical functioning and quality of life after renal transplantation. In addition, detailed measures of physical fitness, level of physical activity, gain in adiposity, renal function, and cardiometabolic profile will be investigated, as well as success factors for lifestyle change in RTR. A health economics evaluation is included.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><p id="Par28">Active Care After Transplantation (ACT) is a multicenter pragmatic randomized controlled trial in renal transplant patients in the Netherlands, registered on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov">www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link> as NCT01047410. The ACT trial has three study arms: usual care versus exercise intervention versus exercise + diet intervention (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). It is designed according to the principles of a pragmatic RCT to allow evaluation of the intervention in real-life care facilities. Details are described below according to the CONSORT statement for parallel randomized trials and the extension of the CONSORT statement for pragmatic trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The study is performed according to the declaration of Helsinki and ethical approval is obtained from the University Medical Center Groningen Medical Ethics committee (NL49084.042.14). Adverse- and serious adverse events data are collected and closely monitored to ensure the ongoing safety of the participants. Both are reported in a standardized Adverse Events Report Form. Exemption to report adverse events is given for common renal transplant related co-morbidities, such as cardiovascular events, urinary tract infections, viral infections, pneumonia, urine retention, rejection, cardiac decompensation, hydronephrosis, nephrostomy catheter, lymphocele, hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, post-transplantation lymphoma, cerebrovascular accidents, meningitis, and skin cancer.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Flowchart of the ACT trial</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12882_2017_709_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig>

Inclusion criteria are: written informed consent; age&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;18&#x000a0;years; &#x0003c; 1&#x000a0;year after transplantation; approval for participation based on a general medical evaluation by their nephrologist. Exclusion criteria included the following: multiple organ transplantation; psychopathology or serious cognitive impairment; physical or clinical limitations that make participation impossible; pregnancy, negative screening verdict by the nephrologist or cardiologist. Participants receive a small financial reimbursement (10 Euro) for participation in the final follow-up measurement at 15&#x000a0;months. Participation in the exercise training sessions and dietary care are financed by research funds, and participants&#x02019; travel expenses are reimbursed. Pre-defined reasons to discontinue participation in the study included pregnancy and conversion to dialysis. Furthermore, reasons to discontinue participation are: changes in ECG during maximal aerobic capacity testing, systolic blood pressure&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;250&#x000a0;mmHg, diastolic blood pressure&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;120&#x000a0;mmHg or blood pressure decline of &#x0003e; 20&#x000a0;mmHg during maximal aerobic capacity testing, and severe cardio-pulmonary complaints during the exercise trainings sessions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Screening, recruitment and randomization</title><p id="Par30">All RTR patients are screened for eligibility during the post-transplantation recovery period, so within 7&#x02013;10&#x000a0;days after surgery, by the nephrologist. Eligible RTR are invited to participate, informed about the study protocol and if agreed are asked to participate and sign written informed consent. In case of non-Dutch or non-English speaking patients, interpreters are used.</p><p id="Par31">In total, 219 participants (73 per group) will be recruited. The sample size is based on the expected improvement on the physical functioning scale of quality of life of 13.8 points in the intervention group and 8.8 points in usual care (&#x003b1;=0.05, &#x003b2;= 0.80, SD&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;11.0) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. A difference of 5.0 points between the standard effect is considered a relevant effect. This results in a required number of 57 RTR per group. Taking into account a potential dropout rate of 15% and a correction for heterogeneity between centers of 10%, this results in a total required number of 73 RTR per group (<italic>N</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;219 in total). Randomization to one of the three arms is computerized using the &#x02018;PROC SURVEYSELECT&#x02019; function in the software program SAS (Cary, North Carolina, USA). It is performed by an independent data management company hosting the data entry facility, who are not involved in conducting the study itself (Nefrovisie foundation, Utrecht, the Netherlands).

Current standard nutrition care after kidney transplantation consists of 1&#x02013;4 inpatient consultations by a renal dietitian during the inpatient stay (7&#x02013;10&#x000a0;days), followed by 1 outpatient consultation. During inpatient consultations attention is paid to optimal nutritional intake, maintaining a stable body weight and muscle mass, or increasing body weight when needed. After a few months, during the outpatient follow-up, attention is paid to maintaining a stable body weight, or increasing or decreasing body weight when needed. When a participant has increased cholesterol, (un)saturated fat intake is discussed, and mono/disaccharides are discussed when a participant has increased HbA1c. Likewise, salt consumption is discussed in case of increased 24-h sodium excretion. Exercise or lifestyle counseling are not included in the standard post-transplant care in either of the participating hospitals. Participants randomized to the usual care group receive general advice to meet the standard Dutch exercise guidelines (30&#x000a0;min of moderate physical activity per day) and follow the Dutch Dietary guidelines.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Exercise only intervention</title><p id="Par38">The exercise intervention consists of two phases. The first phase is a 3-month exercise training program, followed by the second phase; a 12-month active follow-up with lifestyle counseling (Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Exercise training sessions are done in groups of 4&#x02013;10 participants in the rehabilitation centers and with 1&#x02013;6 participants in the physiotherapy centers.</p><p id="Par39">The training program encompasses two exercise training sessions per week (21 exercise training sessions and 3 test sessions in total) and is focused on improving maximal muscle strength, local muscle endurance, and aerobic capacity. Each exercise training session consists of 30-min dynamic resistance training of all the major muscle groups (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1) using resistance training machines, 30&#x000a0;min of aerobic training (cycle-ergometry and treadmill walking), and is concluded with a 30-min supervised sports activity or swimming, depending on the available facilities.</p><p id="Par40">The dynamic resistance training includes both maximal strength training (relatively high load, fewer repetitions), and muscle endurance training (relatively low load, large number of repetitions).</p><p id="Par41">Optimal resistance training load is determined using one-repetition maximum testing (1RM) for each participant. The content of the training program is in line with the American College of Sports Medicine guidelines exercise in healthy adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], and was previously shown to be effective in improving muscle strength and aerobic capacity in RTR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].

For maximal muscle strength training, moderate loading is used (50&#x02013;60% 1RM), for 2&#x02013;3 sets of 8&#x02013;10 repetitions. Higher loads are known to be more appropriate for maximal muscle strength, however 50&#x02013;60% 1RM is used in our protocol as most participants are untrained, and RTR have increased risk of tendon ruptures. For local muscle endurance training a light-to-moderate load is used (25&#x02013;35% 1RM), for 1&#x02013;3 sets of 30 repetitions. All resistance exercise involved exercise machines, no free weights are used for safety reasons.</p><p id="Par43">The load for the aerobic cycle training is determined based on the baseline symptom-limited graded maximal cycle ergometry test. Treadmill walking is performed at the load at which heart rate is similar to the heart rate during aerobic cycle-training. If the physiotherapists notice that a subject is training below or above the optimal intensity (e.g. in case a baseline exercise test is performed sub optimally), they are allowed to make slight adjustments to the participants&#x02019; exercise intensity.</p><sec id="Sec9"><title>Lifestyle counseling</title><p id="Par44">During the active follow-up, participants are supported to continue sports activities and keep up daily physical activity by lifestyle coaches. A total of 5 lifestyle counseling consultations are scheduled during the entire exercise intervention and similar for the exercise + diet intervention, see next paragraph: at 6&#x000a0;weeks, 12&#x000a0;weeks, 16&#x000a0;weeks, 6&#x000a0;months, and at 15&#x000a0;months. The first two consultations are face-to-face and combined with the exercise training sessions. Consultations at 4 and 6&#x000a0;months are done face-to-face if possible, otherwise by phone. The final lifestyle counseling session is face-to-face together with the final test moment at 15&#x000a0;months. To optimize participant motivation, the lifestyle counseling is in line with the Self-Determination Theory, fostering the perceived autonomy, competence and relatedness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Additionally, the Stages of Change model is applied, and readiness for change is assessed at the first 2 lifestyle counseling sessions to better tailor the content of the consultations to the participants' readiness to change their exercise and physical activity behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. During these lifestyle counseling sessions a motivational interviewing approach is used. During the lifestyle counseling participants receive several tools to stimulate a physically active lifestyle, including an information leaflet of the Dutch Kidney Foundation on exercise and physical activity after renal transplantation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], a step counter to stimulate physical activity through self-monitoring, and finally, a hard-copy log book for educational and motivational purposes.

The dietary counseling runs throughout the entire 15&#x000a0;months of the study period and consists of a total of 12 counseling sessions with a renal dietician. The dietary counseling takes place in the hospital face-to-face. If this is not feasible some counseling sessions are done by phone. The dieticians are trained to use motivational interviewing techniques which they apply during the dietary counseling sessions.</p><p id="Par46">Goals are set to improve nutrition status to preserve renal function, to prevent weight gain, type 2 diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia. These goals are set together with the participant to facilitate an autonomy supportive counseling climate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. A three-day food diary is used as input during the dietary consultations and for personal goal setting. Participants also receive a food logbook which contains information and exercises to help the participant set diet goals. During the dietary counseling sessions, special attention is given to salt intake, whole-wheat grains and fruit and vegetable intake, intake of saturated and unsaturated fat, and the use of sugar-rich products, sugar-sweetened beverages (soft drinks, sweetened dairy drinks and fruit juices) and preventing overeating. In addition, participants are reminded of their physical activity goals, and the importance of protein intake for maintaining and increasing muscle mass.

Maximal muscle strength of knee extensors, knee flexors, back and chest muscles are included as an outcome measure. Maximal muscle strength is determined using the one-repetition maximum (1RM) method under supervision of a qualified physiotherapist. The 1RM refers to the resistance at which the participant is only just able to perform the exercise correctly. For each strength test, the physiotherapist estimates the 1RM of the subject for the particular exercise machine. The increments are chosen in such a way that the participant reaches 1RM after 3&#x02013;5 one-repetition sets.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Aerobic capacity</title><p id="Par54">Aerobic capacity is determined by symptom-limited graded cycle ergometry, which is commonly used in renal transplant patients and considered the gold standard for determining aerobic capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The test determines the maximal workload (Wpeak) and maximal oxygen uptake (VO<sub>2</sub>peak) using a respiratory gas analyzer (Cortex Metalyzer 3B breath analyser, Cortex Biophysik GmbH, Leipzig, Germany). VO<sub>2</sub>peak indicates the peak amount of oxygen that the body is able to utilize during sustained physical exertion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The cycle ergometers used for all participants is a Lode Corival 906900 (Lode B.V., Groningen, Netherlands). After a period of rest and 1&#x000a0;min pedaling without workload, the bicycle workload is increased gradually every minute by 10 to 25&#x000a0;W depending on the participants&#x02019; expected exercise capacity. The incremental increase in workload is done in such a way that maximal exercise capacity is reached within 8&#x02013;12&#x000a0;min after starting the exercise test. The workload during the test is blinded for the participant. Participants cycle at a cadence of 60&#x02013;70 rotations per minute until exhaustion. The maximal cycle ergometry tests are medically supervised by a sports physician. Before and during the test, the participant&#x02019;s heart function is monitored using ECG-monitoring. In addition, heart rate, blood pressure and oxygen saturation are monitored. The test is stopped when ECG abnormalities occur, systolic blood pressure rises over 250&#x000a0;mmHg or diastolic blood pressure rises over 120&#x000a0;mmHg, or if blood pressure falls with more than 20&#x000a0;mmHg.</p><p id="Par55">The sub-maximal exercise test is performed on a general fitness cycle-ergometer under supervision of a qualified physiotherapist.

Anthropometry measures include bodyweight, height, waist- and hip circumference. All anthropometry measures are done twice. Bodyweight is measured in lightweight clothing without shoes, preferably in the morning, on a calibrated scale (Seca 877, Seca GMBH, Hamburg, Germany), to the nearest 0.1&#x000a0;kg. Height is measured using a wall-secured stadiometer (Seca 222, Seca GMBH, Hamburg, Germany). Waist circumference is measured with the subject in standing position at the level midway between the lowest rib and iliac crest at the end of an expiration to the nearest 0.1&#x000a0;cm. Waist circumference is also measured in participants with polycystic kidney disease which may create noise in the data, although in case a participant had polycystic kidney disease this is clearly defined in our dataset. Hip circumference is measured as the maximum circumference over the trochanter major to the nearest 0.1&#x000a0;cm. A tape with standardized retraction mechanism (Seca 201, Seca GMBH, Hamburg, Germany) is used. Nutrition status is assessed by subjective global assessment (SGA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].

Furthermore, potential preset determinants of intervention outcome will be evaluated in a GLM model: gender, age, coping style, fear of movement, work participation and clinical factors.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par67">The aim of this RCT is to evaluate the effects and cost-effectiveness of an exercise only intervention and an exercise + diet intervention on physical functioning, quality of life and -as an important secondary aim- post-transplantation weight gain and cardiometabolic risk after renal transplantation. It will cover a large range of relevant patient-centered and clinical outcomes, as well as cost-effectiveness analyses, to provide guidance for evidence-based care.</p><p id="Par68">The ACT trial is a pragmatic RCT. This means that already in the trial phase, the intervention is aimed at and implemented by regular staff members in daily care. This also implies that the control condition can be less controlled than it would have been in an explanatory trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p id="Par69">In the present study we strive for a set-up to maximize external validity within the context of renal transplant care in the Netherlands, by working with physiotherapists in existing rehabilitation centers and physiotherapy practices, and with dieticians in the field of renal care. Hereby generalizability to the clinical setting in RTR population is offered, providing widely applicable high-quality evidence for healthcare policy makers. Evidence-based behavioral components are included in the study to facilitate behavior change and long-term behavior maintenance.</p><p id="Par70">Another strength is the application of focus groups with both the participants as well as the various healthcare professionals, as these qualitative data will provide a wealth of detailed information of patients&#x02019; and professionals&#x02019; attitudes toward and experiences with the intervention, supporting future implementation.</p><p id="Par71">The present RCT includes a relatively high number of participants. The exercise training is delivered in larger groups at rehabilitation centers, and in smaller groups with physiotherapy practices. Sub-analyses may reveal differences in outcome between settings. The diet intervention is done by renal dieticians which are familiar with this patient population. Other strengths include gold standard measurement of aerobic capacity, objective measurement of physical activity using step counters, bio-impedance and BMI measured by dieticians, and the use of 24-h urine biomarkers.</p><p id="Par72">A limitation of the present study is its complexity. The RCT involves skills and experience of multiple healthcare professionals working at different centers, making it difficult to standardize intervention delivery. Another limitation is that the exercise intervention and exercise with dietary counseling groups are combined. This may lead to contamination between groups, as participants of the exercise + diet group may share dietary advice with the exercise only group e.g. during the exercise training sessions. Furthermore, participants entering the ACT trial already have a certain degree of motivation to improve their health and fitness through lifestyle. Therefore, control participants may have worked on their health and fitness in alternative ways. Another limitation is that the study took place only in the Netherlands.</p><p id="Par73">The present study aims to provide evidence needed to guide decision making by clinicians and policy-makers in post-transplantation care. Furthermore, it will help develop guidelines for post-transplantation care in the Netherlands to further improve long-term outcomes of renal transplantation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec27"><p>
