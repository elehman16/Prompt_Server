Our objective was to develop a compartmental model for quantification of adrenaline&#x02019;s impact on the pharmacokinetics of perineurally-injected lidocaine in the dog. Dogs were subjected to paravertebral brachial plexus block using lidocaine alone or adrenalinated lidocaine. Data was collected through a prospective, randomised, blinded crossover protocol performed over three periods. Blood samples were collected during 180 minutes following block execution. Compartmental pharmacokinetic models were developed and their goodness-of-fit were compared. The lowering effects of adrenaline on the absorption of lidocaine were statistically determined with one-sided tests. A one-compartment disposition model with two successive zero-order absorption processes best fitted our experimental data. Adrenaline decreased the peak plasma lidocaine concentration by approximately 60% (<italic>P &#x0003c;</italic> 0.001), decreased this local anesthetic&#x02019;s fast and slow zero-order absorption rates respectively by 50% and 90% (<italic>P</italic> = 0.046, and <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001), which respective durations were prolonged by 90% and 1300% (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.020 and <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). Lidocaine demonstrated a previously unreported atypical absorption profile following its paravertebral injection in dogs. Adrenaline decreased the absorption rate of lidocaine and prolonged the duration of its absorption.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008755</institution-id><institution>Association des M&#x000e9;decins V&#x000e9;t&#x000e9;rinaires du Qu&#x000e9;bec en Pratique des Petits Animaux</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient>Am&#x000e9;lie Choquette, D.M.V.</principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>Fonds en Sant&#x000e9; des Animaux de Compagnie</institution></funding-source><principal-award-recipient>Eric Troncy, D.V., Ph.D.</principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>#327158&#x02013;2008</award-id><principal-award-recipient>Eric Troncy, D.V., Ph.D.</principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award004"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>#441651&#x02013;2013</award-id><principal-award-recipient>Eric Troncy, D.V., Ph.D.</principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award005"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000196</institution-id><institution>Canada Foundation for Innovation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>#9483</award-id><principal-award-recipient>Eric Troncy, D.V., Ph.D.</principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award006"><funding-source><institution>Canada Foundation for Innovation (CA)</institution></funding-source><award-id>#24601</award-id><principal-award-recipient>Eric Troncy, D.V., Ph.D.</principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award007"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient>Martin Guillot, D.V., Ph.D.</principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>Financial support was provided by the Bourse de recherche clinique of the Association des m&#x000e9;decins v&#x000e9;t&#x000e9;rinaires du Qu&#x000e9;bec (AMVQ), and the Fonds de recherche clinique Zoetis of Fonds en Sant&#x000e9; des Animaux de Compagnie (FSAC), Facult&#x000e9; de M&#x000e9;decine V&#x000e9;t&#x000e9;rinaire of Universit&#x000e9; de Montr&#x000e9;al.

Yet, the range of desensitization techniques is much narrower for the canine forelimb than for the hindlimb. The subscapular approach to the brachial plexus block is efficacious at desensitizing the forelimb from elbow to toes, but its effect proximal to the elbow is unpredictable at best [<xref rid="pone.0169745.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0169745.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] By targeting the nerve roots as they exit the vertebral foramen, the original and the modified paravertebral blocks of the brachial plexus seem promising for anesthetising the shoulder and brachium [<xref rid="pone.0169745.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], but both approaches give inconsistent results and warrant further investigation.</p><p>Lidocaine is used in a variety of local anesthetic procedures, both in human and veterinary medicine, and its pharmacokinetics has been studied in different species for over 40 years [<xref rid="pone.0169745.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0169745.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Its destiny after intravenous and extravascular administration has been studied with different formulations, dosages or anesthetic contexts [<xref rid="pone.0169745.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0169745.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Yet, we are unaware of a published study describing the pharmacokinetics of lidocaine following peripheral nerve block in dogs.</p><p>Furthermore, several local anesthetics are available in solutions containing adrenaline, which decreases the regional blood flow and the rate of lidocaine absorption at injection site, hence extending the duration of the exposure of the targeted nerves to effective anesthetic concentrations [<xref rid="pone.0169745.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Still, the effects of adrenaline on the absorption of lidocaine have not been thoroughly characterized [<xref rid="pone.0169745.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], at least for this particular technique.</p><p>Among the few publications describing the effect of adrenaline on the pharmacokinetics of extravascular-administered local anesthetics, one used an interesting model to quantify the effect of adrenaline on the absorption of levobupivacaine following caudal epidural administration in children: these investigators fitted the drug&#x02019;s time-concentration data to a model with two distinct first-order absorption rate constants whose onsets were separated by a lag time [<xref rid="pone.0169745.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. We hypothesized that this model could (1) be applied to other amide-type local anesthetics and extravascular administration sites, including the brachial plexus, and (2) accurately measure the lowering effects of adrenaline on the absorption rate of lidocaine. To verify our hypotheses, we performed a pharmacokinetic study of lidocaine either alone or combined with adrenaline. Our objectives were: first, to compare the goodness-of-fit of the above-described dual-absorption compartmental model (alternative model) and of the basic one-compartment model with a single first-order absorption process (standard model) to the plasma lidocaine data of both drug formulations (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. plain and adrenalinated lidocaine). Second, to determine whether the model with the highest goodness-of-fit could be further improved, and third, to quantify the effect of adrenaline on the absorption pharmacokinetics of lidocaine by analyzing the time-concentration data of both drug formulations with the best model.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials &#x00026; Methods</title><p>The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Facult&#x000e9; de M&#x000e9;decine V&#x000e9;t&#x000e9;rinaire Bioethics Committee (CEUA) of the Universit&#x000e9; de Montr&#x000e9;al (protocol #Rech-1574).

The students interacted with them and exercised them daily except on the days of experimentation. Initial health status was assessed with a physical examination and standard blood tests (hematocrit, total proteins, uremia). Prior to each anesthesia, dogs were re-examined, weighed and fasted for 12 hours with free access to water.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Study design and procedures</title><p>Dogs were sedated with an intramuscular combination of 10 &#x003bc;g/kg medetomidine hydrochloride and 0.1 mg/kg butorphanol tartrate. A 30-mm 20-gauge cephalic intravenous catheter was placed in the right cephalic vein for drug administration and blood sampling. Anesthesia was then induced with propofol to effect (maximum dose of 4 mg/kg), followed by endotracheal intubation and maintenance with &#x02248;2% isoflurane in oxygen, as targeted on the vaporizer. Once the anesthesia depth was stabilized according to clinical signs, dogs were positioned in right recumbency, with the left forelimb pulled far caudally to improve visualization of the cervical seventh (C7) transverse process and the head of the first rib. To minimize the variability in block execution, all injections were performed on the left forelimb by the same left-handed investigator (A.C.). The fur along the lateral aspect of the neck was clipped from the transverse processes of C4 to the mid-scapula and from the spinous processes to the jugular groove. The skin was disinfected with isopropanol, which was also used instead of gel to facilitate transducer-skin contact. Ultrasound imaging (M-Turbo Vet<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>; FUJIFILM SonoSite Inc., Bothell, WA), was performed with a 6&#x02013;15 MHz linear probe (HFL 50X Linear Transducer; FUJIFILM SonoSite Inc., Bothell, WA), using color-flow Doppler.</p><p>The ultrasound approach of Bagshaw <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0169745.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] was used in order to position the insulated needle (Echostim facet tip, 21-gauge, 40 mm; Havel&#x02019;s Inc., Cincinnati, OH, USA) as close as possible to the nerve roots of C6, C7, and the junction of C8 and T1. Great care was taken not to lacerate/puncture a vessel or the targeted nerve sheath. Once the needle in position, the electrical stimulation technique (Stimuplex<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Dig RC, Braun Medical Inc., Bethlehem, PA, USA) was combined to ultrasound visualisation in order to validate needle positioning through the characteristic motor responses for each root: shoulder rotation with C6, elbow flexion with C7 and carpus/digits flexion with C8-T1 [<xref rid="pone.0169745.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Details of the guided loco-regional block and rationale for diluting the tested local anesthetic solutions are subject of a separate publication [<xref rid="pone.0169745.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>Dogs were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups using a block balanced randomized crossover design. The randomization was controlled for age, gender and body weight. Treatments consisted of commercially available injectable solutions containing 20 mg/mL of lidocaine hydrochloride, either alone or combined with 0.01 mg/mL adrenaline. Both formulations were diluted with sterile physiological saline at a 1:1 volume ratio prior to administration. For every block, 2 mg/kg lidocaine was administered per nerve root, to a total dose of 6 mg/kg per dog. After the third injection, isoflurane administration was immediately stopped and atipamezole hydrochloride administered intramuscularly at a dose of 50 &#x003bc;g/kg. Dogs were oxygenated until extubation and warmed as needed until they were awoken and capable of standing.</p><p>At the request of the bioethical committee, the dogs were used in three periods with a four-week washout between the first two treatments, and two weeks between second and third treatments. All washout periods exceed by at least 295 times the average 0.88 h terminal half-life of lidocaine in dogs [<xref rid="pone.0169745.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].

This and the visible trends in the standardized regression residuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169745.g003">Fig 3A and 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169745.g004">Fig 4A and 4C</xref>) warranted the rejection of the &#x0201c;null hypothesis&#x0201d; Model A despite its lower AIC value as compared to model B. Other investigators already have reported such biphasic absorption kinetics for lidocaine and other local anaesthetics in human beings [<xref rid="pone.0169745.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0169745.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The mechanistic basis of this model cannot be ascertained from our data, but at least 4 options are possible. First, the fast absorption compartment may represent the dissolved drug molecules present at the site of injection receiving the highest blood supply, and the slow absorption compartment the drug molecules in a region of the injection site that receives a lower level of blood perfusion [<xref rid="pone.0169745.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Second and consistent with our observations of dyes injected in the paravertebral brachial plexus of canine cadavers, the fast absorption compartment may represent an anatomical site proximal to a diffusion obstacle (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. fascia or fatty tissue), and the slow absorption compartment may represent the site distal to it. Third, the fast and slow absorption components may respectively reflect the blood <italic>vs</italic>. lymphatic transit pathways from the injection site to the systemic bloodstream. This possibility is receiving increased attention in parallel with the current development of therapeutic proteins and other large drug molecules [<xref rid="pone.0169745.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Fourth, the dual fast/slow absorption may reflect a process of precipitation of this lipophilic drug at the site of injection. This phenomenon may result from the resorption of the aqueous drug solvent and the pH shift caused by the buffered interstitial fluids, which may increase the injection site drug concentration to the point of saturation [<xref rid="pone.0169745.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>The regression residuals of model B (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. with asynchronous fast and slow first-order absorption rate constants) scattered randomly over the abscissa of model-predicted concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169745.g003">Fig 3B and 3D</xref>), but an N-shaped trend was detected for the residuals of the first 50 minutes after drug injection, especially with plain lidocaine administration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169745.g004">Fig 4B and 4D</xref>). Therefore, this model misspecification suggestive of an atypical drug absorption process warranted the refinement of model B [<xref rid="pone.0169745.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>One possible modification is to replace the dual first-order, asynchronous absorption rates with two zero-order, time-constrained absorption rates, a strategy tried for the PK modeling of the epidural block with levobupivacaine [<xref rid="pone.0169745.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Although these investigators found that the goodness-of-fit of this alternative model was lower than their original model, other authors have found it useful to fit the i.m. absorption kinetics of several other aqueous drug products such as trovafloxacin [<xref rid="pone.0169745.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], pralidoxime [<xref rid="pone.0169745.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], or recombinant human luteinizing hormone [<xref rid="pone.0169745.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Another possible modification is to use two asynchronous inverse-gaussian absorption processes, a strategy that successfully quantified the effect of adrenaline on the uptake of ropivacaine in a thoracic paravertebral or a femoral nerve block [<xref rid="pone.0169745.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0169745.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In the current study, we improved our model by using the dual zero-order, time-constrained, asynchronous absorption rates. This alternative Model C had a markedly lower AIC value as compared to models A and B, an improved overall goodness-of-fit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169745.g006">Fig 6C vs. 6A and 6B</xref>), and random scattering of residuals over the abscissas, both as a function of model-predicted lidocaine concentration and as a function of time (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169745.g004">4B and 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169745.g005">5B and 5D</xref>).</p><p>In contrast with the studies cited above [<xref rid="pone.0169745.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0169745.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0169745.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], the time-course of plasma lidocaine concentration had quasi-straight absorption phase slopes with abrupt slope changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169745.g007">Fig 7</xref>), a shape that resembles a short stepwise i.v. infusion and is suggestive of at least two zero-order absorption processes [<xref rid="pone.0169745.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. This hypothesis was confirmed by comparing the AIC for models B and C. Our study design cannot elucidate the physiological determinants of a zero-order absorption profile of the tested aqueous solutions of lidocaine hydrochloride, but such atypical absorption behavior may be associated with the lymphatic uptake of precipitated drug molecules [<xref rid="pone.0169745.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], or their dissolution by the rate-limiting turnover of interstitial fluid, resulting in pseudo zero-order absorption [<xref rid="pone.0169745.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Further research is needed to confirm this hypothesized mechanism for lidocaine hydrochloride [<xref rid="pone.0169745.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>In contrast with levobupivacaine [<xref rid="pone.0169745.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and ropivacaine in humans [<xref rid="pone.0169745.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], the zero-order absorption rates (k<sub>01</sub> and k<sub>02</sub>) of lidocaine, their respective durations (Dur<sub>1</sub> and Dur<sub>2</sub>), and the lag time for the onset of the second absorption rate significantly differed between formulations (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). These changes in the absorption kinetics of lidocaine resulted in a significantly lower C<sub>max</sub>, hence a lower toxicity potential [<xref rid="pone.0169745.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Interestingly, no significant difference was found for the partition coefficient f, a result that differs from the reported effect of adrenaline on the caudal epidural absorption kinetics of levobupivacaine in humans [<xref rid="pone.0169745.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and of ropivacaine injected paravertebrally in the thorax region [<xref rid="pone.0169745.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In both studies, adrenaline significantly decreased the dose fraction that was absorbed from the fast-absorption compartment.</p><p>One limitation to our study is the lack of a study arm where each lidocaine solution was administered intravenously to the dogs. This precluded the estimation of the disposition pharmacokinetic parameters CL and V, of its terminal elimination rate, and of the absolute bioavailability F. But using one or more i.v. study arms in the same dogs may decrease the intrinsic clearance of lidocaine [<xref rid="pone.0169745.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], and therefore hinder the elucidation of the effects of adrenaline on its absorption kinetics. Still, the disposition pharmacokinetic parameters estimated in this study are comparable to those of previous studies: one reported a CL of 0.04 L&#x000b7;min<sup>-1</sup>&#x000b7;kg<sup>-1</sup> and a V of 1.44 L&#x000b7;kg<sup>-1</sup> after a lidocaine i.v. bolus [<xref rid="pone.0169745.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and another reported a 70 min terminal half-life after a single intraperitoneal and incisional administration of lidocaine in dogs, with a calculated average CL/F of 0.056 L&#x000b7;min<sup>-1</sup>&#x000b7;kg<sup>-1</sup> [<xref rid="pone.0169745.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p><p>Additional limitations of this study include the small number of subjects, and the narrow blood-sampling window, especially for the adrenalinated lidocaine administration. But the latter problem was circumvented by assuming that, at the dose and dosing interval used here, adrenaline has negligible effects on the disposition kinetics of lidocaine. This enables the use of a compartmental model where the PK systems for plain and adrenalinated lidocaine share identical CL/F and V/F, and therefore the terminal slope can be detected even if one sampling time of the adrenalinated lidocaine formulation occurred in the elimination phase.</p><p>The tested drugs were administered under isoflurane general anesthesia, which was shown to alter lidocaine&#x02019;s pharmacokinetic parameters in cats [<xref rid="pone.0169745.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, anesthesia was stopped as soon as the last block injection was completed, and therefore most blood samples were taken on ambulatory dogs.</p><p>Finally, with respect to the dosing schedule, differences in the early post-C<sub>max</sub> portion of the time-course of plasma lidocaine concentrations after dosing adrenalinated lidocaine on single <italic>vs</italic>. multiple paravertebral injection sites have been reported [<xref rid="pone.0169745.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In our study, three injections were administered to each subject within a maximum window of four minutes, and the recorded slope of plasma drug concentrations did not change following each block injection. We therefore chose to consider our dosage regimen as a single administration.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec014"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This crossover comparison of the pharmacokinetics of plain and adrenalinated lidocaine solutions in dogs subjected to a paravertebral brachial plexus block quantified the slowing effect of adrenaline on the systemic absorption rate of lidocaine. But most importantly, it revealed a previously unreported atypical absorption pattern for this local anaesthetic drug, which is independent of the presence of adrenaline. The physiological and/or physicochemical determinants of this sequential, time-constrained, zero-order absorption kinetics remain to be elucidated, but may explain our limited ability to predict the depth and duration of local anesthesia when the local anaesthetic is administered at different doses or in repeated dosings.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec015"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0169745.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Lidocaine time-concentration data in dogs dosed paravertebrally with plain and adrenalinated lidocaine formulations.</title><p>Subject#, subject number; ID, identification; Formulation, lidocaine formulation used; Time (min), time following the initiation of the 1st injection; Cp (mg/L), plasma lidocaine concentration (mg/L).</p><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0169745.s001.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are grateful to Mrs. Myriam Charest, D.M.V. student, Mrs. Dominique Gauvin, M.Sc., and Mrs. Johanne Couture, D.E.C. for their valuable assistance in data collection and blood sample analysis, as well as to FUJIFILM Sonosite Inc., Markham (On), Canada, for generously lending the ultrasound equipment.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0169745.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><name><surname>Skarda</surname><given-names>TR</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Tranquilli</surname><given-names>WJ</given-names></name>. <chapter-title>Local and regional anesthetic and analgesic techniques: dogs</chapter-title> In: <name><surname>Tranquilli</surname><given-names>WJ</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Thurmon</surname><given-names>JC</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Grimm</surname><given-names>KA</given-names></name>, editors. <source>Lumb and Jones&#x02019; Veterinary Anesthesia and Analgesia</source>, <edition>4th ed</edition>
