It is available as both tablets and solution for injection. The objective of this safety study was to investigate the interchangeable use of two robenacoxib formulations in dogs using a novel study design alternating between oral tablets and subcutaneous injections. Thirty-two na&#x000ef;ve healthy 4-month dogs were enrolled in this 88-day study and were randomized among four groups to be untreated or to receive robenacoxib at the highest recommended or elevated dose rates. The dogs were administered three 20-day treatment cycles each separated by a 14-day washout period. Each 20-day cycle was comprised of 10&#x000a0;days of once daily oral administration, 3&#x000a0;days of subcutaneous administration, followed by further 7&#x000a0;days of oral administration (Groups 2 to 4). The control group (Group 1) received oral empty gelatin capsules or subcutaneous saline injections. Assessment of safety was based on general health observations, clinical observations, physical and neurological examinations including ophthalmological examinations, electrocardiographic examinations and clinical pathology evaluations, food and water consumption, body weight, and macroscopic and microscopic examinations. Blood samples were collected for pharmacokinetic evaluation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par2">Blood concentrations of robenacoxib confirmed systemic exposure of all treated dogs. All dogs were in good health through study termination and there were no serious adverse events during the course of the study. No changes in body weight, food consumption, ophthalmic, neurological examinations, electrocardiograms, buccal mucosal blood times, clinical pathology or organ weight were attributable to robenacoxib formulation administration. Primary treatment-related abnormalities were of low incidence at all doses. They were confined to macroscopic and microscopic changes observed locally at the subcutaneous injection sites and microscopic findings within the gastrointestinal tract. These findings were as expected based on previous studies with robenacoxib solution for injection alone and the known properties of this class of compound and mode of administration. There were no adverse effects which could be attributed specifically to the interchangeable use of oral and injectable robenacoxib.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par3">Alternating regimens of robenacoxib tablets and solution for injection were well tolerated in healthy young dogs.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Robenacoxib</kwd><kwd>Onsior&#x02122;</kwd><kwd>Tablet</kwd><kwd>Injection</kwd><kwd>NSAID</kwd><kwd>Dog</kwd><kwd>Safety</kwd><kwd>Interchangeable</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par20">Robenacoxib is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) of the cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitor (coxib) subclass with a fast onset of action in dogs and cats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].

Its objective was to apply a novel study design to establish the safety of the interchangeable use of Onsior&#x02122; tablets and Onsior&#x02122; solution for injection in dogs. By alternating between oral tablet and subcutaneous (SC) injection dosing, it was possible to demonstrate that tablets and injections can be used sequentially in either order. This is relevant for situations, in which for example a dog receives robenacoxib for surgery via injection and then continues for two additional days of postoperative pain therapy with tablets or when a dog treated with oral robenacoxib for osteoarthritis receives a single injection of robenacoxib for surgery and then continues with its oral osteoarthritis therapy. Because Onsior&#x02122; is a globally marketed product and dosages and indications vary in different geographies, the dose levels used in this study were selected to equal or exceed all potential scenarios of use and addressed both indications (postoperative pain and osteoarthritis). Group 1 was the negative control group. Groups 2 to 4 received three cycles of oral and subcutaneous treatments (separated by a washout period). During each cycle, Group 2 was administered &#x02265;2&#x000a0;mg/kg orally for 7&#x000a0;days, &#x02265;4&#x000a0;mg/kg orally for 3&#x000a0;days, 4&#x000a0;mg/kg subcutaneously for 3&#x000a0;days and &#x02265;2&#x000a0;mg/kg orally for 7&#x000a0;days. Groups 3 and 4 received multiples thereof (2X and 3X). In addition, to investigate the minimum proposed label age for safe use of Onsior&#x02122;, dogs were 4&#x000a0;months of age at start of treatment compared to 6&#x000a0;months of age in previous safety studies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Objective and standards</title><p id="Par24">The objective of the study was to establish the safety of the interchangeable use of robenacoxib (Onsior&#x02122;) tablets and solution for injection in dogs starting at 4&#x000a0;months of age.</p><p id="Par25">This study was conducted in compliance with Good Laboratory Practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and site procedures.

Each animal was uniquely identified with a microchip and acclimatized to the study conditions for 4&#x000a0;weeks. Dogs were approximately 4&#x000a0;months old at initiation of dosing (Day 1). Suitability was evaluated by physical examination and clinical pathology and only healthy animals were included. Dogs were housed individually indoors in climate controlled facilities (20 to 26&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, 30 to 70% humidity and 12-h light/12-h dark cycle) in accordance with accepted laboratory animal care and use guidelines. Dogs were fed ad libitum at least 8&#x000a0;h each day with an appropriate ration of a certified commercial canine feed and water was available ad libitum.

Appropriately sized whole tablets placed in one or two gelatin capsules (Torpac&#x000ae; no.12, Torpac Inc., Fairfield, NJ, USA) were used to provide the most accurate dosing based on the body weights of the study dogs. The number and strength of oral tablets were calculated to ensure that the minimum targeted dose level was achieved. For Group 2, this meant that dogs received a robenacoxib dose of at least 2&#x000a0;mg/kg during the first and last 7&#x000a0;days of each cycle and at least 4&#x000a0;mg/kg from the 8th to 13th day of each cycle (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The dose level for robenacoxib injections was in all cases delivered at the exact dosage (i.e. 4&#x000a0;mg/kg for Group 2).

In this model, I<sub>max</sub> is the maximal inhibition (100%), IC50 is the concentration of robenacoxib providing 50% of Imax, C is the robenacoxib concentrations and n is the slope parameter. The parameters values were obtained from previously published work in dog [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Mean values for n and IC50 were, respectively, 0.586 and 11,328&#x000a0;ng/mL for inhibition of TxB<sub>2</sub> and 1.273 and 280.3&#x000a0;ng/mL for inhibition of PGE<sub>2</sub>.

There were no serious adverse events during the course of the study and no treatment-related adverse findings in general health observations. No treatment-related abnormalities were noted during the physical examinations or neurological abnormalities other than injection site findings as described hereafter. Over the entire study, a total of 288 subcutaneous injections were administered and only occasional scratching (47 observations) or excessive licking of the dose site (27 observations) were noted. Additionally, there was a single observation each of twitching and vocalization, in a Group 4 female and Group 2 male, respectively during dosing.</p><p id="Par43">Other clinical observations included liquid, mucoid, or non-formed feces, vomitus and various other findings on the skin and pelage. These observations appeared infrequently, were transient and lacked a dose relationship for incidence, or were reported at a comparable incidence in control animals and/or during the predose phase or washout periods. They were therefore not considered test article-related.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Body weights and food consumption</title><p id="Par44">All dogs gained weight during the study.

Minimal to moderate acanthosis/hyperkeratosis of the overlying skin was observed (Group 2&#x02013;4). Minimal or slight acanthosis/hyperkeratosis in two Group 3 dogs and one Group 4 dog, and minimal to moderate ulceration of the skin (Groups 3 and 4) were also observed. Slight infiltrates of macrophages and an infiltrate of lipid within the axillary lymph nodes were noted in one control dog and all treated dogs. Axillary lymph node findings reflected drainage from the subcutaneous injection sites, therefore, they were considered secondary and not primary test article-related effects.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Clinical pathology and urinalysis</title><p id="Par48">Summary data for selected haematology and clinical chemistry are presented in Tables&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref> and <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>.

Finally, there was no effect of robenacoxib on the coagulation parameters (i.e., activated partial thromboplastin time, BMBT) similar to what has been previously reported for robenacoxib in both cats and dogs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par60">The clinical signs observed upon subcutaneous administration (twitching, scratching, licking or vocalization) were uncommon and, as they occasionally occur after subcutaneous injection in dogs, were not considered related to robenacoxib injectable or saline, but to the subcutaneous injection process itself.</p><p id="Par61">The incidence of macroscopic findings at the subcutaneous dose sites was greater in Groups 3 or 4 than in Groups 1 or 2. Following injection, severity was generally dose-related and the findings at the subcutaneous injection sites were consistent with the observations in a previous target animal safety study using only Onsior&#x02122; solution for injection (unpublished report). In this study, 6-month old healthy beagles were administered subcutaneously Onsior&#x02122; solution for injection formulation at 0 (control), 2, 6 and 20&#x000a0;mg/kg of robenacoxib during three dosing cycles of one subcutaneous injection per day for three consecutive days separated by 11-day washout time. A dose-dependent increased frequency of thickening scabbing, scarring, discoloration foci, accentuated vasculature, and subcutaneous haemorrhage at the injection site, were observed at necropsy. Subcutaneous inflammation was dose-dependent and a progressive resolution of subcutaneous lesions over time was evident. Thus, it can be concluded that the interchangeable use with Onsior&#x02122; tablets does not result in additional effects compared to use of Onsior&#x02122; solution for injection only.</p><p id="Par62">In the present study, none of these findings had a clinically significant effect on the health or well-being of the animals. Dogs were comfortable and healthy, bright, alert, and responsive, hydrated, and in good body condition, showing only some discomfort upon palpation of dose sites.</p><p id="Par63">The findings of lipid infiltrates and infiltrates of vacuolated macrophages in axillary lymph nodes were considered secondary treatment-related effects because they represented drainage of the necrosis and degeneration that occurred at the subcutaneous injection sites (including a control dog). Likewise, depletion of lymphocytes in the thymus may have been a secondary response and not a direct effect of the treatment.</p><p id="Par64">Toxicokinetic results confirmed consistent and appropriate exposure of the animals and thus allows conclusion to be made regarding the safety of interchangeable use. Further interpretation of the toxicokinetics in this study is made difficult by the limited sampling schedule. A maximum of three (one predose and two post dose) samples during a dosing interval is insufficient to accurately estimate C<sub>max</sub>, half-life, or AUC. No accumulation was observed in this 88-day study. Previous studies have shown robenacoxib to be eliminated in the dog with a half-life of less than 1&#x000a0;h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] therefore no accumulation would be expected with once daily dosing.</p><p id="Par65">The predicted levels of COX-1 and COX-2 inhibition in this study were derived from the concentrations observed at 1 and 5&#x000a0;h. In general, the maximum inhibition of COX-1 and COX-2 was observed at 1&#x000a0;h where high average inhibition of COX-2 (i.e., &#x02265; 79%) and limited inhibition of COX-1 (&#x02264; 41%) was predicted. The maximum predicted inhibition for COX-1 was 53%, in Group 4 (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab8" ref-type="table">8</xref>). Inhibition levels were higher when the blood concentrations were higher at 1&#x000a0;h after treatment, but without marked differences between the dose groups presumably because the concentrations achieved in all groups had saturated the enzyme and reflect maximum activity. Levels of COX-1 and COX-2 inhibition were decreased at 5&#x000a0;h compared to at 1&#x000a0;h corresponding to decreased blood concentrations. At these lower concentrations, the enzymes are not saturated and therefore at 5&#x000a0;h the level of inhibition was dose-dependent. The magnitude and duration of COX-1 inhibition needed to induce gastrointestinal toxicity is not known, however it was concluded in a previous study that approximately 50% inhibition of COX-1 for up to 3.5&#x000a0;h or 25% for up to 8&#x000a0;h was safe for robenacoxib and the canine gastrointestinal tract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. This is in alignment with the maximum inhibition of COX-1 predicted in the present study, in which gastrointestinal toxicity was not observed.</p><p id="Par66">The results of this study indicate that injections of robenacoxib can be safely administered instead of a tablet to a dog receiving oral therapy or that robenacoxib injection(s) can be followed by oral robenacoxib therapy. The microscopic findings in the gastrointestinal tract and the clinical signs and microscopic findings at the injection site were as expected based on a previous study with robenacoxib solution for injection alone (unpublished report) and the known properties of this class of compound and mode of administration. There were no safety concerns caused by the interchangeable use of the oral and injectable robenacoxib formulations. To our knowledge, this is the first publication showing results of a study designed to establish the interchangeable use of two formulations in veterinary medicine.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par67">This study supports the safe use of any combination of Onsior&#x02122; tablets or injectable once daily. There were no serious adverse events during the course of the study. No changes in body weight, food consumption, ophthalmic examinations, electrocardiograms, buccal mucosal blood times, clinical pathology or organ weight were attributable to robenacoxib administration. Primary treatment-related findings were confined to clinical signs upon subcutaneous administration, macroscopic and microscopic findings at the subcutaneous injection sites and microscopic findings in the gastrointestinal tract, typically seen with the individual use of oral or injectable robenacoxib or with this class of compound and mode of administration. It is concluded that alternating regimens of robenacoxib tablets and injection (Onsior&#x02122;) were well tolerated in healthy young dogs when administered once a day.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>AUC</term><def><p id="Par4">Area under the curve</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BMBT</term><def><p id="Par5">Buccal mucosal bleed times</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>C<sub>max</sub></term><def><p id="Par6">Maximum blood drug concentration</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>COX</term><def><p id="Par7">Cyclooxygenase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ECG</term><def><p id="Par8">Electrocardiogram</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FDA-CVM</term><def><p id="Par9">Food and Drug Administration&#x02019;s Center for Veterinary Medicine</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HPLC</term><def><p id="Par10">high-performance liquid chromatography</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>K2-EDTA</term><def><p id="Par11">Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid dipotassium</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LC-MS/MS</term><def><p id="Par12">Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LLOQ</term><def><p id="Par13">Lower limit of quantification</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NSAID</term><def><p id="Par14">Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PGE<sub>2</sub></term><def><p id="Par15">Prostaglandin E2</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SC</term><def><p id="Par16">Subcutaneous</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>T<sub>max</sub></term><def><p id="Par17">Time to maximum blood concentration following drug administration</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TxB<sub>2</sub></term><def><p id="Par18">Thromboxane B2</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VICH</term><def><p id="Par19">Veterinary International Conference on Harmonization</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank the personnel of Covance Laboratories Inc., Madison, Wisconsin, US for conducting the study.</p><sec id="FPar2"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par69">The study was funded by the Sponsor i.e. Novartis Animal Health which is now owned by Elanco Animal Health.</p></sec><sec id="FPar1"><title>Availability of data and material</title><p id="Par68">All data cannot be freely shared without control due to confidentiality.
