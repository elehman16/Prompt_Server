The Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials Statement recommends that multicenter randomized controlled trials (RCTs) should account for center effects in their analysis, however most do not. The Early External Cephalic Version (EECV) trials published in 2003 and 2011 stratified by center at randomization, but did not account for center in the analyses, and due to the nature of the intervention and number of centers, may have been prone to center effects. Using data from the EECV trials, we undertook an empirical study to compare various statistical approaches to account for center effect while estimating the impact of external cephalic version timing (early or delayed) on the outcomes of cesarean section, preterm birth, and non-cephalic presentation at the time of birth.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The data from the EECV pilot trial and the EECV2 trial were merged into one dataset. Fisher&#x02019;s exact method was used to test the overall effect of external cephalic version timing unadjusted for center effects. Seven statistical models that accounted for center effects were applied to the data. The models included: i) the Mantel-Haenszel test, ii) logistic regression with fixed center effect and fixed treatment effect, iii) center-size weighted and iv) un-weighted logistic regression with fixed center effect and fixed treatment-by-center interaction, iv) logistic regression with random center effect and fixed treatment effect, v) logistic regression with random center effect and random treatment-by-center interaction, and vi) generalized estimating equations.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>For each of the three outcomes of interest approaches to account for center effect did not alter the overall findings of the trial.

Multicenter trials are often used to accumulate large sample sizes in a short time period, or to meet sample size requirements that would be impossible within one center. The inclusion of different centers and providers is beneficial in pragmatic trials as it allows for the greater generalizability of trial results. However, the potential variation between centers poses methodological issues. Each center needs to rigorously follow the study protocol, particularly around inclusion and exclusion criteria, and the application of the intervention to reduce heterogeneity and allow for outcome results to be pooled. Furthermore, accurate reporting of the characteristics of the centers involved in the study can allow readers to assess the risk of bias and the usefulness of the results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>The assumption made in many multicenter trials is that participants recruited to the trial are independent of each other. This assumption of independence is necessary to apply routine statistical methods such as the Student&#x02019;s t-test or chi-squared test. However, management of individuals within the same trial center may be similar, leading to the potential of outcomes from these individuals being correlated with each other. It is not hard to imagine that intervention success rates could differ from one center to the next due to any number of combinations of practitioner experience, nursing support and expertise, medical equipment, and center-specific treatment practices. When trial centers are in different international locales, the dissimilarities could be magnified. The correlation of outcomes among individuals within a study center is a type of clustering described as a center effect. If center effects are overlooked, incorrect effect estimates, confidence intervals, and <italic>P</italic> values may be the result [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>Many RCTs test non-pharmacologic treatments such as surgery, technical procedures, devices, rehabilitation, psychotherapy, behavioral interventions, and complementary and alternative medicine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. A review of all RCTs published in 2000 revealed that 10% of RCTs are for surgical or procedural interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. These trials have specific issues compared to pharmacologic trials because treatments are less standard and blinding is more difficult [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The group responsible for the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) Statement published an extension of the Statement to specifically guide researchers involved in RCTs of non-pharmacologic treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The Statement identifies center characteristics such as provider skill and center volume that could impact patient outcomes. Since clustering of outcomes at study centers may reduce statistical power, the CONSORT group recommends accounting for clustering in sample size calculations and in statistical analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>Despite the development of statistical methods to account for center effect and the recommendations by trial reporting guidelines, evidence from reviews of the literature indicate that most individually randomized multicenter trials do not account for center effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Biau <italic>et al</italic>. conducted a systematic review of the account of center and provider effects in large surgical and interventional (non-pharmacological) RCTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. A total of 68 multicenter interventional randomized trials of more than 200 patients between the years 2000 and 2005 met the inclusion criteria. They found that stratification by center at randomization was reported in 38% of trials and analysis adjusted for center was reported in 6% of trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Tangri <italic>et al</italic>. published a similar systematic review of the literature to assess the extent of adjustment for center in RCTs of medicinal products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. They included 101 multicenter RCTs published in 2007 in four prominent medical journals. Of the 101 trials, 36% used random allocation stratified by center, and 18% adjusted for center in the statistical analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Both reviews concluded that improvements to trial reporting regarding center effects are needed. However, the literature provides little guidance and does not suggest one preferred statistical method to account for center effects. In fact, there is a lack of evidence on which models perform best in various situations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>The objective of this secondary analysis was to use a combined dataset of the Early External Cephalic Version (EECV) trials to demonstrate the use of available statistical methods to account for center effects in multicenter trials. The EECV trials had many centers and the main outcomes were binary. We reviewed the literature for statistical approaches - both population-averaged and random-effects models - which might fit with these study characteristics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. We estimated the effect of external cephalic version (ECV) timing (early or delayed) on the outcomes of cesarean section, preterm birth, and non-cephalic presentation at the time of birth without accounting for center, and then assessed the consistency of the results under different methods of accounting for center.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>The Early External Cephalic Version trials</title><p>ECV is an obstetric procedure undertaken during pregnancy to attempt to manually turn a fetus through the maternal abdomen from the breech (buttocks down) presentation to a cephalic (head down) presentation. The pilot and full EECV trials were multicenter RCTs aimed at investigating the effectiveness of beginning ECV earlier in pregnancy (conducted between 34 weeks and 0 days and 35 weeks and 6 days gestation) compared to the usual timing of ECV at full term (37 weeks and 0 days or beyond) on pregnancy outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. At the time of the EECV trials, nearly all fetuses in the breech presentation at term or at the onset of labor were born by cesarean section. The primary outcome was the rate of cesarean section and the secondary outcome was the rate of preterm birth. The study measured overall success of the ECV procedure by including the rate of non-cephalic presentation at delivery as another outcome.</p><p>Eligible participants were women with a singleton breech fetus at a gestational age of 33 weeks and 6 days to 35 weeks and 6 days. Participants were randomly assigned to have the first ECV procedure early or delayed, with stratification by center and parity to ensure approximately equal numbers of early and delayed ECVs at each center, as well as balance the number of multiparous women (a known predictor of ECV success) in each group at each center.</p><p>Ethical approval was obtained for both the pilot trial (The University of Toronto Office of Research Services) and the EECV2 trial (The University of British Columbia Clinical Research Ethics Board, reference number: C04-0348 and the Research Ethics Board of Hamilton Health Sciences Research Ethics Board, reference number: 07-122). Furthermore, ethical approval was obtained from each of the sites where the recruitment took place. Informed consent was obtained from each woman who was enrolled in the trial.</p><p>The planned analysis called for Fisher&#x02019;s exact test to assess the relationship between the exposure (timing of ECV procedure) and the primary and secondary outcomes (cesarean section and preterm birth). The effects of the intervention were reported using relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Subgroup analyses were completed using logistic regression to test for interactions between baseline characteristics and treatment group for the primary and secondary outcomes. None were found to be significant.</p><p>The EECV pilot trial recruited 233 women from 25 centers in 7 countries. There were non-significant decreases in the rates of cesarean section (RR 0.90; 95% CI 0.76 to 1.08; <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.32) and non-cephalic presentation at birth (RR 0.86; 95% CI 0.70 to 1.05; <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.09) for women in the early ECV group. There was a non-significant increase in the rate of preterm birth for women in the early ECV group (RR 1.42; 95% CI 0.56 to 3.59; <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.31) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The clinically important findings of the EECV pilot trial supported the funding of a full-scale RCT.</p><p>The EECV2 trial recruited 1543 women from 68 centers in 21 countries. Women in the early ECV group were less likely to have a non-cephalic presentation at delivery (RR 0.84; 95% CI 0.75 to 0.95; <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.002), but the decrease in the cesarean section rate remained statistically non-significant (RR 0.93; 95% CI 0.85 to 1.02; <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.12), and the trend for an increase in preterm birth was strengthened, though still not statistically significant (RR 1.48; 95% CI 0.97 to 2.26; <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.07) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The data from the EECV pilot trial and the EECV2 trial were merged using SPSS IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA (version 19.0); SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA (version 9.2) and R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria (version 2.12.2) were used for the statistical analyses. Participants were excluded from analysis if they withdrew from the trial, if they were lost to follow-up, or if there was missing data for the outcomes of interest: mode of delivery, gestational age at birth, or presentation at birth (cephalic versus non-cephalic) (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>

The methods are broadly grouped as conditional and unconditional methods as follows. No further research ethics approval was required to conduct this secondary analysis.</p><sec id="Sec4"><title>Conditional methods</title><p>Conditional methods estimate treatment effects by stratifying (or conditioning) on center. These methods are appropriate for multicenter trials in which participants are randomly assigned to different treatment arms within each center [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Conditional methods can be subdivided into fixed- and random-effects models. A fixed-effects analysis considers a center to represent only itself, while a random-effects analysis represents the population of centers from which the study sample was drawn [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Accounting for center as both a fixed and random effect produces a single estimate of treatment effect if the treatment effect is assumed to be constant across centers. If the treatment effect is suspected to be different across centers, altering the model to include treatment-by-center interaction can improve the model&#x02019;s fit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Trials that test procedural interventions, such as the EECV trials, may be more likely to have heterogeneity of treatment effects across trial centers due to the difficulty of standardizing and administering the procedural intervention in a consistent manner across study sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Such heterogeneity may be reduced when a strict study protocol is followed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The interaction that occurs when trial sites have different treatment effects is also known as effect modification.</p><p>We used six different conditional methods to account for center in the EECV trials. Four are fixed-effects approaches: i) the Mantel-Haenszel test, ii) logistic regression with fixed center effect and fixed treatment effect, iii) logistic regression with fixed center effect and fixed treatment-by-center interaction (weighted by center size), and iv) logistic regression with fixed intercept and fixed treatment-by-center interaction (un-weighted by center size). Two are random-effects models: v) logistic regression with random center effect and fixed treatment effect, and vi) logistic regression with random center effect and random treatment-by-center interaction. Models including treatment-by-center interaction as either fixed (iii and iv) or random effect (vi) allow for possible effect modification in the EECV trials. The models are described briefly below.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Mantel-Haenszel test</title><p>The Mantel-Haenszel test is a fixed-effects analysis that summarizes data into a series of two&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;two tables based on covariates or strata. The Mantel-Haenszel test is often used when the trial has binary response variables and only two treatment groups; however, it has been generalized to analyze 2(response)&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;J(exposure) tables [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The Mantel-Haenszel test performs well even with sparse data and is suitable for studies like the EECV trials that have many centers and few participants per center [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The simplicity of the Mantel-Haenszel test is considered an advantage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Centers that had only one participant were removed from the analysis.

It achieves this by including a separate intercept for each center as a fixed effect, restricting the inference of the results to included centers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The model works best when there are many participants spread across few centers. Unreliable estimates can occur when the majority of centers have few patients and few events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].

The Mantel-Haenszel test used data from 78 out of 81 centers after the three centers that enrolled only one woman were removed from the analysis. For the three fixed-effects regressions, centers had to be removed from analysis if all the participants at that center were in one treatment group, or if all the participants experienced the same outcome. The removal of these centers was necessary because the statistical model is constructed only with centers that provide sufficient statistics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Differing numbers of centers were removed from the analysis for the three outcomes of interest. A total of 71 centers representing 1739 participants were included for the outcomes of cesarean section and non-cephalic presentation at birth; 46 centers representing 1434 women were included for the outcome of preterm birth. Further centers were removed from analysis when the treatment-by-center interaction term was added to the fixed-effects regression model due to zero counts in the interaction term. For the outcome of cesarean section, 57 centers representing 1655 women were included, for preterm birth 14 centers representing 646 women were included, and for non-cephalic presentation at birth, 57 centers representing 1649 women were included in the analysis. The models, including a random-effects term and the GEE, were run with the entire dataset.

For cesarean section, the ICC was 0.036, for preterm delivery the ICC was 0.014, and for non-cephalic presentation at birth the ICC was 0.048. These values suggest that the power to detect a treatment effect could be underestimated by approximately 0.5 to 4.0% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec21" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Seven statistical models, available in the statistics literature, were applied to data from the EECV trials to provide researchers with an empirical example of accounting for center in a multicenter trial with binary outcomes. While population inference is the goal of clinical research, assuming that individuals recruited to a center are independent of others at the same centre may reduce the statistical power needed to show a treatment effect when the clustering of outcomes occurs. Our results show how changing statistical assumptions can confirm the magnitude of the treatment effect and builds on previous works addressing statistical analysis in multicenter trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p>As we applied statistical models to adjust for center effect, issues arose that may be of interest to researchers attempting similar adjustment. Low-recruiting centers were problematic in the application of fixed-effects logistic regression models. Centers that contain only patients of one treatment group or experiencing only one type of outcome event need to be removed. Since patients at small centers provide little information to overall treatment effect, removing them may not cause a problem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and this was confirmed in our results. However, when an interaction term is added to the equation, further centers need to be dropped, particularly for rare outcomes, and the resultant findings display low precision. We also illustrated the effect that weighting (or not weighting) by center size has on the logistic regression with fixed center effect and fixed treatment-by-center interaction. Our results for the un-weighted model have the widest CIs and most different effect estimates than any other model, confirming the work of Senn that weighting small and large centers equally can actually increase the variation around the estimate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>GEE was the one unconditional method applied to the dataset. GEE uses covariance matrices and/or structures to estimate correlation within centers that are inherently weighted to center size. GEE was well suited to the EECV trial data where there were many centers and the center size varied widely. The small difference between results from the GEE approach and the conditional methods may be partly explained by the non-collapsibility of ORs with non-null treatment effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p>Missingness in the EECV trial dataset used in this study was unlikely to have influenced the results of these analyses because it was not substantial. When the outcome is missing completely at random, GEE yields consistent estimators of the regression parameters, provided the model for the mean is correctly specified. Likelihood-based methods such as random-effects models may be a better alternative when missingness is at random [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. When missingness depends on the unobserved outcomes, none of the methods can guarantee an unbiased estimate of effect.</p><p>This secondary analysis adds to the knowledge base regarding center effect in multicenter RCTs. A study by Kahan and Morris [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] looked at clustering in individual randomized trials by using both a case study and a simulation. They concluded that clustering by recruitment center is &#x02018;non-ignorable&#x02019; when both patient outcomes and treatment assignments are correlated within clusters. Their simulation indicated that adjusting for center gave correct type 1 error rates. In future research trials, protocols ought to include plans to account for center effect, especially as starting with the sample size calculation as the magnitude of center effect can even change the sample size required [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec22" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Awareness of the center effect in multicenter RCTs is growing as literature describing its occurrence accumulates. We conducted a secondary analysis of the EECV trials - large obstetric trials that included many centers with a wide range of recruitment rates in various international locales - to adjust for center effect. Our results did not change the overall conclusions of the EECV trials, however, adjusting for center effect increases confidence in the results by illustrating the robustness of the study findings under different statistical assumptions. This secondary analysis provides an example to support clinical researchers in their pursuit to adjust for center effect in the design, analysis, and interpretation of multicenter RCTs.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-list><def-item><term>CONSORT</term><def><p>Consolidated standards of reporting trials</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CI</term><def><p>Confidence interval</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ECV</term><def><p>External cephalic version</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EECV</term><def><p>Early External Cephalic Version</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICC</term><def><p>Intra-class correlation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GEE</term><def><p>Generalized estimating equation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OR</term><def><p>Odds ratio</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCT</term><def><p>Randomized controlled trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RR</term><def><p>Relative risk.</p></def></def-item></def-list></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>AR conducted the analyses with RC and JT.
