trunk stabilization exercise on different support surfaces. [Subjects and Methods] Sixteen
stroke patients with onset of stroke six months earlier or longer were randomly and
equally assigned to group I (exercise performed on a stable support surface) and group II
(exercise performed on an unstable support surface). The two groups conducted the trunk
stabilization exercises on the respective support surfaces, in addition to existing
rehabilitation exercises five times per week for 12 weeks. Changes in the cross-sectional
area (CSA) of the muscles were examined using computed tomography (CT), and changes in the
balance ability were assessed using a measuring system and the trunk impairment scale
(TIS). [Results] In group I, there was a significant increase in the CSA of the mulifidus
muscle on the side contralateral to the brain lesion and in the paravertebral and
multifidus muscles on the side ipsilateral to the brain lesion. In group II, there was a
significant increase in the CSA of the paravertebral and multifidus muscles on the side
contralateral to the brain lesion and on the side ipsilateral to the brain lesion. In
terms of changes in balance ability, the sway path (SP) and TIS significantly improved in
group I, and the SP, sway area (SA), and TIS significantly improved in group II .
[Conclusion] Exercise on the unstable support surface enhanced the size of the
cross-sectional area of the trunk muscles and balance ability significantly more than
exercise on the stable support surface.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Cross-sectional areas</kwd><kwd>Trunk control</kwd><kwd>Balance</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The trunk is the center of the body, and it plays a postural role in functional movement by
preparing the body for the movement of the extremities against gravity. It also plays an
active role in smoothing the movement of the center of gravity, and it enables ease of
movement into a new posture<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Balance is
the result of interactions among the visual system, vestibular system, proprioceptive
system, musculoskeletal system, and cognitive ability. Balance maintenance is a very
important element for safe and independent performance in ordinary life of movements and
walking<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Stroke patients suffer from balance disability due to abnormalities in the proprioceptive
system, sensory system, trunk muscles, and muscles of the limbs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Stroke often
causes paralysis on the affected side as soon as it occurs, decreasing the adjustment
ability of the trunk<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. In particular, reduction in the activity of the muscles of the
trunk reduces movement of the pelvis, leading to the development of asymmetry of the trunk,
and preventing use of strategies protecting against the risk of balance loss<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>A previous study evaluated the trunk muscles of stroke patients and normal age-matched
controls using a hand-held dynamometer and found that stroke patients&#x02019; bilateral lateral
flexors were weaker<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. A study that used an
isokinetic dynamometer reported that trunk flexors, extensors, and bilateral rotators were
weakened in stroke patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Stroke patients experience weakened trunk
muscles on the unaffected side, as well as the affected side. Therefore, evaluation of the
trunk should be made on the affected and unaffected sides.</p><p>Verheyden et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref><sup>)</sup> conducted trunk
exercise on a stable support surface with subacute stroke patients and reported that the
functions of their trunks improved. Bayouk et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref><sup>)</sup> observed that exercise on different support surfaces had a positive
influence on subacute stroke patients. Shumway-Cook et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref><sup>)</sup> noted that an unstable support surface stimulated the sensory
system and the motor system more than a stable support surface, effectively changing
postural orientation ability and aiding postural strategies. Until now, clinical evaluation
tools for the assessment of stroke patients&#x02019; trunks have been used. However, changes in
scores are difficult to interpret. And an additional problem is the potential subjectivity
of the evaluators. In contrast, morphological study through computed tomography (CT) enables
visual identification of muscles and is quantitative and objective<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Accordingly, in the present study we examined the changes in the cross-sectional area of
the trunk muscles using CT and investigated how trunk stabilization exercise affects balance
ability. This study also aimed to establish a scientific basis for an effective trunk
muscle-training environment for stroke patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title> Characteristics of study participants</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Parameters</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Group I (n=8)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Group II (n=8)</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (years)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">53.4&#x000b1;5.8</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">52.4&#x000b1;7.6</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Sex (male/female)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5/3</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4/4</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Time since onset (months)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">17.9&#x000b1;4.3</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">18.1&#x000b1;4.2</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Affected side (right/left)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4/4</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3/5</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Cause (hemorrhage/ischemic)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2/6</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3/5</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Trunk Impairment Scale (0&#x02013;23)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">15.80&#x000b1;3.99</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">14.20&#x000b1;4.26</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Modified Ashworth Scale (n) </td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1+</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>All data are expressed as means with standard deviation (SD).</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>The study subjects were 16 stroke patients.

When the trunk exercise was
initiated, the therapist provided a moderate level of aid and gradually reduced the level
of support. The number of exercise repetitions and the intensity were based on reducing
the base of support, increasing the lever arm, advancing the balance limits, or increasing
the hold time<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>CT was used to measure the cross-sectional area of the trunk muscles. A cushion was
placed beneath the knees with subjects in the supine position, and even weight was
maintained on both sides. In this position, the lumber 4 upper end plate, where the
curvature angle is smallest and precise imaging is possible, was scanned. A CT 5-mm scan
was obtained at a power of 120 kV and 240 mA for 1 second (matrix 512 &#x000d7; 512 pixels). In
the cross-sectional area of the muscles, the multifidus, deep muscle, paraspinal muscle,
and superficial muscle were measured. Analysis after the measurement was performed on the
regions of interest using a picture archiving and communication system. The images were
enlarged to 152.28% to enhance the visibility of the circumference of each muscle. A
drawing was made along the contour surfaces, avoiding fat, skeletal structure, and other
soft tissues. The sum of the cross-sectional areas of the muscles was then automatically
calculated by the computer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Balance ability was measured using BioRescue (RM Ingenierie Co., France). Static balance
ability, sway path (SP) and the sway area (SA) were measured with the subjects looking to
at the front for 60 seconds on the plate, with their eyes open. To determine the dynamic
balance ability, the average speed of the sway (SAP) was measured during rotation of 180
degrees on the plate<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. For the
clinical assessment, the trunk impairment scale (TIS) was used to evaluate the static,
dynamic, and coordination ability of the trunk in the sitting position<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>For the statistical analysis, SPSS version 12.0 for Windows was used. The independent
t-test was used to compare the cross-sectional areas of the muscles on the side
contralateral and ipsilateral to the brain lesion, before and after the trunk
stabilization exercises, and the differences in the cross-sectional area and balance
ability between the two experimental groups. The paired t-test was used to analyze the
size of the cross-sectional area and the balance ability in each group, before and after
the trunk stabilization exercises. The statistical significance level was chosen as at

during different activities<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. However,
hemiplegic patients have muscle function loss and resulting balance disorder, which disrupts
their daily lives<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. To resolve this
problem, there are many therapeutic approaches to motion relearning and voluntary adjustment
used in rehabilitation treatment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. A few
hypotheses have been presented as to the cause of trunk muscle weakening in stroke patients.
Neurological control of the trunk is dominated by the bilateral cerebral hemispheres, and a
lesion on one side may affect both sides of the trunk. Trunk muscle weakening has been
attributed to insufficient mobilization of high-threshold motor units and disuse of
muscles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. In hemiplegic patients, the
weakening of muscle strength is not severe compared to that of the muscles of the
extremities. However, trunk muscles on the paretic and the non-paretic sides are
weakened<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>To improve the strength of the trunk muscles, the abdominal muscles, and the multifidus
muscles, the small muscles of the vertebrae need to be harmoniously activated<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. These muscles are tonic or postural
muscles and the muscle imbalance necessary for the stability of the trunk and for postural
adjustment is improved during whole body exercise<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>When improving the strength of the trunk muscles, an increase in the cross-sectional area
of the trunk muscles does not occur during the first four weeks of exercise. The observed
increase in muscle strength is due to adaptation in the neurological system. The increase in
the strength of the muscles owing to an increase in the cross-sectional area of the muscles
occurs eight weeks after the start of exercise<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. This study conducted trunk stabilization exercises for 12 weeks on
a stable support surface (group I) and on an unstable support surface (group II), with
stroke patients whose onset of stroke had occurred six months earlier or longer and
determined the effects of the changes in cross-sectional areas of subjects&#x02019; trunk muscles
and their balance.</p><p>The tensile force exerted by the muscles exhibits performance of muscle strength in
proportion to the cross-sectional area if neurological adaptation is unaffected<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, in the present study, the
subjects had diseases of the central nervous system. Thus, changes in the cross-sectional
area of their trunk muscles may not haven been proportionate to changes in muscle strength.
Nevertheless, changes in the cross-sectional area may serve as an index that indicates
changes in the muscles.</p><p>Using CT, this study analyzed the cross-sectional areas of the multifidus, deep stabilizer
muscles and the paravertebral, superficial stabilizer muscles by dividing them into those on
the side contralateral to the brain lesion and thosed on the side ipsilateral to the brain
lesion. The results show that the cross-sectional area of the trunk muscles on the side
contralateral to the brain lesion significantly increased after the exercise. Ferbert et
al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref><sup>)</sup> conducted transcortical magnetic
stimulation on one hemisphere of normal subjects and the recorded motor evoked potential
(MEP) on the bilateral paravertebral. Fujiwara et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref><sup>)</sup> conducted transcortical magnetic stimulation on the cerebral
hemisphere of stroke patients on the non-paretic side. They found that changes in the MEP of
the paravertebral muscles on the contralateral side to the brain lesion were more
significant than those of normal subjects. Another study showed that compensatory activities
through uncrossed pathways of the unaffected hemisphere are involved in functional recovery
of the trunk<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In the present study, the strength of the trunk muscles improved in the two groups. The
results for group I were similar to those of Verheyden et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref><sup>)</sup> who conducted trunk exercise on a stable support surface for stroke
patients. Comparing the two groups, the improvement in the multifidus, deep muscles, of
group II showed the most significant difference. This result suggests that exercise on an
unstable support surface is more effective at activating the trunk muscle tissue than that
on a stable support surface. In other words, diverse movement on an unstable support surface
appears to provide postural perturbation enhancing the maintenance of desired postures<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><table-wrap id="tbl_004" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 4.</label><caption><title> Changes of balance between control and experimental group (Mean&#x000b1;SD)</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="2" colspan="2">Parameters</td><td align="center" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Group I</td><td align="center" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Group II</td></tr><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pre</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Post</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pre</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Post</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="2" colspan="1">Static balance</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">SP (mm)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">233.90&#x000b1;85.20</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">181.90&#x000b1;56.74<sup>*</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">253.40&#x000b1;73.45</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">207.90&#x000b1;59.13<sup>*</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">SA (mm<sup>2</sup>)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">241.10&#x000b1;64.41</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">194.60&#x000b1;90.20</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">252.70&#x000b1;49.89</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">212.70&#x000b1;50.26<sup>*</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Dynamic balance</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">SAP (mm/s)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">239.00&#x000b1;70.61</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">209.30&#x000b1;42.48</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">231.30&#x000b1;64.27</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">204.60&#x000b1;57.84</td></tr><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">TIS (score)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">15.80&#x000b1;3.99</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">17.60&#x000b1;3.24<sup>*</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">14.20&#x000b1;4.26</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">17.90&#x000b1;2.88<sup>**</sup></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>The paired t-test was used to compare differences in each group before and after the

lower than that of group I after the exercise. Thus, the trunk stabilization exercises on
the unstable support surface seem to have produced a balanced adjustment in the performance
of the muscles on the side contralateral to the brain lesion and on the side ipsilateral to
the brain lesion. Voluntary efforts to maintain the desired postures during exercise on an
unstable support surface may stimulate activation of the bilateral cerebral cortex.</p><p>A recent posturographic analysis reported that stroke patients tended not to move the
center of the body to the paretic side while in the sitting and standing positions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref><sup>)</sup>. Accordingly, we examined the effects of changes in the
cross-sectional area of the trunk muscles on balance (<xref rid="tbl_004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Balance was enhanced in both groups after the exercise, demonstrating
that improvement in proximal trunk adjustment plays a role in improving balance ability.
Verhetden et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref><sup>)</sup> also noted that there
was positive association between trunk adjustment and balance after stroke. The static
balance and the balance ability in the sitting position showed more improvement in group II
than in group I. In a posturographic analysis, Messir et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref><sup>)</sup> observed that the lower trunk movements of stroke patients were very
limited and that their upper trunk movements were also limited, reducing balance. In the
present study, exercise on the unstable support surface improved lower trunk muscle
adjustment, increasing the stability of the pelvis and affecting the mobility of the upper
trunk and distal lower extremities, thereby improving balance. Therefore, exercise on an
unstable support surface provides a superior environment for trunk muscle exercises for
stroke patients by increasing the cross-sectional areas of the trunk muscles and improving
balance ability.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Ryerson</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Byl</surname><given-names>NN</given-names></name><name><surname>Brown</surname><given-names>DA</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Altered trunk position sense and its relation to balance
