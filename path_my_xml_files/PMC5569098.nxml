However, their impact on the gut&#x02019;s bacterial microbiota remains uncertain. We characterised the intestinal microbiota in 6&#x02013;11 month-old infants in India who received a 3-day course of azithromycin or placebo during a randomised trial of oral poliovirus vaccine immunogenicity (CTRI/2014/05/004588). In 60 infants per study arm, we sequenced the V4 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene in stool samples collected before and 12 days after finishing treatment. We also tested for the presence of common bacterial, viral, and eukaryotic enteropathogens in the same samples using real-time PCR in a Taqman array card (TAC) format. Azithromycin induced a modest decline in microbiota richness and a shift in taxonomic composition driven by a reduction in the relative abundance of Proteobacteria and Verrucomicrobia (specifically <italic>Akkermansia muciniphila</italic>). The former phylum includes pathogenic strains of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and <italic>Campylobacter</italic> spp. that declined in prevalence based on the TAC assay. These findings differ from previous observations among older children and adults in Europe and North America, suggesting that the effects of azithromycin on the bacterial microbiota may be specific to the age and geographic setting of its recipients.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">The use of antibiotics continues to rise globally. Numerous concerns have been raised regarding the long-term sequelae of this trend, including threats to populations, such as the emergence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens, and threats to individuals, such as an increased risk of metabolic disorders, asthma, and inflammatory bowel disease, among others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Perturbations of the gut&#x02019;s bacterial microbiota appear to be key to the long-term effects of antibiotic exposure. In particular, studies in mice have revealed that early-life treatment with a &#x003b2;-lactam or macrolide may lead to accelerated growth, delayed microbiota maturation, and a diminished capacity of the microbiota to respond to changes in diet<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">With upwards of 8 billion individual doses administered each year, macrolides such as azithromycin and clarithromycin are among the most widely prescribed antibiotics globally<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. In a recent cohort of 2&#x02013;7 year-old children in Finland, treatment with a macrolide within the preceding 6 months was associated with a reduction in the diversity and relative maturity of the bacterial microbiota, as well as an increase in macrolide resistance genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. However, few previous studies have considered the influence of macrolide exposure on the composition of the bacterial microbiota within the context of placebo-controlled clinical trials using antibiotics. Moreover, given that significant geographic variation occurs in microbiota composition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, the influence of a given antibiotic on the gut&#x02019;s bacterial community may differ markedly from population to population.</p><p id="Par4">We recently performed a randomised placebo-controlled trial in Vellore, India, to examine the impact of a 3-day course of oral azithromycin on the immune response to a subsequent dose of monovalent type 3 oral poliovirus vaccine among seronegative 6&#x02013;11 month-old infants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Antibiotic treatment significantly reduced the prevalence of potentially pathogenic intestinal bacteria as well as the levels of several faecal biomarkers of intestinal inflammation and permeability, including calprotectin, myeloperoxidase, and &#x003b1;1-antitrypsin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Here, we assess the extent to which azithromycin influenced the composition of the bacterial microbiota in these infants by sequencing the V4 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene in DNA extracted from stool and testing for the presence of specific pathogen gene targets using PCR in a TaqMan array card (TAC) format. In addition, we report on the impact of age on microbiota composition.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>The bacterial microbiota progresses towards a more &#x02018;adult-like&#x02019; composition between 6 and 11 months of age</title><p id="Par5">We sequenced the V4 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene in 120 infants, including 60 azithromycin recipients and 60 placebo recipients. For each infant, we assessed stool samples collected before and 12 days after completion of a 3-day course of treatment (study days 0 and 14, respectively). We also included samples from 40 adults cohabiting with trial participants to provide a population-specific baseline of the mature (adult) bacterial microbiota. After quality filtering, we obtained an average of 14,685 (standard deviation 2,386) sequences per sample across the 240 infant samples and 40 adult samples that were tested. These sequences spanned 820 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) with &#x02265;97% nucleotide identity, of which 265 were present in infants and 677 were present in adults.

Indeed, in the study population as a whole, the proportion of infants harbouring &#x02265;1 bacterial, viral, or eukaryotic enteropathogen was 662/704 (94%) and 636/704 (90%) at days 0 and 14, respectively. Meanwhile, diarrhoea was observed in 13/704 (2%) infants at each timepoint, and did not differ according to study arm at day 0 (7/347 [2%] vs 6/357 [2%] for azithromycin and placebo recipients, respectively; Fisher&#x02019;s test, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.786) or day 14 (3/347 [1%] vs 10/357 [3%]; Fisher&#x02019;s test, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.090).

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par16">Azithromycin inhibits the growth of numerous Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, and is widely used to treat infections of the respiratory tract, urogenital tract, and skin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Antibacterial mechanisms are varied, encompassing the inhibition of protein synthesis, the disruption of quorum sensing, and interference with adherence to host cells, among other<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Activity extends to several common bacterial enteropathogens &#x02013; in the present study, azithromycin had both a therapeutic effect (among infants infected on day 0) and a prophylactic effect (among uninfected infants) lasting for at least 12 days after the cessation of treatment. It is likely that the latter reflects, in part, the extended half-life of azithromycin in mucosal tissues (2&#x02013;4 days)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. The extracellular release of azithromycin by macrophages and neutrophils (in which the macrolide achieves high concentrations) also appears to be dependent on the presence of bacteria at a site<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. In spite of the significant reductions in pathogen burden observed among azithromycin recipients in this study using sensitive molecular detection methods, it is notable that the majority of infections occurred in the absence of diarrhoea and are thus of equivocal clinical significance. During a recent observational cohort study in Vellore, antibiotic treatment of diarrhoea was associated with a decrease in the median interval to a child&#x02019;s next diarrhoeal episode<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Thus, the short-term reduction in pathogen burden observed following azithromycin treatment may not translate to a longer-term protective effect against diarrhoea.</p><p id="Par17">Although the antimicrobial effects of azithromycin have been studied in relation to pathogenic bacteria, little is known regarding the impact of this drug on the bacterial microbiota as a whole, particularly during infancy. We observed a ~7% reduction in bacterial microbiota richness and a shift in composition 12 days after a 3-day course of treatment. Random Forest models based on microbiota composition were somewhat effective at distinguishing infants according to study arm after azithromycin treatment, but their predictive accuracy was surprisingly limited given the recency of antibiotic exposure. The relatively modest treatment effect that we observed may in part reflect the normalisation of the microbiota after the cessation of antibiotics, as well as the fact that OTUs in several phyla (including Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Firmicutes) were largely unaffected by azithromycin. The observed discrepancies in taxonomic composition according to study arm were driven primarily by the azithromycin-induced depletion of Proteobacteria (in particular the dominant genus <italic>Escherichia</italic>) and <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> (phylum Verrucomicrobia).</p><p id="Par18">Our results differ from recent findings from Europe and North America regarding the impact of macrolides on microbiota composition. Korpela <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> observed a significant decrease in the relative abundance of Actinobacteria and a corresponding increase in Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes among 2&#x02013;7 year-old Finnish children exposed to azithromycin or clarithromycin within the preceding 6 months (although in agreement with our study an increased abundance of the genus <italic>Streptococcus</italic> in response to macrolide exposure was also reported). Meanwhile, Abeles <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> documented the depletion of Erysipelotrichaceae, Veillonellaceae, and Clostridiales (all members of the phylum Firmicutes) among US adults following a 3- or 7-day course of azithromycin as opposed to placebo. <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> is a mucin-degrading species of Gram-negative bacteria that has been suggested to play an important role in adipose tissue homeostasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> and prevention of intestinal inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. An increased abundance of this taxon has been observed following the treatment of adults with a range of non-macrolide antibiotic regimens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> and of mice with the veterinary macrolide tylosin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. However, while we observed <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> in 20% of azithromycin recipients on day 0, it was entirely absent from the post-treatment samples of these infants. Notably, these changes occurred in conjunction with a decrease in the levels of several faecal biomarkers of intestinal inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par19">The discord between previous findings and our own likely reflects discrepancies in trial setting and age of participants &#x02013; both of which markedly alter the baseline composition of the microbiota upon which azithromycin has the potential to act &#x02013; as well as time since antibiotic exposure. Indeed, the phylum Proteobacteria had a mean relative abundance of 17% at baseline in the present study, but had a low abundance (&#x0003c;5%) in the majority of children in the study by Korpela <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. This phylum also contains enteroaggregative <italic>E. coli</italic>, <italic>Campylobacter</italic>, and several of the other bacterial enteropathogens that declined in prevalence following azithromycin treatment in the present study. In addition to differences in baseline composition of the bacterial microbiota, the prevalence of antibiotic resistance genes (the &#x02018;resistome&#x02019;) may differ markedly among populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. These differences may play an important role in shaping the effect of antibiotic exposure on microbiota composition.</p><p id="Par20">Azithromycin did not significantly influence microbiota age, which we assessed among infant samples by measuring their mean Unifrac distance from adult samples. Previous findings regarding the impact of antibiotics on microbiota maturity have been mixed &#x02013; while antibiotic exposure within the preceding 7 days did not influence relative microbiota maturity among infants in Bangladesh<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, a decrease in microbiota maturity was apparent up to 2 years after macrolide exposure in the aforementioned Finnish cohort<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Similarly, early-life antibiotic exposure in mice resulted in delayed maturation of the bacterial microbiota<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Given that the effects of azithromycin were assessed just 12 days after the cessation of treatment, we cannot rule out a longer-term impact of antibiotic exposure on the developmental trajectory of the microbiota in the present study population.</p><p id="Par21">Several limitations of this work should be acknowledged. Biases in amplification efficiency and discriminatory power arise when profiling the bacterial microbiota using amplicon sequencing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Although these could have been exacerbated in the present study through the use of non-degenerate primers rather than degenerate primers that target somewhat more bacterial taxa (such as those used by Caporaso <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>), the taxonomic distributions we obtained from mock communities of known composition were largely consistent with those previously attained using degenerate V4-specific primers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Perhaps more importantly, our sequencing pipeline captures changes in the relative (rather than absolute) abundance of bacterial taxa at a given sequencing depth. We may therefore have failed to describe changes in absolute abundance of the bacterial microbiota in azithromycin recipients. As noted above, the short-term effects of azithromycin captured in our study may differ from the longer-term sequelae of antibiotic exposure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Finally, by focusing on changes in microbiota diversity and composition of the bacterial microbiota, we may have failed to capture changes in the functional capacity of the microbiome following azithromycin treatment, including the potential emergence of macrolide resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> and the alteration of metabolic phenotypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par22">Overall, our findings revealed a modest effect of azithromycin on the composition of the bacterial microbiota among 6&#x02013;11 month-old infants in south India. Although azithromycin brought about a decrease in microbiota diversity and a reduction in the abundance of several taxa, antibiotic treatment did not appear to influence the relative maturity of the bacterial microbiota. In addition, the bacterial taxa most affected by azithromycin differed markedly from those identified in previous studies of macrolide exposure in Europe and North America. Thus, changes in composition of the bacterial microbiota following treatment with a given antibiotic appear to be highly specific to the age and geographic setting of its recipients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Study population</title><p id="Par23">A full description of the design, laboratory methods, and primary outcomes of the study has previously been published<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.
