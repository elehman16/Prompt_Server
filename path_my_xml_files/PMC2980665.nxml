Continuous epidural analgesia is the most versatile and most commonly employed technique, because it can be used for pain relief during labor and for subsequent vaginal delivery as well as analgesia and anesthesia for cesarean section, if necessary.</p><p>Various nonpharmacological methods and pharmacological method of providing labor analgesia have been used. Regional analgesia is widely used for providing labor analgesia. Regional techniques present the most flexible, effective, and least depressant options when compared with parenteral and inhalation techniques. Spinal analgesia provides short duration of action. This technique will not be able to provide adequate analgesia for the whole duration of labor. Newer techniques such as combined spinal-epidural, continuous epidural infusions, walking epidurals and patient controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA) are now available.</p><p>Fentanyl and sufentanil most commonly used in combination with local anesthetics were found to be effective in providing labor analgesia. Studies comparing fentanyl and sufentanil in labor analgesia are few and give conflicting results. Many investigators have advocated using epidural doses of sufentanil considerably greater than one tenth of the commonly used epidural dose of fentanyl.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT3">3</xref>]</p><p>Hence, we did a study to compare the efficacy between fentanyl and sufentanil combined with low concentration (0.0625%) of bupivacaine for epidural labor analgesia.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>The study was conducted on 50 full term parturient women of ASA status I and II of mixed parity who were willing for epidural analgesia during labor. The women included in the study had singleton pregnancy with vertex presentation with cervical dilatation of 3&#x02013;4 cm and had no contraindication to epidural analgesia.</p><p>The study was undertaken after Institutional Ethical Committee approval and informed written consent was obtained. Before administration of the epidural block demographic data, parity, gestational age condition of the membrane, cervical dilatation, vital parameters, and fetal heart rate were noted and preloading with 500 ml of ringer lactate was done. Epidural block was given after 3&#x02013;4 cm cervical dilatation in sitting or lateral position L2-4 interspace with 18 G Touhy&#x02019;s needle. Loss of resistance to air was used for localization of epidural space. The multi-orifice No. 18 Portex catheter was inspected for its patency and threaded through the needle gently till 3&#x02013;4 cm length of the catheter is in the epidural space. All the patients received an initial bolus dose of a 10 ml solution containing 0.125% bupivacaine. The patients were randomly divided into two groups according to computer generated randomization.</p><p>Group F:-0.0625% bupivacaine with 2.5 mcg/ml fentanyl Group S:-0.0625% bupivacaine with 0.25 mcg/ml sufentanil</p><p>The continuous infusion of the study was started at the rate of 12 ml/h after 30 minutes of the initial loading bolus. If analgesia was inadequate, an additional bolus of 5 ml of 0.125% bupivacaine was supplemented after 20 minutes of the initial bolus. The continuous infusion was started using a syringe infusion pump. The infusion was increased or decreased by 2 ml/h and if needed, administered up to two additional 5 ml boluses of 0.125% bupivacaine to provide a pain score of less than 3.</p><p>Pain relief was assessed at 20 minutes and then hourly by an observer (who was unaware of the group) using Verbal Analog Scale of 0&#x02013;10, where 0=no pain and 10=worst pain. Highest level of sensory block, degree of motor block (Bromage Scale), number of additional supplements by anesthetist, total dose of bupivacaine consumed per hour and during the labor, mode of delivery and neonatal Apgar scores were recorded. SpO<sub>2</sub>, heart rate and BP were monitored throughout the labor. FHR was monitored continuously using cardiotochograph. Any adverse effect such as weakness of limbs, hypotension, arterial desaturation, and pruritus were noted and managed if required.</p><p>Data were analyzed using INSTAT 3 (GraphPad Software, CA, USA). The data are presented as mean&#x000b1;SD or % or number of patients. Sample size of 50 with 25 patients in each group with power of study 80% to detect a statistically significant difference in the verbal analogue pain score.

Opioids are commonly being used in combination with local anesthetic drugs through central neuraxial route for labor analgesia. Opioids help in reducing the minimum analgesic dose and concentration of local anesthetic agent given epidurally<sup>4</sup> and helps in preserving maternal ambulation throughout the process of labor by avoiding motor block. A continuous infusion of a dilute mixture of local anesthetics and opioids offers the advantage of stable level of analgesia, increased maternal hemodynamic stability, less risk of systemic local anesthetic toxicity and slower ascend of level of anesthesia, in case of intravascular or intrathecal migration of the catheter. Both fentanyl and sufentanil[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT5">5</xref>] were found to have dose sparing effect on bupivacaine when coadministered epidurally.</p><p>Both the groups provided equivalent labor analgesia and maternal satisfaction. The chances of cesarean delivery were also not increased in any group. No difference in the cephalad extent of sensory analgesia, motor block or neonatal Apgar score were observed. Although mean pain scores throughout the labor and delivery were similar in both groups, more patients in the fentanyl group required supplementary boluses though not statistically significant.</p><p>Our dosing regimen is consistent with various studies,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT6">6</xref>] which used similar dosing regimen.</p><p>A recent report by the American Society of Anaesthesiologist (ASA) task force on Obstetric Anaesthesia concluded that pain relief itself is enough an indication to use epidural analgesia and that cervical dilatation at the time of epidural administration does not impact the outcome of labor.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT7">7</xref>] In our study, we appropriately timed to induce epidural analgesia at the early stage after the diagnosis of the active phase of first stage of labor was established.</p><p>Other studies[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT9">9</xref>] observed no difference in total dose of bupivacaine required between fentanyl and sufentanil group like ours. In contrast, Cohen <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT8">8</xref>] reported that patients receiving sufentanil required less total dose of bupivacaine than those receiving fentanyl.</p><p>In the present study, the number of additional supplementary bupivacaine top ups was comparatively less in sufentanil group though not statistically significant different. Cohen <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT8">8</xref>] reported similar finding. However some other studies[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT11">11</xref>] observed no difference in requirement of number of supplementary bupivacaine top-up injections between sufentanil and fentanyl groups.</p><p>The pain scores during the first and second stage of labor were comparable without any significant difference between both the groups [Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">2</xref>].The side effects were comparable in both the groups, number of breakthrough pain episodes requiring interventions were similar in both the groups. The following studies,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT12">12</xref>] are consistent with our studyand they observed excellent and comparable pain relief with both fentanyl and sufentanil.
