applied before resistance exercises by examining changes in stress hormone levels with
vibrations applied before different exercise intensities. [Subjects] Eighteen male
subjects in their 20s were included, and were randomly divided into one-repetition maximum
(1RM) 50% group (50% RMG, n = 6), 1RM 70% group (70%RMG, n = 6), and 1RM 90% group (90%
RMG, n = 6). [Methods] Three sets of Smith squats were performed at 1RM 50%, 70%, and 90%
according to resistance intensities, and vibrations were applied for 1&#x02005;min at a fixed
frequency of 30&#x02005;Hz before each set. Epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine stress
hormone levels were analyzed. [Results] Epinephrine levels were significantly higher
immediately after exercise than at rest in the 50%RMG; however, no significant changes
were noted in the 70%RMG and 90%RMG. Norepinephrine levels were significantly higher
immediately after exercise than at rest in all three groups. However, no significant
changes in dopamine levels were noted in the three groups. [Conclusion] The application of
vibrations at a frequency of 30&#x02005;Hz before 70%RM and 90%RM resistance exercises suppressed
increases in the stress hormone epinephrine levels immediately after exercise.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Muscle resistance exercise</kwd><kwd>Vibration</kwd><kwd>Stress hormone</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Resistance exercise helps improve the strength of all the muscles of the body and can be
performed continuously at any location. Well-designed resistance exercise programs have been
reported to effectively improve muscle strength and the ability to perform exercise,
increase fat-free mass, and decrease body fat<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. The most important aspect of resistance exercise is identifying the
appropriate intensity for the exercise, and repetition maximum (RM) is most frequently
determined for identifying the appropriate intensity. During resistance exercises, 1RM
should be changed depending on exercise intensities in order for the exercise to be
effective<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Resistance exercise at 80%
RM or higher are classified as muscle strengthening exercise, that at 75% RM as muscle
strength exercise, and that at 60% RM as muscle endurance exercise. Although resistance
exercises at 70&#x02013;80% RM are effective for muscle strength enhancement in beginners, those at
85% RM or higher are effective for muscle strength enhancement in experts<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, resistance exercises performed
without considering a participant&#x02019;s ability can result in injury. The degrees of muscle
damage are similar during high-, medium-, and low-intensity resistance exercises<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, different degrees of muscle damage
have been reported to occur according to the type of muscle resistance exercise, the degree
of muscle contraction, and exercise load<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Based on the findings of studies on muscle damage, muscle fatigue, and changes in hormone
levels after muscle resistance exercise, studies that aim to minimize side effects after
exercise should be performed. Vibrations of muscles before exercise have positive effects on
motor skill improvement, and are used to increase the metabolic and blood flow rates of
individuals in the fields of sports and rehabilitation<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. The effects of vibrations vary with frequency, and frequencies of
15&#x02013;50&#x02005;Hz have been reported to promote oxidation, increase oxygen uptake, help blood
circulation, and raise skin temperature<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>One study reported that muscle pain reduced after stretching on a machine vibrating at a
frequency of 35&#x02005;Hz before resistance exercises<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Another study with 20 adults showed that blood flow through the
quadriceps femoris and gastrocnemius increased with the application of vibrations, which
caused the inflow of blood into the muscles<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Additionally, a study reported that muscle pain and creatine
phosphokinase (CPK) level decreased significantly with the application of vibrations at a
frequency of 50&#x02005;Hz before treadmill exercise<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Although studies on the positive effects of vibrations on muscles have been performed, no
study has evaluated the effects of vibrations before resistance exercise at different
intensities on the levels of stress hormones. Therefore, the purpose of the present study
was to determine whether vibrations should be applied before resistance exercise by
examining changes in stress hormones levels with the application of vibrations resistance
exercises at different intensities.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The present study included 18 healthy male subjects in their 20s, having less than 6 months
of experience in weight training and residing in K City, South Korea. The subjects were
randomly divided into 1RM 50% group (50%RMG, n = 6), 1RM 70% group (70%RMG, n = 6), and 1RM
90% group (90%RMG, n = 6). Subjects in the 50%RMG had a mean age, height, and weight of 21.5
&#x000b1; 2.42&#x02005;years, 170.2 &#x000b1; 6.68&#x02005;cm, and 71.1 &#x000b1; 14.11&#x02005;kg, respectively. Those in the 70%RMG had a
mean age, height, and weight of 22.3 &#x000b1; 2.40&#x02005;years, 172.9 &#x000b1; 6.14&#x02005;cm, and 70.5 &#x000b1; 7.23&#x02005;kg,
respectively. Additionally, those in the 90%RMG had a mean age, height, and weight of 21.12
&#x000b1; 2.13&#x02005;years, 172.1 &#x000b1; 5.35&#x02005;cm, and 70.38 &#x000b1; 6.35&#x02005;kg, respectively. The subjects voluntarily
participated in the study after receiving explanations about the intent and purpose of the
study. The three groups had no statistically significant differences of physical
characteristic of subjects such as age, height, body weight and body fat (p &#x0003c; 0.05);
therefore, the groups were homogeneous. The Smith squat exercise for resistance training was
used to examine changes in the levels of stress hormones with the application of vibrations
before resistance exercises at the following intensities: 1RM 50% (maximum number of
repetitions &#x02265;30), 1RM 70% (maximum number of repetitions 12&#x02013;15), and 1RM 90% (maximum number
of repetitions 3&#x02013;4). The subjects performed three sets of Smith squats, and vibrations were
applied for 1&#x02005;min before each set. A vibratory apparatus Sky Life-SM290 (Maxton, Korea)
capable of frequencies of 2&#x02013;60&#x02005;Hz was used. The frequency was fixed at 30&#x02005;Hz, and vibrations
were applied at knee flexion to sufficiently stimulate the quadriceps femoris and
gastrocnemius. Blood was collected at rest, immediately after exercise, and 24&#x02005;h after
recovery from exercise to analyze levels of the stress hormones epinephrine, norepinephrine,
and dopamine. To examine changes in the levels of the stress hormones in each group, one-way
repeated ANOVA was performed using SPSS 20.0 for Windows on the basis of the levels at rest
in each group. The significance level &#x003b1; was set at 0.05. All of the subjects understood the
purpose of this study and provided written informed consent prior to their participation in
the study in accordance with the ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Epinephrine levels were significantly higher immediately after exercise than at rest in the

cortisol levels, and epinephrine and norepinephrine are considered representative
catecholamines<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Epinephrine and norepinephrine levels increase when the sympathetic system is activated by
physical activities. During exercise, epinephrine is secreted from the adrenal medulla and
norepinephrine from the sympathetic terminal<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. The major function of epinephrine includes promoting
glycogenolysis and lipolysis during energy metabolism, and norepinephrine is a precursor of
epinephrine, which is secreted from the sympathetic terminal to function as a
neurotransmitter. The arterial plasma levels of these two hormones are known to continuously
increase with exercise time and intensity. Epinephrine levels do not increase during
low-intensity exercise not involving mental stress, and its levels increase when oxygen
uptake rises to at least 60% of the maximum oxygen uptake. Norepinephrine levels increase at
exercise intensities that increase oxygen uptake to &#x0003e;50% of the maximum oxygen uptake,
and its levels have been reported to increase by up to six times those at rest during
maximum intensity exercise<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore,
measurement of the levels of stress hormones help evaluate the degree of physiological
stress in the body according to the intensity of resistance exercise, and enable the
identification of changes in the levels after vibrations are applied. In the present study,
epinephrine levels were significantly higher immediately after exercises than at rest in the
50%RMG (p &#x0003c; 0.05), and no significant changes in these levels were noted in the 70%RMG
and 90%RMG. Therefore, the application of vibrations at a frequency of 30&#x02005;Hz before the
70%RM and 90%RM resistance exercises did not result in significant changes in epinephrine
levels immediately after exercise.</p><p>The use of vibrations at frequencies of 20&#x02013;50&#x02005;Hz is recommended because vibrations at
frequencies below 20&#x02005;Hz induce excessive relaxation of muscles and those at frequencies over
50&#x02005;Hz cause muscle pain<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. In general,
vibration of muscles at 25&#x02013;45&#x02005;Hz is used to increase muscle strength and mass<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>, and the application of vibrations has
been reported to have positive effects on the muscle function recovery of delayed-onset
muscle soreness<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The positive effects of vibrations on muscles can be explained by neurophysiological
factors<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. Vibrations suppress
interneuronal activities of the skin and spinal cord receptors that reduce pain signals
crossing &#x003b1;-exercise nerves and C fibers and instead cause the migration of these signals to
the spinal cord and brain<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition,
vibrations have been shown to affect capillary vessels and reduce lactic acid levels<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>, and a study has presented the mechanism
underlying the activation of the neuromuscular system that may improve the ability of the
neuromuscular system to function appropriately<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. The activation of muscle spindle receptors with vibrations has
been reported to have positive effects not only on the directly stimulated muscles but also
on the surrounding muscles.<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup> A study of
29 male subjects who ran downhill for 40&#x02005;min reported that the levels of the inflammatory
markers IL-6 and histamine, as well as muscle pain in the femoral region decreased
significantly in the group in which vibrations were applied before the run<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. On the basis of the results, vibrations
of muscles before activities may help reduce epinephrine levels. In the present study,
vibrations applied at a frequency of 30&#x02005;Hz before 70%RM and 90%RM resistance exercises
suppressed increases in epinephrine levels immediately after exercise. In the future,
studies on the effects of vibrations on muscles and the areas of application should be
performed by using different intensities of resistance, frequencies of vibration, and
physiological variables.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Faigenbaum</surname><given-names>AD</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Strength training for children and
