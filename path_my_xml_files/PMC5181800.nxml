Among these methods, pretreatment with lidocaine with venous occlusion is the most effective method in preventing pain following propofol injection.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> However, unfortunately this treatment could not abolish the pain. It is reported that the amount of free propofol in the aqueous phase of the emulsion is positively associated with injection pain. Therefore, propofol long-chain triglycerides (LCT)/medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) was introduced in attempts to prevent injection pain by reducing the concentration of aqueous-free propofol.<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> However, pain can occur up to 47% during injection of propofol-LCT/MCT.<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> It was demonstrated that pretreatment with lidocaine with venous retention before injection of propofol LCT or lidocaine premixed in propofol LCT were more effective in reducing pain than a more expensive reformulation of propofol-LCT/MCT.<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup></p><p>Pregabalin, a synthetic molecule derived from gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) inhibitor, has anticonvulsant and analgesic effects. Pregabalin is recommended as first-line treatments for neuropathic pain disorders.<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> In addition, this agent is known to be effective for treatment of incisional inflammatory pain. Many studies demonstrated that preoperative administration with pregabalin effectively decreased pain severity and opioid requirement after various surgeries.<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> However, up to date, there is no study about the effect of pregabalin on pain following propofol injection. Therefore, we evaluated the effect of pretreatment with oral pregabalin 75 and 150&#x0200a;mg on pain from propofol injection, compared with intravenous lidocaine 40&#x0200a;mg with venous occlusion.</p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec><label>2.1</label><title>Patients and exclusion criteria</title><p>A total of 120 patients (20&#x02013;60 years) with American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I or II were studied.

On arrival at the operating room, standard monitoring devices including noninvasive blood pressure, electrocardiogram, and pulse oximetry were applied, and a 22-ga cannula was placed into the vein on the dorsum of the nondominant hand. After venous occlusion using a rubber tourniquet, patients in group LP and HP received 2&#x0200a;mL of normal saline and patients in group L received 2&#x0200a;mL of 2% lidocaine intravenously, respectively. A physician who was not involved in this study prepared identically coded syringes. After 1 minute, venous occlusion was released and propofol 0.5&#x0200a;mg/kg was administered at the rate of 0.5&#x0200a;mL/s using syringe pump.<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> Pain following propofol injection was assessed by a study blinded anesthesiologist using a 4-point scale: 0&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;no (negative response to questioning), 1&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;mild pain (pain reported only in response to questioning without any behavioral signs), 2&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;moderate pain (pain reported in response to questioning and accompanied by a behavioral signs or pain reported spontaneously without questioning), and 3&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;severe pain (strong vocal response or response accompanied by facial grimacing, arm withdrawal, or tears).<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> Thereafter, propofol 1.5&#x0200a;mg/&#x0200a;kg was administered for induction of anesthesia. After loss of an eyelash reflex, rocuronium 0.8&#x0200a;mg/kg was injected and tracheal intubation was performed.

Pregabalin 150&#x0200a;mg was compatible with intravenous lidocaine 40&#x0200a;mg with venous retention for preventing propofol injection pain. There were no differences in the incidence of side effects such as headache, dizziness, and drowsiness between groups.</p><p>Lipid emulsion propofol is commonly used for sedation and induction of general anesthesia. But pain from propofol injection is one of the most common adverse effects, which often distresses patients.<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> The exact mechanism of pain on propofol injection is unclear. The pain following propofol injection is thought to arise from direct stimulation of nociceptive receptors or free nerve ending in the vessels by free propofol molecules.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> In addition, free propofol activates the kallikrein kinin system which releases inflammatory factors such as bradykinin, resulting in increase of permeability and dilation of vein. In this bradykinin-modified vein, contacts between free propofol and free nerve ending increases, leading to pain on injection.<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> Pretreatment with various drugs including lidocaine, opioid, and nitroglycerin have been tried for the prevention of injection pain. By a systematic review conducted in 2000, pretreatment with lidocaine 40&#x0200a;mg plus venous occlusion was suggested as the most effective intervention for preventing pain on propofol injection.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> Pretreatment with lidocaine plus venous occlusion decreases injection pain by local anesthetic effect on vein and stabilizing the kinin cascade. However, this cannot completely alleviate pain following propofol.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> Propofol LCT/MCT which contains lower concentration of free propofol than standard propofol was introduced to reduce injection pain.<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> However, despite of pretreatment with lidocaine, pain still occurs during injection of propofol-LCT/MCT.<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup> In the previous study, when premixed with lignocaine, there was no difference in the incidence of pain between propofol LCT and propofol LCT/MCT.<sup>[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup></p><p>The fundamental mechanism of action of pregabalin is the reduction of release of calcium by binding to &#x003b1;2-&#x003b4; subunit of calcium channels, which inhibit excitatory neurotransmitter including glutamate and increase neuronal GABA levels.<sup>[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup> In addition, it was found that opioid spinal pathway is involved in the analgesic actions of pregabalin in mice.<sup>[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup> Recently, it has been used as a multidimensional analgesia for postoperative pain in various surgeries including dental, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, and spine surgery.<sup>[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup></p><p>Orally administered pregabalin is rapidly absorbed with maximum plasma concentrations attained with 1.3 hours and has a bioavailability of 90% with elimination half-life of 6 hours.<sup>[<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup> Therefore, in the present study, oral pregabalin was administered 2 hours before general anesthesia. Dizziness and drowsiness are common side effects of pregabalin.<sup>[<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup> The previous studies demonstrated that premedication with pregabalin 150&#x0200a;mg could be optimal dose for improving postoperative analgesia without an increase of adverse effects.<sup>[<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</sup> In the present study, pretreatment with 150&#x0200a;mg pregabalin was effective in reducing propofol injection pain, which was comparable with pretreatment with lidocaine 40&#x0200a;mg with venous retention. In addition, there was no significant differences in the incidence of side effects of pregabalin such as drowsiness and dizziness between groups.</p><p>The present study had some limitations. First, placebo group was not examined to determine the baseline incidence of pain following propofol injection. Pain during propofol injection is a common clinical problem.<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> Therefore, in this study, it was considered unethical that patients given propofol did not receive prophylactic analgesics. Second, in this study, premedication was not administered, which could affect pain on injection of propofol. The incidence of postoperative recall of this pain was about 50% to 87% if sedative or anxiolytic premedication was not given.<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</sup> The recall of pain during injection of propofol can decrease patient's satisfaction with anesthetic care.<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> Therefore, another study will be required to investigate the postoperative recall for this pain.</p><p>In conclusion, pretreatment with oral pregabalin 150&#x0200a;mg and intravenous lidocaine 40&#x0200a;mg with venous occlusion equally reduced pain from propofol injection.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: GABA = gamma-amino butyric acid, LCT = long-chain triglycerides, MCT = medium-chain triglycerides.</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>[1]</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Dundee</surname><given-names>JW</given-names></name></person-group>
