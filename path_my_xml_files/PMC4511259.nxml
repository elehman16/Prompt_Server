In the absence of curative treatment, current therapy centers on renoprotective interventions that reduce proteinuria and fibrosis. The FONT (Novel Therapies for Resistant FSGS) Phase II clinical trial (NCT00814255, Registration date December 22, 2008) was designed to assess the efficacy of adalimumab and galactose compared to standard medical therapy which was comprised of lisinopril, losartan, and atorvastatin.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Key eligibility criteria were biopsy confirmed primary FSGS or documentation of a causative genetic mutation, urine protein:creatinine ratio &#x0003e;1.0&#x000a0;g/g, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &#x0003e;40&#x000a0;ml/min/1.73&#x000a0;m<sup>2</sup>. The experimental treatments &#x02013; adalimumab, galactose, standard medical therapy-- were administered for 26&#x000a0;weeks. The primary endpoint was a 50&#x000a0;% reduction in proteinuria with stable eGFR.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Thirty-two subjects were screened and 21 were assigned to one of the three study arms. While none of the adalimumab-treated subjects achieved the primary outcome, 2 subjects in the galactose and 2 in the standard medical therapy arm had a 50&#x000a0;% reduction in proteinuria without a decline in eGFR. The proteinuria response did not correlate with serial changes in the serum glomerular permeability activity measured by the P<sub>alb</sub> assay or soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR). There were no serious adverse effects related to treatments in the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Recruitment into this trial that addressed patients with resistant FSGS fell short of the enrollment goal. Our findings suggest that future studies of novel therapies for rare glomerular diseases such as FSGS may benefit from enrollment of patients earlier in the course of their disease. In addition, better identification of patients who are likely to respond to a new treatment based on biomarkers suggesting involvement of the disease pathway targeted by the experimental agent may reduce the required sample size and increase the likelihood of a favorable outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12882-015-0094-5) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>FSGS</kwd><kwd>Galactose</kwd><kwd>Adalimumab</kwd><kwd>Renoprotective</kwd><kwd>Antifibrotic</kwd><kwd>Permeability factors</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is an important cause of nephrotic syndrome in children and adults and accounts for a sizable number of patients who develop end stage kidney disease (ESKD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. FSGS can be primary, genetic, or secondary to a wide range of clinical conditions including obesity, HIV infection, medications, or reflux nephropathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Regardless of the underlying etiology, podocyte dysfunction and loss are considered the pivotal events in the pathogenesis of the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Current therapy involves administration of corticosteroids as first-line treatment. Administration of an agent that blocks the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis to lower proteinuria is standard of care in patients with primary or secondary FSGS. In those who fail to respond to steroids, calcineurin inhibitors are the next step in treatment. However, a significant number of patients with FSGS are resistant to corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive medications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In the recently completed FSGS Clinical Trial, fewer than half of the patients responded to either cyclosporine (44&#x000a0;%) or a combination of oral dexamethasone pulses and mycophenolate mofetil (33&#x000a0;%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Patients who fail to achieve a significant reduction in proteinuria after treatment with currently available therapeutic options are at high risk of progressing to ESKD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Moreover, in those who require a kidney transplant, nearly 25&#x000a0;% manifest recurrent disease in their renal allograft [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. These findings underscore the pressing need to develop new treatments for primary idiopathic or genetic FSGS that are safe and well tolerated.</p><p>The FONT (Novel Therapies for Resistant FSGS) study was a combined Phase I/II clinical trial designed to test new treatments for patients with refractory FSGS. In the absence of a defined molecular mechanism of disease, the overall objective was to assess antifibrotic agents that would decrease proteinuria and reduce glomerular sclerosis progression. Based on the preclinical and clinical findings implicating the tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; (TNF) and peroxisome proliferator activator-&#x003b3; (PPAR&#x003b3;) pathways in FSGS, the trial was originally designed to compare standard conservative therapy (SCT) <italic>versus</italic> SCT plus adalimumab <italic>versus</italic> SCT plus rosiglitazone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Because of patient concerns about potential adverse cardiovascular consequences of rosiglitazone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], oral galactose supplementation was substituted for rosiglitazone. This replacement was made based on pre-clinical and clinical data indicating that galactose neutralizes the activity of a circulating FSGS permeability factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. This report summarizes the clinical outcomes of the FONT trial and highlights difficulties that are encountered in the performance of randomized clinical trials in nephrology.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The FONT II trial was a Phase I/II open-label RCT designed to select treatments that are worthy of further study in randomized Phase III studies.

Testing for podocyte gene mutations was not required prior to enrollment in the FONT II trial because renal fibrosis is an intrinsic feature of primary FSGS, regardless of whether or not there is a defined genetic mutation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Screening and run in phase</title><p>In this phase, subjects were placed on the maximal tolerated doses of lisinopril, losartan, and atorvastatin, based on reports of adverse effects and measurements of blood pressure, serum K<sup>+</sup>, creatinine, liver enzymes, and cholesterol concentrations. The doses of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi)/angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) treatment had to be stable for a minimum of 2&#x000a0;weeks prior to randomization. No specific recommendations were made regarding daily dietary sodium or protein intake and this was left to the discretion of the site investigator.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Study medications</title><p>All subjects received standard conservative medical therapy consisting of a combination of the following three agents: 1) lisinopril: 2) losartan; and 3) atorvastatin.

Oral administration of this monosaccharide achieved at least a 50&#x000a0;% reduction in proteinuria in 3 out of 7 or 42&#x000a0;% of the treated subjects, 2 of whom maintained a stable eGFR. It is difficult to interpret the response to galactose therapy in response to the serial measurements of the circulating level of the sugar. Although there was no significant change in serum galactose concentration over the course of the study, this is not unexpected because galactose is rapidly metabolized to glucose. In addition, the serum galactose concentration was measured at arbitrary times and we did not standardize blood sampling in relationship to the oral dosing schedule (trough level or fixed interval after ingesting the monosaccharide). However, the consistent decrease in P<sub>alb</sub> in all subjects who received galactose suggests that all of the subjects adhered to the assigned treatment and is consistent with prior experience with the sugar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. There was no evidence of adverse effects related to the use of galactose and future studies of this agent may benefit from a stable formulation that is already prepared ready for use. Our findings are somewhat at variance with the data of Sgambat et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] who administered galactose to 7 pediatric subjects with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (2 with post-transplant FSGS), none of whom achieved a reduction in proteinuria despite a fall in P<sub>alb</sub>. Differences in age, confirmation of the diagnosis of FSGS, by renal biopsy, and inclusion of patients with recurrent disease may account for the modest differences between this negative report and our findings.</p><p>It is worth noting that while 0 out of 7 subjects who were assigned to adalimumab in the FONT trial achieved a favorable response to treatment, 4 out of 10 subjects who received adalimumab over 16&#x000a0;weeks in FONT I had at least a 50&#x000a0;% decline in proteinuria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Preliminary data from the NEPTUNE cohort study indicate that there is genomic evidence of TNF activation in a subset of patients with primary FSGS (unpublished observations). It is plausible that future efforts to delineate a molecular signature of TNF activation may be useful in identifying individual patients with FSGS who are more likely to respond to a TNF antagonist. It is becoming increasingly apparent that primary FSGS is a heterogeneous disorder with some cases representing a genetic disorder of the podocyte and others arising from alterations in the integrity of the glomerular barrier due to a circulating factor (see below). It is anticipated that in the future, improved efforts to characterize patients based on their underlying genetic and molecular profiling will facilitate better selection of patients who have a greater likelihood of responding to a targeted therapy. Two out of the 7 subjects who were assigned to conservative medical therapy also achieved a 50&#x000a0;% reduction in proteinuria, which supports the need to include this control arm in any prospective trial of a novel therapeutic agent in patients with resistant FSGS.</p><p>There are several features about the FONT study design that are worthy of note. The entry criterion, Up/c&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;1, is lower than a cut-off value of 2 used in most studies. As such, it might appear to be less stringent than the usual definition of partial response, namely a 50&#x000a0;% decline in proteinuria from an initial value exceeding 2. The definition used in this trial was an extension of the entry criterion into the FSGS Clinical trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In fact, the mean Up/c was 4.9 and exceeded 2 in all cases. Moreover, using a cut-off of Up/c&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;2 did not alter the results. The study was open label because of a reluctance to implement sham injections in children. However, because the primary outcome involved objective laboratory measurements, it is unlikely that this influenced the outcomes of the trial.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Permeability biomarkers - P<sub>alb</sub> and suPAR concentration</title><p>Our data suggest that the permeability factors that are defined by the P<sub>alb</sub> bioassay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and the currently available suPAR ELISA kits are distinct entities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. While P<sub>alb</sub> decreased with galactose administration in every subject after 8&#x000a0;weeks, suPAR levels were unchanged throughout the cohort regardless of treatment. In the analyzed samples, there was no correlation between these two potential biomarkers or between either marker and the proteinuria response. Moreover, neither measurement in isolation fully accounted for the persistence or decline in proteinuria in this study. This finding is in contrast to earlier studies which suggested that elevated suPAR levels may be a biomarker for primary FSGS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Recent data suggest that full length suPAR may cause proteinuria in the presence of specific antibodies, e.g. auto-antibodies against CD40, in patients who develop recurrent FSGS after receiving a kidney transplant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. A similar 2-hit process may be involved in the pathogenesis of proteinuria in response to other putative circulating factors. We urge caution in interpreting our data about P<sub>alb</sub> and suPAR in this study because of the limited sample size and the collection of samples fairly late during the course of disease in these subjects with refractory FSGS. Further prospective studies are needed involving patients with all types of glomerular disease including FSGS to determine the prognostic implications of these circulating factors and their role in the pathogenesis of proteinuria and kidney injury.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Problems with Clinical Trials in FSGS</title><p>It is recognized that nephrology ranks near the bottom among medical specialties in the performance and completion of clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Enrollment into the FSGS Clinical Trial that served as the antecedent to the FONT Trial was below expectations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Poor subject comprehension of the adverse consequences of CKD, the adverse effects of many proposed treatments, and the high incidence of rapid decline in kidney function in patients with refractory proteinuria are among the explanations that have been offered to account for low enrollment into nephrology studies and specifically trials of glomerular diseases. It is likely that all of these factors contributed to the low recruitment into the FONT trial. Problems with subject recruitment underscore the need to create an infrastructure for clinical research and to design pragmatic trials that can be implemented in a timely manner to test potential treatments in patients with rare diseases like FSGS.</p><p>Two additional and specific factors may have played a role in limiting recruitment into the FONT Trial. First, by restricting the enrollment to patients who had failed steroids and at least one other immunosuppressive medication, we preselected for those with established disease of several years duration. These patients may be at very high risk of rapid deterioration in kidney function compared to patients evaluated soon after the onset of the disease. In fact, several of the treatment resistant subjects who were offered participation in the study experienced a rapid decline in GFR during the screening period and became ineligible. These observations suggest that it may be prudent to consider clinical trials of novel therapies earlier in the course of glomerular disease with persistent proteinuria. Such patients may have more reversible anatomic changes to glomeruli and the interstitium and their renal function may be more likely to remain stable during the course of the screening evaluation and experimental treatment period. Second, this trial transpired during a period when rosiglitazone and adalimumab were each receiving intense scrutiny because of reports of serious adverse events. Specifically, the FONT trial study was launched almost simultaneously with the publication of a meta-analysis that suggested that rosiglitazone increased the risk of cardiovascular complications in adults receiving the drug for the management of type 2 diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Although the FDA never questioned the rationale for testing thiazolidinediones in patients with resistant FSGS, the ongoing adverse publicity surrounding the use of PPAR-&#x003b3; agonists dampened patient willingness to be randomized to that arm. As a consequence, we replaced rosiglitazone with galactose, a test agent with no known adverse effects. In addition, a report appeared at nearly the same time linking the adalimumab to the occurrence of serious infections and malignancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. This diminished physician enthusiasm for adalimumab as a treatment arm in FONT even though the adverse consequences of adalimumab were documented in patients who receiving adalimumab in conjunction with other immunosuppressive drugs as treatment for rheumatological diseases. A follow-up report substantially downgraded the level of risk associated with adalimumab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Finally, it is unclear what impact subject perception of a randomization scheme that compared an oral treatment thought to have minimal risk (galactose) to an injectable drug with a well-defined risk profile had on enrollment. Some potential participants expressed concern about a perceived imbalance in risk between the study arms and voiced a strong preference for galactose. They may have declined to participate in the trial without assurance that galactose was the test therapy they would receive. These observations remind us that clinical trials occur in a real world context and enrollment can be seriously impacted by a wide range of extraneous factors, some that are beyond the control of the investigative team and others that can be addressed during protocol development.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec23" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The FONT Trial provides data that must be considered as hypothesis generating rather than hypothesis testing due to the small sample size. Our findings suggest that adalimumab is not a viable agent for further study in patients with resistant FSGS. However, taking into account the combined results of the Phase I (4 out of 10 subjects had a 50&#x000a0;% reduction in proteinuria in response to a 16-week course of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]) and Phase II studies of adalimumab, additional investigation may be warranted to determine if a subgroup of subjects with TNF associated disease can be identified who would benefit from treatment with inhibitors of the cytokine. Galactose also appears to be of potential value because of proteinuria reduction and preservation of kidney function in some subjects as well as its ease of administration and excellent side effect profile. However, future testing will be necessary and may be strengthened by better delineation of the relationship between P<sub>alb</sub> and fibrosis and enrollment of patients with earlier disease. Implementation of alternative study designs such as adaptive clinical trials or &#x0201c;n-of-1&#x0201d; trials may be useful to assess response to novel treatments in patients with rare conditions such as FSGS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. It is not justified to proceed to a formal Phase II or III trial of either adalimumab or galactose in a non-selected cohort of patients with resistant FSGS based on the findings of the FONT study. The results add to the body of evidence that suggests that future trials of novel agents in FSGS will benefit from a selected cohort approach where patients with a particular mechanism of disease are enrolled into trials of agents that are directed to the active target. The inclusion of a control or standard therapy arm remains mandatory. FSGS includes a constellation of diseases categorized by common pathology features. Standard therapies have approached these diseases as a single entity with the trialing of a series of therapies until a response occurs or futility is reached following multiple drug failures. This FONT trial launched with Phase I in 2008 and Phase II in 2009 and was designed to test novel therapies in individuals with multi-drug resistance. While these treatment resistant patients assuredly need better therapies, a contemporary approach based on molecular profiling of an individual patient may improve the selection of initial target-based therapy. Benefits of a targeted approach may also minimize the cumulative drug related toxicities that accompany sequential therapies observed in these patients. Making the transition to precision medicine will require partnership with patients, clinicians, investigators, and the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries for target identification, trial design, early phase drug development and drug testing. Finally, a greater willingness on the part of clinicians and patients will be required to engage in the process of discarding drugs with poor risk-benefit profiles while testing promising agents early in the disease course.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec24"><title>Additional file</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12882_2015_94_MOESM1_ESM.docx" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1: Table S1.</label><caption><p>Font trial: comparison of proteinuria responder <italic>versus</italic> resistant subjects.</p></caption></media></p></sec></app></app-group><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ACEi</term><def><p>Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ARB</term><def><p>Angiotensin receptor blocker</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CKD</term><def><p>Chronic kidney disease</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ESKD</term><def><p>End stage kidney disease</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FONT</term><def><p>Novel Therapies for Resistant FSGS</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FSGS</term><def><p>Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GFR</term><def><p>Glomerular filtration rate</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IRB</term><def><p>Institutional review board</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PK</term><def><p>Pharmacokinetic</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SAE</term><def><p>Serious adverse event</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SCT</term><def><p>Standard conservative therapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TNF</term><def><p>Tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1;</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Up/c</term><def><p>Urine protein:creatinine ratio</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>Jochen Reiser is a cofounder of TRISAQ, a biopharmaceutical company aimed to develop novel kidney protective therapies.
