During the past decades, the expansive open-door laminoplasty (ODL) is considered an effective and safe method for decompressing multisegmental cervical lesions, and has been widely accepted in clinical practice.<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup></p><p>At present, in order to further improve the safety and effectiveness of decompression and stability of the spine, a variety of modifications and supplementary procedure were introduced, such as plate fixation, spacers, and plate fixation combined with bone struts and ceramic spacers. These were used in the laminoplasty to construct a complete laminar arch and avoid the secondary narrowing of the spinal canal and neurological deterioration over the long-term follow-up.<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup></p><p>Conventional cervical laminoplasty, however, had a high technical demand on using high-speed drills, which may cause spinal cord and nerve injury with inappropriate handling.<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> Piezosurgery is a relatively new osteotomy technique using microvibrations of scalpels at ultrasonic frequencies to perform safe and effective osteotomies. It can ensure a greater precision in cutting and increase safety, thanks to its characteristic of selective bone-cutting properties with preservation of adjacent soft-tissue structures.<sup>[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup> Moreover, unlike other conventional drill, it does not produce high temperature during its use, which could result in a higher incidence of marginal osteonecrosis.<sup>[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup> So far, piezoelectric bone surgery had been described in patients undergoing spinal, oral, and maxillofacial surgery, with good success.<sup>[<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup></p><p>The aim of this study was to compare the safety and efficacy of piezosurgery devices with those of a conventional high-speed drill for the transection of the lateral laminae.</p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Material and method</title><sec><label>2.1</label><title>Patient population</title><p>This prospective randomized controlled study was conducted between June 2012 and December 2014 in the Department of Spinal Surgery, Liaocheng People's Hospital, Shandong province, China.

Following induction of general anesthesia, each patient was positioned prone in slightly flexion of neck in a Mayfield head fixator. The standard posterior midline approach was used to expose the lamina, spinous processes, and the medial facet joints from C3 to C7. The supraspinous and interspinous ligaments were cut between C2 and C3 and between C7 and T1. The spinous processes were then amputated. The opening side was made on the side with more symptoms by completely cutting the lamina off along the medial margin of the facet joints and only the dorsal cortex and the cancellous bone were removed on the hinge side. Trough preparation in the hinged and opening sides was performed respectively with high-speed drill (drill group) or piezosurgery device (piezosurgery group). A V-shaped bone trough was created at the junction of the lamina and the lateral mass. The lamina was opened carefully and the ligamentum flavum between the opening laminae and dura was removed. After elevating the open side of the lamina approximately 1&#x0200a;cm en bloc, prebent titanium plates were placed on each segment. Two screws in the lateral mass and 2 in the lamina were used to fix the plate tightly. Screws that were 8 or 6&#x0200a;mm in length were used for most patients (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).

As surgical techniques are continuously being improved and surgical devices become increasingly fine, the rate of good surgical efficacies continues to improve while surgical time, blood loss, and relevant complications decrease.<sup>[<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</sup></p><p>In our study, all the patients underwent modified expansive ODL using 5 titanium miniplates and showed clear improvement after operation. The average JOA score was from 8.7&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;1.7 to 11.2&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;1.8, and VAS from 6.3&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;1.3 to 3.0&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;1.2, respectively, and there were significant differences observed after surgery.</p><p>In the current study, we recorded the operation time, intraoperative blood loss, and postoperative drainage of all patients and compared those of piezosurgery group with drill group. The intraoperative blood loss and postoperative drainage in the piezosurgery group were 272.9&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;87.2 and 127.9&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;28.6&#x0200a;mL, respectively, which were significantly lower than those of drill group (357.4&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;129.9 and 153.2&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;29.5&#x0200a;mL, respectively). The results indicated that using the piezosurgery could reduce the intraoperative and postoperative blood losses of cervical expansive ODL, which was due to the advantage of piezosurgery that avoids soft tissues injury and the air&#x02013;water cavitation effect that assists in closing the smallest blood vessels and rinses away any blood from the larger vessels.<sup>[<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</sup></p><p>Several previous studies on the oral and maxillofacial surgery had shown that the micrometric cutting action of piezosurgery required a longer surgical time compared with rotatory instruments use.<sup>[<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]</sup> Our result also showed that the operation time of the piezosurgery group was a little longer than that of the drill group (138.2&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;26.6 vs 125.8&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;23.5&#x0200a;minutes); however, there was no statistical difference between 2 groups, which indicated that the use of piezosurgery would not significantly prolong the surgery and increase the risk of operation.</p><p>In this series, we also compared the clinical outcome and complications of 2 methods. The JOA scores in both groups were from 8.9&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;1.7 and 8.5&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;2.1 to 11.1&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;1.7 and 11.3&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;1.9, respectively, and both of them significantly increased after surgery. The VAS score was also improved postoperatively. However, there were no statistical differences of them observed between 2 groups. The results indicated that the instrument for the lamniplasty would not affect the clinical outcome because the effect was determined by the decompression of spinal cord, not by the instruments for the transection of lamina.</p><p>The rate of complications was compared in both groups. The rate of C5 paralysis was comparable in 2 groups (2/21 in the piezosurgery group vs 1/21 in the drill group), which was similar to the previous reports, and no difference was observed. Narrower preoperative foramina and nerve root traction caused by excessive spinal cord drift after laminoplasty were the pathologic mechanisms of C5 palsy,<sup>[<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]</sup> which could explain why no difference was found in the rate of C5 paralysis between both groups.</p><p>When it came to the dura tear, we would expect to fewer patients of dura tear and cerebrospinal fluid leak in the piezosurgery group; however, the rates of the dura tear in 2 groups (9.5% vs 9.5%) were comparable. We analyzed the main reasons were that the cervical canal was large enough to avoid the dural tear with conventional instrument, and the familiarity of the piezosurgery was inferior to that of high-speed drill.</p><p>High-speed drill is potentially injurious because of the production of excessively high temperatures during osseous drilling. Such temperatures can engender marginal osteonecrosis which ultimately impairs bone regeneration.<sup>[<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]</sup> The result of this study showed that osseous fusion of the laminar arch was observed in every patient in the radiological follow-up of more than 6 months. However, we had not focused on the difference of osseous fusion rate and time of the laminar arch during the follow-up periods in both groups, which was 1 limitation of the current study.</p><p>Another shortcoming of this study includes the small patient population. Future studies, enrolling more patients and with more parameters such as fusion rate and time during the follow-up period, will be necessary to evaluate the safety and efficacy of piezosurgery devices with conventional high-speed drill.</p><p>In conclusion, the piezosurgery is a useful instrument and at least as safe and efficacious as the conventional high-speed drill, although our clinical valuation of the effectiveness of this technique was based on intraoperative and postoperative parameters. Thus, we recommend this device for application in various spinal surgery fields as a good substitute to high-speed drills or other instruments.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: CSM = cervical spondylotic myelopathy, JOA = Japanese Orthopedic Association, ODL = open-door laminoplasty, OPLL = ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament, VAS = visual analogue scale.</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Chang</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name><name><surname>Holly</surname><given-names>LT</given-names></name></person-group>
