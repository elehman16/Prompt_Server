exercises on the muscle strength, flexibility, and balance of old-old elderly individuals
over the age of 75&#x02005;years. [Subjects and Methods] Forty-three old-old elderly subjects
(aged 78.7 &#x000b1; 2.9&#x02005;years) participated in 8 weeks of recreational exercises. The exercises
were performed twice a week for 8 weeks. Muscle strength, flexibility, and balance were
evaluated by the Senior Fitness Test before and at the end of the intervention. [Results]
Significant improvements in muscle strength, flexibility, and balance were observed at the
end of the intervention. [Conclusion] This study demonstrated that an intervention using
recreational exercises effectively improves the muscle strength, flexibility, and balance
of old-old elderly individuals.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Balance</kwd><kwd>Old-old elderly</kwd><kwd>Recreation exercise</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Lamoureux et al.<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that people&#x02019;s
strength decreases as they age, and that this occurs rapidly after the age of 75&#x02005;years. The
frequency of falls increases after the age of 75 years<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, old-old elderly people over the age of 75&#x02005;years have
little opportunity to participate in regular physical activities, making it more difficult
for them to increase their physical activity and thus increase their strength<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Many interventions aimed at reducing fall rates have been studied. Traditionally, fall
prevention exercises for elderly people have involved lower-extremity resistance and balance
training<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Well-designed exercise
programs can prevent falls among community-dwelling older adults<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, one weakness of conventional exercise is low
levels of motivation<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Standage et
al.<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup> described the importance of
intrinsic motivation in exercise programs. Graves et al.<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that exergaming focuses on the fun of video gaming while
providing the health benefits of physical activity. Unfortunately, exergaming requires
expensive equipment and an appropriate interior space. Older adults often refrain from
participating in regular physical activity because of perceived barriers such as financial
constraints and the lack of an environment conducive to physical activity and exercise
programs<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, recreational
exercises provide motivation for exercise without expensive equipment. Thus, the objective
of this study was to examine the effect of recreational exercises on fitness strength,
flexibility, and balance of old-old elderly individuals.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects of this study were 43 community-dwelling old-old elderly individuals over the
age of 75&#x02005;years (78.7 &#x000b1; 2.9&#x02005;years, mean &#x000b1; SD) with an average height and weight of 150.13 &#x000b1;
4.67&#x02005;cm and 57.44 &#x000b1; 7.50&#x02005;kg, respectively. Each subject provided informed consent before
participating in this study. This study was approved by the Inje University Faculty of
Health Sciences Human Ethics Committee. The exercise program used several pieces of
equipment, manufactured by NewSport. Such as foam hemispheres and foam croquet equipment,
Equipment made of foam is appropriate for old adults with a risk of falling because of its
softness and safety. The participants performed recreational twice weekly programs over a
period of 8 weeks, a total of 16 sessions. Each exercise session lasted for 60 minutes, with
10 minutes of warm-up, 40 minutes of the main exercise, and 10 minutes of cool-down. The
exercise program comprised four types of exercise: badminton, foam croquet, foam hemisphere
walking, and balance beam walking. The Senior Fitness Test (SFT) was developed as a safe and
enjoyable test method for elderly people, whether inactive or very active, which meets
scientific standards of reliability and validity<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. The individual fitness test items are common activities such as
getting up from a chair, walking, lifting, bending, and stretching. They include: arm curl,
back scratch, rising from a chair, chair sit and reach, 8-feet up and go, and 6-minute walk.
Before the tests were started, a 5- to 10-minute warm-up and general stretching exercises
were performed. Performance of each part of the test was preceded by a demonstration, then
the subjects checked their ability to perform the test to become familiar with its proper
course. The collected data were statistically analyzed using Windows SPSS version 18.0 (SPSS
Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The paired t-test was used to determine the significance of the
difference between the pretest and post-test SFT results to evaluate the program&#x02019;s
effectiveness. The significance level was chosen as p &#x0003c; 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>There were statistically significant improvements in all items (the 30-second chair stand,
right arm curl, left arm curl, chair sit and reach, right back scratch, left back scratch,
and 8-feet up and go) after the intervention (p &#x0003c; 0.05). The 30-second chair stand
results were pre, 12.02 (&#x000b1;4.62), and post, 17.16 (&#x000b1;5.32). The right arm curl results were
pre, 14.86 (&#x000b1;9.15), and post, 18.40 (&#x000b1;12.47). The left arm curl results were pre, 15.35
(&#x000b1;8.96), and post, 18.91 (&#x000b1;13.06). The chair sit-and-reach results were pre, 5.33 (&#x000b1;7.37),
and post, 8.86 (&#x000b1;7.25). The right back scratch results were pre, &#x02212;11.14 (&#x000b1;15.11), and post,
&#x02212;6.37 (&#x000b1;13.14). The left back scratch results were pre, &#x02212;14.49 (&#x000b1;14.17), and post, &#x02212;9.62
(&#x000b1;12.67). The 8-feet up &#x00026; go results were pre, 8.98 (&#x000b1;2.41), and post, 6.30 (&#x000b1;1.80).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Recreational exercises for this old-old elderly group resulted in statistically significant
improvements in strength, flexibility, and balance during walking. Cahow et al.<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup> examined the effects of therapeutic
recreation on the quality of life (QOL) of patients with spinal cord injury. Participation
in therapeutic recreation and community activities during rehabilitation predicted a higher
motor Functional Independence Measure score. Recreational exercises effectively improve
physical abilities. Our study showed that such exercise is effective at improving the muscle
strength, flexibility, and balance of old-old adults. The recreational exercises performed
in this study utilized NewSport equipment, which is commonly used in schools and in research
because of its flexibility and simplicity. These characteristics make NewSport equipment
ideal for assessing the physical and cognitive characteristics of elderly individuals, such
as muscle weakness, balance instability, and cognitive impairment. Recently, some studies
showed aquatic exercise and hippotherapy were effective at arousing the motivation of the
elderly<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>, but the old-old elderly refrain from participating in regular
physical activities due to financial constraints and physical ability. Recreational
exercises not only arouse interest and motivation, but are also inexpensive.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Lamoureux</surname><given-names>EL</given-names></name><name><surname>Sparrow</surname><given-names>WA</given-names></name><name><surname>Murphy</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Differences in the neuromuscular capacity and lean muscle
