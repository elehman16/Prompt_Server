Alopecia Areata (AA) is defined as circumscribed, non-scarring hair loss without destruction of the pilar units.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] It affects about 2% of new patients attending dermatology clinics.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>]</p><p>AA is a common disease of unknown origin. It seems to represent a heterogeneous syndrome. It affects males and females equally and strikes all ages, although it is more common in children and young people. Approximately 60% patients develop AA before the age of 20 years.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>]</p><p>The exact etiology is not known, but the possible responsible factors may be autoimmunity,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] atopic state,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] patient's genetic constitution,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] non-specific immune reactions, emotional stress, and numerous psychological factors.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] Patients may have one or multiple patches at any hair-bearing site of the body. AA is known to be associated with other autoimmune disorders such as asthma, atopy, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. In 1989, based on associated conditions and the course of illness, Ikeda classified AA into four types as common, atopic, pre-hypertensive, and autoimmune type.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>]</p><p>In AA, the hair follicle, in response to some unknown signal or injury, is suddenly precipitated into premature telogen and then the cycles are shortened in which it is repeatedly arrested part way through anagen. The hair loss produces cosmetic concern, loss of self-esteem, and alteration in self-image. There are a number of treatments that induce hair growth in AA with variable results and possible side effects. Therefore, the present study was undertaken to compare the therapeutic efficacy of various modalities and to assess their safety in the treatment of AA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>Thirty patients of all age groups and both sexes clinically diagnosed as AA who presented for the first time with localized (&#x0003c;5 patches and &#x0003c;25% scalp involvement) alopecia over the scalp, with no underlying disease or family history and who had not received any treatment before were selected for this study. Diagnosed cases already on treatment, family history of AA, underlying disease, AA involving other areas other than the scalp, alopecia with more than 5 patches and &#x0003e;25% scalp involvement were excluded.</p><p>A detailed history was taken with reference to the onset, duration, and progress of the lesion, history of similar lesions in the past, family, and any other relevant skin or systemic disease. Dermatological examination of the lesions was carried out with respect to morphology, distribution, and nail involvement. All patients were informed regarding the nature of disease, course, prognosis, and the probable adverse effects of the treatment modalities. After an informed consent, the following regimes were recommended sequentially.</p><p>5 different regimes were used:</p><p>Regime I Intralesional Steroid (Inj. Triamcinolone acetonide10 mg/ml)</p><p><graphic xlink:href="IJT-4-265-g001.jpg" position="float"/></p><p>6 patients were included in each group. Each patient was followed up at monthly intervals of 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 12 weeks and response to treatment was evaluated subjectively and objectively.</p><p>The end point of the study was 3 months. Subjective evaluation was performed by examination of the patch for any hair growth.</p><p>Grading was carried out based on subjective assessment as follows:</p><p>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Grade I slight improvement, barely noticeable (up to 25%)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Grade II moderate improvement, noticeable (25-50%)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Grade III obvious improvement (51-75%)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Grade IV marked improvement (&#x0003e;75%)</p></list-item></list></p><p>Objective evaluation was carried out based on SALT scoring, that is &#x0201c;Severity of Alopecia Tool Score&#x0201d;.</p><p>SALT scoring &#x02013; This calculation is based on a scoring system. The scalp is divided into the following 4 areas:</p><p>
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Vertex: 40% (0.4) of scalp surface area.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Right profile of scalp: 18% (0.18) of scalp surface area.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Left profile of scalp: 18% (0.18) of scalp surface area.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Posterior aspect of scalp: 24% (0.24) of scalp surface area.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>Percentage of hair loss in any of these areas is the percentage hair loss multiplied by percent surface area of the scalp in that area.</p><p>SALT score is the sum of percentage of hair loss in all the above-mentioned areas.</p><p>The results were analyzed and tabulated. A <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05% was considered as significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Of the 30 patients enrolled in the study, 18 (60%) were males and 12 (40%) were females.

</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Intralesional steroid</title><p>Triamcinolone acetonide10 mg/ml is injected intralesionally so as to let the drug pass the barrier zone and establish a subepidermaldepot, thus allowing a higher concentration of the drug to act at the site of the disease.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] Adverse effects include pain, atrophy, headache, hyper/hypopigmentation, anaphylaxis,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] and hemorrhage at the puncture site.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Topical steroid</title><p>AA is a T-cell-mediated response, and corticosteroids are known to exert a strong inhibitory effect on the activation of T-lymphocytes.

After Analysis Of Variance (ANOVA) table and calculating the <italic>P</italic> value, the difference in mean reduction SALT score in the five regimes was statistically significant. There was significant change in SALT scoring on the 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> follow-ups [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>]. Here too, Regimes I and II showed more standard deviation and difference in the SALT scores at day 0 and at the end of the 1<sup>st</sup> follow-up and 2<sup>nd</sup> follow-up. Hence, the findings of objective assessment matched those of subjective assessment, i.e., intralesional and topical steroids were the most superior treatment modality. Adverse effects were observed only in 4 patients (66.66%) in Regime IV; anthralin showed adverse effects such as Erythema and Pruritus. None of the other treatment modalities showed any adverse effects [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>].</p><p>We concluded that AA constituted a major hair disorder presenting to the dermatologist. Among the currently available topical modalities for the treatment of AA, the best response was to the intralesional and topical steroids, followed by anthralin, salicylic acid 1.15%, and coal tar 5.3% ointment combination. Minoxidil did not show any better results than placebo. A minimum of 3 months is required for the response. It was also observed that there were no significant side effects with the various treatment modalities except for anthralin, salicylic acid, and coal tar combination. Hence, the ideal approach may be to initiate the treatment with the more effective modalities such as intralesional and topical steroids and later on maintain with anthralin combination.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Mitchell</surname><given-names>AJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Krull</surname><given-names>EA</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Alopecia areata: Pathogenesis and treatment</article-title><source>J Am Acad Dermatol</source><year>1984</year><volume>11</volume><fpage>763</fpage><lpage>75</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">6210311</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Moshell</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Price</surname><given-names>VH</given-names></name><name><surname>John</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Heading ton and Jean-Claude Bystryn.
