Previously, in the CaVenT study, we have shown that additional catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) in patients with a high proximal DVT localised in the mid-thigh level or above, and a low risk of bleeding, reduced the frequency of PTS from 56% to 41% (p=0.047) after 2&#x02005;years and that CDT is likely to be a cost-effective alternative to standard treatment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref> However, as PTS is a chronic condition associated with substantial morbidity and with no healing treatment options, assessment of both generic and disease-specific health-related quality of life (QOL), including the impact on health and daily functioning, may provide meaningful information not captured by clinical scores and other traditional health outcome measures. Development of PTS has been shown to be a principal determinant of QOL following DVT of the lower limb; however, there is currently no gold standard for the PTS diagnosis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref> We aimed at investigating whether additional CDT for a high proximal DVT improved long-term QOL compared with standard treatment alone.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study population</title><p>Patients were recruited as part of the CaVenT study, an open randomised controlled trial (RCT), from 19 hospitals within the South-Eastern Norway Regional Health Authority, which serves a population of 2.6 million people. Patients aged 18&#x02013;75&#x02005;years with a first-time objectively verified acute high proximal DVT, defined as thrombus in mid-thigh level or higher and with a low risk of bleeding, were eligible for inclusion if symptoms had lasted &#x0003c;21&#x02005;days.

Responses are rated on 2-point to 7-point descriptive scales, and two summary scores are computed. The VEINES-QOL summary score assesses QOL, and the VEINES-Sym score is a subscale that measures symptom severity only. Higher scores represent better QOL and/or fewer symptoms, and a difference or change of &#x02265;4 points has been suggested to represent a clinically meaningful difference.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></p><p>The EQ-5D is a preference-based generic instrument for describing and valuing QOL, and is a widely used health measure outcome in clinical trials and cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses. This descriptive classification system comprises five items: mobility, self-care, activity, pain and anxiety; each with the three levels reflecting the patient's status that particular day. The scoring provides a single number/health status index ranging from 0 (dead) to 1 (best possible health). A difference or change in this index of &#x02265;0.08 is likely to represent a clinically meaningful difference.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>

Each sign or symptom is rated as 0 (none), 1 (mild), 2 (moderate) or 3 (severe), and summed to produce a total score, where less than 5 indicates no PTS, 5&#x02013;14 indicates mild or moderate PTS and 15 or more (or presence of venous ulcer) indicates severe PTS.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Statistical analysis and sample size</title><p>Health-related QOL was among the prespecified secondary outcomes of the CaVenT study, while the primary outcome of PTS after 2&#x02005;years was the basis for the sample size calculation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref> For all patients, an EQ-5D summary index was calculated based on values from a Danish population as there was no Norwegian algorithm.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref> Scores for VEINES-QOL and VEINES-Sym were computed using standard scoring algorithms obtained from the authors.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref> Statistical analyses were by intention to treat.

However, patients who developed PTS after 24&#x02005;months reported poorer QOL with both EQ-5D and VEINES-QOL, and more symptoms on Sym score compared with patients without PTS. This finding is in line with other reports, and the VEINES-QOL/Sym scores were in similar range as previously reported in DVT populations.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15 R16 R17">15&#x02013;17</xref></p><p>To our knowledge this is the first study to investigate QOL after CDT in a well-designed manner using validated QOL instruments and PTS assessment. We have recently in a retrospective study of 71 patients previously treated with CDT shown that VEINES-QOL/Sym scores were poorer in patients with established PTS compared with no PTS (median) 6&#x02005;years after the index DVT, and poorer in patients compared with a control group without previous DVT.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref> Another retrospective study of corresponding size found improved QOL and less post-thrombotic symptoms in patients treated with CDT compared with similar patients treated with anticoagulation only; however, this study did not use a disease-specific QOL instrument or a validated assessment of PTS.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref> This finding was not supported in our RCT, and long-term QOL may not represent a significant secondary efficacy outcome after CDT.</p><p>The baseline scores were obtained within 1&#x02013;2&#x02005;days following the verification of the acute DVT, and the low EQ-5D scores are likely to reflect patients&#x02019; medical emergency situation at that time point. The items of the VEINES instrument are concerned with &#x02018;the last 4&#x02005;weeks&#x02019; and mean symptom duration among study participants was only 6&#x02013;7&#x02005;days and, as indicated by the relatively better scores, the VEINES-QOL/Sym baseline results are likely to reflect a longer period including time before symptom onset. Finally, QOL is a more appropriate outcome for chronic conditions, and together with our lack of more frequent study visits and longitudinal assessments, we did not include baseline scores in our analyses.</p><p>The finding that more control patients reported a meaningful improvement in the Sym score during the follow-up than patients treated with CDT, should be interpreted with caution as the 6-month Sym score was higher in the CDT arm, though this difference did not reach a meaningful difference of at least 4 points.</p><p>We regard our study population to be representative and the CDT procedure to be applicable in a clinical setting.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref> However, due to the open label design, bias in patient-reported outcomes (PROs) such as QOL cannot be excluded, and it is uncertain in what direction such bias would impact the results. As our eligibility criteria allowed for study participants to enrol with up to 21&#x02005;days of symptoms, this meant that patients with subacute DVT, that is, more than 14&#x02005;days of symptoms, may have entered the study and possibly contributed to the overall high PTS frequency and lack of treatment group differences in the QOL scores.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref> However, as the mean symptom duration was less than 7&#x02005;days and only 15 patients (hereunder 8 controls) had more than 14&#x02005;days of symptom, we find this unlikely. Finally, two ongoing RCTs; the American ATTRACT study and the DUTCH CAVA trial, will provide additional data to the field of QOL after CDT treatment (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov">http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>; NCT 00790335 and NCT 00970619).</p><p>The Villalta scale has been validated and recommended for assessment of PTS,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref> however, as no gold standard exists and a relatively high frequency of PTS was found in both treatment arms, concerns have been raised about the clinical benefit of CDT as shown in the CaVenT study.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref> The current findings of poorer QOL in those who developed PTS, as obtained within an appropriately designed RCT, underpin our perception that the 15% absolute reduction in PTS as assessed with the Villalta scale and shown in CaVenT, does represent a clinically meaningful effect of additional CDT.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></p><p>It has been recommended to include QOL as part of the long-term follow-up assessment of patients at risk of PTS,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref> and a recent review &#x0201c;recommend(s) that the Villalta score combined with a venous disease-specific QOL questionnaire be considered as the &#x02018;gold standard&#x02019; for the diagnosis and classification of PTS.&#x0201d;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref> The VEINES questionnaire would be a candidate, but such a combination must be validated in appropriately designed studies and take into account the apparent overlap between the Villalta score and the VEINES-scores; all items in the Sym score are covered in the QOL score, 2/3 of Sym items are covered in Villalta and 1/4 of the QOL items are covered in Villalta. Finally, 5 of 11 items in Villalta score, that is, the symptom rating, are in fact PROs, and combining with another patient PRO instrument should seek to avoid repeat assessment.</p><p>The generic instrument EQ-5D showed a clinically meaningful and statistically significant poorer QOL measure in patients who developed PTS, indicating that this preference-based questionnaire can be included in studies on PTS and thereby allowing analyses on utilities and cost-effectiveness for decision-making.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref> However, the sample size was powered to detect a 15% reduction in PTS after additional CDT, not improvement in QOL, which was among the secondary outcome measures. Accordingly, the negative finding in terms of no difference in QOL between the treatment arms, may relate to the sensitivity of the instruments, the prevalence of PTS and the lack of power to detect a statistically significant difference. Finally, the VEINES scores differed significantly between patients with PTS versus no PTS, and the magnitude of the mean difference was 6 points or higher. This has been reported to represent meaningful differences, but a well-established definition or cut-off for a clinically meaningful difference in VEINES scores is lacking, and also this limitation must be taken into account when interpreting the results.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></p><p>In conclusion, there was no difference in long-term QOL between patients with a high proximal DVT treated with additional CDT compared with those treated with anticoagulation and compression therapy alone. Patients who developed PTS reported poorer QOL and more symptoms than patients without PTS. This is in line with previous reports, and supports the use of QOL as an outcome measure in clinical research on patients who are at risk of PTS.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e200" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2013-002984.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e201" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2013-002984.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank all study participants and study collaborators; without their contributions the CaVenT study would not have been possible.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> TE participated in the design of study, acquisition of the data, analysis and interpretation of the data, drafting of the manuscript, critical revision of the manuscript, obtaining funding; HSW participated in acquisition of the data, interpretation of the data, critical revision of the manuscript; AKK participated in interpretation of the data, and critical revision of the manuscript; YH participated in acquisition of the data and critical revision of the manuscript; NEK and PMS participated in the design of study, acquisition of the data, critical revision of the manuscript, obtaining funding.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Funding:</bold> This work was funded by South-Eastern Norway Regional Health Authority, Research Council of Norway, University of Oslo and Oslo University Hospital, and the Unger-Vetlesen Medical Fund.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Competing interests:</bold> None.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Ethics approval:</bold> The study protocol was approved by the Regional Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics and the Norwegian Medicines Agency, and was registered at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov">http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link> with the unique trial identifier NCT00251771..</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Provenance and peer review:</bold> Not commissioned; externally peer reviewed.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Data sharing statement:</bold> Unpublished data from the CaVenT study are available to TE, YH, NEK and PMS through authorised access to the research server at Oslo University Hospital, Ullev&#x000e5;l.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Prandoni</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Lensing</surname><given-names>AW</given-names></name><name><surname>Prins</surname><given-names>MH</given-names></name><etal/></person-group>
