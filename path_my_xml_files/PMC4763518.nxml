Fewer than 25% of those affected have access to effective treatments. A large selection of effective antidepressant medications is available, but their clinical utility is limited by adverse events or some or other problems. Indeed, the clinical success of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) over the past decade relative to their therapeutic predecessors, such as tricyclic antidepressants, has been attributed to their improved tolerability, ease of use and far greater safety.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] However, the safety and tolerability of individual SRIs vary within the class[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and it is clear that many patients may not respond optimally to an acute course of any given treatment. Thus, there is a constant need of search for new better effective treatment.</p><p>The efficacy and the tolerability of escitalopram, aSSRI and desvenlafaxine, a non-selective SRI has been well-established.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Most of the studies establishing their efficacy and safety are available from western population and whatever available has compared these drugs respectively with placebo. Thus, there are very limited studies available directly comparing efficacies of escitalopram with desvenlafaxine in treatment of major depression.</p><p>Hence, a preliminary 1-year prospective randomized open label trial comparing efficacy and safety of escitalopram with desvenlafaxine in the treatment of major depression was undertaken.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>A total of 60 patients from psychiatry outpatient departmentof a tertiary level hospital diagnosed with major depression were included in the study after they fulfilled the inclusion criteria.
