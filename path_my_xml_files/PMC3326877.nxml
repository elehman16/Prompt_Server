Psoriasis has been shown to affect health-related Quality of Life to an extent similar to the effects of other chronic diseases such as depression, myocardial infarction, hypertension, etc. The modern treatment options not only provide temporary relief but also have serious side effects. Thus, the chronic and recurring nature of the disease hampers the Quality of Life to a great extent. In the present study, patients were randomly divided into two groups. <italic>Koshtha Shuddhi</italic> was done by <italic>Eranda bhrushta haritaki</italic> (6 g at night with <italic>ushnodaka</italic>) in patients of both the groups for 3 days before starting the treatment. A total of 111 patients were selected for the present study and were grouped into two. Patients of group A (45) were given &#x0201c;<italic>Navayasa rasayana leha</italic>&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;<italic>Dhatryadhyo lepa</italic>&#x0201d; for external application. Stress is a well-known precipitating factor of Psoriasis. Hence, to study the efficacy of <italic>Medhya rasayana</italic> drugs, patients of group B (49) were given <italic>Medhya rasayana</italic> tabl<italic>et al</italic>ong with the application of <italic>Dhatryadhyo lepa</italic>. The duration of the study was 3 months and follow-up was done for one month. Both the groups showed equally good results on improving the quality of life in the patients in terms of Dermatology life quality index and Psoriasis disability index.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Psoriasis</kwd><kwd><italic>Dhatryadhyo lepa</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Navayasa Rasayana leha</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Medhya Rasayana</italic></kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Psoriasis can have a significant impact on a patient's Quality of Life, sometimes profoundly altering their everyday life. Quality of Life patient survey published in the <italic>Archives of Dermatology</italic> in 2001 showed that physicians underestimate disease severity. 78% of severe psoriatics are frustrated by lack of efficacy of treatment and 26 minutes is the average time to apply topical medications per day.</p><p>Information from Quality of Life surveys suggest that 78% of psoriatics indicate the negative impact on their life quality, whereas 21% of patients suggest neither a positive nor a negative effect.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] It is important to note that the types of psoriasis are based on the effect of psoriasis on life quality as follows:</p><p>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Mild: Disease that does not alter Quality of Life</p></list-item><list-item><p>Moderate: Disease that alters Quality of Life. Therapies would be expected to improve Quality of Life with minimal risk of side effects</p></list-item><list-item><p>Severe: Disease that does alter Quality of Life, and the response to treatments which have minimal side effects is ineffective. These patients will accept life-altering side effects to achieve better Quality of Life.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>Also, it is interesting fact that any new intervention in patients of psoriasis initially gives good results, but later on, the therapy does not respond very well. This is also the major cause of impaired life quality in patients of psoriasis. Thus, looking at the impact of psoriasis on life quality, the present study was designed to find out the effect of <italic>Navayasa Rasayana leha, Dhatryadhyo lepa</italic> and <italic>Medhya Rasayana</italic> tablet on life quality of the patients.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Aims and objectives</title><p>

In a survey study, nearly 60% reported their disease to be a large problem in their everyday life. Nearly 40% with psoriatic arthritis reported their disease to be a large problem in everyday life.

<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>71% reported that the disease was a significant problem in everyday life;</p></list-item><list-item><p>more than half reported significant feelings of self-consciousness (63%) and embarrassment (58%); and</p></list-item><list-item><p>more than one third said they avoided social activities and limited dating or intimate interactions.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>A 2009 study looked at the impact of psoriasis by using interviews with dermatologists and exploring the patient's viewpoint. It found that in cases of mild and severe psoriasis, itch contributed the most to the diminished health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Here, it can be seen that both the therapies provide significant effect on improving the life quality of the patients as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T7">Table 7</xref>.</p><table-wrap id="T7" position="float"><label>Table 7</label><caption><p>Comparative effect of both the therapies on life quality in patients of Psoriasis</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="Ayu-32-333-g014"/></table-wrap><p>As, described previously, the effect of psoriasis in patients was very large effect in 44.14% and extremely large effect in 19.81% patients, which reduced completely showing that there were no patients having very large and extremely large effects on the Quality of Life. Also, after treatment, maximum number of patients in group A had small effect (40%), whereas maximum number of patients in group B had moderate effect (57.14%) [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T7">Table 7</xref>].</p><p>Also, based on the results, it can be inferred that both the groups showed highly significant relief in all the questions of DLQI and PDI.
