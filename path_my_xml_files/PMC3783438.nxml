At follow-up, manikins were used to assess students&#x02019; performance by two independent blinded video-assessors using binary checklists and a single-item global assessment scale.

It offers a protected, &#x0201c;mistake forgiving&#x0201d; training environment [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] that allows students to practice procedures on manikins, with standardized patients or with each other prior to performing procedural skills on real patients [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>-<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Skills lab trainings have shown to improve procedural skills in novices as well as experts [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>-<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. This applies to complex surgical skills [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] as well as basic clinical skills performed by medical students [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Furthermore there seems to be evidence, that simulation-based medical education (SBME) positively influences the outcome in the clinical setting [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>In a systematic review, Issenberg and colleagues describe aspects that influence the effectiveness of SBME [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The key factor seen is educational feedback, providing a chance for reflection on procedural performance. Other elements including &#x0201c;deliberate practice&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;integration into curriculum&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;validity of simulators&#x0201d; also contribute to the significant success of SBME. However, not much is known about the long-term retention of procedural skills acquired during SBME, although practical proficiencies are known to abate over time, if they are not repeatedly practised [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>In general, theoretical knowledge seems to be retained better than practical skills, and the performance of simpler tasks seems to be lost more slowly than complex ones [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The majority of studies looking at the long-term retention of procedural skills focus on techniques in basic and advanced cardiac life support training. In this setting, a significant decline in performance could be shown to start as early as a couple of weeks after initial training or could begin up to a year later. The most significant decline occurred between 6 and 12 months of time [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>-<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The effectiveness and retention of other skills taught in the SBME setting have been studied less, and much heterogeneity is seen with regards to performed skills, study subjects and teaching methods, rendering data interpretation difficult. Examples include competencies in laparoscopic surgery or colonoscopy by surgical residents after 3 months [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], a significant decay in temporary haemodialysis catheter insertion skills by nephrology fellows after 6 months [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and a satisfactory retention of a rare but crucial procedural skill like coniotomy performed by trained anaesthetist up to one year [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. This heterogeneity in findings makes it hard if not impossible to draw any conclusions for skills lab training in medical undergraduates. In summary, our current understanding of factors contributing to long-term retention of SBME trained skills is still limited owing to general data shortage, flaws in study design (heterogeneity in training methods, number of redundant practice, etc.) and heterogeneity in tested skills with regards to their complexity.</p><p>Within a SBME setting, different teaching components comprise the &#x0201c;best practice&#x0201d; skills lab training. Amongst it are feedback and repetitive practice as key factors of effective SBME [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], and instruction methods like Peyton&#x02019;s &#x0201c;Four-Step-Approach&#x0201d; which seems to provide a reliable and yet quite popular teaching method [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In this respect, it was implemented as standard instruction for resuscitation courses of the European Resuscitation Council [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. There is, however, conflicting evidence whether skills lab teaching following a &#x0201c;best practice&#x0201d; approach (BPSL) leads to a better performance than other established teaching methods, for example a more traditional teacher-centred &#x0201c;see one, do one&#x0201d; approach (TRAD), which is a main component of clinical bedside teaching [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In this form of teaching, students learn by merely watching an experienced doctor explaining and demonstrating the skill [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The expert acts as a role model and the first independent performance of procedural clinical skills is already with a real patient. Two recent studies could show that skills lab training following a &#x0201c;best practice&#x0201d; model with structured individual feedback, practice on manikins and Peyton&#x02019;s &#x0201c;Four-Step-Approach&#x0201d; is superior to traditional bedside teaching immediately after teaching [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, these findings are solely based on performance assessments immediately after the respective teaching, and research comparing long-term effects is still lacking. Knowledge about long-term retention is crucial though, as medical students often experience a time lapse between their skills lab training and actual performance on patients. This happens even more so, since the importance of early clinical teaching in the pre-clinical phase has been stressed more intensively throughout many curricula worldwide [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In light of limited resources and an already high study load there is only limited capacity for repetitive classes. Hence, there is a clear need for established methods for effective SBME providing a maximum of retention.</p><p>To our knowledge, so far there has been no randomized and prospective study investigating the effect of two different teaching approaches for undergraduate medical students for skills of different complexity with regards to long-term outcomes. We therefore investigated the effects of two different teaching methods within a simulated setting on the long-term performance of undergraduate medical students: a &#x0201c;best practice&#x0201d; example of skills lab training (BPSL) incorporating structured individual feedback, practice on manikins and Peyton&#x02019;s &#x0201c;Four-Step-Approach&#x0201d; vs. a traditional &#x0201c;see one, do one&#x0201d; approach (TRAD) similar to bedside teaching. As task complexity is an important variable with regards to skills retention over time [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], we have chosen two skills with different complexity level for investigation, namely nasogastric tube insertion, NGT, as a simpler and i.v. cannulation, IVC, as a more complex procedure. As the time lapse between training and assessment is another important variable for retention, we assessed the students&#x02019; performance at 3 and 6 months respectively, resulting in a study design comprising four independent arms. Our data support a &#x0201c;best practice&#x0201d; form of SBME (BPSL) to be more effective than formerly used &#x0201c;see one, do one&#x0201d; approaches (TRAD), especially for the long-term retention of trained clinical skills with higher manual complexity.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2.1"><title>Study design</title><p>We conducted a randomised controlled trial to investigate the long-term retention of &#x0201c;best practice&#x0201d; skills lab training (BPSL) versus a traditional &#x0201c;see one, do one&#x0201d; bedside teaching (TRAD) in a simulated setting of two different procedural skills (nasogastral tube insertion, NGT, and i.v. cannulation, IVC) at undergraduate medical educational level.

For this study, we aimed at a power of &#x02265; 0.8.</p></sec><sec id="s2.3"><title>Skills classification</title><p>The complexity of the skills was determined by 10 expert interviewers who rated them on a 10-point Likert scale (0= very easy to 10 = very complex).

Students were excluded on the basis of the following criteria: previous training as a paramedic or nurse, prior experience in intravenous cannulation, urinary catheter or nasogastric tube insertion, and/or inability to attend the teaching sessions within the given timeframes. Therefore, the whole cohort of 1<sup>st</sup>-year medical students at the University of T&#x000fc;bingen in 2011 (n=358) was approached for participation in the study. The 95 voluntarily participating and eligible medical students were allocated by means of blocked randomisation to one of four groups: i) &#x0201c;best practice&#x0201d; skills lab training with follow-up after 3 months (BPSL<sub>3M</sub>: <italic>n</italic>=24), ii) &#x0201c;best practice&#x0201d; skills lab training with follow-up after 6 months (BPSL<sub>6M</sub>: <italic>n</italic>=23), iii) &#x0201c;see one, do one&#x0201d; with follow-up after 3 months (TRAD<sub>3M</sub>: <italic>n</italic>=24), and iv) &#x0201c;see one, do one&#x0201d; with follow-up after 6 months (TRAD<sub>6M</sub>: <italic>n</italic>=24).

In addition, the students&#x02019; general learning strategies were characterised by two standardized questionnaires: The Kolb Learning Style Inventory (LSI) [<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and the General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSE) [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>The Kolb Learning Style Inventory aims to define an individual&#x02019;s specific learning preference. It consists of 12 items ranked on a four-point Likert scale (4 = most like me to 1= least like me) and results in one out of four learning modules: Concrete Experience (CE) - Abstract Conceptualization (AC) - Reflective Observation (RO) - Active Experimentation (AE) [<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>The General Self-Efficacy Scale is also ranked on a four-point Likert scale (1 = I agree to 4 = I disagree) and assesses 10 items with regards to perceived self-efficacy [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>Both LSI and GSE have been shown to provide a reliable measurement for students&#x02019; learning motivation and self-assessment; these two parameters were considered potential confounder in addition to former education or clinical practice [<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s2.6"><title>Conceptual frameworks</title><p>As conceptual frameworks for the learning content we used standard up-to-date manuals, which have been used regularly in our classes as well as for our previous studies [<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p><p>Regarding the conceptual frameworks for methods, the current study was based on Ericsson&#x02019;s model of deliberate practice with feedback as the basis of our skills lab training, and Bandura&#x02019;s social learning theory as basis for the traditional bedside teaching [<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s2.7"><title>&#x0201c;Best practice&#x0201d; skills laboratory training</title><p>The two intervention groups (BPSL<sub>3M</sub>: <italic>n</italic>=22 and BPSL<sub>6M</sub>: <italic>n</italic>=22) trained both procedural skills (NGT and IVC) in the skills laboratory using structured individual feedback, performance on manikins and Peyton&#x02019;s &#x0201c;Four-Step-Approach&#x0201d; [<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] which consists of the following four steps: 1. The teacher demonstrates the skill at his normal speed without any comments (&#x0201c;Demonstration&#x0201d;). 2. The teacher repeats the procedure, this time describing all necessary sub-steps (&#x0201c;Deconstruction&#x0201d;). 3. The student has to explain each sub-step with the teacher following the student&#x02019;s instructions (&#x0201c;Comprehension&#x0201d;). 4. The student performs the complete skill on his own (&#x0201c;Performance&#x0201d;). Each student was allowed to perform step 4 once for each skill. Each session was held in a group of three students with one teacher. The &#x0201c;Life/form Adult Venipuncture and Injection Training Arm&#x0201d;, a part-task-trainer model shaped like a human arm, was used for intravenous cannulation (Nasco, Fort Atkinson, USA). The &#x0201c;Nursing training manikin CLA 1+8&#x0201d; (CLA, Coburg, Germany), a whole body model, was manikin for nasogastric tube insertion. Both skill trainings were embedded into a clinical scenario with role-play to create a more realistic training situation and to enhance the students&#x02019; involvement [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].

In order to control for time differences arising due to practice in BPSL training, a thorough theoretical introduction on both procedures, NGT and IVC, was given to the students. This was followed by the practical part where the teachers showed both skills on the same manikins within the same skills laboratory setting as in the intervention groups. They explained each step while they were performing it. Students were asked to watch the performance attentively and were allowed to make themselves familiar with the material used but were not allowed to practise the skills within the teaching session itself. As with the &#x0201c;best practice&#x0201d; skills lab group, the student:teacher ratio was 3:1.</p></sec><sec id="s2.9"><title>Skills lab setting and teachers</title><p>All teaching took place within DocLab, the skills lab of the Medical Faculty of T&#x000fc;bingen. This was done to make the teaching conditions as comparable as possible and to control for a maximum of possible confounders. At any given time, only one method (BPSL or TRAD) was taught to avoid cross-contamination. In total, 8 teachers ran the training sessions. All teachers were experienced student tutors of our skills lab whose equality in teaching performance as compared to faculty staff has been shown previously [<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. They were randomised to one of the teaching methods. Additionally, the teachers received thorough instructions for their respective teaching session and a detailed manual including defined learning goals, a comprehensive teaching agenda and detailed information about the time available for each section of the teaching session.

Each student was alone in the assessment room and had only one attempt to perform the skill learned. The other students from the corresponding teaching group waited in a different room with a supervisor present until it was their respective turn for individual assessment. The total amount of time needed was recorded for each skill at both assessments dates. Two blinded video-assessors rated the performance according to pre-defined binary and global checklists.</p><p>According to group randomisation, we re-invited students after either 3 or 6 months. This time, they did not receive any teaching but were asked to perform both skills again on the same manikin in the same environment as before. Once more, students were assessed alone according to the method (BPSL or TRAD). There was an assistant present to take care of any students who arrived before their allocated assessment time. Again, students were videotaped to be rated by video-assessors via the identical checklists. All students signed an agreement not to talk to their fellow students about their experienced teaching method and not to practise the skills in between assessment date one (OSCE I) and two (OSCE II, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076354-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2.11"><title>Video rating</title><p>For videotaping, high-resolution cameras with optical zoom were used.

Two blinded video assessors evaluated students&#x02019; performance according to a binary checklist and a global rating form, both already used in our previous studies [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Video assessors were encouraged to fill in the boxes as soon as students showed the respective step. The single-item global rating on a six-point Likert-scale (6 = very good to 1 = unsatisfactory) referred to the overall performance and was given at the end of intravenous cannulation or nasogastric tube insertion. It was furthermore categorised into &#x0201c;competent students&#x0201d; (rated as &#x02018;6&#x02019; and &#x02018;5&#x02019;), &#x0201c;borderline students&#x0201d; (rated as &#x02018;4&#x02019; and &#x02018;3&#x02019;) and &#x0201c;incompetent students&#x0201d; (rated as &#x02018;2&#x02019; and &#x02018;1&#x02019;).</p></sec><sec id="s2.12"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All data are presented as means &#x000b1; standard error of the mean (SEM), if not otherwise stated. Data were tested for normal distribution using the Shapiro-Wilk-Test. Normally distributed data were compared using a Student&#x02019;s t-test (assuming equal variances). A Mann-Whitney U-Test (MWU) was used for non-normally distributed parameters. For reader&#x02019;s convenience, results of the MWU tests are not displayed as sum of ranks. The distribution of discontinuous group characteristics was compared by the chi-square test. Effect sizes were calculated using Cohen&#x02019;s d for continuous variables and Cramer&#x02019;s &#x003c6; for 2-level associations. Standardized inter-rater reliability for the two video assessors was calculated based on Kappa analysis. A <italic>p</italic>-value &#x0003c;0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Raw data were processed using Microsoft EXCEL (Microsoft Inc., Redmond, WA, USA). The software packages JMP (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) and SPSS (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) were used for statistical analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s2.13"><title>Ethics</title><p>Study participation was voluntary and all students were assured of anonymity and confidentiality. Students were informed that the purpose of the study was the comparison of different ways of teaching but they did not receive any details. The ethics committee of the University of T&#x000fc;bingen waived the requirement of further ethical approval based on the condition that all data were analyzed anonymously (Nr. 539/2012A and 296/2008A).

Of the 358 students approached, 121 medical students volunteered to participate. After initial screening according to our criteria, 95 were eligible to be included in the study. Three students failed to attend follow-up and another video was not assessable for technical reasons, therefore the final number of students whose performance could be completely assessed was 91 (BPSL<sub>3M</sub>: <italic>n</italic>=22, BPSL<sub>6M</sub>: <italic>n</italic>=22, TRAD<sub>3M</sub>: <italic>n</italic>=23, TRAD<sub>6M</sub>: <italic>n</italic>=24).</p></sec><sec id="s3.2"><title>Student sample</title><p>All participating students were in their first year.

Following assessment after training, students were re-invited for a second assessment either 3 or 6 months after initial training sessions according to randomisation. Students were carefully selected according to in- and exclusion criteria and randomized to one of the four groups. There were no significant differences in socioeconomic background and other potentially influencing variables among the four different study cohorts. Students who received the &#x0201c;best practice&#x0201d; model of skills lab training showed significantly better results measured with binary checklists as well as a single-item global rating at measurement immediately after teaching (T<sub>0</sub>) and each follow-up (3 or 6 months, respectively). Interestingly, BPSL training led to better assessment results, in particular for IVC which represents a task of higher complexity, while NGT as a lower complexity skill made its benefit from BPSL training primarily in regard to its long-term retention (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076354-g003">Figure 3</xref>). It should be emphasized that the resulting effect sizes attributed to BPSL can be considered quite large. This was surprising given the long time interval between the assessments (3 and 6 months, respectively) and the short intervention time (90 min each for both BPSL and TRAD teaching sessions).</p><p>Being trained in the &#x0201c;best practice&#x0201d; skills lab group also led to a significantly shorter time needed for performance of both skills, despite the fact that both tested teaching methods occupied the identical resources in teaching time. Furthermore, BPSL students were significantly more often rated as &#x0201c;competent&#x0201d; than TRAD students.</p><p>To our knowledge, the long-term retention of skills taught to medical students comparing a &#x0201c;best practice&#x0201d; model of skills lab training and a &#x0201c;see one, do one&#x0201d; approach as frequently used in clinical bedside teaching has not been investigated so far. Most of the research contrasting simulation-based medical education (SBME) and traditional teaching methods to date has focused on residents, and was either concerned with complex surgical or intensive care procedures [<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] or refers to cardiac life support training [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. It is well known, that straight after training SBME with &#x0201c;deliberate practice&#x0201d; is superior to traditional clinical teaching in the acquisition of a broad variety of skills [<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. We could show that on top of the immediate effect, there is a long term benefit of &#x0201c;best practice&#x0201d; skills lab training with structured individual feedback, training on manikins and Peyton&#x02019;s &#x0201c;Four-Step-Approach&#x0201d; improves students&#x02019; performance in a relatively simple task (nasogastric tube insertion) as well as a more complex one (intravenous cannulation). There is a relative superiority of BPSL after 3 or 6 months and a smaller loss of correctly performed steps in absolute terms.</p><p>Within the &#x0201c;best practice&#x0201d; skills lab training, various factors contributed to the teaching: First, BPSL teachers acted as role models when showing the skill, helping students to observe the correct procedure. Secondly, we included Peyton&#x02019;s &#x0201c;Four-Step-Approach&#x0201d; [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], which implies a rather unusual step, namely instructing the teacher step-by-step how to perform the skills. This comprises the necessity to review all steps on their own and also reflect upon the procedure itself. Reflection has been shown to be a crucial step in memory consolidation [<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Additionally, BPSL students had the advantage of &#x0201c;learning through teaching&#x0201d; by instructing someone else in step 3 of Peyton&#x02019;s &#x0201c;Four-Step-Approach&#x0201d;. If students made a mistake, they could see the immediate implication as the tutor followed all instructions given by the student regardless of them being correct or not. This gives immediate feedback and allows students to monitor their progress. This kind of metacognitive awareness is a hallmark feature of self-regulated learning, which is an approach that actively incorporates students into the learning process [<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Students are encouraged to show initiative and take responsibility for what and how they learn [<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Particularly in its directed form as described by Brydges and colleagues, self-regulated learning can lead to superior long-term performance when compared to an instructor-regulated approach [<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. This could help to explain why our results do not seem to be in line with the &#x0201c;performance&#x02013;learning paradox&#x0201d;, which refers to the common finding that immediate performance can be quite good but does not necessarily reflect long-term learning [<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. In the current study, students trained in skills labs were not only better at immediate assessment but also at the respective follow-up assessment after 3 or 6 months, respectively. As another component of the &#x0201c;best practice&#x0201d; skills lab training, BPSL students received structured individual feedback on their own performance. This is well recognised to represent a key feature of effective skills lab training [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Simulators alone are not enough to improve skill performance [<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Feedback helps medical students to get a feeling for what they do and increases the likelihood of correct performance [<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. On the other hand, research in motor learning shows that feedback from instructors improves immediate performance but can be a hindrance for long-term learning [<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. In our study this was not supported, as the &#x0201c;best practice&#x0201d; skills lab teaching group had more feedback but performed better in the long run. This might be due to other components in line with the concept of self-regulated learning like review at each stage and self-monitoring as described above. Finally, by integrating the aspect of role-play into BPSL teaching, a more realistic training scenario was created [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>On the contrary, the alternative teaching followed the &#x0201c;see one &#x02013; do one&#x0201d; principle, usually common in clinical bedside teaching. TRAD Students&#x02019; only way of learning the skill was through attentive observation as in line with the social learning theory [<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Tutors acted as role models by demonstrating each skill to the students. However, all other components described as part of skills lab teaching were completely missing, and students never had the opportunity to practise the skill before the first assessment, as this is not part of a traditional bedside situation. This might explain their inferiority to BPSL students.</p><p>Nonetheless, in general, there was a decline in the ability to perform both skills in nearly all students. Only 7 students out of the 91 (3 BPSL, 4 TRAD) showed an improvement from t<sub>0</sub> to their respective long-term follow-up. This is likely explained by the fact that they were all amongst the bottom performers at baseline point and, thus profited by the training effect of a 2<sup>nd</sup> assessment.</p><p>We added a global rating to the binary checklist in order to balance for the fact that a checklist ranks all items in the same way, potentially leading to failure because of several less important items rather than one big mistake [<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Our good inter-rater reliability for both measurements validates our methodological approach to measure skill performance. Additionally, global ratings take into account the difference between competence shown in an assessment situation and performance shown under real life circumstances as described by Rethans et al. [<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Furthermore, we tried to improve the validity of our skills training and testing by creating a role-play scenario as validity improves effective learning [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>].</p><p>We deliberately used student tutors as teachers who are teaching in our official classes within the curriculum. They have been shown to be equally effective and accepted as staff [<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] and student tutors are meanwhile part of most faculties&#x02019; skills lab training [<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Additionally, all tutors participating in our study received an elaborate manual as well as a training session before teaching the students.</p><p>In line with well-matched skills training, most students are being taught simple as well as more complex skills early on from the beginning of their studies. This is the first step of a process building up to the transfer of these skills to actual patient care. Following the results of our study, some recommendations for skills teaching can be made: Skills lab training comprising different teaching elements like structured individual feedback, practise on manikins and Peyton&#x02019;s &#x0201c;Four-Step-Approach&#x0201d; should be an inherent part of undergraduate medical education. To optimise long-term outcome, these skills should be refreshed in at least biannual intervals for more complex skills, and annually for easier tasks. Further studies have to examine whether supervised practice outside regular curricular activities can also serve this purpose.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Limitations</title><p>Several limitations of our study should be mentioned. As the study was done on a voluntary basis, there is of course the possibility of a selection bias with only the very motivated students showing up. However, there were a lot more students registering in the first place that had to be excluded due to exclusion criteria or time incompatibilities. Additionally, careful randomisation of all applicants to one of our four groups was performed.</p><p>Furthermore, we cannot exclude that some students practised the tasks on their own, although all students signed an agreement not to do so and additionally gave oral confirmation on their second testing day about it. In any case, it is very unlikely that they had a structured training in the meantime. Another limitation is the fact that all teaching took place in a simulated environment. This limits the generalizability of our findings with regards to clinical context. Additionally, students taught within the skills lab could practise each skill one time before doing the actual test in the assessment stations as opposed to bedside teaching students who had only seen someone else performing the task. However, this was part of one of the components included into the skills lab teaching, namely Peyton&#x02019;s &#x0201c;Four-Step-Approach&#x0201d;. At the same time, the traditional &#x0201c;see one, do one&#x0201d; approach without this possibility to practise has been recognised as an appropriate teaching method, too [<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Additionally, we made all other conditions like time or student to tutor ratio the same for both groups. Another limitation may be seen in that we did not undertake any assessment of students&#x02019; prior abilities. We deliberately waived this possibility during designing the study in order to minimize any training effect due to repetitive testing.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, we could show that a best practice skills lab training of intravenous cannulation and nasogastric tube insertion skills is superior to the traditional &#x0201c;see one, do one&#x0201d; approach not only immediately after training, but also at 3 or 6 months follow up. This observed superiority applies for single steps of the procedures, time needed to perform the skills, and the global clinical impression. With regards to the long-term performance, skills lab teaching seems to be particularly helpful for the reproduction of easier skills.</p><p>In line with previous studies that showed superiority of skills lab training immediately after teaching and in transfer to real patients for the two skills [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], this study underlines the importance of skills lab training being an integral part of teaching students with respect to long-term performance. Regular fresher classes have to be provided when our students are supposed to show stable performances. We suggest a biannual interval for more complex tasks and an annual one for easier tasks.</p><p>Further studies should investigate whether these findings hold up when transferred to real patients. Additionally, research in this field should focus on clarification studies as suggested by Cook et al., asking for how and why skills lab training seems to be so superior to the traditional &#x0201c;see one, do one&#x0201d; training provided by bedside teaching [<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>].</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank Friederike Holderried (MD) for her constructive suggestions and organisational support, as well as Clare Blythe (Research Assistant) and Christopher Garrrett MD for proofreading the manuscript.
