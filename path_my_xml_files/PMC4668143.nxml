training programs used in a variety of fields have had on the ankle&#x02019;s static and dynamic
senses of balance among subjects with functional ankle instability. [Subjects and Methods]
This study randomly divided research subjects into two groups, a strengthening exercise
group (Group I) and a balance exercise group (Group II), with each group consisting of 10
people. A virtual reality program was performed three times a week for four weeks.
Exercises from the Nintendo Wii Fit Plus program were applied to each group for twenty
minutes along with ten minutes of warming up and wrap-up exercises. [Results] Group II
showed a significant decrease of post-intervention static and dynamic balance overall in
the anterior-posterior, and mediolateral directions, compared with the pre-intervention
test results. In comparison of post-intervention static and dynamic balance between Group
I and Group II, a significant decrease was observed overall. [Conclusion] Virtual reality
programs improved the static balance and dynamic balance of subjects with functional ankle
instability. Virtual reality programs can be used more safely and efficiently if they are
implemented under appropriate monitoring by a physiotherapist.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Virtual reality</kwd><kwd>Balance</kwd><kwd>Functional ankle instability</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>In a virtual reality (VR) program, human beings interact with a virtual space; this has the
advantage of allowing the movements of an experiment&#x02019;s subjects to be perfectly observed,
evaluated, and controlled, which makes it a good candidate for new intervention methods for
neurological rehabilitation<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Despite such
advantages, however, the use of VR programs has been limited due to restrictive usefulness
and the high cost of VR systems<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Although
the effects of traditional training programs on enhancement of the sense of balance has been
proven, the programs have a disadvantage in that they are somewhat boring and unable to
arouse participants&#x02019; interest<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. VR
programs are especially useful in the field of physiotherapy because they enable repetitive
exercise learning and provide a mechanism for providing proper incentives to patients who
need feedback<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Through this direct
feedback, VR programs can not only provoke excitement but also enable users to develop a
good sense of balance<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Ankle sprains make up a large proportion of injuries in several different areas of
activity, especially sports. For example, according to a study that investigated injuries
incurred in a total of fifteen sports, including baseball, basketball, hockey, and soccer,
for approximately 16&#x02005;years, ankle sprain accounted for the highest proportion of injuries,
representing 15% of the total<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Another
study reported that 25% of the injuries relevant to sports involved ankle sprains<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Moreover, 40&#x02013;70% of those who suffer an
ankle sprain have the potential risk of chronic ankle instability if the sprain goes
untreated<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. College students who
actively participate in sports activities therefore should pay special attention to
physiotherapy for ankle sprains. Functional ankle instability (FAI) refers to a subjective
condition in which the subject has the feeling of his or her ankle giving way as a result of
repetitive ankle sprain<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. FAI is a major
cause of lack of muscle strength and sense of balance. In particular, the sense of balance
plays a fundamental role in many activities, and it is a critical factor for successful
exercise performance<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Balance refers to the neuromuscular activity process that occurs when individual tries to
maintain his/her posture in a smooth and coordinated manner when the body is about to
deviate from the gravitational center line of the basal plane. Some of the factors essential
for balancing include the visual system, vestibular system, and proprioceptive sense<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Balance can be classified into static
balance and dynamic balance. Static balance refers to sense of balance when maintaining a
stand-still posture on one or both legs without movement. Dynamic balance refers to the
sense of balance when standing without collapse during movement. According to study results
concerning the difference in balance between subjects with FAI and a stable ankle,
deficiency of balance turned out to be related to ankle instability, which can subsequently
cause ankle sprain<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, balance and coordinated training is frequently used for
preventing the reoccurrence of ankle sprain<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>This study therefore investigated the impact that recent VR training programs used in a
variety of fields have had on the ankle&#x02019;s static and dynamic senses of balance among
subjects with FAI; it further attempts to complement previous physiotherapeutic intervention
methods applied to the ankles.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>There were 20 participants (16 female and 4 male) aged 21&#x02013;27&#x02005;years (mean 23.3&#x02005;years, SD =
2.4&#x02005;years). They ranged in height from 155 to 177&#x02005;cm (mean = 163.1&#x02005;cm, SD = 7.4&#x02005;cm) and in
weight from 42 to 73&#x02005;kg (mean = 55&#x02005;kg, SD = 10.2&#x02005;kg). Their Cumberland ankle instability
tool (CAIT) scores ranged from 7 to 26 (mean = 18.3 score, SD = 5.4 score).</p><p>The research subjects were gathered by public invitation for students enrolled in
universities located in Gwangju and Suncheon in South Korea. The sample consists of 20
university students in their twenties. This study randomly divided research subjects into
two groups, a strengthening exercise group (Group I) and a balance exercise group (Group
II), with each group consisting of 10 people. The CAIT was used to measure FAI. The
selection criteria were as follows: (1) previous experience of an ankle sprain that made
weight support impossible, (2) previous experience of a feeling of the ankle joint giving
way as a result of an ankle sprain, (3) a CAIT score lower than 24, (4) capability to
perform the intervention or daily activities without an increase in pain, (5) not
currently participating in other rehabilitation exercise programs, and (6) no history of
ankle surgery. This study proceeded after receiving approval through a preliminary review
by the Committee of Clinical Tests at Gwangju Oriental Hospital of Dongshin University
(IRB No. DSGOH-019), and all participants provided informed consent.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A VR program was performed three times a week for four weeks. It required a total of 30
minutes for daily exercise, including 10 minutes for warming up and wrap-up exercises. VR
exercises from the Nintendo Wii Fit Plus (Nintendo Inc., Kyoto, Japan) program were
applied to each group for twenty minutes; the intensity of the exercise program was
properly controlled by the physiotherapist according to the participants&#x02019; needs. In the
event of unforeseen circumstances in which a subject could not participate, he or she
performed the exercise program on a different day. The experiment participants were told
of the purpose and objective of this study, and they were asked for consent before
participation, which was voluntary.</p><p>The Nintendo Wii Fit Plus contains programs that aim to enhance muscle strength as well
as those that aim to enhance the sense of balance. For muscle strengthening exercise,
lunges, single-leg extensions, sideways leg lifts, single leg twists, and rowing squats
were performed. For exercise that enhances balancing sense, the soccer heading, ski
slalom, tight rope walk, table tilt, and snowboard slalom games were used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Virtual reality training.

measuring ankle balance. The Biodex Balance System consists of a display and a platform,
and it contains twelve strain gauges that measure the angle of the platform. The platform
can freely move in any direction up to 20&#x000b0;, and information for balance overall and for
and anterior-posterior and medial-lateral directions can be obtained using the system<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Measurements were performed while the subjects supported their weight with their legs
straight on the center of the support plate and with eyes open while maintaining 90&#x000b0;
flexion on the other side&#x02019;s knee joint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig.
2</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_002" position="float"><label>Fig. 2.</label><caption><p>Measure of ankle balance</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jpts-27-3097-g002"/></fig>). The weight-bearing foot was entered following the program directions for
measurement. The support plate stability can be adjusted between 1 and 8 degrees, with a
lower value indicating better balance sense. Measurements were conducted for 30 seconds,
followed by a 10 second break; the average of three measurements was calculated and used
as the experiment value. After static balance measurement, dynamic balance was measured,
and the level of dynamic balance was set at level 2, which indicates low stability<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Descriptive statistics (average and standard deviation) were calculated for all the data
measured in this study using the PASW statistics 18.0 software. The one-sample
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was performed to determine if each measurement variable had a
normal distribution. The paired-samples t-test was performed to determine if there were
significant differences before and after VR training programs. Moreover, an
independent-samples t-test was performed to examine the difference according to the type
of VR training program. In testing the significance of the statistical analysis results,
the significance level &#x003b1; was set at 0.05 for all tests.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Group I showed a significant decrease in post-intervention static balance in the

medial-lateral direction compared with the pre-intervention test results while no
significant difference was observed overall or in the anterior-posterior direction. This can
be attributed to the fact that among the five muscle strength exercises in this study, the
sideways leg lift, the single leg extension, and the single-leg twist exercise were designed
with the purpose of enhancing muscle strength in the medial-lateral direction while
maintaining balance. Pessoa et al.<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>
pointed out that even though the muscle strength exercises of Nintendo Wii Fit Plus can be
used for physiotherapeutic intervention, they were originally designed for entertainment,
rather than for professional intervention, which supports the results of this study.</p><p>Group II showed a significant decrease in post-intervention static balance overall and in
the anterior-posterior and medial-lateral directions compared with the pre-intervention test
results. Considering this, balance training using VR is effective in enhancing static
balance in all directions among subjects with FAI. These results can be attributed to the
fact that the ski slalom and snowboard slalom games used in this study not only spur
anterior-posterior directional movement but also enable medial-lateral directional movement.
Moreover, the tight rope walk game stimulates movement in the medial-lateral direction, and
the table tilt game involves movement in all directions (overall)<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. Moreover, in the comparison of post-intervention static
balance between Group I and Group II, a significant decrease was observed overall, which
implies that balance training is more effective than strength training.</p><p>Group I showed a significant decrease in post-intervention dynamic balance overall compared
with the pre-intervention test results, with no significant difference in the
anterior-posterior and medial-lateral direction. This result can be interpreted as
indicating that an increase in ankle muscle strength was linked to pain reduction, which
subsequently affected ankle balance. Son et al.<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup> reported a correlation between ankle strengthening exercise and
balance, which is consistent with this study&#x02019;s results.</p><p>Group II showed a significant decrease in post-intervention dynamic balance overall and in
the anterior-posterior and medial-lateral directions compared with the pre-intervention test
results. These results are consistent with the static balance results in this study, which
can be attributed to the fact that more interesting and exciting factors were added compared
with traditional physiotherapy exercise programs<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. Moreover, it is believed that the application of VR training
programs enables participants to be immersed in repetitive practice with controlled
movement<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. A VR program using Nintendo
Wii Fit Plus can thus be thought of as a useful tool for improving the balance of those with
FAI. In comparison of post-intervention dynamic balance between Group I and Group II, there
was a significant decrease overall and in the anterior-posterior direction but no
significant difference in the medial-lateral direction. This implies that balance exercises
were more effective on dynamic balance than strengthening exercises in this study. However,
the balance training did not show as many effects as the strength training in the
medial-lateral direction. This can be attributed to the limited time of four weeks for the
intervention.</p><p>The body receives ground reaction forces (GRFs) in every type of gait; vertical GRFs, in
particular, which have two peaks for each step, have a magnitude as large as 120% of a
person&#x02019;s weight. These GRFs thus have a considerable impact on the foot, and they can also
incur plantar flexion, as the line of action is located in the rear of the ankle.
Considering these points, maintaining a sense of balance overall is important in preventing
ankle sprain. In the gait cycle, GRFs are located toward the posterior direction during heel
strike, and toward the anterior direction during the late stance and early swing phases.
Anterior-posterior GRFs have a magnitude of approximately 20% of one&#x02019;s weight, and they can
affect the body&#x02019;s center of gravity and walking speed. Without proper balance in the
anterior-posterior direction, people can slip forward or slip backward or can be unable to
move the body forward. The magnitude of GRFs in the medial-lateral direction is as small as
approximately 5% of body weight, and hence it is not easily felt during normal gait. It can
be felt, however, in cases of a very long gait or when jumping sideways. Moreover, in cases
of walking on snow-covered roads or on ice, people minimize medial-lateral GRFs by
minimizing their step width<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Considering this, balance in the medial-lateral direction is apparently very important for
preventing ankle sprain in situations such as rough sports activities or when walking on
slippery ground, e.g., over snow or on uneven ground.</p><p>In this study, the application of VR programs showed significant effects on static and
dynamic balance among subjects with FAI. There have been some reports of damage or injury in
shoulder and knee joints, however, as well as fractures of cervical vertebrae in cases of VR
application. It is important to implement exercise programs under appropriate monitoring of
a physiotherapist in order to avoid such potential risks<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup>. As for the limitations
of this study, the intervention period was rather short (four weeks), and the subjects
included were all in their twenties. We expect that the physiotherapeutic area can be
further expanded if the effects of VR programs are investigated not only in terms of ankle
balance but also in terms of more diverse areas such as strength and proprioceptivity in
future studies. </p><p>To sum up, virtual reality programs improved the static balance and dynamic balance of
subjects with functional ankle instability. Moreover, we believe that virtual reality
programs can be used more safely and efficiently, as long as they are implemented under
appropriate monitoring by a physiotherapist.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was supported by research funds from Gwangju University in 2015.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Riva</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>From toys to brain: virtual Reality applications in
