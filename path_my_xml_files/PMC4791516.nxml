Thus, we evaluated the effects of an 8-week increase in activity energy expenditure (AEE) on <italic>ad libitum</italic> energy intake (EI), body mass and composition in healthy participants with baseline physical activity levels (PAL) in line with international recommendations. Forty-six male adults (BMI&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;19&#x000b7;7&#x02013;29&#x000b7;3&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>) participated in an intervention group, and ten (BMI&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;21&#x000b7;0&#x02013;28&#x000b7;4&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>) in a control group. Anthropometric measures, cardiorespiratory fitness, EI, AEE and exercise intensity were recorded at baseline and during the 1st, 5th and 8th intervention weeks, and movement was recorded throughout. Body composition was measured at the beginning and at the end of the study, and resting energy expenditure was measured after the study. The intervention group increased PAL from 1&#x000b7;74 (<sc>se</sc> 0&#x000b7;03) to 1&#x000b7;93 (<sc>se</sc> 0&#x000b7;03) (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0&#x000b7;0001) and cardiorespiratory fitness from 41&#x000b7;4 (<sc>se</sc> 0&#x000b7;9) to 45&#x000b7;7 (<sc>se</sc> 1&#x000b7;1)&#x000a0;ml O<sub>2</sub>/kg per min (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0&#x000b7;001) while decreasing body mass (&#x02212;1&#x000b7;36 (<sc>se</sc> 0&#x000b7;2)&#x000a0;kg; <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0&#x000b7;001) through adipose tissue mass loss (ATM) (&#x02212;1&#x000b7;61 (<sc>se</sc> 0&#x000b7;2)&#x000a0;kg; <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0&#x000b7;0001) compared with baseline. The control group did not show any significant changes in activity, body mass or ATM. EI was unchanged in both groups. The results indicate that in normal-weight and overweight men, increasing PAL from 1&#x000b7;7 to 1&#x000b7;9 while keeping EI <italic>ad libitum</italic> over an 8-week period produces a prolonged negative energy balance. Replication using a longer period (and/or more intense increase in PAL) is needed to investigate if and at what body composition the increase in AEE is met by an equivalent increase in EI.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Energy balance</kwd><kwd>Energy expenditure</kwd><kwd><italic>Ad libitum</italic> food intake</kwd><kwd>Exercise intervention</kwd><kwd>Body composition</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="abbreviations"><title>Abbreviations</title><kwd>AEE, activity energy expenditure</kwd><kwd>ATM, adipose tissue mass</kwd><kwd>EE, energy expenditure</kwd><kwd>EI, energy intake</kwd><kwd>estV<sub>O2max</sub>, estimated maximal cardiorespiratory fitness</kwd><kwd>HR, heart rate</kwd><kwd>LTM, lean tissue mass</kwd><kwd>MET, metabolic equivalent</kwd><kwd>PA, physical activity</kwd><kwd>PAL, physical activity level</kwd><kwd>REE, resting energy expenditure</kwd><kwd>TEE, total energy expenditure</kwd><kwd>V<sub>CO2</sub>, carbon dioxide production</kwd><kwd>V<sub>O2</sub>, oxygen consumption</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="4"/><table-count count="2"/><ref-count count="66"/><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><p>Energy balance is the state in which energy expenditure (EE) equals metabolisable energy intake (EI) so that the overall energy content of the body remains stable<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>. A negative energy balance occurs when EE is greater than EI, and a positive energy balance occurs when EI is greater than EE. The extent to which exercise changes energy balance depends on the extent to which the increase in EE due to exercise is balanced by a compensatory increase in EI.</p><p>The intuitive common-sense view is that an increase in activity EE (AEE) is followed by an equivalent increase in EI<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>, which raises the question of whether exercise alone, without any imposed dietary regimens, could be prescribed as a single tool for body-weight regulation.</p><p>Some studies indicate that short-term exercise does not have the same effect on food intake as long-term exercise. Studies investigating the effects of exercise on <italic>ad libitum</italic> EI suggest a rather loose coupling between EI and EE in both normal-weight and obese individuals during short-term exercise interventions lasting from 1 or more hours to 2 or more weeks<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref><sup>&#x02013;</sup><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>. It was suggested that mobilisation of the fuels in the blood during exercise plays a role in the inhibition of food intake<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>. It was also found that exercise is accompanied by an increase in the release of glucagon, which in combination with other satiety factors such as cholecystokinin, cytokines and serotonin, contribute to suppressing food intake<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>. Exercise-induced increases in core temperature, blood lactate levels and TNF were also cited as possible mechanisms inducing hunger suppression<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>. All these mechanisms were proposed to explain the exercise-induced suppression of EI, but the exact mechanisms for this phenomenon remain largely unknown.</p><p>Although an increase of EE is not followed by an equivalent increase of EI in the short term<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>, the correlation becomes positive over the course of approximately 1 to 2 weeks or more, depending on the participant's body composition<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>. The speed at which EI starts balancing increased EE may differ between lean and obese participants. In lean active individuals with daily physical activity levels (PAL) around 1&#x000b7;7 and higher, energy balance is achieved by spontaneous adjustments of EI to match EE, yielding relative stability of the body's energy stores<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>. Several studies suggest that an increase in PAL is less likely to be followed by a corresponding increase in EI in obese individuals than in lean individuals<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref><sup>&#x02013;</sup><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>. Many physiological and psychological factors may influence the observed absence of a compensatory increase in EI in obese participants<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>. One explanation is that fat mass may act as an energy buffer<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref><sup>)</sup> and fully compensatory responses in EI to altered levels of AEE might not begin until the excess adipose tissue is expended<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>, but this hypothesis has not been directly tested.</p><p>The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of an 8-week exercise-induced increase of EE on <italic>ad libitum</italic> EI, body mass and body composition changes in normal-weight and overweight male participants with baseline PAL in line with international recommendations for the health-enhancing effects of physical activity (PA), i.e. at least 30&#x000a0;min of moderate intensity at least 5&#x000a0;d a week<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>.

The participants were recruited in a non-randomised allocation manner, recruiting the intervention group first, followed by fifteen participants in the control group for the sake of data comparison and detection of possible significant differences between the groups. Participants were healthy individuals who engaged in at least 30&#x000a0;min of moderate intensity PA at least 5&#x000a0;d a week.

The declared purpose was to conduct metabolic studies. Beyond that, the true purpose of the study was not discussed with the participants, nor did they spontaneously inquire about it. The study consisted of a 1-week baseline period and an 8-week intervention period. During the baseline period, the participants were instructed to maintain their usual lifestyle routines, food intake and PA habits. After the baseline period, the intervention group was instructed to increase AEE by approximately 10&#x000b7;5&#x000a0;MJ/week or approximately 2092&#x000a0;kJ/d on 5&#x000a0;d/week on a moderate to vigorous PAL for the duration of the 8-week intervention period. The control group was instructed to maintain their usual lifestyle routines, food intake and PA habits throughout the entire study period. The Compendium of Physical Activity<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref><sup>)</sup> was used to provide participants in the intervention group with examples of endurance exercise modes (jogging, cycling, walking, swimming, etc.) necessary to expend approximately 2092&#x000a0;kJ/d. Upon request, some exercise modes (jogging, walking) were also demonstrated practically (intensity and duration) by a professional PA instructor. Anthropometric data, cardiovascular fitness, AEE, energy intensity and EI data were collected during the baseline period and during the 1st, 5th and 8th weeks of the intervention period in the intervention group. Movement (counts/min) during waking hours was recorded with accelerometers throughout the entire study. Body composition was measured at the beginning and at the end of the study, and resting EE (REE) was measured after the study. All the measurements were also repeated in the control group, except for the AEE and dietary intake during the 1st week of the intervention period, which were not carried out due to the limited financial and human resources available for the study. Before and after each measurement time point, the PA instructor organised regular meetings with the participants, discussed the activities performed and encouraged the maintenance of the prescribed PAL. All data were collected at the Swiss Olympic Medical Centre, Magglingen, Switzerland, using the methods described below. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref> provides a schematic representation of the intervention group study protocol.

During the measurements, participants were instructed to lay supine on the scanning table with their ankles fixed using supports. Participants&#x02019; arms were positioned to the side with their palms flat on the table. Participants were required to remain still. Whole-body scans were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions, and adipose tissue mass (ATM), lean tissue mass (LTM) and bone mineral content were calculated (enCore software v. 11.10; GE Healthcare). The machine's calibration was checked and passed on a daily basis before each scanning session using a calibration phantom.

Calibration of the gas analysers and flow measurement module was carried out before each measurement according to the manufacturer's instructions. The participants were instructed to arrive at the research unit in the morning after an overnight fast, avoiding any strenuous physical effort. After acclimatising and relaxing on a bed for 30&#x000a0;min, a ventilated hood (Canopy System Option, AEI Technologies, Inc.) was placed over their heads and the measurements started. Oxygen consumption (V<sub>O2</sub>) and carbon dioxide production (V<sub>CO2</sub>) were measured for 30&#x000a0;min with the participants in a supine position and completely at rest in a quiet and thermoneutral environment (20&#x02013;22&#x000b0;C). The first 5&#x000a0;min of data were eliminated as an acclimatisation artefact. From the remaining 25&#x000a0;min, segments of a minimum ten consecutive 1-min measures with &#x0003c;10&#x000a0;% CV in V<sub>O2</sub> and V<sub>CO2</sub> were considered as steady-state.

As a consequence, this was accompanied by a significant reduction of body mass through ATM loss.</p><p>Current guidelines recommend 30&#x000a0;min of moderate intensity activity 5 or more days per week for the general population to promote optimal health and prevent chronic diseases, 60&#x000a0;min/d of moderate intensity activity 5 or more days per week as a target level for preventing weight gain and 60&#x02013;90&#x000a0;min of moderate intensity activity as a target level for preventing weight regain following significant weight loss and to enhance long-term weight control outcomes<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr"><sup>45</sup></xref><sup>&#x02013;</sup><xref rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr"><sup>48</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>. This consensus has been reached based predominantly on observational evidence<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>. One major limitation of the existing evidence is the lack of objective measurement of PA. Limited evidence indicates that a much higher dose of activity may be needed to prevent overweight and obesity and to avoid weight regain in previously overweight and obese individuals<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Our participants were already active before starting the intervention period, engaging in PA for an average of 90&#x000a0;min/d at a moderate intensity level and around 10&#x000a0;min/d at a high intensity level, thus reaching an average baseline PAL of 1&#x000b7;7. This means that they were, already at baseline, largely compliant and much above the recommendations for minimal PA levels for the prevention of chronic disease. During the 8-week exercise intervention, PAL increased to an average of 1&#x000b7;9 (equivalent to around 2&#x000a0;h of moderate-to-high intensity activity per d). This increase of PAL did not only induce body mass loss during <italic>ad libitum</italic> food intake but also significantly improved a major protective factor, i.e. aerobic fitness level.</p><p>Although we would need to look at different PAL to be able to make recommendations on the PAL required for the prevention of body-weight gain (or regain), the findings of our study suggest a PAL of 1&#x000b7;9 as a reasonable level for body-weight gain prevention under <italic>ad libitum</italic> nutritional conditions.</p><p>According to the dietary reference intakes (DRI), the nutrient requirements of persons aged 19 to 50 years old are essentially equal and not influenced by ageing<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr"><sup>49</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>. The participants in our study belonged to this age group (21 to 45 years), so their nutritional requirements were not influenced by age span. Additionally, we recruited only men in order to exclude the potential influence of sex in response to an imposed exercise intervention. While some studies showed no sex difference in body-weight response to exercise<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref50" ref-type="bibr"><sup>50</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>, others suggested that women tend to &#x02018;defend&#x02019; body fat against body mass loss due to increased PA under <italic>ad libitum</italic> food intake more effectively than men<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref51" ref-type="bibr"><sup>51</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref52" ref-type="bibr"><sup>52</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>. Finally, our inclusion criteria comprised both normal-weight and overweight participants. The body composition of individuals engaging in sports plays an important role in EI regulation and its changes over time. When engaging in moderate to intense PA regularly and on a long-term basis, lean and obese participants do not behave identically. Whereas lean participants show a tendency to balance the increased PAL by adapting their EI to reach a balance within a period of several days to several weeks, obese participants, probably due to their excess energy storage, do not show such a compensatory mechanism<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>. One possible explanation for this observation is that, in the obese state, fat mass may act as an energy buffer, and compensatory responses in intake to altered levels of exercise might not begin until excess energy stores drop below a certain level. Taking this into account, we have chosen to study normal-weight to overweight participants in order to detect possible alterations of EI due to increased PAL already during the 8-week exercise intervention period of our study. The larger excess body fat storage of obese participants would probably have required a significantly longer intervention period in order for their regulatory mechanism to trigger a spontaneous increase in EI once their energy stores dropped below a certain level.</p><p>As hypothesised, the 8-week exercise intervention did not progressively induce a reciprocal increase in EI. The overweight participants tended to lose more body weight than the normal-weight participants, despite having a similar PAL. However, the absence of a full compensatory effect in response to an exercise-induced energy deficit cannot be presumed to continue indefinitely. We would expect that, once the excess adipose tissue becomes significantly depleted, a regulatory mechanism would trigger a spontaneous increase in EI in order to match EE. To test this further, a similar study design over a longer period of time &#x02013; or a study of similar duration but with a leaner study group &#x02013; would be needed.</p><p>When examining the effects of exercise on body-weight regulation, it should also be taken into account that large inter-individual differences are often observed<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref53" ref-type="bibr"><sup>53</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>. Examining only the overall group mean weight loss could lead to the inaccurate interpretation that all individuals experience the same effect of exercise. Our study also showed that exercise interventions produce large inter-individual variability in body weight. Furthermore, the participants who gained weight during the intervention period had a similar PAL and similar time spent on low, moderate or vigorous activities compared with those who lost weight. According to the dietary records of the participants who gained weight, their EI was similar to that of the individuals who lost weight, indicating possible larger EI under-reporting of those who gained weight.</p><p>To assess the effect of exercise on energy balance regulation, studies accurately and precisely measuring both EI and EE are needed. In the past, the lack of methods enabling precise and accurate estimates of AEE in a free-living environment for prolonged periods of time were responsible for the greater use of EI estimates as a proxy of EE, assuming EI&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;EE. However, in 1985, the joint FAO/WHO/UNU Expert Consultation suggested abandoning this approach and concentrating on measuring EE rather than EI to assess energy requirements<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref54" ref-type="bibr"><sup>54</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>. In free-living humans, the accuracy of EI estimates is questionable and extremely uncertain<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref55" ref-type="bibr"><sup>55</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>. Underestimations of EI up to 20&#x000a0;%, particularly in obese individuals<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref55" ref-type="bibr"><sup>55</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref56" ref-type="bibr"><sup>56</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>, have been observed. The underestimation in EI reporting is evident in the present study as well, starting from the baseline period, where one would assume EI would be similar to TEE, given that the participants reported stable body mass upon recruitment.</p><p>In order to enhance the accuracy of dietary assessment methods, future studies should explore the use of alternative techniques for EI measurement. The doubly labelled water method represents the &#x02018;gold standard&#x02019; for estimating EE and validating EI measurements, although it is rather costly<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref57" ref-type="bibr"><sup>57</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>. It has been recently suggested that wearable camera-assisted methods could reduce measurement error by revealing unreported foods and misreporting errors<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref58" ref-type="bibr"><sup>58</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>. This method may have a smaller measurement error for EI (7&#x000a0;%)<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref59" ref-type="bibr"><sup>59</sup></xref><sup>)</sup> and may increase the accuracy of self-reported EI by 6&#x02013;18&#x000a0;% compared with traditional methods<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref58" ref-type="bibr"><sup>58</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref60" ref-type="bibr"><sup>60</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The causal relationship between sufficient regular PA and numerous aspects of health is beyond doubt, and physical inactivity was recently labelled &#x02018;the biggest public health problem of the 21st century&#x02018;<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref61" ref-type="bibr"><sup>61</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>. Activity promotion interventions have shown limited effectiveness for the general population, with an estimated 45&#x000a0;% dropout rate among individuals who initiate exercise programmes<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>. Our study participants were not sedentary and were meeting minimal recommendations for PA prior to entering the study. Even so, the dropout rate of 23&#x000a0;% in the intervention group is illustrative of the difficulties (lack of time, discipline and/or motivation) in integrating higher PAL into everyday life as this would entail a change in lifestyle that goes against the idea fostered by &#x02018;modern&#x02019; life and its motorised and food-abundant surroundings.</p><p>Evidence from existing randomised controlled trials is relatively consistent with regard to the role of exercise alone in weight loss<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref62" ref-type="bibr"><sup>62</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>. In studies where exercise results in only modest weight loss, the level of exercise prescribed was relatively low and presumably induced an energy deficit smaller than that generally recommended for weight loss by energy restriction<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref63" ref-type="bibr"><sup>63</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref64" ref-type="bibr"><sup>64</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>. The resulting weight loss findings from those studies are therefore consistent with the amount of exercise prescribed<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref65" ref-type="bibr"><sup>65</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>. Limitations in existing studies include poor adherence to the prescribed PA, variability in the amount of exercise prescribed and the limited duration of the exercise interventions<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref62" ref-type="bibr"><sup>62</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>. Few studies have addressed the role of activity in weight-loss maintenance by providing a long-term, sustained activity intervention, and there is a need for well-designed, prospective, randomised trials to assess such regimens.</p><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Limitations and strengths of the study</title><p>The present study should be interpreted in light of its limitations. First, the limited financial and human resources available for this study did not allow us to perform a randomised controlled trial by recruiting the same number of participants for the control and intervention groups. Therefore, the participants were recruited in a non-randomised allocation manner by recruiting the intervention group first, followed by fifteen participants in the control group, for the sake of data comparison and detection of possible significant differences between the groups. Although a non-randomised design could be susceptible to bias, we were careful to recruit the control group with the same participants&#x02019; characteristics as the intervention group, to present information on the study in the same way to both groups and to interpret the results in line with the study's non-randomised design. Second, the resources and equipment available at the relevant time did not allow us to measure REE both at the beginning and at the end of the study. Although the absence of these measures did not allow us to precisely measure possible changes in REE following the intervention period, we would not expect that any such change would substantially influence the overall results given that the amount of LTM was unchanged before <italic>v</italic>. after the intervention period.</p><p>Another limitation of the study lies in the fact that, due to limited financial and human resources, the AEE and dietary intake data of the control group could not be collected during the first week of the intervention period. Collecting these data would have allowed us to perform additional statistical analyses and further tease out the effect of time and/or condition on the outcomes. Additionally, we recruited only men to exclude potential influences related to sex in response to an imposed exercise intervention. Nevertheless, it would be interesting to perform a similar follow-up study on female participants as well, with the intention to examine possible differences in body-weight response to exercise. Finally, our study did not focus on analysing subjective or appetite hormone measures or eating behaviour, which potentially would have further contributed to the interpretation of our findings. Further studies are needed to find the mechanisms responsible for alterations in appetite and eating behaviour with exercise.</p><p>Our free-living design precluded any precise measurement of EI. Our participant-reported EI levels are probably biased by under-reporting, as can be seen from the energy gap at baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3</xref>). Even though we cannot exclude that the extent of under-reporting changed during the following 8 weeks, the invariant EI over the course of the 8 weeks would suggest that the participants simply continued their habitual EI throughout the entire intervention period. We therefore assumed that EI did not change for the duration of the study. Since our control group did not show any changes over time, we are confident that the observations in the intervention group reflect the physiology of increased EE on body composition while <italic>ad libitum</italic> EI remained constant.</p><p>A strength of our study is that we tried to fill a gap in current knowledge related to the effects of an increase in AEE on <italic>ad libitum</italic> EI according to the recommendations of Donnelly <italic>et al.</italic><sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref66" ref-type="bibr"><sup>66</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>, who systematically reviewed all studies published between 1990 and 2013 on this topic. They highlighted a need for adequately powered trials of sufficient duration that prescribe and measure exercise EE across the duration of the study and evaluate and compare the levels of exercise for weight management currently recommended by governmental agencies or professional organisations.</p><p>A novelty of the present study is that it focused not on obese but rather on normal-to-overweight participants. Our results show that the prevailing common-sense view, namely that an increase of AEE is followed by an equivalent increase in EI, does not hold true, even for participants who are, according to the BMI cut-off specifications, categorised as normal-weight to overweight. However, the observed absence of a compensatory effect of EI in response to an exercise-induced energy deficit cannot be presumed to continue indefinitely; otherwise, a considerable loss of body mass would occur. At some stage, a regulatory mechanism must trigger an increase in EI in order to match increased EE. The percentage of body fat, as a trigger point when EI starts balancing the increased exercise-induced EE, merits further investigation.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-2" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results of the present study indicate that in normal-weight and overweight men, increasing PAL from 1&#x000b7;7 to 1&#x000b7;9 during <italic>ad libitum</italic> EI over an 8-week period produces a prolonged negative energy balance. Replication of the study using a more prolonged (and/or greater increase in PAL) is needed to investigate if and at what body composition the increase in AEE is eventually met by an increase in EI.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank Juliane Heydenreich for critically reviewing the manuscript and Samuel Mettler for giving valuable input during data collection.</p><p>The authors&#x02019; responsibilities were as follows: K.
