Azoles for e.g clotrimazole, ketoconazole are quite efficacious in treatment of tinea versicolor. However, only fewer studies are available depicting the efficacy of a newer azole; eberconazole (topical) in tinea versicolor which is found to be effective in other fungal infections (dermatophytoses and candidiasis).</p></boxed-text><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tinea versicolor (TV) or pityriasis versicolor, also known as Peter Elam's disease, is one of the most common infectious skin diseases that is seen in abundance during summer. It is a chronically recurring fungal infection of the stratum corneum characterised by scaly, hypo- or hyper-pigmented, irregular macules usually located on the trunk and proximal extremities.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] It is caused by a fungus, <italic>Malassezia furfur</italic> which is an opportunistic organism, which changes from the saprophytic phase to the pathogenic mycelial phase under certain conditions, such as increased temperature, greasy skin, sweating, and immunosuppression.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>Treatment with topical antifungal therapy has several advantages over systemic management, including fewer side effects, fewer drug interactions, localisation of treatment and lower cost. The azole antifungal compounds which have been used for the treatment of tinea versicolor are clotrimazole, miconazole, econazole, ketoconazole, sulconazole, sertaconazole, etc.</p><p>Terbinafine is an allylamine antifungal which inhibits the enzyme squalene epoxidase in the fungal cell membrane, thereby blocking the biosynthesis of ergosterol and leads to accumulation of squalene which accounts for its fungicidal activity while deficiency of ergosterol is associated with its fungistatic activity. Topical terbinafine is indicated for use in dermatophytoses and TV. Once daily application of topical terbinafine 1% solution, cream or gel, has been effective in TV.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] It efficiently penetrates the stratum corneum and may persist for up to 7 days after application.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Eberconazole, an imidazole derivative is a newer antimycotic agent. It is a broad spectrum antifungal agent used as a topical preparation in the management of cutaneous mycoses. It prevents fungal growth by inhibiting lanosterol 14&#x003b1;-demethylase enzyme that is responsible for the formation of 14&#x003b1;-methylsterols (precursor of ergosterols).[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Eberconazole exerts fungicidal or fungistatic activity depending upon concentration, being fungicidal at higher and fungistatic at lower concentrations.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Topical eberconazole has good local and general tolerability without detectable systemic drug levels.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>A similar study comparing the efficacy and safety of eberconazole versus terbinafine had already been done on patients with tinea corporis and tinea cruris.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] The present study was undertaken to compare the efficacy and safety of eberconazole versus terbinafine in TV.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This was an open-label, randomised, comparative clinical trial conducted on sixty patients. An informed consent was obtained from all patients enrolled for the study.

The eligible patients were randomly divided into two study groups, i.e. Group A (eberconazole 1% cream once daily for 2 weeks) and Group B (terbinafine 1% cream once daily for 2 weeks) with the help of computer-generated random numbers. Each study group had thirty patients who had completed the study as per protocol.</p><p>The inclusion criteria were: Patients of either gender over 18 year of age, patients having lesions on the face, neck and thorax, patients with a clinical diagnosis of TV, confirmed by microscopic KOH test and patients who were ready to give written informed consent. The exclusion criteria were: Pregnant and lactating females, all other types of tinea infections, patients with a history of intolerance or hypersensitivity to the study drugs, patients who had received systemic or topical antifungal treatment within a month, patients who had serious concomitant illness which could prevent the completion of study, patients who had extensive involvement with TV and patients with contact dermatitis, atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, or any other skin disease.</p><p>Efficacy assessment was done by observing signs and symptoms, i.e. pruritus, scaling and erythema on a scale of 0&#x02013;3 (3-severe, 2-moderate, 1-mild, and 0-absent), i.e., physician assessment 4-point scale, microscopic potassium hydroxide (KOH) examination, Wood's lamp examination, global clinical response assessment and patient's assessment on visual analog scale at the end of 1 and 2 weeks and subsequently patients were reassessed at the end of 4 and 8 weeks to check for any relapse. Safety assessment was also done.</p><p>Patients were considered as having clinical cure who were not having any of the three symptoms, i.e., erythema, scaling, and pruritus. Mycological cure was considered for negative KOH.
