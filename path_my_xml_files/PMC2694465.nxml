Exclusion criteria were an ejection fraction below 40%, contraindications to neuraxial blockage, coagulopathy, use of low-weight heparin, warfarin, intrathecal morphine, or a platelet aggregation inhibitor other than aspirin, systemic or local infection, combined procedures, and patients with a specific contraindication to the medication employed in this study. Preoperative aspirin use was not an exclusion criterion. Preoperative surgical risk was evaluated using Higgins Surgical Risk Scale for cardiac surgery, and patients were considered: (1) minimum risk, (2) low risk, (3) moderate, (4) high, (5) extreme risk<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-cln64_4p279">12</xref>. The patients were randomly assigned to receive general anesthesia with prior administration of intrathecal morphine at a dosage of 400 &#x003bc;g (morphine group n=20) or general anesthesia alone (control group n=22) according to a simple computer-generated list.</p><sec><title>Anesthesia and surgical procedures</title><p>On the day of the operation, the patients received 1 to 2 mg kg <sup>&#x02212;1</sup> of midazolam orally 30 minutes before surgery, up to a maximal dose of 15 mg. Patients were monitored by continuous ECG and ST-analysis, pulse oximetry, and an invasive arterial line inserted in the right radial artery. In the morphine group, a 400-&#x003bc;g intrathecal injection of morphine was administered using a 27-gauge spinal needle in the L3-L4 space prior to induction of general anesthesia. If intrathecal puncture was not successful after two attempts, the patient was excluded from the study.</p><p>After pre-oxygenation, general anesthesia was induced using 0.3 mg/kg of hypnomidate, 0.1 mg kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> of pancuroniun bromide, and 0.5 &#x003bc;g kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> of sufentanil first as a bolus, followed by a continuous infusion at 0.5 &#x003bc;g kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> h<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. Mechanical ventilation was initiated using a C&#x000ed;cero ventilator (Dr&#x000e4;ger&#x000ae;, Germany) with a tidal volume of 8 ml kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, respiratory frequency of 12 ipm, oxygen inspired fraction of 0.6%, and 5 cm of H<sub>2</sub>O PEEP. A nasoesophageal thermometer, bladder catheter, and central venous catheter were inserted after anesthesia induction. When judged necessary by the attending anesthesiologist, a pulmonary artery catheter was placed in the right internal jugular vein. Immediately after intubation and after CPB weaning, a lung expansion maneuver using an airway pressure of 30 cmH<sub>2</sub>O for 20 seconds was performed to revert any intraoperative lung collapse. During CPB, hypnosis was maintained with a propofol infusion aimed at maintaining a calculated plasma propofol concentration of 2.5 ug ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> according to the Marsh model<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-cln64_4p279">13</xref>. All patients received 1 g of methylprednisolone intravenously before initiation of CPB according to the institutional protocol. Sufentanil infusion was terminated at the moment of skin suture.</p><p>After arrival in the intensive care unit (ICU), a patient-controlled analgesia pump (PCA) programmed for a 1 mg bolus of morphine with an administration interval locked at 5 minutes and free demand was installed. Dipyrone (30 mg kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) was administered if patients presented persistent pain despite the use of PCA. Tracheal extubation was performed when patients were fully awake and responsive to verbal commands, as well as when the peripheral oximetry was greater than 94%, spontaneous respiratory frequency was greater than 10, temperature was greater than 36&#x000b0; C, and the patient was hemodynamically stable such that they were bleeding less than 100 ml/h.</p></sec><sec><title>Ventilatory and pain score evaluation</title><p>Spirometry using an Easy One&#x000ae; portable spirometer (Niche Medical, West Leederville, Australia) was also performed preoperatively in the first and second postoperative days (POD) to measure forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1), and thus the FEV1/FVC ratio. Arterial blood samples were collected during the preoperative period, immediately before surgery, after anesthesia induction, at the end of surgery, and in the first and second postoperative days to evaluate the PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> ratio. Pain was evaluated using a visual numeric scale from zero to ten at rest, at the time of profound inspiration, and after cough at 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 36 hours postoperatively. Morphine cumulative consumption and solicitation was also evaluated at the same times listed above. All postoperative pain, respiratory function, and morphine utilization measurements were obtained by individuals who were not involved in patient randomization and anesthesia administration.</p><p>Blood samples assessed for plasma morphine concentrations were collected intraoperatively, immediately after stopping sufentanil infusion, after 5, 15, 30, and 60 minutes, and after 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 36 hours in the ICU. The blood samples were centrifuged at 10.000 rpm for 10 minutes, and the supernatant was frozen at &#x02212; 70 &#x000ba;C for later analysis.

Spirometric variables were compared over time between the groups using repeated measures analysis of variance, followed by the Student-Neumann-Keuls post hoc test when necessary.

According to our results, use of low doses of intrathecal morphine can decrease the intensity of postoperative pain at different times, such as at rest, upon profound inspiration, and upon cough. This suggests that not only does intrathecal morphine provide better analgesia at rest, but also during activities that support walking, respiratory maneuvers, and the use of incentive spirometry. This is important to ensure the quality of patient recovery, since it has been demonstrated that respiratory physiotherapy may reduce rates of pulmonary complications.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-cln64_4p279">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-cln64_4p279">25</xref></p><p>Improved analgesia may allow for a decrease in the solicitation and consumption of postoperative analgesics, resulting in lower plasma analgesic levels, as observed in this study.

In patients undergoing hysterectomy with postoperative PCA, an increase in plasma morphine levels resulted in clinical effects 6 to 12 hours after surgery. This lag could be explained by the delay in morphine passing through the hematoencephalic barrier. After this period, a significant reduction in morphine consumption and pain scores was observed, and this can be explained by maintenance of a steady-state level of morphine sufficient to maintain an effective level of analgesia.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-cln64_4p279">27</xref> Mutations in the opioid &#x003bc; receptor were described to support the interindividual variability theory in the population and its possible influences on the use of morphine.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-cln64_4p279">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-cln64_4p279">30</xref></p><p>Although the number of patients in our study was insufficient to fully evaluate the adverse effects of intrathecal morphine, no cases of spinal hematoma or treatable pruritus were observed in the present study.

Thus, our study has direct clinical applications. Future studies are being conducted to study the effects of pain control on quality of life, satisfaction, and postoperative recovery, since no additional benefits of intrathecal morphine beyond pain control have been shown until now.
