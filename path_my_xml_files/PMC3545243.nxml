In Group A (Trial Group) 61 patients were registered and 55 patients completed the treatment. In Group B (Placebo Group) 62 patients were registered and 52 patients completed the treatment.</p><p>On the observation of age wise distribution of 107 patients of <italic>Pandu roga</italic>, 33.64% patients were found to be from both age groups, i.e. between the age group of 1-5 years and between the age group of 5-9 years. The maximum number of patients in this study were from urban (47.67%) and urban slum (37.38%) areas, while the 14.95% belonged to rural areas. In this study, the maximum number of patients were from lower class, that is 43.93%, while 37.38% belonged to lower middle class of society. A maximum number of patients, that is 58.88 % were nonvegetarians, whereas the remaining 41.12% patients were vegetarians. The maximum number of (71.03%) children included in the study were having average/normal body weight and 28.97% children were underweight. The study shows that 56.07% patients were having <italic>Vata-Pitta Prakriti</italic> and 28.97% were of <italic>Pitta-Kapha Prakriti</italic>, whereas 14.96% of patients were having <italic>Vata-Kapha Prakriti Prakriti</italic> implies the type of bodily constitution as per Ayurvedic philosophy. A majority, that is, 78.50% of the patients were having <italic>mandagni</italic> (~ low digestive capacity). The study shows maximum, that is 55.14% patients, were having <italic>madhyam koshtha</italic>, and 23.43% patients displayed <italic>mridu</italic>
<italic>and</italic>
<italic>krura koshtha</italic>. (The term <italic>koshtha</italic> implies the inherent condition of the digestive system. <italic>Mridu koshtha</italic> ~highly sensitive to laxative substances, <italic>Madhya koshtha</italic> ~ moderately sensitive and <italic>krura koshtha</italic> ~ very less sensitivity to laxative substances.)</p><p>After treatment, the trial group showed 89.29% relief in pica, whereas the placebo group perceived 61.54% relief.

Families of poor income group are unable to afford proper diet and due to improper and imbalanced diet, children of those families may get the disease. As per the WHO report iron deficiency is most common among groups of low socioeconomic status.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] The disease <italic>Pandu roga</italic> is equally prevalent in both vegetarians and nonvegetarians. The disease is more prevalent in the children having the <italic>Prakriti</italic> dominant in <italic>Pitta</italic>. As <italic>Pandu roga</italic> is <italic>Pitta</italic> dominant <italic>tridoshaja vikara</italic> (~ disease caused due to anomalous behaviour of all the three doshas) and undernutrition is commonly found in <italic>Vata</italic> dominant persons so probably this might be the reason of majority of patients being of <italic>Vata-Pitta Prakriti</italic> group in the present study. <italic>Mandagni</italic> and <italic>Madhyam koshtha</italic> are observed in maximum patients. Consuming insufficient diet due to <italic>Mandagni</italic> leads to malnutrition, the root cause of disease. According to Ayurveda abnormal function of Agni is the root cause of all diseases. <italic>Madhyam Koshtha</italic> showing dominance of <italic>Kapha</italic> leads to improper digestion, which is the important cause of any disease. <italic>Kapha Dosha</italic> is predominant during childhood period and <italic>kapha dosha</italic> also plays an important role in the pathogenesis of the disease.</p><p>After 10 weeks treatment with the trial drug, highly significant improvement was observed in the clinical features of IDA with P value &#x0003c; 0.001. After 5 and 10 weeks of medication with <italic>Trikatrayadi Lauha</italic> suspension comparatively faster improvements were observed in the clinical features such as pallor, anorexia, weakness, fatigue, irritability, and so on [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>]. Clinical features of <italic>Pandu roga</italic> (~IDA) are mainly due to quantitative and qualitative reduction of Hb and less oxygen supply in the tissues. 1 g% hemoglobin, when fully saturated, combines with 1.34 mL of oxygen, therefore, hemoglobin concentration is an index of oxygen carrying capacity of blood. With the trial drug therapy hemoglobin status improves, body tissues get adequate oxygen, body metabolism improves, and ultimately relief in clinical symptoms is observed.</p><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Showing clinical recovery in patients of IDA treated with trial drug and placebo</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JAIM-3-215-g002"/></table-wrap><p>The present clinical study shows the hematinic potential of <italic>Trikatrayadi Lauha</italic> suspension. It is evident that the treatment of iron deficiency anemia with <italic>Trikatrayadi Lauha</italic> suspension shows statistically significant increase of hematologic values, such as blood Hb%, total RBC, PCV, MCV, MCH, MCHC, and so on. Blood hemoglobin level was improved significantly with a mean increase of 1.94 g/dL in 5 weeks (8.52-10.46 g/dL, P &#x0003c;0.001) and 3.33 g/dL in 10 weeks (8.52-11.85 g/dL, P&#x0003c;0.001) [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. After 10 weeks treatment in the trial group, Hb was increased by 39.10%, whereas in the placebo group Hb was increased by only 3.33%. A significant improvement in serum iron, TIBC and serum ferritin level was obtained. In placebo group improvements in the hematologic values were not satisfactory [Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>.

Children especially those who are underfed and anemic are commonly affected with pica. As per modern pediatric text, iron deficiency is definitely responsible for pica in a large number of children and habit usually abates with iron therapy.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>]</p><p>The trial drug <italic>Trikatrayadi Lauha</italic> suspension was subjected to test for iron. As per analytical study reports the present trial drug contains 1.049 mg elemental iron per milliliter of the suspension. It contains mainly ferric iron and also ferrous iron, but in smaller quantities. Iron oxides, iron sulfide, and iron manganese hydroxide have been found to be present in the trial drug. Normally iron is recommended in the dose of 4-6 mg (elemental iron) per kg of body weight per day in divided doses. In the present clinical study the trial drug <italic>Trikatrayadi Lauha</italic> was administered in the dose of 0.5 mg/kg of body weight per day in two divided doses. Quantity of iron in the administered dose of the trial drug was less with respect to normal recommendation. Absorption of ferrous form of iron is more than ferric iron. But the present trial drug contains more amount of ferric iron than ferrous iron. Ferric iron can be converted in the presence of gastric acid by ferric reductase in the duodenal brush border to ferrous iron.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>]</p><p><italic>Trikatrayadi Lauha</italic> suspension is an Ayurvedic herbomineral drug. The trial drug contains herbal drugs like <italic>Triphala</italic>, which is rejuvenative; <italic>Trikatu</italic>, which is an appetizer; and <italic>Trimada</italic>, which is digestive. Herbal ingredients in the trial drug may increase the bioavailability of <italic>Mandura bhasma and lauha bhasma</italic> which are important contents of the formulation. About 10% of iron in an average Indian diet is normally absorbed.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] More is absorbed during deficiency states. Iron deficient state absorbs about 30% of dietary iron.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] Although amount of iron in the administered dose of <italic>Trikatrayadi Lauha</italic> suspension is less and it contains iron mostly in less favorable ferric form but because of the herbal ingredients the trial drug may be equally effective in the management of iron deficiency anemia. During treatment significant improvement was observed in <italic>Aruchi</italic> (loss of appetite) in children. Appetizing property of the <italic>Trikatrayadi Lauha</italic> suspension might have helped in better tolerance, absorption, and metabolism of iron. The trial drug was in the form of suspension and sweet in taste. So the palatability of the trial drug <italic>Trikatrayadi Lauha</italic> suspension was good in children. No complaint of any uncomfortable feeling was noticed during and after the drug administration. It does not produce gastric disturbances or constipation.</p><p>Effectiveness of <italic>Haritaki</italic>,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] <italic>Mandura Bhasma</italic>,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] and <italic>Lauha Bhasma</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] to increase blood hemoglobin level has been proved scientifically by previous research studies. <italic>Amalaki (Emblica officinalis)</italic> is richest source of Vitamin C, which helps in absorption of iron.

Herbal ingredients present in the trial drug may increase the bioavailability of iron. Hematinic action of <italic>Trikatrayadi Lauha</italic> suspension may be due to the presence of iron contents of good bioavailability. The present clinical study clearly indicates that the herbomineral formulation <italic>Trikatrayadi Lauha</italic> suspension is an effective, well-tolerated, and clinically safe formulation for the management of IDA in children.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Grant for research project by the institute NIA, Jaipur, Rajasthan, India</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Brahmanand</surname><given-names>Tripathi</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Hindi Commentator, Charaka Samhita</article-title><year>1997</year><publisher-loc>Varanasi</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Chaukhambha Surbharati Prakashan</publisher-name></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><article-title>National Family Health Survey for India conducted by
