During the recent decades, despite the significant improvements in supportive interventional procedures for premature newborns and the resulting decrease in mortality, ICH still presents a significantly harmful risk for these newborns.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>A number of mechanisms cause germinal matrix-intraventricular hemorrhage (GM-IVH), including susceptibility of GM structure to damage, coagulopathy and platelet dysfunctions, genetic factors, cytokines, and finally hemodynamic factors. Hemodynamic factors are influenced by two interventional systems of intrinsic and extrinsic indicators.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>The fluctuations in cerebral blood flow (CBF), which are caused by the increase in the pressure of cerebral venous drainage during respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), positive pressure ventilation (PPV), out-of-synchrony in PPV, and pneumothorax, are major ground stones for the development of GM-IVH.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>RDS is among the most exclusively challenging conditions for Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICUs) and hence needs special management. The most prevalent pathology affecting the newborns &#x0003c;32 weeks of gestational age is RDS. In this regard, a significant portion of the long-term morbidity and mortality cases is ascribed to RDS and its outcomes.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>So far, nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) has been considered as the standard care for the management of RDS for more than four decades. nCPAP improves the oxygenation in the newborns involved in the process of RDS through recruitment of pulmonary volumes, prevention of atelectasis, stabilizing the rib cage, alternation of pulmonary compliance, and decreasing the work of breathing. nCPAP decreases the intrapulmonary shunt by enhancing the efficiency of the ventilation to perfusion ratio. Studies have revealed that even in newborns who suffer frequent central apnea, the gas pressure nCPAP imposes on the upper parts of the respiratory system that can prevent the mentioned pauses in respiration through its stimulating effect. Needless to say, nCPAP shows a promising mechanism in maintaining open airways in obstructive apnea.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Nasal intermittent PPV (NIPPV) was first developed for the primary application of apnea of prematurity control. It has been a while since NIPPV has been introduced as primary mode (when NIPPV is administered for a newborn with RDS, equal or &#x0003c;2 h after birth, either with or without surfactant administration) in NICUs; however, taking this approach to treat RDS has revealed a high level of diversity; as in the U. K., its difference in application ranges from 48% in England to 61% in Ireland.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>Although it is always stressed that the brain's autoregulatory mechanism (though not developed) accompanied by an average systematic blood pressure (BP) above 30 mmHg is enough to maintain the cerebral blood perfusion, Evans <italic>et al</italic>. showed that other factors, such as intrathoracic pressure level, can affect the intracranial blood flow, and interventions involving respiratory support are among those which are markedly accompanied by significant changes in intrathoracic pressure.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>The improvement in our capability to evaluate the changes in cerebral oxygenation levels and the interventional mechanisms affecting the CBF had led to a development of our understanding of these fluctuations and their potential harm to the developing brain tissue. Premature newborns are in danger of developmental delays in &#x0201c;CBF autoregulatory system,&#x0201d; and this, in turn, increases the risk of facing unusual perfusion flows (and hence facing unusual levels of oxygenation) during hemodynamic instabilities. So far, very few technologies have been implemented for monitoring CBF in endangered newborns. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), due to the low thickening of scalp and calvarium in newborns, especially premature newborns, has the capability to monitor oxygenation levels in microscopic vascularity in fact the system monitors the hemoglobin chromophore levels which absorb the wavelength of 700&#x02013;1000 nm as the basis for its monitoring and also calculates the oxyhemoglobin saturation (StO<sub>2</sub>) through differentiating the oxygenated hemoglobin (O<sub>2</sub> Hb) from deoxygenated hemoglobin (HHb) using the following formula:</p><p>StO<sub>2</sub> = O<sub>2</sub> Hb + HHb, and tHb = total Hb</p><p>As a result, the operator can relate continuous changes to the changes in tissue hemoglobin concentration (or the blood volume in the tissue, resulting from tissue perfusion and CBF) and interpret its outcome records.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>Due to the concerns regarding the adverse effects related to out-of-synchrony performance in the application of NIPPV, this study tried to challenge this type of respiratory support versus nCPAP through studying the brain tissue oxygenation in newborns that are frequently altered between these two forms of respiratory support.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study design and participants</title><p>This study is a randomized clinical trial (RCT)-crossover done on very low-weight newborns who were under nCPAP respiratory support in the NICU Department of Isfahan Shahid Beheshti Hospital from October 2015 to May 2016.

The newborns had a gestational range of 28&#x02013;32 weeks, and in case, they had experienced Downes score of equal or higher than 4 in the first 6 h from birth, and they would be randomly assigned to two interventional groups of nCPAP and NIPPV. Around 39 newborns were placed in nCPAP group, and the maximum setup was considered with CDP = 7 cmH<sub>2</sub>O and FiO<sub>2</sub> &#x02264;70%.

Moreover, by activating the NIPPV mode, the newborns&#x02019; O<sub>2</sub> saturation levels also decreased significantly. The study done by Bhandari <italic>et al</italic>. revealed that PVL prevalence was significantly lower among newborns in the nCPAP group than those in the NIPPV group. It seems that the results of the current study provide grounds for the outcomes of the study done by Bhandari, as at least part of the background for PVL, more specifically brain tissue ischemia, can be attributed to lower levels of CrSO<sub>2</sub> during NIPPV treatment. Respiratory rate has also been significantly higher in the NIPPV group. The question is whether the decrease in brain tissue oxygen content is due to the decrease in O<sub>2</sub> saturation or the instability in brain tissue perfusion, as the increase in respiratory rate or the increase in CO<sub>2</sub> pressure in blood flow, with their relevant mechanisms of increasing asynchrony and inducing out-of-control pressures in thorax (regarding the increase in respiratory rate), as well as increasing brain tissue perfusion (regarding the increase in PCO<sub>2</sub>), may result in fluctuations or CBF. Therefore, it seems necessary to perform a wider range of research (in terms of the magnitude of the samples and the focus on long-term outcomes) before one could consider applying two different pressure levels in an out-of-synchrony fashion in respiratory management of newborns involved in RDS.</p><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>This study was funded by
