However, it is possible that nonsurgical treatment could resolve symptomatic FAI in some patients; thus, uncertainty about the necessity of surgical treatment exists. The current equipoise concerning FAI treatment presents an opportunity to conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of surgical and nonsurgical treatment options. Given the unique challenge of adequate patient enrollment in RCTs, it is important that a preliminary study is done to appraise the feasibility of conducting an RCT.</p></sec><sec><title>Purpose:</title><p>To estimate enrollment rates of a planned future RCT to compare surgical and nonsurgical treatments for symptomatic FAI and to identify factors associated with patients&#x02019; willingness to participate in the randomized trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Study Design:</title><p>Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 4.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Patients diagnosed with FAI at 2 orthopaedic centers were presented with a hypothetical randomized trial comparing 2 treatment options for FAI. All patients completed forms providing information regarding their willingness to participate and treatment preferences.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 75 patients participated in the study: 53 and 22 from 2 centers, respectively. Twenty-eight percent indicated absolute willingness to participate in the trial, 40% were probably willing or unsure, and 32% were definitely not willing; 18.7% had a strong preference for surgery while 2.7% strongly preferred nonsurgical treatment. The majority (78.6%) had no strong preference for either treatment arm. There were correlations between treatment preferences and willingness to participate. Patients with a strong treatment preference and/or a preference for surgery were less likely to be willing to participate.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion:</title><p>The study findings suggest that sufficient patient accrual for a randomized trial of FAI treatment is currently feasible while equipoise still exists among patients and surgeons.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>femoroacetabular impingement (FAI)</kwd><kwd>randomized clinical trial</kwd><kwd>feasibility study</kwd><kwd>surgical treatment</kwd><kwd>nonsurgical treatment</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>edited-state</meta-name><meta-value>corrected-proof</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) is a pathologic mechanical condition of increasing interest because of its high prevalence and role in the development of osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-2325967115592844" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> It is characterized by a femoral head-neck deformity (cam) that leads to eccentric loading within the joint or an acetabular overcoverage deformity (pincer) that leads to restriction of hip motion, or a combination of the 2 (mixed) deformities. A cross-sectional study done by Reichenbach et al<sup><xref rid="bibr10-2325967115592844" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> indicated that approximately 25% of young male adults have the FAI deformity. Several epidemiologic studies also point to the importance of this deformity in the development of hip OA.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-2325967115592844" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bibr5-2325967115592844" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bibr9-2325967115592844" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> It is therefore apparent that investment in advancing treatment options for FAI will not only relieve symptoms but also potentially decrease the progression of hip OA.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-2325967115592844" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>
</p><p>Femoroacetabular impingement represents a varied spectrum of disease patterns among a diverse patient population requiring a range of evolving treatment strategies.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-2325967115592844" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Because of the complexity of the FAI deformity, there exists much variability in treatment options. Increasing evidence suggests the efficacy of surgical procedures in correcting the deformity and relieving symptoms. Nonetheless, lower level evidence studies form the main source of this evidence. Cohort studies have also suggested that nonsurgical treatment can relieve symptomatic FAI.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-2325967115592844" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bibr8-2325967115592844" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> At this time, surgeon equipoise persists, and payers remain doubtful of the effectiveness of surgery,<sup><xref rid="bibr2-2325967115592844" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> providing us the opportunity and the need to perform randomized controlled trials.</p><p>The hierarchy of clinical research is established,<sup><xref rid="bibr7-2325967115592844" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are considered the highest level of evidence. However, RCTs comparing surgical and nonsurgical treatments can present particular obstacles relative to the study design and feasibility. One major disadvantage is the potential for low patient enrollment, which should be thoroughly considered while planning an RCT.</p><p>An RCT feasibility analysis was conducted by Creel et al<sup><xref rid="bibr3-2325967115592844" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> prior to their undertaking of the Meniscal Tear in Osteoarthritis Research (MeTeOR) trial. They utilized a method proposed by Halpern<sup><xref rid="bibr6-2325967115592844" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> called <italic>prospective preference assessment</italic>, which helps mimic recruitment and predict enrollment rates. We also undertook this assessment by presenting a hypothetical randomized trial of arthroscopic and nonsurgical therapy for managing FAI. The primary purpose of our feasibility study was to estimate the proportion of FAI patients who would be willing to enroll in the trial. Other aims were to determine the appropriate set of enrollment criteria defining the type of FAI deformity to be represented in the cohort for the forthcoming RCT and identify factors associated with willingness to participate. This analysis will enable us to effect needed modifications in trial design and recruitment strategy.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="section1-2325967115592844"><title>Methods</title><p>On receiving institutional review board approval, patients were recruited from 2 large academic referral centers: one primarily an adult (center A) and the other a primarily pediatric care center (center B). Each center took a different approach in creating a cohort of subjects for the feasibility study. Center A enrolled all patients who had been diagnosed with FAI deformity. Center B had additional eligibility criteria for recruitment to participate in the study: a minimum modified Dunn lateral view alpha angle of 60&#x000b0; as evidence of cam-type impingement, &#x02264;15&#x000b0; of hip internal rotation in 90&#x000b0; of flexion, a pain score of at least 5 of 20 on the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) 5-item pain scale, and at least 3 months of symptoms secondary to FAI. All subjects recruited from both centers were 18 years or older. Those with a history of hip surgery, inflammatory arthritis, skeletal dysplasia, or neuromuscular disorders were not included in the study.</p><p>A research coordinator approached eligible patients at clinic visits either before or after consultation with the surgeon to introduce the concept of the feasibility study and administer the study survey. We used a standardized script that explained the design of a hypothetical randomized trial comparing 2 treatment options for FAI: surgical (arthroscopy) and nonsurgical (management with physical therapy and anti-inflammatories). The script also mentioned that while FAI is usually treated by surgery, nonoperative treatment was also a possibility that lacked significant investigation. A flowchart helped the patient follow the randomization process.</p><p>After establishing patients&#x02019; understandings of both the feasibility and hypothetical studies, we invited them to complete the survey form. This form queried patients&#x02019; willingness to participate in a randomized trial, treatment preferences, and factors influencing their choices. We used a 5-point scale to categorize willingness to participate: definitely, probably, unsure, probably not, and definitely not. Patients were then asked to indicate as many factors out of 9 options that influenced their decision about participating (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-2325967115592844">Table 1</xref>). Treatment preference was categorized into the following: definitely nonsurgical, probably nonsurgical, unsure/no preference, probably surgery, and definitely surgery. Again, we gave opportunity to select reasons for their preference (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-2325967115592844">Table 1</xref>). Demographic data were collected, and WOMAC pain scores were documented from questionnaires they completed as part of standard procedure for their clinical care.</p><table-wrap id="table1-2325967115592844" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>TABLE 1</label><caption><p>Possible Influential Factors Presented to Patients in Survey</p></caption><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_2325967115592844-table1"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Factors Influencing Willingness to Participate</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Factors Influencing Treatment Preference</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">

We evaluated the association of age, sex, education, race, employment, and pain with willingness to participate. The continuous factors, age and WOMAC pain score, were compared across the categorical variables using 1-way analysis of variance and independent <italic>t</italic> tests as appropriate.

Other notable factors were functional ability (45%) and ineffectiveness of prior nonsurgical management (24%).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="section6-2325967115592844"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our 2-center study was designed to allow us to estimate enrollment rates for a future randomized controlled trial of arthroscopic treatment versus nonsurgical management of FAI and also identify the group of FAI patients with whom the trial would be feasible. One center recruited patients to create a cohort representative of the heterogeneity of FAI deformities while the other took a more selective method forming a group in which one form of FAI morphology was predominant. The main advantage of the former approach is a higher proportion of eligible patients, as evidenced in our results whereas the latter allows for a more focused research study. These 2 factors must be weighed carefully when designing an RCT with regard to the feasibility of enrolling a sufficient number of subjects versus a more defined cohort perhaps producing a more consistent result. Our study provides the range of subjects that must be screened for both approaches to designing the inclusion criteria.</p><p>Our different enrollment criteria introduced some limitations to our feasibility study. The pediatric center&#x02019;s recruiting strategy resulted in the exclusion of 24% of eligible patients because they were younger than 18 years. However, since FAI is increasingly diagnosed in adolescents, extending the age range to include skeletally mature patients younger than 18 years may increase enrollment numbers. The stricter eligibility criteria used at the pediatric center also excluded many patients from participating in the study on the basis of the type of FAI deformity, thereby making it difficult to ascertain the enrollment potential from that center if the criteria were altered to expand the pool of eligible patients.</p><p>Another limitation of our feasibility study design was that it precluded the analysis of the effect of each center&#x02019;s research history and environment on willingness to participate. It is possible that varying levels of patient experience with clinical research or staff experience in recruitment at different centers is associated with patients&#x02019; willingness to participate in the RCT. Our results showed a higher proportion of patients from the pediatric center (center B) not willing to participate in the future trial. This may be attributed to differences in how each center presented the research plan to patients, or it may just be due to regional variations in patient populations we did not account for (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2325967115592844">Figure 1</xref>). All the same, a multicenter study design will ensure that one center&#x02019;s shortage of willing study participants is offset by a significant number of participating patients from other centers.</p><p>Our findings suggest that enrollment for our planned randomized trial may benefit if more relaxed inclusion criteria were used. We conducted a subanalysis to evaluate the potential effect of relaxing the eligibility criterion of minimum alpha angle from 60&#x000b0; to 55&#x000b0;. This included 21 more participants from the adult care center, and there was a slight increase from 18% to 25.4% in the proportion of subjects definitely willing to participate. A previous prospective assessment study on willingness to participate in a comparable randomized trial for the treatment of meniscal tears found a similar proportion of 22% of potential subjects who were definitely willing to participate in the trial.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-2325967115592844" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> The prospective assessment predicted quite accurately the 26% of eligible patients who participated in the actual randomized trial.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-2325967115592844" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>
</p><p>Analysis of the association of stated willingness to participate and treatment preferences in the adult care center group revealed a significant relationship consistent with findings from other studies.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-2325967115592844" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> A majority of the patients with stronger treatment preferences, as well as those with preference for surgery, were less willing to participate in the randomized trial (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-2325967115592844">Table 3</xref>). As expected, patients who favor one treatment arm highly over another will likely find the randomization process disturbing because they could be given the less-wanted treatment. Nevertheless, our data suggest that patients with definite treatment preferences are in the minority (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-2325967115592844">Tables 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-2325967115592844">5</xref>). With respect to surgical treatment, it is not surprising that more of those with preference for this were less willing to be in a randomized study. We found that most of the patients had already tried conservative treatment methods and felt they were ineffective. In another feasibility study of an RCT for FAI treatment done in the United Kingdom, it was found that although more patients were troubled about their risk of developing OA than their current symptoms, patients were not willing to continue with nonsurgical management for more than 6 months if their symptoms had not improved.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-2325967115592844" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> This demonstrates how crucial patients&#x02019; equipoise is in enrolling for a trial comparing 2 treatment arms. A balanced perception of the risks and benefits of both treatment methods may not only enhance enrollment rates but also minimize the incidence of cross-overs and dropouts.</p><p>It is also possible that greater understanding of treatment specifics could lead to less willingness to participate in the randomized trial. Given the recent growing interest in the etiology, treatment, and treatment outcomes of FAI deformities, there is an expanding base of knowledge available to patients and surgeons alike. A person may learn of the advantages or pitfalls of one treatment approach as compared with others, leading to consolidation of a treatment preference. This trend will have an effect on the implementation of high&#x02013;evidence level studies on FAI treatment outcomes. It is therefore important that an RCT is undertaken now while it is feasible.</p><p>The findings of this study show that participant accrual for a randomized trial comparing treatments for FAI is currently achievable. Waiting on this may be detrimental to the successful implementation of the trial, as treatment preferences seem to influence willingness to participate in the trial. Our findings, with respect to inclusion criteria and regional variations in patient populations, will influence the design of a planned randomized trial to maximize enrollment.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1-2325967115592844" fn-type="conflict"><p>The authors declared that they have no conflicts of interest in the authorship and publication of this contribution.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bibr1-2325967115592844"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
