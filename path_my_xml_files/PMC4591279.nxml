One such intervention may include population-based deworming, recommended as of 12 months of age by the World Health Organization in soil-transmitted helminth (STH)-endemic areas; however, the benefit of deworming has been understudied in early preschool-age children.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted to determine the effect of deworming (500 mg single-dose crushed mebendazole tablet) on growth in one-year-old children in Iquitos, Peru. Children were enrolled during their routine 12-month growth and development clinic visit and followed up at their 18 and 24-month visits. Children were randomly allocated to: Group 1: deworming at 12 months and placebo at 18 months; Group 2: placebo at 12 months and deworming at 18 months; Group 3: deworming at both 12 and 18 months; or Group 4: placebo at both 12 and 18 months (i.e. control group). The primary outcome was weight gain at the 24-month visit. An intention-to-treat approach was used. A total of 1760 children were enrolled between September 2011 and June 2012. Follow-up of 1563 children (88.8%) was completed by July 2013. STH infection was of low prevalence and predominantly light intensity in the study population. All groups gained between 1.93 and 2.05 kg on average over 12 months; the average difference in weight gain (kg) compared to placebo was: 0.05 (95% CI: -0.05, 0.17) in Group 1; -0.07 (95%CI: -0.17, 0.04) in Group 2; and 0.04 (95%CI: -0.06, 0.14) in Group 3.

It is considered to be one of the most common Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTD), affecting an estimated 1.45 billion people worldwide [<xref rid="pntd.0004020.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. STHs are transmitted in contaminated food, water and the environment in areas of poverty in low- and middle-income countries. These intestinal parasites have a direct and indirect adverse impact on nutritional status by disrupting normal nutrient intake, excretion and utilization in their hosts and by causing blood loss and loss of appetite [<xref rid="pntd.0004020.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004020.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>WHO recommends large-scale preventive chemotherapy programs, using anthelminthic treatment (i.e. deworming), for the high-risk groups of women of reproductive age, especially pregnant women, school-age children (i.e. 5 to 14 years of age), and preschool-age children (i.e. 1 to 4 years of age) in STH-endemic areas [<xref rid="pntd.0004020.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004020.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Adverse effects from deworming are infrequent, and when reported, are mild and transitory, including gastrointestinal upset and diarrhea [<xref rid="pntd.0004020.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Deworming interventions are often school-based in order to reach school-age children. In preschool-age children, deworming is often piggybacked onto vaccination or supplementation programs, child health days, or programs for the elimination of lymphatic filariasis [<xref rid="pntd.0004020.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, preschool-age children lag behind their school-age counterparts as scaling-up of school-based programs continues while that of preschool programs remains a challenge [<xref rid="pntd.0004020.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The global proportion of at-risk preschool-age children receiving deworming in 2012 was estimated to be on the order of 25% [<xref rid="pntd.0004020.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. This coverage has decreased since previous reports [<xref rid="pntd.0004020.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Prior to 2002, children under two years of age had been excluded from deworming interventions as the burden of STH infection was perceived to be low in this age group and the safety profile of available anthelminthics was not well established. In 2002, WHO convened an informal consultation of experts, and subsequently recommended the inclusion of children between 12 and 24 months of age in deworming activities using single-dose albendazole (in a reduced dose of 200 mg) or mebendazole (in the usual dose of 500 mg) [<xref rid="pntd.0004020.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. These recommendations were based on animal studies, toxicity data and other safety data [<xref rid="pntd.0004020.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Despite the WHO recommendations and increasing evidence of the occurrence of STH infection in early preschool-age children [<xref rid="pntd.0004020.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0004020.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], many countries still exclude children under 24 months of age from their national deworming programs. Providing evidence on the potential benefits of deworming in the younger age group between one and two years of age is essential. A study reviewing data from 54 countries confirmed that preventive interventions must occur during the first two years of life to prevent growth deficits, such as stunting and underweight [<xref rid="pntd.0004020.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Interventions at this time are essential to prevent both short- and longer-term adverse health effects [<xref rid="pntd.0004020.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The evidence-base on including deworming as one of the essential early childhood interventions in this critical window is, however, limited. Randomized controlled trials conducted exclusively in school-age children or in both preschool-age and school-age children have provided mixed evidence on deworming benefits on growth and development [<xref rid="pntd.0004020.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004020.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004020.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Few studies have focused exclusively on the preschool-age population [<xref rid="pntd.0004020.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004020.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0004020.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. There is some evidence that adverse consequences of even low prevalence and intensity STH infection may be more pronounced in children during this critical time period [<xref rid="pntd.0004020.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Considering the unique nutritional demands and growth patterns of younger children, aggregated results from older children do not provide a clear indication of the potential benefit of deworming on growth and nutrition in younger age groups. To fill this research gap, we therefore conducted a randomized controlled trial on the effect, and optimal timing and frequency, of a deworming intervention incorporated into routine child health services at one year of age. Our objective was to determine whether deworming would improve growth by two years of age.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Ethics approval and trial monitoring</title><p>This study received ethics approval in Peru from the Comit&#x000e9; Institucional de &#x000c9;tica of the Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia and the Instituto Nacional de Salud, in Lima, and the local Ministry of Health office (Direcci&#x000f3;n Regional de Salud (DIRESA) Loreto) in Iquitos (<xref rid="pntd.0004020.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Text</xref>).

Details on baseline enrolment methodology and the study population have been described elsewhere [<xref rid="pntd.0004020.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Briefly, children were enrolled into the trial in their homes or participating health centres. Inclusion criteria were: 1) children attending any one of the 12 participating health centres for their 12-month CRED visit; and 2) children living in Bel&#x000e9;n, Iquitos, Punchana or San Juan districts. Exclusion criteria were: 1) children attending the health centre for suspected STH infection; 2) children who had received deworming treatment in the six months prior to the trial; 3) children whose families planned to move outside of the study area within the next 12 months; 4) children under 12 months of age or 14 months of age or older; and 5) children with any serious congenital or chronic medical condition. Any child who was excluded for medical reasons, and who was not already receiving regular health care, was referred to the health centre for follow-up by appropriate health personnel.</p><p>A baseline socio-demographic and epidemiological questionnaire (including family and child health and nutrition information) was administered in the home or health centre to the primary caregiver of the child.

Tablets were crushed and mixed with juice for ease of administration and safety [<xref rid="pntd.0004020.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].

From previous research in the study area, STH prevalence was expected to be 25% at 12 months of age [<xref rid="pntd.0004020.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. To estimate expected growth, longitudinal growth data was collected from health centre registries in the study area in 2011. Mean weight gain &#x000b1; standard deviation between 12 and 24 months in 100 untreated children was calculated to be 2.0 kg &#x000b1; 0.8 kg.

The random allocation sequence was generated by a biostatistician who was not otherwise involved in the trial. Research personnel not directly involved in the trial prepared small envelopes containing the randomly assigned intervention for each visit.

Envelopes were stored in a temperature-regulated pharmacy at the research facility, and distributed by the Project Director (SAJ) or the local Study Coordinator (LP) in sequential order to research assistants until the sample size was achieved. Appropriate allocation concealment and randomly ordered block sizes ensured that the randomization sequence would not be predictable [<xref rid="pntd.0004020.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. All health centre and research personnel, and parents of participants were blinded to intervention status.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Follow-up visits</title><p>Children were followed-up at their 18 and 24-month visit in the health centre, at which time all outcome ascertainments were repeated. At the 18-month visit the second randomly assigned intervention was administered. Each visit was scheduled six months after the previous visit. In the case that a participant did not attend their 18-month visit, children remained eligible for the 24-month visit, which was scheduled 12 months after initial enrolment. If participants were not located prior to the day of their anticipated follow-up visit, or a scheduled date was missed, a minimum of four additional attempts were made to locate them. The original end dates of the 18-month follow-up and 24-month follow-up (i.e. trial completion) were each extended by one month (i.e. seven months and 13 months after the end of enrolment, respectively) to maximize follow-up rates.

Pre-specified secondary outcome measures were weight-for-age z-score, length gain, length-for-age z-score, change in STH infection prevalence and intensity, and change in development (i.e. cognitive, language and fine motor skills) between the 12 and 24-month visit. The development outcomes are reported separately.</p><p>Prior to commencing recruitment, in-depth practical training of the research assistants took place according to WHO guidelines [<xref rid="pntd.0004020.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004020.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] to ensure accurate outcome assessment and standardization.

Length (i.e. the recommended measurement of height in children less than two years of age) was measured in duplicate as recumbent crown-heel length on a flat surface using a stadiometer (Seca 210, Seca Corp., Baltimore, MD, USA), accurate to the nearest millimetre. One stool specimen per child was collected to assess STH (e.g. <italic>Ascaris</italic>, <italic>Trichuris</italic> and hookworm) infection prevalence and intensity.

Secondary analyses which were specified <italic>a priori</italic> were conducted to examine differences between intervention groups in terms of change in derived weight indices (i.e. mean WAZ change) and length and derived length indices (mean length gain and mean LAZ change). Multivariable linear regression was also conducted adjusting for age, sex, socioeconomic status (based on an asset-based proxy index) [<xref rid="pntd.0004020.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004020.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and continued breastfeeding at 12 months of age.</p><p>All analyses were first expressed using an intention-to-treat (ITT) approach such that participants were analyzed according to their assigned intervention group. Multiple imputation, using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) model with five imputations, was used for those who did not attend the 24-month follow-up visit. Variables related to the outcome, and hypothesized to be related to missing the follow-up visit(s) were used to impute missing weight and length measurements. These variables were baseline weight, length, socioeconomic status, continued breastfeeding at 12 months, sex, and age. Imputation was done separately by randomly assigned treatment group. Additional analyses were specified <italic>a posteriori</italic>, including: 1) using a complete case approach on all participants who had attended the final follow-up visit, 2) using a per-protocol approach excluding those participants who did not attend all three visits and/or who reported having received deworming outside of the trial between baseline and the final follow-up visit and 3) restricted to children positive for STH infection at baseline. These analyses were conducted for the following reasons: 1) complete case analyses were conducted for comparison purposes with intention-to-treat analyses with imputed data; 2) per-protocol analyses were conducted to account for higher than anticipated non-compliance to the assigned intervention; and 3) subgroup analysis in STH-infected children were conducted to account for the lower than anticipated baseline STH infection prevalence.</p><p>The primary research question on the effect of deworming was determined by comparing growth outcomes between each intervention group and the control group. To explore the secondary research question on the effect of the timing of deworming (i.e. at the 12-month visit or at the 18-month visit), growth outcomes in Group 1 were compared to Group 2.

At the 18-month visit, any STH prevalence was 28.5% (i.e. 30.7% in PBO/MBD and 26.4% in MBD/MBD). As expected due to lower sensitivity, STH prevalence in children whose stool specimens were analyzed by the direct method at 12 and 18 months was moderately lower (i.e. 10.5% and 24.5%, respectively). Certain sensitivity analyses were therefore conducted in subgroups of children found to be STH-positive 1) by both the direct and Kato-Katz methods and 2) only by the Kato-Katz method. Despite potential misclassification of STH infection status in children whose specimens were analyzed by the direct method, this strategy allowed for maximum comparison among all groups.

This is the age at which WHO first recommends starting mass deworming programs, and it is also a time of rapid growth, development and STH acquisition. Our trial had several strengths. These include: 1) its randomized controlled design, which minimized confounding and the influence of external factors; 2) a large sample size, so that primary analyses were sufficiently powered; 3) a high follow-up rate, despite a highly mobile population and environmental challenges such as flooding which displaced many participants in the study area; 4) consistency of results in intention-to-treat, complete case and per-protocol analyses, demonstrating that results from children attending the final study visit are likely generalizable to the original trial population; and 5) community-based canvassing in the study area prior to recruitment to attempt to reach the entire study population [<xref rid="pntd.0004020.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><sec id="sec024"><title>Overall effect of deworming</title><p>We were not able to demonstrate an overall benefit on the primary research question of deworming on growth between any of the intervention groups compared to the control group after one year of follow-up in intention-to-treat analysis or in further sensitivity analyses. Our results are consistent with a recent cluster-randomized trial of albendazole (administered every six months to children from six months to six years of age) conducted in north India where light intensity STH infection was also predominant [<xref rid="pntd.0004020.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. It is also consistent with a study in Uganda in children aged 15 months to 5 years who received quarterly albendazole [<xref rid="pntd.0004020.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Our findings do, however, contradict other trials in preschool-age children that found a positive effect of deworming on growth indicators [<xref rid="pntd.0004020.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004020.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>The lack of benefit in our study compared to these other studies could reflect a true lack of effect of deworming on growth in the time period and/or study population. This population of children has a high level of malnutrition that may not be able to be treated solely by one or two doses of deworming in a one-year time period. In addition, we were not able to demonstrate a statistically significant reduction in any STH or species-specific prevalence with any of the deworming interventions, except for a reduction in <italic>Trichuris</italic> infection with twice-yearly deworming. The poor effect of the deworming intervention on STH prevalence measured after 6 and 12 months was almost certainly influenced by the dynamics of re-infection and new infection occurring between study time points. Future studies, which are adequately powered to detect changes in STH infection over time, are needed to confirm these findings.</p><p>If there were, however, a true effect that was not observed, the short follow-up time may have limited the potential to detect this benefit. It is likely that, in the one year period of our study, a steady state has not yet been achieved, in terms of either STH infection (e.g. as evidenced by the over threefold increase in STH prevalence from 12 to 24 months of age) or growth (e.g. as evidenced by a negative deviation of WAZ and LAZ compared to the international WHO growth standard over 12 months). Benefits of the deworming intervention may be apparent only with a longer follow-up time.</p><p>The low prevalence and intensity of infection, in particular, may have limited the impact of deworming, which reduces morbidity primarily through a reduction in moderate and heavy intensity infection. In deworming interventions, nutritional improvements are not a direct consequence of drug administration but a result of the elimination of parasites that are competing for nutrients. When the intervention is administered to a population with low prevalence and/or intensity, the short-term benefits could be difficult to measure. WHO recommends the periodic (once or twice-yearly) administration of antihelminthics as a means of controlling morbidity from STH infection. The nutritional benefits are a consequence of the maintenance of very a low level of these infections in childhood.</p><p>The baseline prevalence of STH infection in the study population was lower than had been anticipated based on a study conducted in the area just three to four years prior (i.e. in 2007 and 2008) [<xref rid="pntd.0004020.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The number of children who could have potentially benefited from deworming in the trial was therefore reduced, resulting in a reduction in power to detect an effect of the expected size. Results from a previous trial suggested that deworming could improve growth in young children, even with low intensity infection [<xref rid="pntd.0004020.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]; however, we did not observe this in our trial. Preventive chemotherapy programs include treatment of both infected and uninfected children; nonetheless, our results suggest that research studies should be conducted in areas of high STH prevalence to ensure as little effect dilution as possible. With increasing implementation of deworming programs, a rapid assessment in the age group and study area to determine baseline prevalence and intensity may be warranted before beginning any research study.</p></sec><sec id="sec025"><title>Effect of deworming timing and frequency</title><p>Our trial was unique in using a multiple group design to look additionally at the secondary research questions of differences in the timing and frequency among the groups that received deworming. Such considerations are important in operationalizing deworming interventions in this age group. Our results suggest that, if deworming is provided between one and two years of age, there is a significant benefit of providing it earlier rather than later. Our results also demonstrate that there was no added benefit from an additional dose provided at 18 months of age (over and above that at 12 months of age). These results were consistent in unadjusted and adjusted analysis, as well as in sensitivity analyses, for multiple growth indicators. A true benefit of earlier deworming compared to later deworming is biologically plausible, as suggested in nutritional research showing the importance of incorporating interventions as early as possible to prevent adverse health and nutritional consequences [<xref rid="pntd.0004020.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, in light of the lack of benefit of any of the deworming interventions compared to the control group and the low STH prevalence and intensity at baseline, these results should be interpreted with caution. The difference in growth between Groups 1 and 2 may be due to a shorter follow-up from the time of intervention to the time of outcome measurement (i.e. 12 months in Group 1 vs. 6 months in Group 2), or a chance finding of lower average weight gain in Group 2 compared to all three other groups. Although the number of statistically significant findings was more than due to chance alone, and all comparisons, except for sensitivity analyses (i.e. complete case, per-protocol, and subgroup analyses in STH-infected individuals), were specified <italic>a priori</italic>, we cannot rule out the possibility that this difference could be a spurious finding due to chance alone.</p></sec><sec id="sec026"><title>Compliance</title><p>One issue that arose after beginning the study was difficulty with compliance, as over 25% of children received deworming at least once outside of the assigned intervention group. A higher proportion of children in the control group had been reported to have received deworming outside of the trial, but this proportion was not statistically significantly different from the other groups. Even after taking non-compliance into account by conducting a per-protocol analysis, excluding those who took deworming outside of the trial and/or who did not attend all three study visits, no statistically significant difference in growth outcomes was observed. The ease of access to deworming was an unexpected result as deworming is not routinely provided to children under two years of age in the study area; however, this level of access to deworming outside of the study protocol has been observed in other trials in preschool-age children [<xref rid="pntd.0004020.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. With the growing presence of deworming campaigns and availability of antihelminthics without a prescription in many countries, this finding of non-compliance will likely become increasingly common. Although for ethical and logistical purposes we could not restrict access to antihelminthics outside of the trial, it is imperative that compliance is measured in all deworming research studies and taken into account in the analysis of results.</p></sec><sec id="sec027"><title>Stool specimen analysis</title><p>For ethical and scientific reasons, we did not immediately analyze stool specimens from children randomized to placebo at the 12 or 18-month visits. This meant that accurate STH prevalence and intensity were not available for those receiving placebo (i.e. Group 2 (PBO/PBO) and Group 3 (MBD/MBD) at 12 months, and Group 1 (MBD/PBO) and Group 3 (MBD/MBD) at 18 months), and that results from the Kato-Katz and direct methods were not easily comparable (<xref rid="pntd.0004020.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Examining a single stool specimen with a single technique (i.e. Kato-Katz) may have also decreased the sensitivity to detect STH infection, particularly in those with low intensity infection [<xref rid="pntd.0004020.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]; however, considering the sample size and age group of children in the study, the collection of multiple specimens was not considered to be feasible. Our strategy had the advantage of providing accurate overall baseline STH prevalence of the study population (as all groups would be expected to have similar baseline prevalences due to randomization), and accurate final STH prevalences at the 24-month visit (at which time all groups were analyzed by the Kato-Katz method). As STH infection status was a secondary outcome (weight gain being the primary outcome), misclassification of infection status would not have affected the analyses on growth or on the effect of the deworming intervention on STH infection at the 24-month visit. Misclassification might have affected only the secondary subgroup analyses restricted to the STH-infected population. Despite the limitations to the strategy we employed, we consider ours to have methodological advantages to other strategies which have been used, such as: 1) not collecting stool specimens, which provides no information on baseline or follow-up STH infection[<xref rid="pntd.0004020.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], or; 2) analyzing all stool specimens immediately, and treating those found to be infected, regardless of allocated intervention group, which would dilute the effect size by providing treatment to those randomized to placebo if found to be STH-positive [<xref rid="pntd.0004020.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec028"><title>Future research focus and directions</title><p>Overall, this is the first trial to provide evidence on the effect of deworming, including optimal timing and frequency, on growth exclusively in children in the critical time window between one and two years of age. This trial demonstrated the feasibility of incorporating deworming into routine growth and development health clinics along with other essential early childhood interventions. We were also able to demonstrate safety of the deworming intervention in this age group, with similar numbers of serious adverse events occurring after mebendazole and placebo administration. This is consistent with results from previous studies [<xref rid="pntd.0004020.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004020.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004020.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Continued observational follow-up of the trial cohort is currently taking place, and will provide evidence on the longer-term effects of deworming up to five years of age.</p><p>Future studies looking at the benefit of deworming on growth in this age group should include study areas of higher STH prevalence and/or intensity, higher potential compliance to the assigned intervention (i.e. lower availability of anthelminthics in the community) and longer follow-up time. Further studies should include other factors that are important to consider for scaling up deworming interventions in this age group. This includes: 1) cost-effectiveness of preventive chemotherapy vs. analyzing and treating only infected individuals; 2) feasibility and cost-effectiveness of integrating deworming with other health, nutritional and environmental interventions, particularly health education and micronutrient supplementation; 3) health and nutritional consequences of low intensity infection in younger age groups; and 4) inclusion of high-risk children living in more remote areas and/or those who do not regularly attend health services. This type of research is essential to contribute to strengthening the evidence base on deworming.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec029"><title>Supporting
