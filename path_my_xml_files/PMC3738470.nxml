The present study sought to investigate the acute effects of this nutritional supplement on serum glucose and insulin in response to a modified OGTT.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Subjects</title><p>Ten healthy, exercise-trained men were recruited from the University of Memphis Campus and surrounding community and completed all aspects of this study. Subjects were not smokers and did not have diagnosed cardiovascular or metabolic disease (including diabetes). One subject reported using a daily aspirin (325 mg) and one subject used an anti-depressant (Sertraline). No other subject reported the use of prescription medications. Subjects were not using dietary supplements believed to influence blood glucose disposal&#x02014;but were allowed to continue their routine use of a daily multi-vitamin/multi-mineral supplement and/or a daily protein/meal replacement powder. Subjects were instructed not to alter their current supplementation schedule over the course of the study period. In addition, subjects were instructed to maintain their current physical activity and dietary intake programs throughout the study. However, they were instructed to refrain from strenuous exercise during the 24 hours prior to each test session, as this may have influenced their response to the modified OGTT. Health history, drug and dietary supplement usage, and physical activity questionnaires were completed by subjects to determine eligibility. Subject characteristics are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-nmi-4-2011-039">Table 1</xref>. The study was approved by University of Memphis Institutional Review Board and all subjects provided written consent.</p><p>As this was a pilot study, we did not conduct a power analysis to determine the optimal sample size necessary to observe a given effect in our outcome measures. It was our objective in this initial study to generate data to determine the general pattern of response in blood glucose and insulin following use of the supplement. These data could then be used for planning potential larger future studies related to the tested supplement. Our small sample size, although consistent with studies of this nature, as well as our failure to include a power analysis, is a limitation of this work.</p></sec><sec><title>Screening</title><p>During the initial visit to the laboratory, subjects completed the informed consent form, health and physical activity questionnaires. Subjects&#x02019; heart rate and blood pressure, height, weight, waist and hip circumference, skinfold thickness (7-site test using Lange calipers and the Siri equation for estimating body fat percentage) were measured and used for descriptive purposes. Subjects were provided with food logs and instructions regarding how to complete these logs during the day prior to each test day.</p></sec><sec><title>Testing</title><p>Subjects reported to the laboratory in the morning hours (6:00&#x02013;8:00 am) following a 10 hour overnight fast. During the two visits subjects consumed in random order, separated by 1&#x02013;2 weeks, either a placebo (microcrystalline cellulose) or a nutritional supplement (proprietary blend of 750 mg of Phellodendron [bark] and Crape Myrtle [Lagerstroemia Speciosia] stem [Anabolic Pump&#x02122;; USPlabs, LLC, Dallas, TX]). The formulation dosage of 750 mg was based on prior studies using Phellodendron and Crape Myrtle in isolation,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-nmi-4-2011-039">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-nmi-4-2011-039">23</xref> while our decision to use the standard single capsule 750 mg dosage was based on our intention to determine the practical application of the finished product when used at the recommended dosage. Although using a dosage greater than 750 mg may have provided greater effects, we would not have truly tested the efficacy of the supplement when taken as suggested by the manufacturer. The supplement was produced using a proprietary process involving a series of solvent-based extraction and chromatographic techniques, to produce highly purified active components of Phellodendron and Crape Myrtle. Both Phellodendron<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-nmi-4-2011-039">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-nmi-4-2011-039">25</xref> and Crape Myrtle<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-nmi-4-2011-039">21</xref> are thought to be safe and non-toxic.</p><p>Subjects consumed the conditions in capsule form. Fifteen minutes following the ingestion of the assigned condition, a modified OGTT was administered. This consisted of 75 grams of 100% pure dextrose powder (NOW Foods, Bloomingdale, IL) mixed into 12 ounces of water. Subjects consumed the entire solution within two minutes. While we do not have data pertaining to the optimal time period in which the supplement should be ingested prior to the OGTT, our timing was similar to and based on the prior work of Fukushima and coworkers who tested the glucose lowering effects of corosolic acid in a mixed sample of diabetic and non-diabetic subjects.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-nmi-4-2011-039">21</xref> It is possible that ingestion of the supplement at times closer to or further from the ingestion of the dextrose solution may yield differing results as compared to those presented here.</p><p>Blood samples were taken before the ingestion of the assigned condition (following a 10 minute quiet rest period) and at 15, 30, 45, 60 and 75 minutes following ingestion of the dextrose load. It should be noted that while standard procedures for an OGTT include sampling every 30 minutes for a period of 2&#x02013;3 hours,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-nmi-4-2011-039">26</xref> we have noted that when using healthy non-diabetic men as test subjects, such a time course is not optimal. That is, serum glucose values after ingestion of a 75 gram dextrose load are close to baseline values within one hour post-ingestion and remain close to this level (or lower than this level) for the following two hours.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-nmi-4-2011-039">27</xref> While it is possible that differing results may have been observed with the present group of subjects, in particular when ingesting a supplement designed to lower blood glucose, we did not choose to continue measurement beyond 75 minutes post ingestion of the dextrose load. Our failure to do so may be considered a limitation of this work. Related to this, it should be understood that the methods employed in the present study are different than those of a standard OGTT, and therefore our findings may not be directly compared to those obtained using the traditional timing schedule (ie, every 30 minutes for a period of 2&#x02013;3 hours).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-nmi-4-2011-039">26</xref></p><p>Prior to each blood draw, heart rate (via 60 second palpation) and blood pressure (via auscultation) were taken.

This response is observed along with a slightly attenuated insulin response to the OGTT when subjects ingest the supplement, as compared to placebo. While the condition effect for insulin failed to reach statistical significance (<italic>P</italic> = 0.06), a post-hoc power analysis indicated that a sample size of 12 subjects would be adequate to yield statistically significant findings.</p><p>Although our data are specific to a small sample of exercise-trained men, they support the notion that this blend of plants may improve glucose disposal while reducing the level of insulin required for such activity. These data provide rationale for continued study with this dietary supplement, in particular within a sample of individuals with impaired glucose tolerance, as more robust findings may be noted within such a population. Of course, the optimal timing of supplementation, as well as the dosage needed to provide for a measureable effect, first needs to be determined. Although the present study simply provided a single serving of the supplement 15 minutes prior to the OGTT (a timing similar to that used by many diabetic patients taking oral hypoglycemic agents prior to feeding), it is unknown whether or not chronic use of the supplement would yield stronger findings. Additional study is needed to generate an answer to this question.</p><p>Phellodendron, or more specifically the dried bark from this plant, is rich in the active ingredient berberine. Berberine is known to regulate glucose and lipid metabolism in vitro and in vivo, with multiple proposed metabolic effects. Specifically, berberine has been reported to mimic insulin activity in mouse models by increasing glucose uptake in adipocytes and myocytes, reducing phosphatase activity of tyrosine, and increasing receptor-mediated phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrates (IRSs).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-nmi-4-2011-039">11</xref> In vitro, insulin messenger RNA and protein expression have been noted to increase in a variety of human cell lines after being treated with berberine.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-nmi-4-2011-039">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-nmi-4-2011-039">16</xref> Berberine has also been shown to increase glucagon secretion while increasing insulin levels and beta-cells in the pancreas in rat models.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-nmi-4-2011-039">15</xref> It has been suggested that berberine may increase GLUT1 activity, adenosine monophosphate&#x02013;activated protein kinase, and acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase phosphorylation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-nmi-4-2011-039">10</xref> The up-regulation of hepatocyte nuclear factor 4alpha (HNF4a) and hepatic glucokinase activity have also been suggested to play a role in enhanced glucose metabolism through the treatment of berberine.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-nmi-4-2011-039">17</xref></p><p>The effects of Phellodendron may be complemented by Crape Myrtle. Much like Phellodendron, Crape Myrtle is believed to contain certain active ingredients within the leaves that have anti-diabetic properties. Specifically, banaba (Lagerstroemia speciosa L.) is a variety of Crape Myrtle that grows in certain parts of the world (eg, Philippines, India, Malaysia, Australia) and contains corosolic acid, for which increased interest exists in relation to its potential role in treating type 2 diabetes. Multiple metabolic effects have been reported for corosolic acid, including stimulated glucose uptake with a similar induction time and a dose-dependent response to that of insulin in adipocytes in vitro.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-nmi-4-2011-039">9</xref> In type 2 diabetic mouse models, orally administered corosolic acid significantly increased the translocation of GLUT4 in muscle.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-nmi-4-2011-039">19</xref> With regards to hepatic glucose metabolism, corosolic acid has been shown to inhibit gluconeogenesis via increased production of Fructose-2, 6-Bisphosphate, lowering cAMP levels, and inhibiting cAMP-dependent protein kinase; and possibly promote glycolysis via increased glucokinase activity independent of glucose-6-phosphate activity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-nmi-4-2011-039">20</xref> Also, in cultured cells, corosolic acid has been noted to induce insulin receptor phosphorylation by increasing the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor &#x003b2;.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32-nmi-4-2011-039">32</xref></p><p>While the potential impact of Phellodendron and Crape Myrtle is significant, with many overlapping effects on various aspects of glucose disposal, the molecular mechanisms related to any <italic>synergistic</italic> effect of these two plant-based ingredients remains to be determined. Future in vitro work using Phellodendron and Crape Myrtle, in isolation and in combination, may provide such mechanistic data.</p><p>Human studies using berberine have reported promising results. For example, Yin et al noted similar effects with berberine as compared to the anti-diabetic drug metformin.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-nmi-4-2011-039">23</xref> Additionally, Zhang and colleagues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-nmi-4-2011-039">24</xref> concluded that &#x0201c;Berberine is effective and safe in the treatment of type 2 diabetes.&#x0201d; Fasting plasma glucose concentrations have been noted to decrease in type 2 diabetic subjects when 0.3&#x02013;0.5 g of berberine was ingested three times daily in three different investigations conducted in China.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33-nmi-4-2011-039">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35-nmi-4-2011-039">35</xref> Taken together, these findings suggest a potential role for this agent in the management of blood glucose.</p><p>Human studies using corosolic acid have reported potential anti-diabetic effects,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-nmi-4-2011-039">21</xref> which may be dose dependent.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-nmi-4-2011-039">22</xref> For example, Fukushima and colleagues reported a lowering of blood glucose in response to an OGTT in a mixed sample of diabetics and those with impaired glucose tolerance, impaired fasting glucose, and normal glucose tolerance.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-nmi-4-2011-039">21</xref> It is unknown how exactly our results compare to those of Fukushima et al,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-nmi-4-2011-039">21</xref> as we used an OGTT with a modified blood sampling time period. Moreover, considering the dose-dependent nature of corosolic acid,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-nmi-4-2011-039">22</xref> it is possible that our findings may have been stronger if we would have treated subjects with a higher dosage of the supplement. Future studies may consider different dosing patterns of this blend, possibly based on body mass, in order to more fully elucidate the potential role of this supplement on glucose disposal.</p><p>Although not a main outcome in the present study, we measured hemodynamic variables pre and post the modified OGTT. No differences were noted between conditions or across time for any measured variable. We hypothesized that a significant reduction in blood glucose following supplement intake may be associated with a reduction in blood pressure. This was based on the observation that a postprandial rise in blood glucose has been noted to be associated with an increase in ROS production,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-nmi-4-2011-039">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29-nmi-4-2011-039">29</xref> which correlated to acute endothelial dysfunction<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29-nmi-4-2011-039">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-nmi-4-2011-039">30</xref>&#x02014;possibly involving elevated blood pressure. Although we failed to note statistical significant in our postprandial hemodynamic measures, values for blood pressure and rate pressure product were slightly lower for supplement compared to placebo (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t3-nmi-4-2011-039">Table 3</xref>). It is possible that our small sample size and the use of healthy, non-diabetic men may have impaired our ability to detect more robust findings. Further investigation is needed, with the inclusion of a larger sample size, in order to extend these findings.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We conclude that when compared to a placebo, a finished dietary supplement containing a blend of Phellodendron and Crape Myrtle can lower the serum glucose response to a modified OGTT, while resulting in a non-significant (<italic>P</italic> = 0.06) attenuation in insulin response. Data from this initial study are specific to a small sample of young, healthy, exercise-trained, non-diabetic men. Future investigations may consider the inclusion of diabetic men and women of varying age, as well as the study of different dosing patterns of each ingredient, as such work may provide information as to the potential therapeutic role of this plant-based combination.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Funding for this work was provided by USPlabs, LLC and The University of Memphis.
