However, there is a lack of rigorous evidence about how to improve food security and HIV-related clinical outcomes. To address this gap, this randomized trial will evaluate three delivery models for short-term food and nutrition support for food insecure PLHIV in Shinyanga, Tanzania: nutrition assessment and counseling (NAC) alone<bold>,</bold> NAC plus food assistance, and NAC plus cash transfers.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>At three HIV care and treatment sites, 788 participants will be randomized into one of three study arms in a 3:3:1 ratio, stratified by site: NAC plus food assistance, NAC plus cash transfer, and NAC only. Eligible participants are: 1) at least 18 years of age; 2) living with HIV infection; 3) initiated ART in the past 90 days; and 4) food insecure, as measured with the Household Hunger Scale. PLHIV who are severely malnourished (body mass index (BMI) &#x0003c; 16 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) will be excluded. Participants randomized to receive food or cash transfers are eligible to receive assistance for up to six months, conditional on attending regularly scheduled visits with their HIV care provider. Participants will be followed for 12 months: the initial 6-month intervention period and then for another 6 months post-intervention. The primary outcome is ART adherence measured with the medication possession ratio. Secondary outcomes include 1) retention in care; 2) nutritional indicators including changes in food security, BMI, and weight gain; 3) viral suppression and self-reported ART adherence; and 4) participation in the labor force.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This rigorously designed trial will inform policy decisions regarding supportive strategies for food insecure PLHIV in the early stages of treatment. The study will measure outcomes immediately after the period of support ends as well as 6 months later, providing information on the duration of the interventions&#x02019; effect. The comparison of food to cash transfers will better inform policies favoring cash assistance or will provide rationale for the continued investment in food and nutrition interventions for PLHIV.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01957917">NCT01957917</ext-link>.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Food security</kwd><kwd>HIV infection</kwd><kwd>Adherence</kwd><kwd>Retention</kwd><kwd>Impact evaluation</kwd><kwd>Cash transfers</kwd><kwd>Food assistance</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Although early initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) among people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHIV) has significant clinical benefits and can virtually eliminate onward HIV transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], these benefits hinge on retention in care and high levels of ART adherence. However, in sub-Saharan Africa, food insecurity, poor nutrition, and poverty are pervasive threats to ART&#x02019;s potential effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Food insecurity in particular is recognized as a barrier to ART initiation, retention in care, and adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], thus fostering interest in the potential for food and nutrition interventions to improve the health of PLHIV.</p><p>People are considered food secure when they have adequate physical, social, and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Studies have highlighted several pathways through which food insecurity impedes adherence to treatment and care in the general adult population of PLHIV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. First, the fear of increased hunger experienced or anticipated by people on treatment as well as the real or perceived fears of exacerbated side effects in the absence of adequate nutritional intake can reduce adherence to treatment recommendations. In addition, people who are food insecure might avoid or delay HIV treatment and care because of food insecurity&#x02019;s overlap with household economic status and the real or perceived costs of ART or HIV primary care (e.g., transportation). Furthermore, food insecurity may influence ART adherence and care seeking through mental health pathways related to the anxiety and stress associated with hunger [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, there is a paucity of rigorous evidence to guide initiatives for PLHIV, including which assistance modalities are best to improve food security, clinical outcomes, and household economic stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Interventions to improve food security</title><p>Some have hypothesized that nutritional support in the form of food baskets or food supplements may minimize or eliminate the food insecurity&#x02019;s negative effects on adherence to treatment and care. To date, there have been four quasi-experimental studies examining the effect of such programs on ART adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. All were conducted in sub-Saharan Africa and compared food supplementation programs to clinics or regions not receiving the programs. Of these, three [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] found significant improvements in treatment adherence among food recipients. However, none of the studies had an experimental design and several evaluated food rations designed for the entire household [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], which are likely to be cost prohibitive and/or unsustainable in resource-constrained settings.</p><p>In addition, there is ongoing debate about whether cash transfers can achieve the same nutritional and clinical goals as food assistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Studies conducted among people in the general population (not limited to PLHIV) suggest that although both food and cash transfers increase food consumption, food transfers result in <italic>greater</italic> increases in caloric intake than cash transfers, may be preferred by beneficiaries over cash, and may be more appropriate when food is scarce and/or food markets are functioning poorly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. However, cash transfers give beneficiaries freedom of choice, may be cheaper to distribute and easier to monitor, and may be more &#x0201c;efficient&#x0201d; (under the assumptions of neoclassical microeconomic theory) than food transfers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The growing body of evidence suggesting that financial incentives can be used to increase adherence to ART and retention in care bolsters the idea that cash transfers have the potential to strengthen the HIV care continuum, and might be equally, if not more, cost-effective than nutritional support for some health outcomes, such as ART adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. However, there are limited data from resource-constrained settings about whether targeted cash assistance programs are effective for improving the health of PLHIV, and if so, their relative effectiveness when compared to other modes of support. The only randomized study to directly compare the effect of food and cash transfers among PLHIV on ART adherence found no difference in adherence between the two support strategies after 8 months in a sample of 293 clients in Zambia, although there was no comparison arm to determine the impact of the interventions over and above the standard of care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Rationale for the current study</title><p>To address this research gap, we designed a randomized study of three delivery models for short-term food and nutrition support for PLHIV in Tanzania who recently initiated treatment: nutrition assessment and counseling (NAC) alone<bold>,</bold> NAC plus food assistance, and NAC plus cash transfers. Participants in the two active treatment arms receiving food or cash transfers are eligible to receive assistance for up to six months, conditional on attending regularly scheduled visits with their HIV care provider.</p><p>The study focuses on ART initiates for several reasons. First, PLHIV who initiate ART with a low body mass index (BMI) have two to six times higher mortality rates than non-malnourished patients in the first years of treatment even after controlling for disease stage, and these individuals are also more likely to be lost to follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. This suggests that food availability is especially critical among ART initiates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Second, short-term food or cash support may provide a bridge until the participant&#x02019;s health improves sufficiently to improve work productivity and hence earnings. This helps prevent households from having to sell productive assets in order to purchase food, especially if the HIV-infected household member is unable to work at the time of treatment initiation. In South Africa, there is a sharp decline in labor force participation in the year before PLHIV start treatment, followed by a slow but nearly complete re-entry into the workforce after treatment initiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Thus, by intervening at the time of ART initiation, household labor supply and productivity may rebound faster, preventing lengthy unemployment spells and/or preventing job loss entirely [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. This may also reduce deleterious spillover effects on nutrition, education, and other dimensions of household welfare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>A six-month support period for ART initiates was selected to be consistent with current policy and practice and for comparability to previous research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. For example, the World Food Programme commonly provides short-term assistance of 6&#x02013;8 months duration for malnourished and/or food insecure PLHIV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], as does the widely recognized Academic Model for Prevention and Treatment of HIV/AIDS (AMPATH) in Kenya [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Furthermore, lengthy periods of food or cash assistance are not likely to be feasible, affordable, nor sustainable in resource-constrained settings.</p><p>For these reasons, we hypothesized that short-term support among ART initiates may be an effective response during an important window of opportunity (ART initiation), when the risk of morbidity and mortality is high, good ART adherence habits are being formed, and household welfare is threatened. Our study will measure adherence to treatment and care immediately after the period of support ends as well as 6 months later, providing information on the duration of effect (if any).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Primary objectives</title><p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Compare the effectiveness of a NAC plus food assistance program for food insecure PLHIV starting ART versus a NAC plus cash transfer program on ART adherence at 6 months.</p><p><italic>Hypothesis</italic>: NAC plus cash assistance will be non-inferior to NAC plus food assistance on ART adherence.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Determine the effect of a nutrition assessment and counseling (NAC) program plus food or cash assistance for food insecure PLHIV starting ART versus NAC alone on ART adherence at 6 months.</p><p><italic>Hypothesis</italic>: Participants who receive NAC plus either food or cash transfers will have better adherence to ART than participants who receive NAC alone.</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Secondary objectives</title><p>The secondary objectives include evaluating the effectiveness of NAC plus food and cash transfers at 6 and 12 months of follow-up on: 1) retention in care; 2) nutritional indicators including changes in food security, BMI, and weight gain; 3) viral suppression and self-reported ART adherence; and 4) participation in the labor force.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>Study setting and design</title><p>In Tanzania, 1,500,000 people are living with HIV infection and 399,886 are on ART [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].

The study is conducted in Shinyanga Region, a resource-poor region in the northwest &#x0201c;Lake Zone&#x0201d; of Tanzania where approximately 17 % of households have poor or borderline food consumption and HIV prevalence is 7.4 %, making this an ideal setting to examine how food and cash assistance may influence adherence to ART [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p><p>We designed a 3-arm parallel group randomized trial to examine the effectiveness of short-term food and cash assistance added to the standard of care HIV services, including nutrition assessment and counseling (NAC).

The food basket consists of locally procured whole maize meal (12 kg), groundnuts (3 kg), and beans (3 kg). The composition of the food basket was determined with the input of experts in academic, government, and donor organizations and was selected to be applicable to other settings, not cost-prohibitive, and use foods available in the local markets.

The cash transfer is 22,500 Tanzanian Shillings (approximately $11 USD) exclusive of transaction fees and is equivalently valued to the food basket. This value was selected to prevent undue coercion to study participants and to be consistent with the Tanzania Social Action Fund (TASAF), a government-run anti-poverty program which targets &#x0201c;orphans, disabled, elderly, widows/widowers, and those infected or affected by HIV/AIDS<italic>,&#x0201d;</italic> among other vulnerable groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. TASAF provides $6-18 monthly to households depending on the presence and number of vulnerable children and elderly members. The transfer for this study, at ~ $11, is within this range, ensuring that the amount is policy-relevant.

CIs will be adjusted for multiple comparisons between the three treatment groups using Bonferroni&#x02019;s adjustment and the <italic>pwcompare</italic> compare command in Stata 14 (College Station, Texas).</p><p>To assess Objective 1, we will compare the proportion of individuals with MPR &#x02265;95 % among those receiving NAC plus food to those receiving NAC plus cash transfers at 6 months. Only Objective 1 will be assessed in terms of non-inferiority; all other comparisons will be tests for superiority. The proportion of participants with MPR &#x02265;95 % in both groups and the associated two-sided 95 % CI for the difference will be estimated. Non-inferiority of NAC plus cash transfers will be defined as the lower 95 % CI of the between-group difference in the primary outcome lying above a threshold of &#x02212;10 % [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. If non-inferiority is evident, we will then assess whether NAC plus cash transfers is superior to NAC plus food transfers using a Wald test with alpha = 0.05.</p><p>To assess Objective 2, if the NAC plus food and cash transfer groups are not statistically different from each other based on examination of 95 % confidence intervals, we will pool the groups together and create a binary explanatory variable indicating NAC alone or NAC plus cash or food. We will then examine the effect of receiving NAC plus food or cash assistance on ART adherence compared to NAC alone.</p><p>We will potentially conduct two secondary analyses. First, if the randomization scheme produces imbalanced baseline characteristics among study participants in each of the three groups, these covariates will be included in regression models to generate adjusted risk differences and 95 % CIs. In addition, we will conduct a per protocol analysis using data from participants who received at least a minimum exposure to the interventions and for whom MPR was available at 6 months. Thus, we will construct a regression model with the 3-level treatment group and restrict the intervention groups to individuals who received &#x02265;1 food basket or cash transfer during the 6-month intervention period.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Human subjects protection</title><p>The Tanzanian National Institute of Medical Research and the Committee for Protection of Human Subjects at the University of California, Berkeley approved this study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Study status</title><p>The study was launched in December 2013 and all sites were actively enrolling participants by February 2014.

This study will explore several strategies to alleviate food security among ART initiates in Shinyanga, Tanzania, a resource-constrained environment with widespread food insecurity. Although a limited number of studies have demonstrated that food or cash assistance may improve adherence to treatment and/or care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>], the evidence base is limited either in geographic scope (i.e., high-income countries) or in the quality of the study design. This study will build on this prior research and will use rigorous methods to examine these hypothesized relationships. The careful selection of the size and composition of the food and cash transfers will ensure that the results are generalizable to other settings in eastern and southern Africa and are relevant to ongoing discussions about how best to support PLHIV to form good adherence habits.</p><p>Specifically, the results from this study will have implications for the development of supportive strategies for PLHIV in the early stages of treatment. If the results for one of the intervention arms (NAC plus food or cash assistance) are positive, demonstrating that PLHIV who receive the intervention are more likely to be retained in care and/or have better treatment adherence, a large-scale impact evaluation to determine cost-effectiveness and examine issues of scale and sustainability may be warranted. Furthermore, if this study validates the hypothesis that increased food and/or cash can mitigate food security and improve adherence, it will support the development and evaluation of livelihood interventions targeted to AIDS-affected households which aim to increase household food and economic security through training, access to productive assets (e.g., fertilizer), or financial products (e.g., microloans) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. In this way, this study provides important proof-of-concept data that will inform both targeted food interventions for PLHIV as well as structural income-enhancing interventions that benefit the entire household. If neither intervention arm is successful, it will suggest that limited resources should not be spent on these models without modifications to enhance their effectiveness, which would need to be evaluated in a future study. Thus, the results from the study should influence policies that aim to mitigate food and economic insecurity and maximize adherence to treatment and care among PLHIV.</p><p>Although the interventions evaluated in this study are designed to mitigate food insecurity, they are not intended to examine the effect of nutritional quality on adherence or clinical outcomes. Similarly, the interventions are also not designed specifically to mitigate malnutrition; although they may improve nutritional status, there are other pathways through which the intervention may improve ART adherence and retention in care (e.g., such as mitigating side effects) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Other studies have examined the effect of nutritional composition and quality on HIV disease progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>], of which some focus on ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF) products and/or fortified blended foods such as corn soy blend. In this study, locally available and preferred foods were selected instead of RUTF or fortified blended products in order to improve the likelihood that the results are generalizable to other settings and also to ensure that participants in the NAC plus cash transfer arm have access to the exact same foods, if they choose to purchase them.</p><p>A potential threat to the study is that the food basket and cash transfer may be shared with others in the household and not used by the PLHIV for whom it was intended. This persistent challenge with sharing has been noted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], and consequently some have provided monthly food baskets for the entire household [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. We determined that this quantity of food would be prohibitively expensive, unsustainable, cost-prohibitive, and may be coercive in participating clinics in Shinyanga Region, where 90 % of ART initiates report moderate or severe food insecurity (data not shown). The approach in this study was to <italic>supplement</italic> the household food supply rather than replace it, recognizing that although sharing is a threat to the intervention&#x02019;s effectiveness on ART adherence, it may benefit others in the household, including children. If we determine through patient interviews that the amount of sharing food and/or cash is significant, it provides valuable information to policymakers about the limitations of cash and in-kind transfers to improve the health of individual PLHIV.</p><p>A limitation of the study is that it will not be powered to examine heterogeneity of effect by sex or site. Data from other cash transfer studies indicate that the magnitude and durability of the effect on health outcomes may be different between men and women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>], a phenomenon that this study will not be powered to address. Similarity, we will not be powered to examine differential effects by study site. Furthermore, at the conclusion of the study we will not know the exact pathways through which the intervention(s) worked, although we will explore this in an ancillary qualitative study where we will focus on how the transfers were used by beneficiaries.</p><p>This study also has significant strengths. This study focuses on food insecure PLHIV who are <italic>at risk</italic> of malnutrition but are not severely malnourished (BMI &#x02265; 16). This study population was selected in order to mitigate the effects of food insecurity before the development of undernutrition, which reduces the benefits of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. In addition, the inclusion of a NAC-only arm will allow study investigators to determine whether the addition of food or cash transfers results in better adherence over and above NAC alone. This issue is highly policy relevant to a variety of settings that already conduct food and nutrition assessments among HIV-infected clients. In addition, the presence of NAC in all study arms may increase the likelihood that the intervention improves nutritional status, compared, for example, to cash transfers delivered without nutritional counseling. Previous studies have found that cash transfers&#x02019; effect on nutrition among children is enhanced with the inclusion of health-related requirements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. Furthermore, because we will measure the effect of the food and cash transfers distributed in months 0&#x02013;6 and again 6 months after they are withdrawn, we will be able to examine durability of effect. Indeed, in every randomized study of cash transfers and ART adherence that examined durability of effect (all conducted in the U.S.), adherence returns to baseline levels once the incentives are removed, hinting at the essential role of intrinsic motivation once external rewards are discontinued (a construct from Self-Determination Theory) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p>Perhaps the most important strength of the study is that, depending on the results, the direct comparison of food to cash transfers will provide additional support for policies favoring cash assistance or will provide rationale for the continued investment in food supplementation for PLHIV. Cash transfer programs targeting poor and vulnerable households are expanding rapidly in Africa, alongside generalized HIV epidemics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. This includes TASAF, a government-run anti-poverty program that targets vulnerable households [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. It is increasingly recognized that programs like TASAF have &#x0201c;spillover&#x0201d; benefits on reproductive health and behaviour (e.g., contraceptive use, sexual behavior) that are not directly linked to the conditions of the transfers nor the programs&#x02019; primary anti-poverty goals, as was observed in Mexico, South Africa, and Kenya [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. It may be justified to expand the reach of these programs to HIV-affected households if the results from our study demonstrate that cash transfers have significant benefits on adherence to treatment and care, nutritional status, and/or household welfare. In contrast, if we find that food support is superior to cash support, this will renew the urgency to develop cost-effective ways to increase food availability, whether through livelihood interventions or the direct provision of food. In either case, the study will yield important information to guide research and policy about how best to support PLHIV who are initiating treatment.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>AMPATH</term><def><p>Academic model for prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ARV</term><def><p>Antiretroviral</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ART</term><def><p>Antiretroviral therapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BMI</term><def><p>Body mass index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CI</term><def><p>Confidence interval</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MPR</term><def><p>Medication possession ratio</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NAC</term><def><p>Nutrition assessment and counseling</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NACS</term><def><p>Nutrition assessment, counseling and support</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OR</term><def><p>Odds ratio</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PEPFAR</term><def><p>President&#x02019;s emergency plan for AIDS relief</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PLHIV</term><def><p>People living with HIV infection</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RUTF</term><def><p>Ready-to-use therapeutic food</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TASAF</term><def><p>Tanzania social action fund</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VAS</term><def><p>Visual analog scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WHO</term><def><p>World health organization</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn id="Fn1"><label>1</label><p>The study was also initiated in a 4<sup>th</sup> facility.
