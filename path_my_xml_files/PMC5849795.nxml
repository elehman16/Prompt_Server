However, engaging in regular physical activity can be challenging for the elderly population because of reduced mobility, low motivation, or lack of the proper infrastructures in their communities.</p></sec><sec sec-type="objective"><title>Objective</title><p>The objective of this paper was to study the feasibility of home-based online group training&#x02014;under different group cohesion settings&#x02014;and its effects on adherence and well-being among Russian older adults. We focused particularly on the technology usability and usage and on the adherence to the training (in light of premeasures of social support, enjoyment of physical activity, and leg muscle strength). As a secondary objective, we also explored the effects of the technology-supported intervention on subjective well-being and loneliness.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Two pilot trials were carried out exploring two different group cohesion settings (weak cohesion and strong cohesion) in the period from 2015 to 2016 in Tomsk, Russian Federation. A total of 44 older adults (59-83 years) participated in the two pilots and followed a strength and balance training program (Otago) for 8 weeks with the help of a tablet-based virtual gym app. Participants in each pilot were assigned to an interaction condition, representing the online group exercising, and an individual condition, representing a home-based individual training. Both conditions featured persuasion strategies but differed in the ability to socialize and train together.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Both interaction and individual groups reported a high usability of the technology. Trainees showed a high level of technology acceptance and, particularly, a high score in intention to future use (4.2-5.0 on a 5-point Likert scale). Private texting (short service message [SMS]) was used more than public texting, and the strong cohesion condition resulted in more messages per user. Joint participations to training sessions (copresence) were higher for the social group with higher cohesion. The overall adherence to the training was 74% (SD 27%). Higher levels of social support at baseline were associated with higher adherence in the low cohesion condition (F1,18=5.23, <italic>P</italic>=.03), whereas in the high cohesion, such association was not found. Overall improvement in the satisfaction with life score was observed between pre and post measures (F1,31=5.85, <italic>P</italic>=.02), but no decrease in loneliness.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Online group exercising was proven feasible among healthy independently living older adults in Russia. The pilots suggest that a physical training performed in a virtual environment positively affect the life satisfaction of the trainees, but it does not provide support for a decrease in loneliness. High cohesion groups are preferable for group exercising, especially to mitigate effects of low social support on adherence. Further research in motivating group interactions in training settings is needed.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>physical fitness</kwd><kwd>exercise training</kwd><kwd>tablet computers</kwd><kwd>elderly</kwd><kwd>social support</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><sec><title>Background</title><p>Regular physical activity is a key factor to a successful aging, contributing to positive outcomes in health and well-being in later life [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. It can improve physical function [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], slow the progression of degenerative diseases [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], reduce risk of falls [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], and also improve cognitive performance, mood, and quality of life (QoL) of older adults [<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. A physically inactive lifestyle, on the contrary, can increase the risk of developing chronic diseases, one of the leading causes of death and disability in older adults [<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Engaging in regular physical activity can be challenging. Older adults might suffer from reduced mobility, low self-efficacy, lack the proper infrastructures in their communities, or simply find it difficult to leave home and participate in physical activities on a regular basis [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. For these and many other reasons, physical inactivity is still prevalent in older adults [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], leading to the undesired effects on health and well-being.</p><p>Intervention programs to promote physical activity have shown to be effective in increasing and maintaining physical activity [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In particular, group-based interventions have shown promising results in long-term settings with higher adherence compared with individual home-based interventions. Studies have also reported a preference by older adults for group exercising [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and discussed the potential of the social context to stimulate social interactions and increase social well-being [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>However, despite the body of literature on the topic, little attention has been paid on populations living under difficult environmental conditions and undergoing complex social changes, such as the Siberian community. Seasonal fluctuation has been found to determine the level of physical and social activities of older adults [<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] leading to less opportunities to go out and interact, especially in high latitudes where winter can result in a decline of physical functions of older adults, such as ankle strength [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Recent history has also shaped the lives of older adults in Russia. The breakup of Soviet Union in the early 90s, and the difficult years that followed, negatively affected the social and economic well-being of the Russian population: the life expectancy of men is 14 years lower than in the European Union [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and loneliness levels are among the highest in Europe [<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The social, political, and economic uncertainty also deeply affected QoL, with a decrease in life satisfaction and happiness [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>The above observations point to the need for solutions that can help older adults living under the above conditions to keep physically and socially active. Technology-supported interventions have been shown in the past to be successful in this goal [<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Related Work</title><p>Recent research has demonstrated an effectiveness of technology-supported exercise interventions for older adults in terms of physical fitness [<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However, although there is an ongoing discussion on whether group exercising or home-based individual exercising is more effective in increasing adherence of individuals to training programs (eg, [<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]) and despite calls for analysis focusing on understanding group-based exercising in terms of <italic>cohesiveness</italic> (frequency of contact and group dynamics) [<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], no intervention has compared the effectiveness of individual and (different types of) group settings in a technology-supported intervention.</p><p>Research has also shown a preference by older adults in group training [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, implementing group exercising can be challenging, especially in a heterogeneous elderly population, with individual differences leading to motivational issues and problems in tailoring the training [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Fitness apps for home-based training have been widely explored in technology-supported interventions (see [<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] for a review); however, we are not aware of interventions supporting online group exercising for individuals of different levels of fitness. Consequently, there is very limited research on the effects of level of fitness, social support, and subjective well-being in online group settings. The exception comes from a recent study on an Internet-based group training intervention [<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] relying on a general-purpose teleconference software to deliver real-time exercises to older adults in rural areas. Although targeting homogeneous groups, focused on physical fitness outcomes, and limited to a small sample of 10 older adults, the study highlights some interesting challenges in deploying this type of technology.</p><p>In our previous study [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], we made some steps to test the feasibility of a tool for online group exercising, namely Gymcentral, that allows individual of different levels of fitness to follow exercises with the remote company of others. We conducted an 8-week pilot study exploring the effects of online group exercise training in Trento, Italy, with 37 adults, 65 years and above, who followed the Otago exercise program [<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] aiming at strength and balance improvement in older age. The specific focus of the study was on technology acceptance, attitude, and preference toward group training and its effects on physical and social well-being; in comparison with a traditional tablet-based individual training program implementing no persuasion strategies.</p><p>Still, despite the prior work and the extensive existing literature, open questions remain:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>How does the online group exercising translate to other cultural and environmental settings?</p></list-item><list-item><p>How effective is online training with groups of different levels of cohesion?</p></list-item><list-item><p>How does online group exercising compare with individual training featuring persuasion strategies?</p></list-item></list></sec><sec><title>Objectives</title><p>This paper reports on two pilot studies of an online exercise intervention with older adults living in Tomsk, Siberian Federal District (Russia). The aim of the intervention was to enable older adults of different levels of fitness to follow a personalized exercise program from home, with the (virtual) company of training companions and under the supervision of a remote coach. This was done with the support of a tablet app offering group exercising in a virtual gym while leveraging on the social context of the group exercising to enable social interactions and feedback.</p><p>The main objective of the pilot was to study the feasibility of online group exercising under different cohesion settings among Siberian older adults.

More importantly, we also explored how the app was used in practice and how the usage relates to the observed effects of the.</p><p>RQ2. How do online group exercising and baseline measures influence the adherence of older adults to a training program? Previous research suggests that exercising in a group results in higher adherence and preference by older adults [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, research also points to major obstacles when delivering group exercises to heterogeneous populations, which can make training in this setting difficult and less motivating [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In this study, we explored how a virtual group environment influences the adherence of older adults under different measures of known determinants of physical activity.</p><p>RQ3. Does online group exercising affect the well-being of older adults? We explored the effects of physical training via a virtual social environment on the subjective well-being and social well-being of older adults. By addressing this question, we aimed at contributing to the existing research on the association between physical training and well-being [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Study Design</title><p>We explored the above questions in two pilot studies in Tomsk, Siberian Federal District (Russian Federation) that adhered to the same protocol and conditions, except for the group cohesion setting:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Tomsk1 (July 2015-September 2015).

Thus, for the reasons explained above, candidate participants from Tomsk 1 had a stronger cohesion than Tomsk 2 at recruitment time, regardless of the treatment they ended up receiving. We did so to understand the effect of the prior connectedness among participants on the observed outcomes.</p><p>Both pilot studies were follow-ups to a previous pilot performed in Trento, Italy, and so they follow the same study design [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. An overview of the study flow in consolidated standards of reporting trials&#x02013;compliant format is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure3">3</xref>.</p><p>In both studies described here, participants were assigned to an interaction group (online group exercise condition) or to an individual group (individual exercise condition) using a random assignment procedure, with age and participants' frailty level as random assignment variables. In Tomsk 1, the process was slightly different as to ensure a high level of cohesion after randomization: pairs of friends, identified during the informative meeting, were treated as single elements during randomization. In this modified process, we firstly followed the randomization procedure for participants <italic>without friends</italic>, assigning participants to interaction and individual treatments, and then repeating the process for the friend pair units. Thus, friends were assigned to the same treatments, contributing to the overall group cohesion in Tomsk 1.</p><p>The two studies and the two treatment conditions defined four effective groups (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

of the app implemented the same training program, developed on the basis of the Otago exercise program [<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], which includes a set of muscle strengthening and balance-retraining exercises. The training program was designed with a standard set of exercises to be performed in each training session, varying in intensity each week according to the performance of the trainees. In the app, each exercise had 10 levels of intensity based on the duration and the number of repetitions. At the beginning of the study, a personal trainer (who was also the coach in the virtual gym) performed a physical assessment, which was used to set the starting intensity level of the program.</p><p>Participants received an iPad Air tablet (9.7-inch) preinstalled with the assigned version of the app and Internet access, a case to support the vertical positioning of the tablet, an activity monitoring sensor (Misfit Shine), one pair of ankle weights (0.5 Kg each), and the telephone number of the support team.</p><p>Before the start of the training program, participants joined pretest and technology training meetings: (1) an initial meeting where they signed the informed consent and filled out enrollment questionnaires, (2) a session with a medical doctor to evaluate eligibility, (3) a technology training session in the use of tablets and the assigned version of the app, and (4) a session for the physical assessment with the coach and pretest measures. The technology training followed a workshop format and was done in small groups of 10 participants each. Participants assigned to individual and interaction conditions attended workshops separately as they were provided with different versions of the app.</p><p>In the 8 weeks of the training, participants performed the home-based training activity with the monitoring of the coach and of the support staff. The training schedule offered three exercise sessions per week, and participants were required to perform at least two exercise sessions every week. The duration of the training session ranged from 30 to 40 min depending on the intensity level. Participants were free to join the training sessions at any time. Posttest measures took place on the week after the training.</p><p>The coach guiding the participants during the training was a practicing doctor with a primary care doctor degree and had over 10 years of experience in gymnastics, rehabilitation exercises, and yoga for older adults. Before the beginning of experiment, the coach was acquainted with the Otago training program and Gymcentral app settings.</p><p>During the training period, the coach had the task of progressing the intensity of the exercise program and providing feedback. At the end of every week, the coach could maintain or increase the intensity level of each trainee according to the attendance and completeness of the training sessions in the week. The coach was also instructed to contact trainees at least once a week to provide feedback and to respond to any question from the trainees. The coach was not aware of the difference between the interaction and individual groups, and both received the same amount of technical support.</p><p>The pretest measures included the <italic>Groningen Frailty Indicator</italic> [<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], the <italic>Rapid Assessment of Physical Activity Questionnaire</italic> [<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], demographic information, and questionnaires concerning psychological and social well-being.

In the Tomsk2 study, the recruitment was carried out through three organizations organizing social activities and events. We conducted presentations explaining the project and their expected involvement and handed out printed bulletins. Older adults interested in participating provided their phone numbers and were later on contacted by the project coordinator. Details about the retirement organizations and the number of candidates reached can be seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>.</p><p>In the Tomsk1 study, 20 participants were found eligible for the study (mean age individual group=65, SD 6.1; interaction group: mean 68.2, SD 7.8; 19 females and 1 male). In the Tomsk2 study, 40 participants were accepted according to the inclusion criteria (mean age individual group=68.9, SD 7.2; interaction group: mean 67.6, SD 6.2; all 40 female). The difference in the number of male and female participants is because of the demographics of the study location and the availability of male candidates at the retirement organizations.

Looking at the time spent in the classroom relative to the time spent in-app by each participant, we can see that participants of the individual group in both studies spent nearly the same percentage of their time (Tomsk1=95.3%, Tomsk2=95.6%) in the classroom. Participants in the interaction groups spent a little less on the classroom&#x02014;especially in Tomsk2 (Tomsk1=92.5%, Tomsk2=81.4%). The lower use in the interaction app is because of the presence of extra features and in the case of Tomsk2, because of the lower time spent training.</p><p>Analyzing the usage of the other features, we observe that participants spent a significant percentage of their time messaging, particularly those in the individual groups (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure4">Figure 4</xref>). We can derive that the individual group not only used the training feature but also the messaging tool to interact with the coach and to check their progress.

The messaging feature was used to send private messages to other participants and the coach, especially in Tomsk1. The bulletin board was also used, although visits were more related to a <italic>lurking</italic> behavior rather than actual contributions.

Not surprisingly, participants of Tomsk1 interacted significantly more among themselves (4.4 messages per user compared with only 0.4 in Tomsk2).</p><p>It is also noteworthy the asymmetry between sent and received messages when including messages by the coach.

Surprisingly, however, participants exchanged more private messages among themselves than public ones, even in the strong cohesion group. The high cohesion setting only accounted for more exchanges per user, not for group-level interactions. This result suggests different attitudes toward group interactions possibly because of cultural differences. In fact, the usage logs suggest mainly a lurking behavior, possibly because of the automatic sharing of the participant&#x02019;s performance&#x02014;a social learning feature. Thus, further studies are required to design better online interaction tools that would motivate group building in the cultural context of reference.</p></sec><sec><title>Copresence Higher in the Strong Cohesion Group (Research Question 1)</title><p>The results of copresence show us that participants from the interaction group in Tomsk1 (strong cohesion group) participated in significantly more training sessions with the company of others compared with the meetings by chance in the individual group. We have seen the same effect in our previous study [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] featuring a high-cohesion group of Italian older adults. This effect was not observed in Tomsk2 (low cohesion group), suggesting that training together is not necessarily a preference in groups with low cohesion, and thus, the cohesion level might affect the willingness to train together.</p></sec><sec><title>Online Group Exercising Did Not Result in Higher Adherence When Compared With Individual Training With Persuasion Features (Research Question 2)</title><p>We have observed a higher adherence for the groups with high cohesion, and in particular, under the group-exercising treatment (interaction: mean 87% [SD 23%]; individual: mean 77% [SD 25%]). However, the ANCOVA showed neither a significant main effect for group or for study, nor interaction between study and group. This suggests that the added group exercising feature did not account for a significant difference in persistence rate compared with the individual training with persuasion features (interaction: mean 65% [SD 25%]; individual: mean 74% [SD 30%]).</p><p>In our previous study with Italian older adults [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], we observed a higher adherence to the online group-exercising compared with individual training (with no persuasion strategies). Here, we did not observe the same effect when comparing online group exercising with individual training (with persuasion strategies). We attribute this effect to (1) Persuasion features in the individual training condition that raised the adherence by 10% compared with our previous study [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This increase made the difference in favor of the group exercising condition nonsignificant and (2) Weaker cohesion among participants in Tomsk2, which might have reduced the effect of normative influence and peer support, resulting in a 20% drop in adherence compared with Tomsk1 and our previous study [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>These results contribute to the ongoing discussion on the differences between individual and group training (see [<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] for the most recent meta-analysis on the topic). First, it adds to the evidence that group-exercising in low cohesion groups results in an adherence comparable to that of individual training with contact (with a coach), extending the evidence to online settings. Second, it partially supports the evidence that group exercising in high-cohesion groups results in higher adherence than individual training with contact. On this point, we have seen evidence only when comparing group exercising with individual training with no persuasion strategies, which is indeed closer to the individual condition explored in [<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The possibility of incorporating persuasion strategies in online setting adds a new dimension that requires further investigation.</p></sec><sec><title>Social Support Can Predict Adherence to a Training Program When Social Connections are Weak or Absent (Research Question 2)</title><p>In analyzing the effects of social support on adherence, we have seen a significant interaction between study and the initial social support score at baseline. In Tomsk2, participants with higher social support level showed higher adherence to the training. This suggests that higher level of social support is associated with higher levels of adherence when the connection among participants is weak (Tomsk2). This observation is in lines with the literature highlighting the social support structure as an important determinant of adherence [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Interestingly, Tomsk1 did not show a significant association between initial social support and adherence. This suggests that low levels of external social support (as measured at baseline) can also be compensated with the social dynamics of an online group with strong cohesion (Tomsk1).</p></sec><sec><title>Enjoyment of Physical Activity With Contradicting Effects on Adherence for Groups With Weak and Strong Cohesion (Research Question 2)</title><p>Enjoyment of physical activity is described as determinant of physical activity [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and is associated with positive attitudes toward exercise, intrinsic motivation, and consequently long-lasting adherence to physical activity [<xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. We have seen, however, some conflicting effects of this variable&#x02014;as measured with the PACES scale&#x02014;on the adherence of the groups with weak and strong cohesion: all groups showed higher adherence for higher PACES score except for the interaction group with low cohesion that showed the opposite effect. This negative effect on adherence in the latter group came as a surprise, and it requires further study to investigate its roots and whether it is because of negative social dynamics in low cohesion settings.</p></sec><sec><title>Initial Level of Fitness With Nonsignificant Effect on Adherence of Online Group Exercising and Individual Training With Persuasion Strategies (Research Question 2)</title><p>Implementing group exercising can be challenging, especially in heterogeneous populations. Individual differences among older adults can lead to motivational issues and problems in tailoring the training [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In addition, perceived barriers such as lack of skills, pain, fear of injuries, and falls can also constitute obstacles to the motivation of older adults to exercise.</p><p>In our previous study with Italian older adults [<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], we observed that the initial level of fitness could predict the adherence of older adults to an individual training (without persuasion strategies). It was also observed that the online group exercising tool&#x02014;the same used in the pilots reported in this paper&#x02014;was effective in mitigating that effect. In lines with this prior study, the results from our two pilots showed that the initial level of fitness did not have a significant effect on adherence of the interaction group but neither on the adherence of the individual group. One potential explanation is the presence of individual persuasion strategies in the version of the app used by the individual group, which might have leveled the effect. This suggests that more studies are needed to better understand the roots of the observed effects of the initial level of fitness, as well as the effects of individual and social persuasion in mitigating them.</p></sec><sec><title>Seasonal Fluctuations and Its Influence on Availability of Candidate Participants (Research Question 2)</title><p>Seasonal fluctuation has been found to determine the level of physical and social activities of older adults [<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], especially in high latitudes where winter can result in a decline of physical functions of older adults [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].

June to September is gardening season, and independent living older adults usually engage in this activity, spending most of the period in their summer houses (Dacha). This influenced the availability of participants in our study as it created obstacles for some candidates that showed initial interest in participating (eg, finding time to train and worries of bringing tablets with them outdoors or to the Dacha). After this experience, the second study was moved to earlier spring months (April-June) to increase the pool of potential candidates. However, we did not see a significant difference in the program adherence that could be explained by these two different seasons.

Still, further studies are needed to see if these observations can be translated to the intervention described in this paper.</p></sec><sec><title>Group Size Difference</title><p>The amount of participants in the Tomsk2 study was twice bigger than in the first Tomsk1 study, 40 and 20 participants, respectively.</p><p>The difference in the group size between the two studies is because of (1) the complexity of the study design and (2) the difficulty in finding participants of older age willing to participate, given the specific social characteristics of the region (older adults living in Siberia are not used to participate in studies). Therefore, we were able to involve only 20 participants for the study Tomsk 1. The following year, as we built better contacts with various retirement organizations and local organizations became more familiar with the project, we were able to involve 40 people in the study (Tomsk 2).</p></sec><sec><title>No Quantitative Measures of Group Cohesion</title><p>Group cohesion was defined as a property of the pool of candidates: participants acquainted with each other and engaging in joint activities. This property was maintained during randomization by ensuring that pairs of friends would end up in the same groups. While being a solid definition, the fact that cohesion was not qualitatively measured should be noted as a limitation.</p></sec><sec><title>Scales Validation in Russian Language</title><p>There is a lack of translations of international standardized measure in Russia. Therefore, except the SWLS (which has already been validate in Russian language), no translation was available for the measures used in the study. These measures were translated and adapted to Russian language and culture by our research group by using the standard translation or bask-translation procedure. During this procedure, we ensured to reach semantic, idiomatic, and conceptual equivalence between the original English and final Russian versions.</p><p>Although, without a validation study, we cannot be completely sure that these instruments fully fit the socioeconomic characteristics of Siberia, we believe that the standard procedure adopted to translate these instruments provided reliable results. This should be considered as the limitation of the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Validity of the System Usability Scale</title><p>Two questions were excluded from the SUS because in the pretest of the prefinal version of the scale (during the translation or back-translation procedure), older adults found it difficult to understand them (&#x0201c;I found the various functions in this system were well integrated&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;I thought there was too much inconsistency in this system&#x0201d;). Therefore, whereas in the original scale the total SUS score ranged from 0 to 100, in our study it ranged from 0 to 80. This is a limitation of our study and could make it difficult to interpret the usability results. However, it is worth noting that no usability scale suitable for older adults existed in Russian language, and our study provides the first adaptation for this culture. Future studies should investigate the validity of this short version of the SUS.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The results point to the feasibility and effectiveness of technology-supported physical interventions, and in particular, of online group exercising among Siberian older adults. High cohesion groups are preferable for group exercising, especially to mitigate effects of low social support on adherence. Cultural differences might explain the preference of private messages over public ones. Results in terms of subjective well-being are promising, but enabling interaction has proved not to be enough to observe a decrease in loneliness. Thus, further research is needed to understand how to better enable community-building interactions.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The study and data collection was supported by the project &#x0201c;Evaluation and enhancement of social, economic and emotional wellbeing of older adults&#x0201d; under the agreement No.14.Z50.31.0029, Tomsk Polytechnic University.
