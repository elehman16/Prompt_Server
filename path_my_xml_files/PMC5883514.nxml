Furthermore, psychological interventions have not been systematically integrated into cardiac rehabilitation services despite being a strategic priority for the UK National Health Service. A promising new treatment, metacognitive therapy, may be well-suited to the needs of cardiac rehabilitation patients and has the potential to improve outcomes. It is based on the metacognitive model, which proposes that a thinking style dominated by rumination, worry and threat monitoring maintains emotional distress. Metacognitive therapy is highly effective at reducing this thinking style and alleviating anxiety and depression in mental health settings. This trial aims to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of group-based metacognitive therapy for cardiac rehabilitation patients with elevated anxiety and/or depressive symptoms.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p id="Par2">The PATHWAY Group-MCT trial is a multicentre, two-arm, single-blind, randomised controlled trial comparing the clinical- and cost-effectiveness of group-based metacognitive therapy plus usual cardiac rehabilitation to usual cardiac rehabilitation alone. Cardiac rehabilitation patients (target sample <italic>n</italic> = 332) with elevated anxiety and/or depressive symptoms will be recruited across five UK National Health Service Trusts. Participants randomised to the intervention arm will receive six weekly sessions of group-based metacognitive therapy delivered by either cardiac rehabilitation professionals or research nurses. The intervention and control groups will both be offered the usual cardiac rehabilitation programme within their Trust. The primary outcome is severity of anxiety and depressive symptoms at 4-month follow-up measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale total score. Secondary outcomes are severity of anxiety/depression at 12-month follow-up, health-related quality of life, severity of post-traumatic stress symptoms and strength of metacognitive beliefs at 4- and 12-month follow-up. Qualitative interviews will help to develop an account of barriers and enablers to the effectiveness of the intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">This trial will evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of group-based metacognitive therapy in alleviating anxiety and depression in cardiac rehabilitation patients.

Approximately 96,000 patients attend CR annually in the UK across 324 CR programmes at an annual total cost of approximately &#x000a3;42 million [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Emotional distress is highly prevalent among CR patients. National CR data demonstrate that 37% of patients starting CR have clinically significant levels of anxiety and/or depressive symptoms and 40% of these patients have mixed anxiety and depression, which further increases the burden of distress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Post-traumatic stress disorder is also common with 12% of acute coronary syndrome patients developing this disorder following hospitalisation with a myocardial infarction or unstable angina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par18">Distressed patients are at greater risk of death and further cardiac events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], have a poorer quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], and use more healthcare resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], leading to greater National Health Service (NHS) costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Distress can also delay or prevent patients returning to work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Therefore, emotional distress is a significant problem for CR patients, the NHS and society.</p><p id="Par19">In 2010, the UK Department of Health implemented the CR commissioning pack to improve CR services. The pack details a comprehensive service specification with a seven-stage care pathway from patient presentation, referral and assessment through to long-term maintenance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Although psychological assessment and support are advocated throughout this pathway and in other key NHS policies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], CR patients with anxiety and depression are not being effectively treated; indeed, only 19% of group CR programmes include a psychological component, 2% of patients receive individual psychological interventions, and no manualised psychological interventions for depression and/or anxiety are available for general use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Following CR, 24% of patients still have elevated anxiety and 13% have depressive symptoms, with rates rising to 26% and 16%, respectively, 9 months later [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Pharmacological and psychological treatments that have been evaluated in these patients have limited effects on psychological outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], and no improvement in cardiovascular outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Given the limitations of existing treatments and CR services, it is imperative that effective psychological interventions for depression and anxiety are developed and integrated into the CR pathway to improve clinical outcomes, patient quality of life and cost-effectiveness.</p><p id="Par20">An evidence-based model from mental health &#x02013; the metacognitive model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] &#x02013; provides the basis for a potentially effective and practicable treatment for depression and anxiety in CR patients. In this model, a maladaptive style of thinking and coping maintains symptoms across a wide range of emotional problems, including depression and anxiety. The model comprises three processes, namely (1) repetitive, difficult-to-control thinking (worry and/or rumination), (2) focusing attention on potential threats (e.g. thoughts, physical sensations, emotions), and (3) maladaptive attempts to control unwanted thoughts (e.g. avoidance, reassurance-seeking, alcohol/substance misuse). These metacognitive processes are maintained by two types of underlying metacognitive beliefs, specifically (1) positive beliefs about the usefulness of worry, rumination, threat monitoring and other coping strategies (e.g. &#x0201c;Worrying about my health will help prevent future illness&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;Constantly focusing on my body helps to keep me safe&#x0201d;) and (2) negative beliefs about the uncontrollability of thoughts and their damaging effects on the body and mind (e.g. &#x0201c;I cannot control my rumination&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;Worry will damage my health&#x0201d;). The metacognitive model is transdiagnostic, wherein a small number of processes and beliefs maintain all forms of emotional distress. Consistent with this model, the same processes and beliefs are associated with depression and anxiety in patients with a diverse range of physical health conditions, including heart disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p id="Par21">Metacognitive therapy (MCT) modifies the processes and beliefs that maintain distress using a range of well-specified strategies and techniques (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] for treatment manual). In mental health settings, MCT for depression and anxiety disorders has been evaluated in case series, as well as in uncontrolled and controlled trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. A recent meta-analysis found MCT to be highly effective in treating depression and anxiety disorders. Large within-group effect sizes were found across all trials from pre- to post-treatment, with treatment gains maintained at follow-up. In controlled trials, treatment gains following MCT were large when compared to wait-list controls and cognitive behaviour therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p><p id="Par22">There are three main reasons why MCT should generalise to heart disease patients. First, as the metacognitive model is transdiagnostic, disparate symptoms of distress are addressed with the same core treatment strategies; this makes it particularly well-suited to heart disease patients who often have mixed anxiety and depression. Second, the same strategies are used to treat distress irrespective of medical diagnosis, which makes it compatible with a CR pathway design, where a range of heart disease patients undertake the same CR programmes and where 80% of patients have at least one other long-term condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Finally, MCT focuses on modifying cognitive <italic>processes</italic> (e.g. reducing worry duration) rather than on cognitive <italic>content</italic> (e.g. reality testing worries), which is the focus of cognitive behaviour therapy. Therefore, it is amenable to working with the realistic negative thoughts that often occur in the context of heart disease, e.g. thoughts about the possibility of recurrent cardiac events and the functional limitations associated with poor physical health.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Aims</title><p id="Par23">The primary aim of the PATHWAY Group-MCT trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of group-based MCT (Group-MCT) plus usual CR compared to usual CR alone in alleviating depression and/or anxiety in patients attending CR. Secondary aims are (1) to evaluate the impact of Group-MCT on secondary outcomes including post-traumatic stress, metacognitive beliefs, and HRQoL, (2) to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of Group-MCT, and (3) to obtain qualitative data to develop an account of the barriers and enablers to the trial and to the intervention, and to interpret evidence of effectiveness, including processes that might underpin or compromise effectiveness or explain its heterogeneity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Design</title><p id="Par24">The PATHWAY Group-MCT trial is a multicentre, two-arm, single-blind randomised controlled trial with 4- and 12-month follow-up comparing Group-MCT plus usual CR with usual CR alone.

The therapists will be guided by a treatment manual to maximise treatment adherence. The aim is to deliver the intervention to groups of between three and ten participants, but this will vary depending on recruitment and attrition rates. The aims of the intervention are to help participants develop knowledge that can facilitate control of worry, rumination and attention, and to modify the metacognitive beliefs that maintain these unhelpful patterns of thinking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. There are eight major treatment techniques that will be used across the six sessions, namely (1) formulation, (2) socialisation, (3) the Spatial Attentional Control Exercise, (4) detached mindfulness, (5) worry and rumination postponement, (6) modifying metacognitive beliefs about the uncontrollability and danger of worry and rumination, (7) a &#x02018;helpful behaviours prescription&#x02019;, and (8) individual treatment summaries. Sessions include group discussions, experiential learning and homework tasks that participants will be expected to complete between sessions. Participants will complete a set of &#x02018;belief thermometers&#x02019; at the start of each session, which measure three core metacognitive beliefs.
