Here we test whether PA is associated with altered prefrontal monitoring functions that could adjust nociceptive processing to a mismatch between expected and experienced pain. We recorded event-related potentials to response errors in a go/nogo task during placebo vs. a matched control condition. Error commission was associated with two well-described components, the error-related negativity (ERN) and the error positivity (Pe). Results show that the Pe, but not the ERN, was amplified during placebo analgesia compared to the control condition, with neural sources in the lateral and medial PFC. This Pe increase was driven by participants showing a placebo-induced change in pain tolerance, but was absent in the group of non-responders. Our results shed new light on the possible functional mechanisms underlying PA, suggesting a placebo-induced transient change in prefrontal error monitoring and control functions.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>LK was supported by the NCCR Affective Sciences financed by the Swiss National Science Foundation (n&#x000b0; 51NF40-104897) and hosted by the University of Geneva, as well as a travel stipend from the Network of European Neuroscience Schools (NENS).

During the last decade, advances have been made in understanding the neurophysiological mechanisms and psychological processes underlying the generation and maintenance of PA.

However, thus far there is no conclusive evidence regarding the <italic>functional</italic> role of these prefrontal areas in PA <xref rid="pone.0049784-Buhle1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Several authors have suggested that LPFC activations during PA reflect a recruitment of cognitive control mechanisms that could in turn trigger opioidergic changes in the descending pain inhibitory system (e.g. <xref rid="pone.0049784-Wager1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049784-Buhle1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049784-Benedetti1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049784-Petrovic2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049784-Krummenacher1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>). Here we address the question of whether PA could be intertwined with a key function of prefrontal cognitive control networks, namely error processing.</p><p>In line with this hypothesis, previous research has shown that the expectation of pain relief is crucial for the implementation of the analgesic response <xref rid="pone.0049784-Benedetti1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. In their seminal study, Wager et al. <xref rid="pone.0049784-Wager1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> reported enhanced activations in LPFC and MPFC, along with orbitofrontal regions during the anticipation of immediate pain administration under PA. Remarkably, brain activity in these cognitive control regions, including LPFC, MPFC, and parietal regions, predicted inter-individual differences in placebo responses <xref rid="pone.0049784-Wager2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Further, transient and reversible inhibition of LPFC by means of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) was found to prevent PA, suggesting a causal role of this cognitive control region for the implementation of placebo analgesia <xref rid="pone.0049784-Krummenacher1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.</p><p>We reasoned that the functional role of prefrontal cognitive control regions such as LPFC and MPFC during maintenance of PA may be related to the monitoring and the regulation of upcoming nociceptive input. During PA, the brain has to adjust to a mismatch between predicted pain and actual nociceptive input (i.e. a prediction error). PA may thus require two complementary processes, which are also crucial for error monitoring, and central to cognitive control in general <xref rid="pone.0049784-Botvinick1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049784-Carter1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049784-Cohen1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>: first, PA probably requires <italic>monitoring</italic> of prediction errors between expected and actual nociceptive signals, and second, subsequent adjustments in top-down <italic>control</italic> of neural processing (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0049784-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). Strikingly, the specific brain regions showing enhanced activation during placebo analgesia, most notably medial and lateral PFC areas, were previously associated with these particular functions (e.g. <xref rid="pone.0049784-Ridderinkhof1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>). Several influential theoretical accounts of cognitive control converge in their proposition that MPFC is crucial for the monitoring of conflicts, prediction errors, and other negative or at least surprising events that require adjustments in cognitive control <xref rid="pone.0049784-Botvinick1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049784-Ridderinkhof1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049784-Carter2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049784-Holroyd1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049784-Ridderinkhof2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049784-Shackman1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049784-Hayden1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.

In light of this model, we reasoned that if the implementation of PA depends on the same prefrontal brain mechanisms as more general control processes, then PA may in turn also exert influences on error processing brain processes (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0049784-g001">Fig. 1</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0049784-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0049784.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Conceptualizing placebo analgesia (PA) and error monitoring (EM) in a common cognitive control framework.</title><p>Both EM and PA require the detection of conflicts or prediction errors, and subsequent adjustments in cognitive processing.

The goal of our study was to test whether PA may be associated with specific changes in the aforementioned monitoring processes. On the one hand, one may hypothesize that PA may <italic>decrease</italic> error-related brain responses, as they are generated by mediofrontal mechanisms that may also be sensitive to negative affect, pain, and &#x02013;more generally&#x02013; need for control <xref rid="pone.0049784-Shackman1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Yet, it has been shown that the effects of PA are usually quite selective regarding the specific instructions about the treatment effects. For example, only the hand upon which &#x0201c;analgesic&#x0201d; cream is applied showed reduced pain sensitivity and was associated with reduced ACC activity, but not so for the opposing hand <xref rid="pone.0049784-Wager1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Therefore, it appears unlikely that PA reduces negative affect in general &#x02013; unless participants were directly instructed that this is what the treatment does (see e.g. <xref rid="pone.0049784-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>).</p><p>Alternatively, we predict that PA <italic>amplifies</italic> error-related brain potentials during the expectation of analgesic effects. This hypothesis is based on accumulating evidence showing that <italic>increased</italic> activity in medial and lateral prefrontal areas, which are crucial for cognitive control and regulation of emotion, is predictive for the installation of analgesic effects <xref rid="pone.0049784-Wager1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049784-Buhle1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049784-Benedetti1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049784-Krummenacher1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049784-Wager2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.</p><p>Participants were tested using a randomized cross-over within-subject design. They were led to believe that a single (inert) dose of a capsule ingested at the beginning of the experiment was either a reliable painkiller (placebo condition) or an ineffective pill (control condition). Pain threshold and tolerance were measured at the beginning and at the end of each experimental session to quantify the individual placebo response to a standard thermal pain administration on the forearm. During the experimental session, 64-channel EEG was recorded while participants performed a speeded go/nogo task and occasionally committed unwanted response errors (i.e. false alarms on nogo stimuli). This enabled us to characterize error-related brain activities during PA versus a perfectly matched control condition, using a within-subject design. Based on the hypothesis that common brain areas underlie both PA and error monitoring (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0049784-g001">Fig. 1</xref>), we predicted that PA would have an amplifying effect on these ERP components specifically related to error detection.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Participants</title><p>Twenty healthy undergraduates from Ghent University (14 women; all right-handed as determined by self-report; mean age 21.2 years; range 18&#x02013;31) participated in two experimental sessions (placebo and control), both taking place at the same time on two consecutive days. Session order was counterbalanced across participants. In order to enhance the plausibility of the cover story, the experimenter was wearing a white medical coat and conducted a brief interview at the beginning of the first session, in which participants were thoroughly screened for any history of serious physical, mental, or neurological illness, for pain-related disorders, allergies, and current medication. Two female participants had to be excluded from the analysis, one because she did not believe in the cover story used to induce PA, and another for reporting that she did not experience any temperature increase during thermal pain stimulation. Accordingly, the final sample contained 18 na&#x000ef;ve participants.

In the remaining third of trials (nogo), the arrow turned either cyan (instead of green) or turned green, but changed direction (relative to the black arrow), indicating participants had to withhold their response.

In a further four trials, participants were requested to button press to indicate the point at which the pain became unbearable (pain tolerance measure). For each time point, both pain threshold and pain tolerance were calculated as the average temperature across the four trials. The net placebo effect upon threshold and tolerance was quantified as the difference between the differences (interaction term) of the temperatures in T3 versus T1 between placebo and control condition (T1<sub>Placebo</sub>&#x02013;T3<sub> Placebo</sub>)&#x02013;(T1<sub> Control</sub>&#x02013;T3<sub> Control</sub>).

Previous studies have demonstrated that prefrontal areas (especially DLPFC and MPFC) are crucial for the installation of the analgesic response <xref rid="pone.0049784-Meissner1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049784-Krummenacher1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049784-Wager2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, but so far their functional role in PA remains unclear (cf. <xref rid="pone.0049784-Buhle1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>). In order to test the assumption that PA could involve a recruitment of mechanisms similar to those employed in error monitoring, we compared error-related ERPs during PA versus a properly matched control condition, using a cross-over within-subject design.</p><p>Our results demonstrate for the first time that PA is related to altered error monitoring brain processes at the level of the Pe component. Importantly, additional analyses confirmed that this PA-dependent effect upon the Pe was primarily driven by those participants who actually showed a placebo effect (increased pain tolerance), providing additional evidence that the Pe increase was linked to the analgesic effect of our manipulation. Remarkably, source reconstructions obtained using sLORETA confirmed that this effect was likely caused by increased activation of specific medial frontal as well as lateral prefrontal regions, which have classically been associated with adaptive control brain mechanisms <xref rid="pone.0049784-Botvinick1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049784-Ridderinkhof1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> and more recently with adjustments to social norms and expectations <xref rid="pone.0049784-Klucharev1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049784-Koban3" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049784-Chang1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049784-Montague1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, but have also been demonstrated to be crucial for PA <xref rid="pone.0049784-Meissner1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049784-Wager1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049784-Krummenacher1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049784-Wager2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.</p><p>Further, the ERP results suggest that the effects of PA are error-specific. Whereas the processing of correct actions (i.e. fast hits) was not influenced, neurophysiological responses to response errors were modulated by PA. Moreover, only the Pe component, and not the preceding ERN component, was reliably enhanced during PA. An additional analysis, in which we directly compared the GFP peaks of these two components (cf. <xref rid="pone.0049784-Shackman2" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>) did not yield a significant interaction effect between component (i.e. ERN versus Pe) and experimental condition. Hence, we cannot exclude the possibility that PA might also influence conflict or error processing at the level of the ERN. Whereas the ERN probably indexes an initial automatic stage of prediction error or motor mismatch detection in dMFC <xref rid="pone.0049784-Botvinick1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049784-Holroyd1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049784-Ullsperger1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049784-VanVeen1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>, the Pe has been related to later stages of error processing, leading to error awareness and subsequent adaptive changes in behavior <xref rid="pone.0049784-Overbeek1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049784-Dhar1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049784-Ullsperger1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Consistent with this framework, it has been argued that the Pe component reflects context updating, thus swiftly signaling error salience and the need for adjustments in cognitive control <xref rid="pone.0049784-Falkenstein2" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049784-Overbeek1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049784-Ridderinkhof3" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Accordingly, our novel results of a Pe- effect suggest that PA may induce a transient change in the reactivity of cognitive control networks. These networks are probably necessary in order to adjust to a mismatch between predicted and experienced pain (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0049784-g001">Fig. 1</xref>) <xref rid="pone.0049784-Allan1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>, to modulate nociception by top-down reappraisal, and to influence opioidergic antinociceptive pathways <xref rid="pone.0049784-Wager1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049784-Petrovic2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049784-Krummenacher1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049784-Watson1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. This transient increase in top-down cognitive control mechanisms could be general enough to modulate the processing of other events requiring enhanced cognitive control and top-down regulatory adjustments, such as response errors. Our findings also indirectly suggest that PA may depend on an altered balance between top-down expectations and bottom-up nociceptive processing. In line with this reasoning, a recent study <xref rid="pone.0049784-Morton1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref> demonstrated that individual differences in a cognitive style of biases towards prior expectations were related to differences in placebo responsiveness. Furthermore, we also note the tight overlap between the source reconstructions underlying the Pe effect in LPFC and previous fMRI activations found in the exact same regions that actually predicted inter-individual differences in placebo responsiveness <xref rid="pone.0049784-Wager1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049784-Wager2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.</p><p>These changes in cognitive control processes during PA may be relatively specific to adjustments following mismatch detection, or alternatively, to events requiring emotion regulation <xref rid="pone.0049784-Wager2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>: A recent study combined placebo expectation with a working memory task in order to test directly whether PA interferes with executive attention resources <xref rid="pone.0049784-Buhle1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Results showed additive, not interacting, effects of working memory load and placebo expectation on analgesia, suggesting that executive functions recruited during working memory are probably not directly involved in maintaining PA <xref rid="pone.0049784-Buhle1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Consistent with this study, we did not find any differences in behavioral performance during placebo compared to the control condition. On the other hand, the use of an adaptive response deadline might have prevented strong differences in behavioral indices of performance monitoring across the two conditions. However, this procedure was an important prerequisite in order to obtain a balanced number of errors (and hence ERP averages) between sessions. More generally, it is also conceivable that the PA-dependent Pe increase seen here indicates differences in affective error appraisal <xref rid="pone.0049784-Ullsperger1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049784-Ridderinkhof3" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, rather than adjustments in attention or effort. This interpretation would be in line with the notion that PA is mediated by brain regions involved in the regulation of emotion <xref rid="pone.0049784-Wager2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.</p><p>Our results, showing a modulation of error monitoring by expectation of pain relief, add to accumulating evidence of the importance of prefrontal control mechanisms for placebo effects. To the best of our knowledge, the present ERP results give a first hint on their functional role: PA may in part depend on domain-general cognitive control mechanisms that subsume error processing, mismatch detection, and subsequent adjustments in cognitive and emotional control (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0049784-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). Future studies are needed to investigate whether the modulation of adaptive control functions induced by PA could also be observed in emotion regulation or conflict-resolution tasks other than error monitoring, and to characterize the role of individual and social expectations in PA.</p><p>Further, more research is needed to establish whether the observed link between error monitoring and placebo analgesia can also be shown in a more general population or alternatively in clinical settings, where pain experience or relief expectations may be altered. Given the relatively low spatial resolution of electrophysiological source estimation and the use of conventional (uncorrected) statistical thresholds in our sLORETA analysis, we also suggest that future studies should employ fMRI (ideally in combination with scalp EEG measurements) in order to investigate the neuroanatomical substrates of PA-mediated effects on error monitoring processes in more detail.</p><p>These findings also underscore the malleability of early error and performance monitoring brain processes. They show that these mechanisms are not only influenced by trait-like emotional or motivational factors <xref rid="pone.0049784-Aarts1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049784-Hajcak1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>, but also by contextual or state-dependent changes in expectancies or beliefs. Psychosocial contextual factors such as expectation of pain relief may impose powerful modulations upon prefrontal cognitive control networks. As such, our results suggest that beyond environmental, genetic, or neuroanatomical differences, cognitive control and error monitoring brain processes are also readily shaped by intra-individual variations concerning abstract beliefs or social expectations.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>LK gratefully acknowledges her advisor Patrik Vuilleumier for continuous support and encouragement.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0049784-Colloca1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
