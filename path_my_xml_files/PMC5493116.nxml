In October 2015, the American Academy of Pediatrics urged physicians to screen children for food insecurity in recognition of the adverse health outcomes associated with inadequate access to food [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. American Indian families may be particularly vulnerable, as they experience higher rates of factors associated with food insecurity, including poverty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], limited access to healthy foods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and decreased food sovereignty (i.e., &#x0201c;community-level food security&#x0201d;, which includes access to culturally appropriate food [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]). Data on food insecurity in American Indian families are lacking in national datasets, but food insecurity rates as high as 75% have been reported in smaller studies of tribal communities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. To date, most studies of food security among American Indian families have been tribe or reservation based studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] or studies of indigenous populations in other countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, rates of food insecurity are known to differ between urban and rural areas in the general US population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], and ~78% of people who identify as American Indian report living outside of tribal-designated areas, which are predominately rural [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Therefore, it is imperative to consider differences that may exist in food insecurity among American Indians in urban and rural settings.</p><p id="Par16">The presence of food insecurity may impact not only the quantity of available food but also diet intake patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], with some evidence of this relationship in older American Indian children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, no studies to date have examined the relationship between household food insecurity and dietary intake in American Indian adults or in very young American Indian children, particularly within the same household. We sought to address these important gaps in the literature by evaluating the prevalence of food insecurity among American Indian households from both rural and urban communities and examining the association of food insecurity with diet patterns of both adults and young children (2&#x02013;5&#x000a0;years) concurrently in these households. These data were collected as part of the Healthy Children Strong Families 2 (HCSF2) randomized controlled trial of a healthy lifestyle intervention for American Indian families nationwide. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] We sought to address three main research questions:<list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>i.</label><p id="Par17">What is the prevalence of food insecurity in American Indian households, and how did this differ by urban-rural status?</p></list-item><list-item><label>ii.</label><p id="Par18">What are the correlates of food insecurity in American Indian households?</p></list-item><list-item><label>iii.</label><p id="Par19">What is the relationship between food insecurity and diet in these households?</p></list-item></list>

The primary objective of HCSF2 is to determine the efficacy of a wellness toolkit in preventing and reducing obesity among American Indian primary caregivers and their children (ages 2&#x02013;5&#x000a0;years). Senior members of the research team approached communities with whom they had previously worked or where they had close relationships with community members or wellness staff to participate as HCSF2 study sites. Participant inclusion criteria included enrolling a child between the ages of 2 and 5&#x000a0;years and a primary caregiver (e.g., mother, father, grandparent), the ability to travel to the local data collection site for study visits, and a valid mailing address. Exclusion criteria were minimal due to the communities&#x02019; value for inclusion in community programs and projects. Caregivers provided written informed consent for both themselves and the participating child, and human subjects approval was granted through the University of Wisconsin Institutional Review Board (protocol 2012&#x02013;0578) and tribal institutional review boards, when requested by tribal administration. Data reported here were collected during the baseline visit for HCSF2, prior to starting the 2-year intervention.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Measures</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Medical history</title><p id="Par21">A self-administered 40-item medical history survey was used to collect information on age, sex, ethnicity, education, household size, income, use of food assistance programs (e.g., WIC, school lunch program), and questions related to chronic disease risk. Adults also provided information on child age, sex, ethnicity, and other demographic factors (e.g., child birthweight). This survey was developed by the study team and has been used previously in this population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Food insecurity</title><p id="Par22">Food insecurity was assessed using two items from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) 18-item Household Food Security Survey: &#x0201c;<italic>Within the past 12 months we were worried whether our food would run out before we got money to buy more</italic>&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;<italic>Within the past 12 months the food we bought just didn&#x02019;t last and we didn&#x02019;t have money to get more</italic>&#x0201d;. An affirmative answer to either of these two questions indicates food insecurity with 97% sensitivity and 83% specificity, and the use of these two questions has been validated against the full survey for households with young children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The two-question survey was chosen to minimize participant burden due to the number of measures and time to complete all the questionnaires included in the larger obesity prevention intervention trial. An additional question was added as a proxy measure to assess distance to stores (<italic>How far do you go to obtain food?</italic>) as an additional variable related to food access, which may impact the ability of a household to obtain adequate food.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Dietary intake</title><p id="Par23">A validated diet screener based on the Dietary Screener Questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] used in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2009&#x02013;2010) was used for adults, and the validated child dietary screener based on questions contained in the 2010 National Youth Physical Activity and Nutrition Survey (documentation at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/yrbs/nypans.htm)">http://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/yrbs/nypans.htm)</ext-link> was used for children. For both screeners, questions asked about intake over the previous 7 days in the following categories: fruit, vegetables, salad, potatoes, fried potatoes, pizza, 100% juice, soda, other sugar sweetened beverages (e.g., lemonade, sweetened tea, fruit punch, Kool-Aid), and milk.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Anthropometrics</title><p id="Par24">An electronic scale measured weight (Tanita Model BWB-800S, Tanita, Inc., Chicago, IL), which was assessed without shoes and in light clothing to the nearest 0.1&#x000a0;kg. Height was measured with a portable stadiometer to the nearest 0.1 cm (Seca Model 217, Seca, Inc., Hanover, MD). The average of two measurements was used for height and weight. Children&#x02019;s heights and weights were converted to body mass index (BMI) percentiles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], and adult BMI was calculated as kg/m<sup>2</sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Focus groups</title><p id="Par25">Focus groups were conducted by trained staff at sites that had completed the intervention to expand our understanding of how geography and other social factors affect food insecurity for participating families and to discuss coping strategies employed by families. Focus group participants were recruited by mailed invitation letters from among participants who had completed the HCSF2 intervention, and 5&#x02013;7 participants were recruited for each session. A topic guide was developed to ensure consistency among focus group facilitators and included questions (e.g., <italic>Do people in the community share food when there are others in need?</italic>) and follow-up probes (e.g., <italic>How does that work?</italic>). Topics included food access, food sharing practices, use of food assistance, and other strategies for obtaining adequate food. Data were audio recorded and transcribed by a transcription service and were supplemented by research staff notes taken during each session. Major themes were determined by inductive methods by three independent trained research staff.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="Par26">Descriptive statistics were used to estimate prevalence of food insecurity in our sample overall and by urban and rural status. Differences in household and adult and child characteristics between the urban and rural geographic regions were assessed using Fisher&#x02019;s exact/chi-square tests and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests for dichotomous, ordinal and nominal categorical, and measurement data, respectively. Predictors of food insecurity were assessed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression models. Predictors included in the multivariate models were ethnicity, caregiver age, educational level, geographic designation (rural vs. urban), number of adults in household (single adult household vs. more than one adult), number of children in the household, work outside the home (yes vs. no), and WIC participation. Factors were included in the multivariate analysis if there was evidence of an association with food insecurity status in the univariate analyses (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x02264;&#x000a0;0.10) or the factors have been shown to be associated with food insecurity status in the literature (e.g. single adult household and number of children in the household). Weight status was not significantly associated with food insecurity status and therefore was not included in the model. Separate models then were run for urban and rural households that additionally included distance traveled to store. This variable was not included in the overall model as it was highly correlated with geographic designation. Daily intake frequencies of food items were calculated from adult and child diet screeners. Intake frequencies between food secure and insecure participants were compared using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests and are summarized using medians and interquartile ranges. For the logistic regression analysis results, odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals are presented. A significance level of 0.05 was used for all analyses without adjustment for multiplicity of testing. All analyses were conducted using STATA 14 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA) and validated using SAS 9.4 (SAS Inc., Cary, NC, USA).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>Prevalence of food insecurity</title><p id="Par27">In total, 450 adult-child dyads from five participating communities (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;240 rural households; <italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;210 urban households) were enrolled.

Participants reported coping strategies employed during times of food insecurity, such as use of food assistance programs and relying on family members to supplement meals. Participants reported some intergenerational living or child care arrangements, which blunted some food insecurity through pooled resources but introduced a loss of parental control over some feeding choices. Some geographic differences in coping strategies were noted. For example, urban families with greater access to food outlets reported shopping frequently (every day or every other day), which resulted in spending more on food than planned. Rural families reported infrequent food purchasing trips, which often resulted in the purchase of fewer fresh fruits and vegetables. Rural families also reported using hunting, gathering, and sharing practices (e.g., hunting deer, harvesting wild rice) and individual/community gardens to supplement their diet.

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par32">An extremely high prevalence of food insecurity was identified among the American Indian households included in this study, and the proportion of households self-reporting food insecurity was significantly different between rural and urban households. These findings are significant as this is the first study of food insecurity to include both urban and rural American Indian families and to examine adults and children concurrently. Our analysis suggested identification as American Indian, urban households, lower educational levels, single adult households, and participation in WIC as factors that are associated with the increased odds for food insecurity. Moreover, differences in dietary intake patterns of both adults and children were identified between food insecure and secure households, suggesting the food insecurity negatively impacts dietary quality for these families. Different coping strategies were reported by rural and urban families that provide context to the quantitative findings.</p><p id="Par33">The prevalence of food insecurity was significantly higher among urban households compared to their rural counterparts, which is of particular importance, as the majority of people who identify as American Indian report living outside of tribal-designated areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Two previous studies included urban American Indians in their sample, and neither found differences in food security between urban and rural participants. Gundersen examined a national sample of American Indian households (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1143) included in the 2001&#x02013;2004 Core Food Security Module of the Current Population Survey and reported no interaction between food insecurity and geographic designation (i.e., rural or urban) for households with children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The author did suggest these results were counterintuitive, as protective factors are known to exist within rural or reservation-based communities, including increased social capital [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and food sharing practices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. However, the extent to which these conditions may have contributed to the lower food insecurity in the rural communities in our study is unclear. Jernigan et al. examined food insecurity in a sample of low-income American Indians in California [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Of note, their study population was approximately half male and half Hispanic. In comparison, our sample included a full range of incomes, almost all females (~95%), and less than 10% Hispanic participants, and these demographic differences may have contributed to the differences in our findings.</p><p id="Par34">Our analyses did suggest differences between rural and urban households with regard to factors associated with a higher risk of food insecurity. Namely, single adult households, lower educational attainment, and working outside of the home were associated with a high prevalence of food insecurity in rural households, while only the distance traveled to purchase food and the number of children in the household were associated factors in urban households. Our findings align with previous reports suggesting that identification as American Indian [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], not being employed outside of the home [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], low education [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and number of children in the household [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] are associated with a high prevalence of food insecurity in American Indian communities; findings related to the relationship between food security and participation in food assistance programs for American Indian have been conflicting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. As for distance traveled to purchase food, Mullany et al. demonstrated that households with transportation barriers were more likely to be food insecure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], which may partially explain why increasing distance traveled to purchase food was associated with lower odds of food insecurity among urban households. In other words, these households may have more resources to travel greater distances to access food at lower cost, such as at Wal-Mart&#x000ae;, rather than relying on convenience stores and small markets where prices are typically much greater and the availability of fresh foods is limited.</p><p id="Par35">Our findings demonstrated significant differences in dietary intake between food secure and insecure households for both American Indian adults and children. Bauer et al. found American Indian children (ages 5&#x02013;6&#x000a0;years) from a rural reservation who were food insecure consumed more hot or ready-made food from convenience stores, including higher intake of pizza and fried chicken [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Adult diet was not considered, and no other studies have examined the relationship between food security status and dietary intake patterns in American Indian families. Moreover, we demonstrated differences among dietary intake for food insecure children compared to food secure children in very young children (2&#x02013;5&#x000a0;years), which have not been previously demonstrated. These findings may be of clinical significance, as the food groups in which we identified differences in dietary intake patterns are known to contribute to obesity, such as high intake of fruit juice, soda, other SSBs, fried potatoes, and lower intake of vegetables. The finding of significantly increased salad intake among insecure children was unexpected, and we are seeking to better understand how adults are defining salad intake for their children.</p><sec id="Sec17"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p id="Par36">This study was strengthened by the inclusion of both urban and rural American Indian households, as the majority of food security studies in American Indian populations to date have included only rural communities or single reservations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. This factor also represents a potential limitation as our data were pooled from multiple, diverse communities. As another strength, our data are contextualized by findings from focus group sessions. For this study, we used only two items of the USDA 18-item Household Food Security Survey, which may have prevented us from capturing more nuanced dimensions of food security and may contribute to differences between our study and existing reports that used different measures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. However, these two particular survey items have been validated specifically in households with young children. The time of year when the food insecurity screener is administered may impact the responses, but this potential limitation likely was mitigated in our study as responses were collected over a 2-year period due to staggered enrollment at study sites. All of the survey measures used in the study were self-report, which may be associated with under- or over-reporting.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Community responses</title><p id="Par37">Many of the communities who participated in this study are currently drawing on traditional culture, strengths, and community resiliency to overcome existing barriers to food security, and we feel it is in alignment with community-based participatory research approaches to address their efforts here. For example, one participating community recently initiated a survey where 73% of respondents viewed hunger as an issue on the reservation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Respondents suggested approaches to address food insecurity, namely, better coordination among programs, greater outreach to children and Elders, more jobs, adoption of a food sovereignty policy by the tribal legislature, and provision of classes (e.g., gardening, harvesting, wild game preparation, canning) and identified existing resources, including community-supported orchards/gardens, food distribution programs, and school-based feeding programs. Another participating rural community supports a strong land reclamation program emphasizing production of traditional foods (e.g., wild rice) in addition to food distribution programs and efforts focused on child and Elder nutrition. For families in the urban community in our study, several resources are provided through the health clinic, such as access to a community garden and food pantry, transportation passes to increase mobility to supermarkets with a broader range of options and prices, and a comprehensive community resource guide (updated monthly). The clinic also provides patient navigation services, including assistance meeting eligibility requirements for food assistance and services specific to American Indian families, such as obtaining a Certificate of Indian Blood and other tribal identification. This identification is needed for access to services like emergency funds provided by some tribes for their citizens living in urban settings, discounts at various Indian-owned businesses, and school-based American Indian-specific programs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par38">Our data suggest food insecurity among American Indian households was extremely high and was significantly higher in urban households. Moreover, less optimal dietary patterns were identified for food insecure families in both urban and rural settings. Interventions to address food insecurity are urgently needed and must consider multiple factors related to food security, such as barriers that may be unique to families in urban settings (e.g., absence of close-knit community) and access to healthy food (e.g., reliance on small markets where prices are higher).</p><p id="Par39">In addition, development of tribal programs and policies to address food insecurity, food sovereignty, and food access may supplement federal-level food assistance strategies; cultural factors unique to American Indian communities should be considered.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>BMI</term><def><p id="Par8">Body mass index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HCSF2</term><def><p id="Par9">Healthy Children, Strong Families 2</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IQR</term><def><p id="Par10">Interquartile range</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OR</term><def><p id="Par11">Odds ratio</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SSB</term><def><p id="Par12">Sugar sweetened beverage</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>USDA</term><def><p id="Par13">United States Department of Agriculture</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WIC</term><def><p id="Par14">Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We gratefully acknowledge all of the families and communities who participated in the Healthy Children Strong Families 2 trial through which these data were collected.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par40">This project was funded by the National Institutes of Health, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute [grant number 1RO1HL114912] to AA.
