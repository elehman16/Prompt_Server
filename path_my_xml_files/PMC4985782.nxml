(Intervention participant 4)</p></disp-quote></p><p>Explanation, support and encouragement to perform exercises unsupervised were also highly valued.<disp-quote><p>If you're left with a sheet of paper to say, do these exercises on a daily basis, I am not likely to be motivated, but if somebody is&#x02026;physically there, saying &#x0201c;Do these, let's do it together&#x0201d;, it's very different.

Intervention participants were also more consistently satisfied (IQR 7.7 vs 9.7&#x02005;cm). In the focus groups, nutritional care was universally perceived as important to recovery, but experiences varied widely among the usual care group.<disp-quote><p>She (dietitian) checked what I was eating&#x02026;She said you could do with a wee (little) bit more of such and such, so she arranged to have that wee bowl of fruit or something. (Usual care participant 5)</p></disp-quote></p><p>Several participants, however, felt that nursing staff were too busy to physically help them eat or deliver prescribed supplements.<disp-quote><p>Nobody was interested. I was actually taking him (husband) in flasks of porridge to try and encourage him to eat&#x02026;I was actually spoon feeding him&#x02026;he was so weak, it was like there was nobody there to do this. (Usual care patient's wife 2)</p></disp-quote></p><p>Intervention participants, in contrast, valued the RAs' physical assistance with eating (including nutritional supplements) and support to achieve prescribed nutritional targets, using individualised feedback. Also valued was their advocacy in relaying dietary concerns to relevant ward-based clinicians.<disp-quote><p>I managed to say, &#x0201c;(RA), I can't manage this (high protein supplement)&#x0201d;. Can you speak to (the ward-based Dietitian) about it?

However, for all these domains, the IQR values were wider for the usual care group, notably for the &#x02018;transfer from ICU to the ward&#x02019; (13.2 vs 5.2&#x02005;cm), suggesting wider variation in experience. Responses to &#x02018;being involved in decisions about your care&#x02019; were less positive (usual care 10.0 vs 7.3&#x02005;cm in the intervention group) with wide variation in responses for both groups. The most direct question about case management, &#x02018;organisation and coordination of care&#x02019;, indicated better experience among intervention patients (5.3 vs 7.2&#x02005;cm; p=0.045).</p><p>In the focus groups, clear differences emerged between the groups. Both described a perceived deterioration in the quality of care following transfer to the general wards, which was attributed to staff shortages, high workload and the dependency of other patients.<disp-quote><p>You know the NHS is short staffed, you know that with their resources&#x02026;.but I mean you're giving them all this care in Intensive Care, and after that, it's like you're thrown to the dogs. (Usual care participant's wife 2)</p></disp-quote></p><p>Experiences across both groups were very variable, and seemed dependent on the discharge destination (specific ward). The experience of usual care participants appeared less consistent; several appeared to &#x02018;slip through the net&#x02019;, for example, in terms of pre-discharge assessment and provision of aids and adaptations for community living.<disp-quote><p>Was somebody supposed to come down and assess&#x02026;her needs? If she needed anything adapted&#x02026;needed any kind of equipment or stuff like that? That never happened. (Usual care patient's son, 7)</p></disp-quote></p><p>Usual care participants frequently described the &#x02018;push&#x02019; for hospital discharge, a general lack of involvement in decision-making and communication that was often ambiguous, contradictory and &#x02018;last minute&#x02019;.<disp-quote><p>I think for&#x02026; basically knocking on Death's door, I think the length of time between coming out of Intensive Care and going home is far, far too short. They are in a rush to&#x02026;get people out. (Usual care patient's son, 7)</p></disp-quote></p><p>Usual care participants were also critical of a lack of postdischarge follow-up.<disp-quote><p>I thought we might have been asked to come back for a check-up after so many weeks&#x02026; I've never heard anything about anything like that. (Usual care patient 8)</p></disp-quote></p><p>Intervention participants, in contrast, valued the RA's assistance across multiple roles, including assistance with eating, washing and dressing, coordination of relevant assessments and referrals, and communication of discharge plans. Intervention group participants attributed this support to consistency and continuity of care.<disp-quote><p>Having one person assigned to you, I thought that was marvellous, you know? There was always that one person that you knew you would see almost, probably every day&#x02026;and if you had any worries you could talk to that one person and your worries got to the right source&#x02026;the source that would do something about it. (Intervention patient 3)</p></disp-quote></p><p>Other examples included the coordination of postdischarge support.<disp-quote><p>I felt I was very lucky because the day of my discharge, (the RA) had managed to gather all the things I needed, had managed to secure all the telephone numbers that I might need&#x02026;I didn't have any qualms about going home&#x02026;. (Intervention participant 6)</p></disp-quote></p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Information provision</title><p>Responses to &#x02018;information about what happened in intensive care&#x02019; showed the largest between-group differences, with intervention patients reporting the greatest and usual care patients the lowest satisfaction across all PEQ domains (10.2 vs 3.6&#x02005;cm; p&#x0003c;0.001). In contrast, group responses were similar to &#x02018;knowing what to expect after you got home&#x02019;, with poorer median values than for many domains (intervention group 7.2 vs 10.0&#x02005;cm in the usual care group) and wide variation in satisfaction for both groups. These data suggest that the intervention improved information provision relating to the critical illness episode, but persisting unmet informational need following hospital discharge.</p><p>Focus group data strongly supported these findings. Amnesia, strange dreams and delusional memories were prevalent for all patients, and limited recall of the ICU admission and early post-discharge period was frequently described. Usual care participants frequently felt ill-informed about the circumstances and chronology of events surrounding their ICU admission and relied almost exclusively upon family members for information. This contributed to anxiety around potential recurrence, ill-explained critical illness-related morbidity, the protraction and limits of the recovery process and the long-term implications of critical illness. Several usual care participants attributed greater anxiety to acquiring information from independent sources, such as the internet.<disp-quote><p>I still don't know why I ended up in there (ICU). Well, I know why, but I don't know why I got what I got&#x02026;I worry a lot more about my health than I ever did before, because I've got no idea what started it. I think that's the biggest problem. I went on the internet and looked up&#x02026;the septic shock thing and what that entailed&#x02026;and I wish to God that I hadn't&#x02026;because I felt like I'd just been knocked back about six steps&#x02026;. (Usual care participant 8)</p></disp-quote></p><p>When asked, many agreed that a clear outline of &#x02018;what happened&#x02019; would have been helpful.<disp-quote><p>I think it would have helped me&#x02026;definitely, just to fill in all the blanks. I would like to know what happened with this and what happened with that and&#x02026;but I never got anything like that. (Usual care participant 9)</p></disp-quote></p><p>In marked contrast, intervention participants valued the structured, individualised information they received. The discussion with an ICU physician was generally valued for the opportunity to &#x02018;fill in the blanks&#x02019;, especially reasons for ICU admission and the clinical course. Some focus group participants declined, however, describing their ICU experience as too &#x02018;raw&#x02019; in the early post-ICU period.<disp-quote><p>I think them coming to see you helps to fill that void, you know, because being in Intensive Care, it's almost like you've lost a number of days without knowing what's happening&#x02026;(the ICU Consultant) managed to explain the facts and&#x02026;what you went through&#x02026;why you ended up in Intensive Care. It really did help&#x02026;me to put things in chronological order. (Intervention participant 10)</p></disp-quote></p><p>The individualised lay summary of the ICU admission was valued for its easily understandable explanation, although the terminology used and its occasional receipt by post (after hospital discharge) sometimes caused anxiety, highlighting the value of face-to-face clarification, reassurance and the opportunity to ask questions.<disp-quote><p>Mine was good&#x02026;but I got a wee (little) bit of a fright&#x02026;although I knew I was on the breathing machine, I didn't know that it was&#x02026;called a life support machine and see when I seen it written down&#x02026;! (Intervention participant 11)</p></disp-quote></p><p>When participants accepted the offer of an ICU visit prior to hospital discharge, it was generally valued as an opportunity to make sense of the critical illness episode. However, timing was important, with several focus group participants reporting that their experiences were still &#x02018;too raw&#x02019;. Finally, the therapeutic relationship with the RA appeared to facilitate the sensitive timing and presentation of information in accordance with patients' needs, emotional status and ability to retain information.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>This mixed methods process evaluation provides valuable insights into patient/carer experiences in a complex intervention trial of post-ICU acute hospital rehabilitation. There was substantial concordance between cohort-level questionnaire data and the detailed accounts of focus group participants. Evidence of greater satisfaction with physiotherapy, nutritional care, information provision and coordination of care emerged from both data sources, suggesting that a case-management approach, delivered by a dedicated RA, improved patient experience of post-ICU acute hospital rehabilitation. Furthermore, focus group data revealed the high value intervention participants placed on the individualisation of their care, according to their needs, abilities and preferences.</p><p>Despite evidence of greater satisfaction in the intervention group, we found no statistically or clinically significant between-group differences across functional, physical, psychological and HRQoL outcomes between hospital discharge and 12&#x02005;months follow-up in the trial.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> The discordance between these &#x02018;biomedical&#x02019; outcomes and greater reported patient satisfaction is striking. It is possible that biomedical outcomes are resistant to modification at this stage of recovery,<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> or that they fail to measure &#x02018;what matters&#x02019; to patients during acute hospital-based recovery.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>
<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> The performance of outcome measures also depends on their appropriate selection, their psychometric properties in the population of interest and the timing of data collection in accordance with the delivery of the intervention.</p><p>We note with interest that only one previous study of a post-ICU critical rehabilitation intervention employed qualitative approaches in its evaluation.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> The authors demonstrated that intervention participants not only experienced improvements in objective measures of fitness but also an increased sense of motivation, well-being, achievement and social participation. In the future, such studies would be well advised to incorporate qualitative approaches and process evaluations into trial design to explore patients' experiences of the intervention (including unanticipated benefits and drawbacks) that may not be accessible by existing questionnaires.</p><p>Qualitative studies among other hospitalised patient groups have shown the high value that patients place on the therapeutic or collaborative relationship with rehabilitation staff, flexibility around the timing, content and delivery of rehabilitation and its individualisation according to needs and preferences.<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40&#x02013;42</xref> These issues underpinned the development of the RECOVER intervention, and the PEQ was specifically developed to capture them. Our data provide strong evidence for important effects on these person-centred outcomes. Our evaluation demonstrates the added value that qualitative research can add in RCTs, particularly in the design and conduct of a trial, improving its internal and external validity, facilitating replicability, interpretation and generalisability of findings<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> and here, in exploring the value of individual components of a complex intervention.</p><p>A key finding was the value participants placed on information. The &#x02018;need to know&#x02019; has long been reported in the critical care literature,<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> underpinning various strategies such as ICU discharge summaries,<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> patient diaries,<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46&#x02013;48</xref> follow-up clinics<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>
<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref> and return visits to the ICU.<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref> Our comprehensive, individualised approach was documentary (rehabilitation manual; individualised lay summary), didactic (discussion with ICU physician and the RAs) and experiential (offer of a return visit to the ICU). Qualitative and quantitative data provided strong evidence for the benefit of information, and focus group data uncovered preferences for its timing, content (including terminology) and delivery. These findings support the need for individualised information in routine post-ICU care.</p><p>A particular strength of our process evaluation was consideration of the clinical context in which the intervention took place, and participants' response to and interaction with the intervention. These are recommended when evaluating how or why complex healthcare interventions may (or may not) work.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Our data provide empirical evidence that enhanced access to physiotherapy, nutritional care and information is important to patients during recovery, but highlight a range of preferences and the need for individualised content, delivery and timing. Case management by a dedicated RA was a key &#x02018;active ingredient&#x02019; that facilitated these preferences and seemed to increase engagement in the rehabilitation process, resulting in greater overall perceived benefit. A potential limitation of our findings is the marked differences between the focus group's patient participants in terms of patient age, duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU length of stay.</p><p>Our findings are relevant to future trial design in this patient population. Specifically, trial interventions that use individual adaptation versus standardised or fixed interventions require different approaches to process and effectiveness evaluation.<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>
<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref> We standardised the process and function of the intervention (ie, individualisation and patient engagement in the rehabilitation process, respectively) but not the content, capturing actual differences in treatments received in the process evaluation. This approach is particularly recommended when the &#x02018;real world&#x02019; or clinical context is complex.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> With this perspective, the internal validity of a trial should be defined functionally as well as compositionally.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>
<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref> Our data indicate that concordance between biomedical and person-centred outcomes should not be assumed,<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> highlighting the importance of specific standardised measures (few currently exist) and the use of qualitative approaches to capture the latter.</p><p>Importantly, cost-effectiveness analysis of the RECOVER trial found no incremental cost-effectiveness over the 12&#x02005;months post-randomisation, and no difference in quality-adjusted life years between the groups.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> It is increasingly recognised that HRQoL trajectories are difficult to modify following critical illness, in part because pre-existing comorbidity dominates reported HRQoL during recovery.<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54&#x02013;57</xref> Quality of care, patient satisfaction and &#x02018;person-centeredness&#x02019; are excluded from cost-effectiveness analysis. The use of service models based on multiskilled RAs providing individualised case management is potentially cost-neutral or even cost-saving compared to existing models that require multiple specialists from different disciplines. Our data provide strong evidence that this approach delivers higher quality care from patients' and carers' perspectives and may well justify service redesign. Our model of care has been adopted into routine clinical practice at the main study hospital.</p><p>In conclusion, we have shown that physiotherapy, nutritional care and information are highly valued by patients during post-ICU acute hospital rehabilitation. A rehabilitation strategy coordinated by a dedicated multiskilled RA improved patients' satisfaction with and perceived quality of care, cutting across traditional disciplinary boundaries, ward-level resource constraints and circumventing communication failures. The focus on individualised, coordinated care according to patient ability and preference was highly valued.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors acknowledge Professor Andrew Thompson (University of Edinburgh, Scotland) for his expert advice on the development of the patient experience questionnaire used in this trial.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Twitter:</bold> Follow David Griffith at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://twitter.com/Griffith_DM">@Griffith_DM</ext-link></p></fn><fn><p><bold>Collaborators:</bold> RECOVER collaborators include: Julia A Boyd, Simon J Mackenzie, Ashma Krishan, Stephanie C Lewis, Gordon D Murray, John F Forbes, Joel Smith, Alastair M Hull, Charles Wallis, Joyce Stewart, Anthony Bateman, Elizabeth Wilson, Mike Gillies, Susanne Kean, David Hope, Heidi Dawson, Corrienne McCulloch, Jean Antonelli, Louise Boardman and rehabilitation assistants Leanne Dow, Winchell Williams, Audrey McCann and Sarah Alexander.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> TW, LS, PR, JM and GH designed the trial and completed pilot and feasibility work.
