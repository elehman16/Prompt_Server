Regular cocoa flavanol (CF) intake can improve vascular function in healthy young and elderly at-risk individuals. However, the mechanisms underlying CF bioactivity remain largely unknown. We investigated the effects of CF intake on cardiovascular function in healthy young and elderly individuals without history, signs, or symptoms of cardiovascular disease by applying particular focus on functional endpoints relevant to cardiovascular aging. In a randomized, controlled, double-masked, parallel-group dietary intervention trial, 22 young (&#x0003c;35&#x000a0;years) and 20 elderly (50&#x02013;80&#x000a0;year) healthy, male non-smokers consumed either a CF-containing drink (450&#x000a0;mg CF) or nutrient-matched, CF-free control drink bi-daily for 14&#x000a0;days. The primary endpoint was endothelial function as measured by flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD). Secondary endpoints included cardiac output, vascular stiffness, conductance of conduit and resistance arteries, and perfusion in the microcirculation. Following 2&#x000a0;weeks of CF intake, FMD improved in young (6.1&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.7 vs. 7.6&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.7&#x000a0;%, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001) and elderly (4.9&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.6 vs. 6.3&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.9&#x000a0;%, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001). Secondary outcomes demonstrated in both groups that CF intake decreased pulse wave velocity and lowered total peripheral resistance, and increased arteriolar and microvascular vasodilator capacity, red cell deformability, and diastolic blood pressure, while cardiac output remained affected. In the elderly, baseline systolic blood pressure was elevated, driven by an arterial-stiffness-related augmentation. CF intake decreased aortic augmentation index (&#x02212;9&#x000a0;%) and thus systolic blood pressure (&#x02212;7&#x000a0;mmHg; Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT01639781). CF intake reverses age-related burden of cardiovascular risk in healthy elderly, highlighting the potential of dietary flavanols to maintain cardiovascular health.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Age</kwd><kwd>Blood pressure</kwd><kwd>Arterial stiffness</kwd><kwd>Endothelial function</kwd><kwd>Nutrition</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; American Aging Association 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>The mechanisms underlying vascular aging are largely unknown but involve all segments of the arterial vascular system. Hallmarks of vascular aging are not entirely identical to those of atherosclerosis, but increasing age is associated with endothelial dysfunction and vascular stiffening, as well as isolated systolic hypertension, and a substantial excess of cardiovascular mortality (Kaess et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2012</xref>). Due to increased arterial stiffness, older humans exhibit an increased pulse wave velocity (PWV). In young individuals, the reflected pulse wave returns to the heart and increases pressure during diastole and therefore contributes to the &#x0201c;windkessel effect&#x0201d; (i.e., elastic reservoir) of the aorta. In older individuals, the pulse wave propagates faster as compared to the young, and its return to the heart coincides with the systolic forward flow, thus leading to aortic augmentation of systolic blood pressure (SBP; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Furthermore, stiff arteries are characterized by a decreased absorption of the pulse wave, resulting in increased mechanical stress on the arterioles, which in turn is thought to cause damage to the microvasculature, leading to structural microvascular remodeling and rarefication (Mitchell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2008</xref>). In addition to an increased peripheral total resistance, age-dependently reduced microcirculatory perfusion, systemic endothelial dysfunction, and intimal hyperplasia are observed in elderly subjects (Celermajer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">1994</xref>; Rossi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2002</xref>). There is great interest in dietary interventions to slow or even reverse the complex pattern of these age-associated vascular alterations, which increase cardiovascular risk (Shai et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2010</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>

Cardiac function is determined by heart rate (HR), cardiac output (CO), stroke volume (SV), and total peripheral resistance (TPR); the aorta as an elastic artery is characterized by its physicomechanical properties: central blood pressure (BP), pulse wave velocity (PWV), and augmentation index (AIX); conduit artery function is determined by flow-mediated and nitroglycerin-mediated vasodilation (FMD and NMD, respectively) as well as peripheral blood pressure that can be determined at the upper arm and finger; arteriolar conductance is characterized by forearm blood flow (FBF), cutaneous capillary blood flow by laser Doppler perfusion imaging (LDPI), and blood rheology by red blood cell (RBC) deformability</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="11357_2015_9794_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p>Diet is a major determinant of healthy aging, and certain bioactives may be capable of contributing to the maintenance of health, thus extending a healthy life span (Estruch et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2013</xref>; Williamson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2009</xref>). Flavanols, a subgroup of dietary plant-derived bioactives, have gained increasing attention, as clinical dietary interventions have shown that a higher intake of flavanol-containing foods can increase arterial function in individuals at risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD), and in those with established CVD (Heiss et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2003</xref>; Heiss et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2010b</xref>). Although the mechanisms of action underlying the biological effects of flavanols are not completely understood, flavanols are one of few bioactives today, for which causality between the dietary intake and an improvement in arterial function has been established (Loke et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2008</xref>; Schroeter et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2006</xref>). Whether or not the intake of cocoa flavanol (CF) has the potential to improve cardiovascular function in healthy elderly individuals or to reverse age-related vascular dysfunction has not been specifically evaluated thus far.</p><p>The FLAVIOLA research project, funded by the European Union&#x02019;s 7th framework program, was created to develop the &#x0201c;Targeted delivery of dietary flavanols for optimal human cell function: Effects on cardiovascular health.&#x0201d; In order to understand the hemodynamic mechanisms that underlie the potential CF-intake-mediated reversal of age-associated changes in circulatory function, the present FLAVIOLA AGE study aims at elucidating in great detail the effects of cocoa flavanols in healthy individuals. We therefore studied in young and elderly healthy individuals the effect of a dietary CF intervention on hallmarks of cardiovascular aging in all segments of the cardiovascular system, such as cardiac performance, endothelial dysfunction, increased systolic blood pressure, vascular stiffness, and microcirculatory functions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study participants and study design</title><p>We recruited YOUNG (&#x0003c;35&#x000a0;years) and ELDERLY (50&#x02013;80&#x000a0;year) healthy male Caucasian adult subjects without history, signs, or symptoms indicative of cardiovascular disease, including previous myocardial infarction, stroke, and peripheral artery disease or current or previous medication (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).

CF-intake-associated improvements in the compliance of large arteries were accompanied by a lowered pulse wave velocity and decreased aortic augmentation of systolic blood pressure. Endothelial function in large conduit arteries was significantly improved in healthy young and elderly individuals. These beneficial effects were associated with an improved dilatory capacity of resistance arteries, decreased diastolic blood pressure, and increases in microcirculatory perfusion and red blood cell deformability. These CF-intake-mediated modulations of circulatory function were independent of changes in cardiac performance, since cardiac output was not affected by CF (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>).</p><sec id="Sec24"><title>CF intake improves endothelial function in young and elderly</title><p>Consistent with previous studies in other populations, ELDERLY exhibited significantly decreased endothelium-dependent vasodilation at baseline as compared to YOUNG (Heiss et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2005</xref>).

We observed a significant increase in the maximal forearm blood flow and cutaneous perfusion during reactive hyperemia. This suggests that CF intake may increase not only the dilatory function of conduit arteries but also that of the arterioles. This effect, together with the increased RBC deformability, contributes to the enhanced perfusion of the microcirculation observed following CF intake. Mechanistically, CF-related vascular effects have been linked to an increase in nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity (Del Rio et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2013</xref>; Schroeter et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2006</xref>). RBCs have been demonstrated to express a functional eNOS that may modulate RBC deformability independent of vascular tone (Cortese-Krott et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2012</xref>; Horn et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2011</xref>). Consequently, our current data support the supposition that CF intake improves tissue perfusion, at least in part, by increasing dilatory capacity of arterioles and increasing RBC deformability.</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>The FLAVIOLA AGE study and healthy vascular aging</title><p>Aging is considered to be an independent cardiovascular risk factor in most methods of CV risk scoring. This raises the important question as to whether or not the regular intake of vasculoprotective bioactives not only does reverse age-associated changes of circulatory function but also has the potential to maintain vascular function with increasing age. It is tempting to speculate that such an approach may ultimately support healthy vascular aging, extend the healthy life span, and lead to a lower rate of cardiovascular events. While such a proposition could only be finally verified through long-term longitudinal studies in healthy elderly individuals, it is possible to meaningfully advance our understanding of this question by way of smaller-scale investigations like the FLAVIOLA AGE study, which can provide the necessary basis for larger-scale studies in future. The present study extended our knowledge regarding the potential role of CF intake in the maintenance of optimal cardiovascular function during normal aging. We demonstrated here that CF intake is effective not only in healthy young but also in elderly individuals, as evidenced by the CF-related reversal of age-specific alterations in circulatory function, vascular stiffness, and hemodynamics.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Limitations</title><p>Intending to specifically focus on mechanistic aspects in greater detail than can be done practically in a larger-scale and longer-term study, the duration of this study was chosen to be 2&#x000a0;weeks. This is based on the outcomes of our previous work showing that approximately 2&#x000a0;weeks of CF intake at 450&#x000a0;mg two times daily is sufficient to establish maximal and sustained improvements (plateau) in FMD in this study population. Consequently, it can be argued tenably that despite of limitations with regard to study duration, our data are relevant in furthering understanding of pharmacodynamics aspects of CF-mediated changes in endothelial function, cardiac output, conductance of conduit and resistance arteries, and perfusion in the microcirculation. An additional limitation regarding the design of this study is the exclusion of female participants. The rationale for doing so was based on complexities related to the influence on FMD and other cardiovascular readouts of hormonal changes that occur in women during the menstrual cycle and during peri-menopause and menopause. To assess detailed mechanistic aspects of CF-intake-related changes in cardiovascular function over the background of menstrual-cycle-dependent modulations, it will require a specific and comprehensive study design, which was beyond the scope of this investigation. Finally, the elderly subjects in our study presented with significantly lower cardiac output as compared to the young subjects that was not significantly changed by the flavanol intervention. It has been appreciated for a long time that besides stiffening of the arteries, stiffening of the heart occurs with advancing age (Tresch and McGough <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">1995</xref>), leading to diastolic dysfunction (Upadhya et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2015</xref>). Whereas a lack of flavanol-related effects on cardiac output may be interpreted as a lack of major flavanol effect on cardiac function, more detailed studies with echocardiography and potentially spiro-ergometry are needed to investigate the impact of flavanols on diastolic function and cardiac performance capacity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec29" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>A CF-based dietary intervention in elderly individuals decreases systolic blood pressure and improves vascular stiffness. These beneficial effects are associated with improved endothelial function in large arteries and enhanced vasodilator function in resistance arteries, as well as with improved microcirculatory perfusion that can already be observed in young healthy participants. Our findings provide clear evidence and novel insights that scientifically underpin the potential of dietary CF to reverse, or at least to attenuate, features of circulatory dysfunction associated with vascular aging in healthy men, a major contributor to atherogenic risk independent of numeric age.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>Christian Heiss and Roberto Sansone contributed equally to this work.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>CH, HS, JPES, GCGK, ARM, MWM, and MK are senior investigators in the FLAVIOLA research consortium of the European Union (FP7-KBBE-2008-2B).
