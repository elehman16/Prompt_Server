The purpose was to explore the efficacies of motor cognition program according to practice methods, centering on coordination and observation pattern. Two practice methods were applied to the 40 MCI elder. In experiment 1, participants divided into two group as, one-hand practice group (n=20) and both-hands practice group (n=20). In experiment 2, participants divided into two group as, active observation group (n=20) and passive observation group (n=20). The participant was asked to alternatively press two buttons 6 times with the index finger hand with goal rhythm pattern (3,600 msec in total duration). In coordination pattern, bimanual practice was more effective for improving temporal-spatial timing memory ability than unilateral practice. In observation pattern, active observation showed better learning effect than passive observation. However, there was a learning effect even in passive observation pattern. Such a result claimed for the elderly, who has problem to do daily activity, could use observation of temporal-spatial timing task for improving cognitive ability.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Mild cognitive impairment</kwd><kwd>Motor cognition program</kwd><kwd>Temporal-spatial memory ability</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The growth of the elderly population and the number of people suffering from dementia has been globing problem to affects negative economic impact. To help dementia population to live independently for as long as possible is a way to contain these costly effects. Dementia is coupled with a progressive decline of perception &#x00026; cognition, motor ability, and memory functions (<xref rid="b1-jer-13-4-430" ref-type="bibr">Dinse et al., 2009</xref>). The effects of cognitive training for the development and prevention of cognitive abilities in mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a transitional stage between normal brain condition and dementia, has frequently been shown during recent decades (<xref rid="b9-jer-13-4-430" ref-type="bibr">Rapp et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="b2-jer-13-4-430" ref-type="bibr">Fernandez-Ballesteros et al., 2003</xref>). More recently, many studies for the MCI have shown that improving motor ability through physical exercise programs has beneficial effects on cognitive performance (<xref rid="b5-jer-13-4-430" ref-type="bibr">Heyn et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Many studies employ physical exercise programs as a method to enhance cognitive performance.</p><p>There are few studies addressing motor cognition program to develop cognitive ability in rehabilitation field (<xref rid="b10-jer-13-4-430" ref-type="bibr">Summers et al., 2007</xref>), while there are many studies focusing motor cognition program to develop cognitive ability for the normal population.

There have been conducted some studies on bimanual coordination and dominant hand according to skill level for the study of motor control and motor learning in normal subjects (<xref rid="b3-jer-13-4-430" ref-type="bibr">Franz et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="b7-jer-13-4-430" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2012</xref>). However, it is hard to find a study focusing motor cognition in rehabilitation field. This study compared the learning efficacies of the OHG and BHG in needs of various changes of the upper-limb exercise types with MCI patients. Furthermore, this study investigated learning efficacy by observation types in active and passive pattern.</p><p>The efficacies of unilateral training and bilateral coordination training, activating the left and right cerebral hemispheres are stimulated differently by absolute timing and relative timing in the timing movement using the visual-auditory sensation information. Specifically, the both-hands practice was more effective than one-hand practice for absolute timing. This result goes with the previous study (<xref rid="b4-jer-13-4-430" ref-type="bibr">Hallett, 2001</xref>) claiming that bilateral exercise is more effective than unilateral exercise, since it stimulates changes in the central and peripheral nervous system related to movements of the affected upper-limb. Even the neuromuscular junction is activated when both hands are coordinated. Therefore, bilateral coordination movement is thought to be more effective than unilateral coordination movement in terms of temporal-spatial timing perception.</p><p>Based on retention test, the BHG showed increased absolute timing ability compared to the OHG. In particular, the OHG showed increased absolute timing error values in each retention test compared to the preliminary test. This result reveals that the OHG perceived two-hands retention test as a new task for improving coordination. Bimanual coordination and temporal stability related studies (<xref rid="b6-jer-13-4-430" ref-type="bibr">Ivry et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="b3-jer-13-4-430" ref-type="bibr">Franz et al., 1996</xref>) show that the two-hands tapping is more efficient in terms of temporal and stability compared to the one-hand tapping, related to internal time signal. Thus, although one-hand movements only use the internal time signal of the relevant hand&#x02019;s direction, two-hands movements use the both internal time signals of each hand which enable performing its task in a stable manner. These results are hypothesized to be similar to such findings. Even though the time and rhythm structured tapping task is recognized with practice, it is perceived as a new task, due to changes in the use of the internal time signal. In general, AOG showed better learning effect than POG. One interesting thing is that there was a learning effect even in passive observation pattern. Such a result claimed for the elderly, who has problem to do daily activity, could use observation of temporal-spatial timing task for improving cognitive ability.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea Grant funded by the Korean Government (NRF-2014S1
