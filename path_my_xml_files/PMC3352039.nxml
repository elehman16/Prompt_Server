Sixty subjects (age 40-75) with symptomatic OA of the hip or knee were assigned to 4 treatment groups (n = 15); Group A0 (Placebo, CMC capsule), Group A1 (UP446 250 mg/day), Group A2 (UP446 500 mg/day) and Group A3 (Celecoxib, 200 mg/day). MOS-SF-36 and Western Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) data were collected at baseline and after 30, 60 and 90 days of treatment as a measure of efficacy. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, plasma thrombin time (PTT), fructosamine, Hematology, clinical chemistry and fecal occult blood were monitored for safety.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Statistically significant decrease in WOMAC pain score were observed for Group A1 at day 90, Group A2 at 30 and 90 days and Group A3 at 60 and 90 days. Statistically significant decrease in WOMAC stiffness score were observed for Group A1 and Group A2 at 30, 60 and 90 days; but not for Group A0 and Group A3. The mean change in WOMAC functional impairment scores were statistically significant for Group A1 and Group A2 respectively at 30 days (p = 0.006 and p = 0.006), at 60 days (p = 0.016 and p = 0.002) and at 90 days (p = 0.018 and p = 0.002), these changes were not significant for Group A0 and Group A3. Based on MOS -SF-36 questionnaires, statistically significant improvements in physical function, endurance and mental health scores were observed for all active treatment groups compared to placebo. No significant changes suggestive of toxicity in routine hematologies, serum chemistries, liver enzymes or PTT were noted in any of the treatment groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Based on current findings UP446 is safe and efficacious alternative to established anti-inflammatory medications for alleviating OA symptoms as measured by the WOMAC Index.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>NSAIDs</kwd><kwd>Anti-inflammatory</kwd><kwd>COX-2</kwd><kwd>LOX</kwd><kwd>UP446</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of joint disorder and the most frequent cause of musculo-skeletal disability worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. As the population ages, the number of affected people with OA is expected to reach 60 million by the year 2020 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. In the United States, alone, there are 40 million people with this disease who cost the economy an estimated $60 billion yearly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>On a biochemical level the primary feature of OA is the accelerated metabolism of arachidonic acid (AA) generated from cell membranes by the action of phospholipase. AA is metabolized by two parallel pathways, cyclooxygenase and 5-lipoxygenase to yield a variety of physiologically active compounds, notably prostaglandins and leukotrienes, respectively. Many of these molecules are involved in the inflammatory response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Present day OA medications act by blocking one or both of the cyclooxygenase (COX-1, COX-2) pathways resulting in reduction of inflammatory mediators such as prostaglandins and prostacyclins. Unfortunately, this therapeutic action is also responsible for most of the toxicity of these agents. It is thought that blocking the COX pathway(s) shunts more AA metabolism down the 5-LOX path with a resultant increase in levels of highly chemotactic and inflammatory leukotrienes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. LTB4 has been shown to stimulate osteoclastic bone resorption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and has been detected at high levels in the walls of NSAID induced gastric ulcers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. LTB4 is also associated with increased production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF&#x003b1; and IL-1&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]</p><p>The class of anti-inflammatory agents, called dual pathway inhibitors more recently developed, blocks all three of the primary AA metabolic pathways and seem to have a more benign toxicity profile than traditional medications. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Dual inhibitors seem not to cause GI damage; rather, they show protective effects on GI mucosa. Potent anti-inflammatory action associated with fewer side effects is the desired outcome but needs confirmation from clinical studies.</p><p>UP446 is a proprietary, standardized blend of extracts from two botanical sources that have been used medicinally in China and India for more than 1000 years. The extracts contain free B-ring flavonoids and flavans standardized to baicalin and catechin. In preclinical studies it has been shown to inhibit COX-1, COX-2 and 5-LOX and to block several animal models of inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The findings of this study suggest that a standardized composition of UP446 has an effect on pain, stiffness and physical function as evaluated by the WOMAC questionnaire.</p><sec><title>Purpose</title><p>This study was conducted to compare the effect and safety of two dosages of UP446 as compared with Celecoxib and placebo in subjects with osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee or hip.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>This was a randomized, double blind, placebo and active comparator controlled study.

Laboratory measures of efficacy included ESR, CRP, and fructosamine at baseline and after 90 days of treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical methods</title><p>The primary outcome measure for efficacy was the subjective assessment of pain as measured by the Western Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC). Additional functional outcome measurements were evaluated with the Short Form SF-36. The Western Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) has been widely accepted as a valid tool for the classical measurement of osteoarthritis symptom quantification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The Health Assessment Questionnaire Short Form SF-36 has been designed for use in clinical practice and research, health policy evaluations and general population surveys. It includes one multi-item scale that assesses eight health concepts: 1) limitations in physical activities because of health problems; 2) limitations in social activities because of physical or emotional problems; 3) limitations in usual role activities because of physical health problems; 4) bodily pain; 5) general mental health (psychological distress and well-being); 6) limitations in usual role activities because of emotional problems; 7) vitality (energy and fatigue); and 8) general health perceptions.</p><p>Within group changes in the efficacy measures were assessed using the paired Student's t-test. Between groups differences with respect to the change in the efficacy measure were assessed with analysis of variance (ANOVA). Multiple-linear regression analysis was used to adjust for the effect of potential confounders. Safety was evaluated by the incidence of adverse events and change in laboratory test results. Relative rate estimates were used to compare the groups with respect to the incidence of adverse events. Paired Student's t-test was used to assess the change in the laboratory test parameters.</p><p>Raw/non standardized values for the WOMAC scores were based on a five point Likert scale with 5 response options ranging from 'none' to 'extreme'. A response of 'none' is scored as 0, 'mild' as 1, 'moderate' as 2, 'severe' as 3, and 'extreme' as 4. Scores for each section were summed to produce pain, stiffness, and physical function Scores.</p><p>Standardization to a scale between 0 and 100 was used for uniformity and to enhance the appreciation of the magnitudes of changes. The mean percent change and p value from baseline are calculated from the normalized scores.</p><p>Statistical Analysis was performed by JSS Medical Research Inc.; Montreal Quebec.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Sixty subjects were enrolled in the study, 22 (36.7%) men and 38 (63.3%) women, mean (SD) age 57.6 (13.2) years.

UP446 is a novel dual pathway inhibitor of botanical origin. The effects of two different doses of this plant extract were evaluated on osteoarthritis and compared to placebo and Celecoxib. This study demonstrated that UP446 at both dose levels and Celecoxib were associated with significant reduction in pain, stiffness and functional incapacity as compared to placebo. Although the treatment groups were small, the results strongly suggest that UP446 at 500 mgs per day was significantly more effective than Celecoxib at 200 mgs for pain reduction and improvement in function as measured by the WOMAC. These findings offer an alternative way of dealing with the discomfort associated with osteoarthritis, there are many NSAIDs available but their major side effects are well known [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. There are some limitations and interesting findings in this pilot study. For example, the statistical findings in changes from baseline (p value &#x0003c; 0.05) were not consistent at the 30, 60 and 90 days time points for any of the study groups. For the pain the scores, the UP446 at both dose levels has significance at 30 and 90 days but not at 60 days in contrast the celecoxib group at 60 and 90 days but not at 30 days. Review of the study shows that the average change in WOMAC pain score (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) for UP446 at 250 mgs was remarkably close for the 30, 60 and 90 day measurement; mean -13 at 30 days, -14.64 at 60 days and -13.57 at 90 days. In fact the value at 60 days is if anything suggestive of a better result than the 30 day and 90 day values (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). We conclude that any "statistical" differences between the values are therefore due to differences in variance (standard deviation), which results in the 60 day value having marginally less statistical significance than the 30 day and 90 day values. Thus while only the 90 day value achieved p &#x0003c; =0.05, in fact the 30 day (p = 0.058) and the 60 day (p = 0.062) values are as meaningful and indicative of efficacy as the 90 day value (p = 0.045). For the UP446 500 mgs/day group statistical significance at p &#x0003c; 0.05 is achieved at 30 days (p = 0.001) and at 90 days (p = 0.001) but not a 60 days (p = 0.102), and for the Celecoxib group significance at p &#x0003c; 0.05 was observed at 60 days (p = 0.004) and at 90 days (p = 0.021) but not a 30 days (p = 0.375).</p><p>We also found lack of agreement between the WOMAC and the SF-36 assessments, these are not uncommon and have been previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], still the WOMAC is the most common and appropriate tool for evaluation of hip and knee osteoarthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>The fact that there were positive fecal occult blood tests (FOBT) in all the groups to include placebo makes it difficult to use this as a safety marker. Since the total number of positive test results in the placebo group, was equal to or greater than the two UP446 treatment groups (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T10">10</xref>), the occurrence of positive FOBT test results is not UP446 treatment related. The guaiac test utilizes a colorimetric indicator that produces a detectable color change upon oxidation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The presence of occult blood is based on oxidation of the indicator by the heme moiety of hemoglobin, which possesses peroxidase activity. There are however, a large number of other redox substances and peroxidases or peroxidase-like enzymes that will test positive or otherwise interfere with this assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Many of these interferants are present in normal dietary foods. While patients may be warned not to eat red meat or certain fruits and vegetables, to avoid use of aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and to avoid ingesting vitamin C, e.g., orange juice, all for the 72 hour period before testing, strict compliance with these instructions is likely poor.</p><p>The baseline average systolic blood pressures for the study groups range from a mean of 134 to 159; thus all groups are pre-hypertensive or overtly hypertensive as defined by the American Heart Association. The high baseline systolic blood pressures combined with the reported increased physical activity and the observed weight loss for all three of the treatment groups is likely to account for the beneficial reduction in systolic blood pressure with the result that participants in the treatment groups are closer to desirable blood pressure values as per the American Heart Association Guidelines, less 120 mm Hg Systolic and less than 80 mm Hg Diastolic. Notably maximal reduction in systolic blood pressure was achieved after 30 days dosing with no further reduction observed after dosing for 90 days. Diastolic blood pressure and resting pulse did not change during the course of the study.</p><p>All active treatment groups experienced weight loss, with BMI changes of between 1.6-2.4 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. The study participants reported no other adverse events and the clinical laboratory evaluations showed no abnormal results that would be indicative of abnormal nutritional status or metabolism. Per protocol the study participants had no dietary or exercise restrictions. These changes can be attributed to increased physical activity reported by study participants as a result of improved mobility and reduced discomfort associated with treatment regimens.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary the results of the present study provide data that supports the use of UP446 at 250 mg/day and at 500 mg/day for the effective management of the clinical course of osteoarthritis. Significant improvement of osteoarthritis symptoms was noticed after 30, 60 and 90 days of treatment with UP446 at 250 mgs and 500 mgs/day. UP446 at 250 mg/day and 500 mg/day is significantly more effective than Celecoxib 200 mg/day for the reduction of function incapacity caused by osteoarthritis, within 30 days (p = 0.010) of treatment and UP446 500 mgs is more effective than celecoxib for reduction of pain at 30 days (p = 0.020)The proprietary plant extract was well tolerated. Symptomatic adverse events and incident of positive fecal occult blood were comparable to the placebo group. No other serious adverse events were observed.</p><p>On the basis of the positive findings in this pilot trial of UP446 we concluded that the mechanism of dual COX/LOX inhibition may confer clinical safety and efficacy benefits comparable to or, in some cases superior to traditional NSAID treatment, offering an effective alternative option in a dietary supplement for managing discomfort associated with OA.
