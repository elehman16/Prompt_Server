It affects approximately 3&#x02013;6% of all pregnancies.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] GDM is still a great problem for the mother and fetus and even in the best conditions, the risk of fetal malformations and mortality is 2&#x02013;5 times higher than normal pregnancy.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Women with untreated gestational diabetes have a greater risk of developing some fetal, neonatal, and maternal outcomes. Congenital anomalies, macrosomia, hypoglycemia, respiratory distress syndrome, hypocalcemia, and hyperbilirubinemia are the neonatal consequences of this complication.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>It is very important to treat GDM during pregnancy. The use of insulin is a standard treatment of gestational diabetes because of its high effectiveness; also, it is believed that insulin does not cross the placental barrier because of its large molecular size.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Results from previous studies showed that anti-insulin antibody is produced in response to insulin transcription in pregnant women with GDM and insulin can cross the placenta as a part of the insulin-antibody complexes.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] This autoimmune response to exogenous insulin can affect fetal development.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Furthermore, insulin injection has disadvantages such as fear, anxiety, repeated injections, the need for education, skills in dose adjustment and injection, the risk of hypoglycemia, more weight gain in pregnant women, and high costs.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>Several studies have investigated oral antidiabetic agents in the treatment of gestational diabetes and some of them used glibenclamide.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] However, it is the second generation sulfonylureas that are commonly used in the treatment of diabetes.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] As a result of similarity in the pathophysiology of gestational diabetes and type 2 diabetes, this drug was also considered in GDM. <italic>In vitro</italic> and clinical studies with very little placental transfer for this drug have been reported unlike other sulfonylureas. The mechanism that reduces the human placental transport of glibenclamide is unknown. A combination of extremely high protein binding and a relatively short elimination half-life might partially explain it.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] This drug releases insulin from pancreatic beta cells by affecting potassium channels.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Furthermore, it reduces postprandial hyperglycemia by improving insulin secretion after meals.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] In addition, it inhibits glucose production by the liver cells.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] The results of a meta-analysis of research entitled &#x0201c;safety of glyburide for gestational diabetes&#x0201d; did not show any increase in perinatal complications.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] The results of a study showed that glibenclamide can be used as the first blood sugar (BS) controller in pregnancy.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Zeng <italic>et al</italic>. also suggested that glibenclamide is effective in the treatment of women with gestational diabetes.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] However, Balsells <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] concluded that glibenclamide should be used as the last drug after insulin and metformin. Studies on glibenclamide, in the treatment of GDM, showed different neonatal outcomes. According to research carried out by Cheng <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] the risk of macrosomia in newborns (weighing more than 4 kg) and admission to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) was higher in glibenclamide than the insulin group. The results of some other studies found no difference in the incidence of neonatal hypoglycemia, increased risk of macrosomia, admission to the NICU, or fetal anomalies.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] Due to the importance of this topic and the conflicting research results, this study was conducted to compare the effect of glibenclamide and insulin on neonatal outcomes in GDM.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study design and participants</title><p>In this clinical trial study, 258 pregnant women who were referred to the gynecology clinics of Shabihkhani and Shahid Beheshti Hospital of Kashan for prenatal care were used as subjects.

Since uncontrolled diabetes can lead to fetal macrosomia,[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] perhaps the higher rate of macrosomia was due to higher BS levels in Cheng's study as compared to the current study.</p><p>Findings of this study showed that there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in the prevalence of hypocalcemia, respiratory distress, and neonatal jaundice.
