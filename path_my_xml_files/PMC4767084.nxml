Hence, effective pain control is vital for early mobilization and postoperative discharge.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] The role of neuraxial regional techniques, particularly epidural analgesia is now well-established. When compared with conventional opioid analgesia they can provide superior analgesia, earlier mobilization, and earlier restoration of bowel function and reduced risk of postoperative respiratory and thromboembolic complications. Therefore, efforts centered on these techniques not only challenge traditional thinking but also improve the overall outcome of the patient.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Narcotic analgesics are frequently used in epidural anesthesia.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Epidural administration of &#x003bc;-receptor opioid agonists such as morphine is regarded by many as the &#x0201c;gold-standard&#x0201d; single-dose neuraxial opioid due to its postoperative analgesic efficacy and prolonged duration of action. However, it is associated with troublesome side effects such as pruritus, nausea, vomiting, urinary retention, and respiratory depression.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Buprenorphine is a semi-synthetic opioid with strong agonistic activity at the &#x003bc;-receptor and antagonistic properties at the &#x003ba;-receptor. Studies show that buprenorphine behavior is typical of &#x003bc;-receptor agonists, with respect to its intended effect (potent and long-lasting analgesia) and side effects (sedation, nausea, and delayed gastric emptying), but a partial agonist at &#x003bc;-receptors involved in respiratory depression.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Butorphanol is a lipid-soluble narcotic with strong &#x003ba;-receptor agonist and weak &#x003bc;-receptor agonist/antagonist activity. These have been frequently used for postoperative analgesia.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] The analgesic efficacy of epidural buprenorphine and butorphanol is comparable to that of morphine, with less respiratory depression, pruritus, and nausea and vomiting.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Aims</title><p>This study was made to evaluate the efficacy of epidural buprenorphine and epidural butorphanol tartrate for postoperative analgesia in laparoscopic hysterectomies.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Study design</title><p>Randomized, double-blinded, prospective clinical study.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>Following approval of the Ethical Committee of KVG Medical College and Hospital, Sullia and obtaining written informed consent from patients, 60 patients who belonged to the American Society of Anesthesiologists I&#x02013;II, aged between 45 and 60 years scheduled for elective laparoscopic hysterectomies were randomly enrolled in the study. Patients were randomly assigned using sealed envelope technique into two groups of 30 patients each. All patients provided written consent for the surgical procedure and anesthetic method. A single anesthesiologist handled all the anesthesia procedures. All patients underwent preanesthetic evaluation on the previous day of surgery. Basic laboratory investigations such as hemoglobin, fasting blood sugar or random blood sugar, blood urea, serum creatinine, and electrocardiography (ECG) were carried out routinely in all patients. Chest radiography was carried out when indicated. All patients were premedicated with tablet anxit 0.5 mg orally the night before the procedure.</p><p>The anesthesia machine was checked before the start of the procedure. Drugs and equipments necessary for resuscitation and general anesthesia were kept ready. Routine monitors (ECG, noninvasive blood pressure [BP], and pulse oximetry) were applied in the operating room. The baseline readings were recorded.</p><p>An intravenous (IV) line was obtained with the 18-gauge cannula in all patients. Injection ondansetron 4 mg IV and injection ranitidine 50 mg IV were given. The patients were preloaded with ringer lactate 500 ml &#x000bd; h before the procedure.</p><p>The patients were placed in the left lateral position. Under all aseptic precautions, a skin wheal was raised in the L2-L3 or L3-L4 interspace with 2 ml 2% lignocaine. An 18-gauge Tuohy needle was passed through space about 1 cm. The stylet was removed, and a 10 ml loss of resistance (LOR) syringe with 5 ml of 0.9% normal saline (NS) was firmly attached to the hub of the tuohy needle. The needle was slowly advanced until it enters the epidural space, which was identified by the LOR technique. The LOR syringe was disconnected. The absence of blood or cerebrospinal fluid was verified by negative aspiration. An 18-gauge epidural catheter was passed through the epidural space with the catheter tip downward 5 cm into space. Three milliliters of 2% lignocaine with epinephrine 1:200,000 was given as test dose. Hemodynamic parameters were monitored for 5 min. Patients were put in supine position.</p><p>All patients were induced with propofol 2 mg/kg IV. Fentanyl 2 &#x003bc;g/kg IV was given for intraoperative analgesia and midazolam 0.05 mg/kg IV was given for sedation and intraoperative amnesia. Tracheal intubation was facilitated with succinylcholine 2 mg/kg IV. Intratracheal tube placement was confirmed by auscultation of the chest and capnography. Ryles tube was placed. Patients were put in position after giving vecuronium 0.1 mg/kg IV. Anesthesia was maintained with intermittent vecuronium 0.05 mg/kg IV, isoflurane (0.4&#x02013;1.5%), nitrous oxide, and oxygen. The lungs were ventilated to maintain end-tidal carbon dioxide between 32 and 36 mm Hg. Intraoperative hypertension was treated with nitroglycerin infusion. Nitrous oxide was discontinued after the patients are fully awake. Neuromuscular reversal was achieved with neostigmine 0.05 mg/kg IV and glycopyrrolate 0.01 mg/kg IV. Extubation was done in the supine position after confirming the patient's response to verbal commands.</p><p>At the end of the surgery, in study Group A, 1 ml (0.3 mg) of buprenorphine diluted to 10 ml with NS was injected through the epidural catheter. In Group B, 1 ml (1 mg) of butorphanol tartrate diluted to 10 ml with NS was injected through the epidural catheter. Patients were observed in the recovery room. Observations were recorded by a blinded observer anesthesiologist. Visual analog pain scales (VAPSs) were assessed every hour till the 6<sup>th</sup> h, then 2<sup>nd</sup> hourly till the 12<sup>th</sup> h. To assess sedation, Ramsay sedation score (RSS) was used. The pulse rate, BP, and respiration were monitored. Patients were given rescue analgesic (injection diclofenac 50 mg IV) when the patients complained of pain, and the pain scales (VAPS) were more than 6.</p><p>The total duration of postoperative analgesia was taken as the period from the time of giving epidural drug until the patients first complained of pain and the VAPS was more than 6.

It is defined as a complex physiologic reaction to tissue injury or visceral distension which is subjective and results in unpleasant, unwanted sensory, and emotional experience. Effective pain control is essential for the optimal care of surgical patients, as these patients suffer from considerable pain in the postoperative period. Therefore, it has been recognized as a prime concern for anesthesiologists.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>Epidural route is used extensively for postoperative pain control. Cleland in 1949 was the first person to describe the technique of epidural analgesia for postoperative pain relief.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Epidural opioids have been administered commonly to relieve anxiety and reduce pain associated with surgery. Opioids bind to specific opioid receptors in the central and peripheral nervous system and other tissues. There are three principle classes of opioid receptors, mu delta and kappa (&#x000b5;, &#x003b4;, and &#x003ba;) receptors. The pharmacodynamic response depends upon which receptor the opioid binds, the affinity of binding and whether it is an agonist or an antagonist. For example, the analgesic properties of morphine are mediated by &#x000b5;<sub>1</sub>-receptor, respiratory depression and physical dependence by &#x000b5;<sub>2</sub>-receptor, and sedation by the &#x003ba;-receptor.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] A study using epidural narcotics for postoperative analgesia concluded that analgesia produced by epidural route was greater than IV route and was relatively free of side effects.</p><p>Epidural morphine for postoperative analgesia was first reported byBehar <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] in 1979, and since then they are very popular. However, their side effects were undesirable which lead to a resurgence of newer drugs such as tramadol hydrochloride, fentanyl citrate, butorphanol tartrate, and buprenorphine.</p><p>Buprenorphine is a semi-synthetic opioid with partial agonist activity at the &#x000b5;-receptor, partial or full agonist activity at the &#x003b4;-receptor, and competitive antagonist activity at the &#x003ba;-receptor. It is a powerful analgesic, approximately 25&#x02013;40 times as potent as morphine.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] It also has a long half-life with relatively little side effects. Furthermore, it is prepared in a preservative-free solution has high lipid solubility, strong affinity for opioid receptors and is, therefore, a logical choice to be used epidurally.</p><p>Butorphanol tartrate is a synthetic morphine derivative which has partial agonist and antagonist activity at the &#x000b5;-receptor and agonist activity at the &#x003ba;-receptor.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] As with other opioid analgesics, central nervous system effects (sedation, confusion, and dizziness) are considerations with butorphanol.</p><p>Thus, this study was made to evaluate the efficacy of epidural buprenorphine and epidural butorphanol tartrate for postoperative analgesia in laparoscopic hysterectomies.</p><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Quality of analgesia (visual analog pain scale)</title><p>In our study, Group A showed significantly higher mean rank of VAPS at 1<sup>st</sup> h (39 vs. 22 [<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001]) when compared to Group B suggesting that onset of analgesia was faster in butorphanol group.
