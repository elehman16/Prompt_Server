assessed the subjective pain degree in chronic low back pain patients. [Subjects and
Methods] Subjects were randomly assigned to two groups: experimental (n=8) and control
(n=8). The experimental group performed two types of rehabilitation therapy programs four
times per week for eight weeks. The rehabilitation program was based on the Korea
Occupational Safety and Health Agency&#x02019;s program. There were several types of stretching
and strengthening. Back strength was measured using the Back Muscle Dynamometer TKK-5402.
The visual analog scale score, selected to measure degrees of subjective pain, was used to
assess treatment efficacy. [Results] For the experimental group, muscular back strength
increased from 133.90 &#x000b1; 11.84&#x02005;kg before exercise to 145.59 &#x000b1; 14.49&#x02005;kg after exercise. In
the control group, muscular back strength decreased from 133.92 &#x000b1; 3.84&#x02005;kg before exercise
to 133.90 &#x000b1; 5.81&#x02005;kg after exercise. In the experimental group, the visual analog scale
score for subjective pain decreased from 6.63 &#x000b1; 0.52 before exercise to 5.75 &#x000b1; 0.46 after
exercise; in the control group, it decreased from 5.61 &#x000b1; 0.52 before exercise to 5.61 &#x000b1;
0.52 after exercise. [Conclusion] Active rehabilitation therapy is a positive intervention
that can provide relief from back pain.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Rehabilitation therapy</kwd><kwd>Subjective pain degree</kwd><kwd>Lower back pain</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Lower back pain is difficult to treat because its relapse rate is very highly influenced by

with this condition has been a serious issue in many countries<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Active trunk muscle
strengthening exercise for the local muscle group located in the core body around the lumbar
vertebrae plays an important role in providing stability to spinal segments, and is useful
for reducing functional disability in the spine. If the muscles lack stability, the patient
tends to make inaccurate movements<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Previous studies have attempted to reduce back pain using exercise programs. The studies
also included several patient education sessions and many different types of stretching and
strengthening.</p><p>A few findings regarding the effect of exercise therapy with lower back pain in patients
who had experienced health risks due to exposure to various adult diseases and illnesses are
controversial, but the number of studies on back strength and subjective pain degree is
rare. Thus, the purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of conventional
rehabilitation therapy for lower back pain patients by analyzing their muscular back
strength and subjective pain degree.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects were allocated to two different groups, the experimental group (45.1 &#x000b1;
2.23&#x02005;years, 171.4 &#x000b1; 5.23&#x02005;cm, 71.1 &#x000b1; 6.56&#x02005;kg, n=8) and the control group (41.6 &#x000b1; 4.27&#x02005;years,
171.0 &#x000b1; 3.23&#x02005;cm, 69.3 &#x000b1; 2.87&#x02005;kg, n=8). The patients were separated based on a body fat rate
of over 30%, obtained using bioelectric impedance. They did not participate in training for
at least six months. This study complied with the ethical standards of the</p><p>Declaration of Helsinki, and written informed consent was received from each participant.
After receiving written informed consent, a radiograph was taken on the following day. The
therapy program was based on the Korea Occupational Safety and Health Agency&#x02019;s program<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. This attempts to reduce pain using
rehabilitation therapy and education sessions and several types of stretching and
strengthening<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Back strength was
measured using the Back Muscle Dynamometer TKK-5402 (Takai, Japan). Posture was the angle of
the upper 30 degrees. Full power and back strength was measured by causing the body when it
is ready. It was performed twice to record a good result, 0.1&#x02005;kg. Pre- and post-treatment
pain intensity levels were measured using a visual analog scale (VAS). We selected the VAS
score as a measure for determining subjective pain, which was used to determine the efficacy
of treatment. Subjective pain degree with low back pain treatment pain score sheets were
then made available for follow-up and final judgment of the patient<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The treatment group performed two different types of rehabilitation therapy programs for
eight weeks. The rehabilitation therapy focused on core back strength and subjective pain
degree. The duration was 10 seconds per repetition three repetitions for weeks 1&#x02013;4, 12
seconds per repetition with three repetitions for weeks 5&#x02013;6, and 15 seconds per repetitions
with three repetitions for weeks 7&#x02013;8, and the rehabilitation therapy was performed twice a
day, four days a week. The patient performed the rehabilitation therapy before and after the
eight weeks of the rehabilitation therapy program. The treatment data were evaluated using
the t-test for comparisons within each group and between the groups. The significance levels
were set as p&#x0003c;0.05 in the statistical analyses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>In the experimental group, muscular back strength increased from 133.90 &#x000b1; 11.84&#x02005;kg before

subjective pain degree in patients with chronic lower back pain. There was an increase in
muscular back strength and subjective pain degree after exercise and a change of muscular
back strength and subjective pain degree between the control and experimental groups. The
muscular back strength and subjective pain degree were measured. The experimental groups
showed a significant decrease, which is a positive result.</p><p>Rehabilitation therapy allowed activation of the abdominal muscles and multifidus, the
motor muscles of the spine<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. The tension
and postural muscles are in this part of the body, and they play an important role in trunk
stability and posture control when individuals perform whole-body activity. These muscles
also counteract the imbalance of muscles necessary for maintaining posture<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. According to the VAS after the two groups
performed the core body stability exercise and combined exercise, both groups showed a
significant decrease in pain. It is assumed that the two rehabilitation therapies enhanced
core body stability and strengthened the back muscles significantly, and resulted in
decreased back pain due to the reactivation of the core body muscle. According to this
study, patients with back pain can decrease pain significantly if they regularly and
continuously use rehabilitation therapy, as shown in the result. Pain results from
mechanical, psychological, and degenerative factors. The back pain was found in the spine,
core back muscles surrounding the spine, sacroiliac, several nerves, and many discs<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>It is indispensable for back pain patients to strengthen core back muscles and improve in
lumbar flexibility. The care for back pain can depend on the type of pain. Because of the
patient&#x02019;s job type, back pain results from injury, job stress, or loading on separate
structure of the body&#x02019;s core. Most studies and researchers use rehabilitation therapy to
evaluate the effects of back pain. Rehabilitation therapy is a significant method for back
pain patients<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Research has used
rehabilitation therapy and lumbar stabilizing rehabilitation therapy to increase lumbar
strength and decrease pain<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
exercise improved back core muscle strength. This study found that patients with core back
pain had decreased subjective pain degree and improved back muscle strength after undergoing
rehabilitation therapy. There appeared to be a significant improvement in core muscular back
strength and subjective pain degree in treatment patients. This finding indicated that the
stretching type of rehabilitation therapy would have some additional benefits. Future
studies should conduct a follow up test to comprehend how subjects maintain rehabilitation
therapy so that the results can be well used by patients with back pain.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><person-group><name><surname>Park</surname><given-names>HJ</given-names></name></person-group>: Effects of Posture Adjusting Exercise on Relieving low back pain.
