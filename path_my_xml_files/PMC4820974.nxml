Internet-based and computerized approaches have been known to be effective in treatment dissemination. The study purpose is to assess the effects of a web-based psychosocial relapse prevention program with a multicenter randomized controlled trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Recruitment began in January 2015 for outpatient participants diagnosed with drug abuse or dependence who have used a primary abused drug in the past year at psychiatric hospitals and a clinic. Participants are randomized either to a web-based relapse prevention program or a self-monitoring group. The intervention is a web-based relapse prevention program named &#x0201c;e-SMARPP&#x0201d; that consists of six relapse prevention program modules with tailored feedback from health care professionals and 8 weeks of self-monitoring. The content is adapted from a face-to-face relapse prevention program which is based on cognitive behavioral therapy and motivational enhancement. The primary outcomes are relapse risk assessed by the <italic>Stimulant Relapse Risk Scale</italic> (baseline, 2-, 5- and 8-month) and the longest duration of consecutive abstinent days from primary abused drug during the intervention. Secondary outcomes will include motivation to change, self-efficacy for drug use and craving, abstinent days in the past 28 or 56&#x000a0;days, quality of life, sense of coherence, cost of substance use, medical cost, retention of treatment and use of self-help group. Completion, usability and satisfaction of the program will be also assessed to explore feasibility. This study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of The University of Tokyo and each recruiting hospital and clinic.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>To our knowledge, this study is the first clinical trial to assess the effects of a web-based therapeutic program for drug users in Japan. If successful, this program is a promising approach for drug user treatment in Japan, where the stigma toward drug users is strong. The results are also useful for researchers who want to know about programs for various substances, including methamphetamine.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>This trial was registered with the University Hospital Medical Information Network clinical trial registry: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://upload.umin.ac.jp/cgi-bin/ctr_e/ctr_view.cgi?recptno=R000018484">UMIN000016075</ext-link> (Date of registration: January 5, 2015).</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Web-based</kwd><kwd>Internet</kwd><kwd>Drug dependence</kwd><kwd>Methamphetamine</kwd><kwd>Relapse prevention</kwd><kwd>Cognitive behavioral therapy</kwd><kwd>Motivational interviewing</kwd><kwd>Self-monitoring</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><sec id="Sec2"><title>Drug use problems and implementation of treatment</title><p>Drug use problems have been a serious public health concern and illicit drug dependence is a global burden, accounting for 0.8&#x000a0;% of global all-cause disability adjusted life years in 2010 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Drug dependence is highest in the age cohort of 20&#x02013;29 years and adversely affects young adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In Japan, drug use prevalence and drug related health problems have been much lower than that of other countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. However, methamphetamine use disorders are the most prevalent in drug addiction treatment. Moreover, problems related to prescription drug use and overdose are serious, especially in Japanese female patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Moreover, outpatient treatment and community-based support for drug users have been very poor because of a zero-tolerance policy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Accessible psychiatric treatment use is very limited, accounting for about 16&#x000a0;% of drug/alcohol use disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Because pharmacotherapy for drug dependence (e.g., methadone, buprenorphine) has not been approved in Japan, psychosocial approaches are the most important treatment, especially in outpatient settings. However, there has been a gap between potential treatment needs and available treatment services, which is also apparent in other countries. Various reasons have been considered as barriers to treatment access: (1) limited availability (e.g., rigid session times, inconvenient locations, costs for drug users), (2) concerns about confidentiality and stigmatization and (3) economic and human-resource limitations for treatment providers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Flexible and accessible treatments are necessary, especially in Japan as outpatient treatment for drug users is very limited and societal drug-use stigma is strong.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Treatment using computer and Internet technologies</title><p>Therapeutic interventions using computer and Internet technologies have developed and adapted to various health problems, including substance use disorders, to address challenges in treatment implementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Many computer-assisted or web-based interventions for drug users which were developed based on psychosocial approaches demonstrated benefits for abstinence, treatment retention and cost effectiveness with small to moderate effect sizes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Most of these interventions have been developed for cocaine or cannabis users in Western countries. There are few programs for amphetamine-type-stimulant users and for populations in Asia with different social backgrounds, even when Internet infrastructure and computers are generally available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In Japan, there have been various web and mobile applications to assist in personal health care, however, evidence-based therapeutic interventions for drug users remains undeveloped.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Previous work: development of &#x0201c;e-SMARPP&#x0201d;</title><p>A new piloted web-based program named &#x0201c;e-SMARPP&#x0201d; for Japanese drug users was developed by the first author (AT) based on an existing face-to-face cognitive behavioral relapse prevention program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], using Moodle (version 2.6.1) which is an open-source web application to build e-learning websites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. A referenced program was the Serigaya Methamphetamine Relapse Prevention Program (SMARPP), which was developed based on the Matrix Model by one of the authors (TM) and was widely implemented in Japan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The web-based e-SMARPP program consisted of three parts: a relapse prevention program series that included videos, with narration and subtitles, and assignments in the form of exercises and a diary; self-monitoring; and information about drug addiction services. e-SMARPP content is intended to be user-friendly with minimal text and limited use of difficult Kanji characters referencing specialized medical terminology. User guides in each section support use. The e-SMARPP website is designed to support any device, including personal computers, mobile phones and tablet computers with Internet access. The website is closed access and only drug users diagnosed with drug dependence by psychiatrists are provided a login account from an administrator. The access security is protected by an individual login/password and secure socket layer technology. The content of e-SMARPP does not depend on the type of drug and was developed with versatility to assist in handling common problems among drug users. This was because most face-to-face programs for drug users deal with problems of various drugs and it was not feasible to gather homogeneous patients in Japan. The usability and acceptance of e-SMARPP were reasonable among psychiatric outpatients and people who had recovered from drug dependence, but some improvements were suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Details of the development process and findings of the pilot study were reported in a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. In the revision process after the piloted usability test, content of the videos were simplified to focus on approaches to recovery rather than drug adverse effects. Self-monitoring was improved to be able to record detailed conditions about drug users if necessary (e.g., drug consumption, forms of used drugs, triggers of drug use). Functional defects including garbled characters on mobile phones were fixed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Objectives and hypotheses</title><p>The aim of this study is to examine the effects of a web-based cognitive behavioral relapse prevention program, revised as e-SMARPP, among Japanese psychiatric outpatients with methamphetamine and other drugs use problems with a multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT) design. The primary hypothesis is that participants assigned to e-SMARPP will have reduced relapse risk and maintain a longer duration of consecutive abstinence (days) from a primary abused drug during the intervention compared to those who were randomized to self-monitoring only. The secondary hypothesis is that participants in the e-SMARPP group will report positive changes in motivation to change, self-efficacy for drug craving, abstinent days in the past 28 or 56&#x000a0;days (percentages and differences in change: pre-post), quality of life, sense of coherence, cost of alcohol and drug, retention of treatment, use of self-help group and psychiatric medical cost. In addition, completion, usability and satisfaction of the program will be assessed for utilization and feasibility test. This article describes the study protocol according to SPIRIT guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>Trial design</title><p>Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> shows the design of this study and participant flow. This study is a two-arm (allocation ratio is one to one), parallel-group, non-blinded and multicenter randomized controlled trial. Eligible participants are asked to complete the baseline assessment and are randomly allocated to either the intervention group or the control group. All participants in both groups will be provided a login/password with instructions about how to access the website and use e-SMARPP during the study. The participants in the intervention group can access the complete contents of e-SMARPP, while the control group can access a part of it: self-monitoring. Each individual access account is tied to either group, and as such participants can use e-SMARPP content included in their group only. Web-based follow-up assessments are conducted at 8, 20, 32&#x000a0;weeks after the baseline assessment.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Study design and participant flow</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12888_2016_793_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Participants and setting</title><p>The participants are recruited from five psychiatric hospitals and one clinic (National Center of Neurology and psychiatry, Saitama Psychiatric Medical Center, Kanagawa Psychiatric Center, Okayama Psychiatric Medical Center, Tokyo Metropolitan Matsuzawa Hospital and APARI clinic) that provides treatment for people with substance use disorder in Japan. The inclusion criteria are: (1) outpatients who were diagnosed with substance use disorder assessed by DSM-5 (psychoactive substances other than alcohol and tobacco), (2) those who used a primary abused drug in the past year and (3) those with access to the Internet via PC, smartphone or tablet computer and can exchange e-mail. The exclusion criteria are: (1) patients with severe physical diseases, (2) patients with high suicide risk, (3) patients with severe symptoms of substance-induced psychotic disorder, (4) patients with impaired cognitive function and (5) those who judged ineligible to participate in the study by a psychiatrist. We include various types of participants (form of drugs, previous and current receiving treatment for drug dependence, psychiatric comorbidity, pharmacotherapy and sexual orientation) because we will test adaptation of e-SMARPP to various drug users in a secondary analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Randomization and blinding</title><p>Staff of recruiting institutions will recruit outpatients who meet inclusion criteria. Eligible participants will be informed that they will be allocated to either of the two groups. After baseline assessment, they will be randomly assigned to either of the two groups using the method of permuted block, with random block size of four, and they will be informed their assigned group by the first author (AT). Randomization will be stratified by institution. The computer-generated allocation list was made by an independent researcher (YM) and concealed to other researchers and participants until the time of assignment. The enrollment is conducted by the first author (AT) and the intervention starts immediately. Researchers and staff who work for recruiting institutions will be blinded. In addition, an independent researcher (YM) who will not analyze data will download data from the e-SMARPP database and an independent research staff person will mask the group variable before analysis, then researchers (AT and T. Shinozaki) will analyze data that is blinded to the group variable.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Interventions</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Web-based relapse prevention program: e-SMARPP</title><p>The website of e-SMARPP is comprised of five modules: (1) cognitive behavioral relapse prevention sessions (watching videos, submitting exercises and a weekly dairy on the website), (2) self-monitoring, calendar that displays drug use status by color, (3) information, downloadable PDF and website links to drug addiction support services, (4) user guide, how to use the system, frequently asked questions and a contact form to researchers and (5) assessment, which are web-based questionnaires for baseline and three follow-up assessments.</p><p>The main intervention modules are the relapse prevention program sessions and self-monitoring. Content for the videos and exercises of the relapse prevention program are taken from the SMARPP workbook and can be adapted to any type of drug. Each session has three videos, two exercises and a weekly diary activity (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Videos are made in a YouTube format and embedded in each session (See Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Videos are online, but are unlisted videos and restricted to people who have the link to the video, so only participants in the intervention group and researchers can view them. Narration and subtitles help users understand the content. Exercises are related to the video content and users will be expected to complete these after watching the video. Users will write and submit their own answers through an Internet text form (See Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). In addition, users are expected to write down in the weekly diary their condition from the last week, current goals, and how they will plan to spend time over the next week. Writing in the diary is also done on the Internet through the system. After submitting the exercise and the weekly diary, users receive tailored feedback comments from qualified health care professionals (registered nurse and medical doctor) who are trained to support patients with substance use disorders (mainly AT). Feedback comments are based on motivational interviewing skills to enhance user motivation and to provide individual support.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Content for relapse prevention session of e-SMARPP</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td colspan="2">1.&#x000a0;What is drug dependence?</td></tr><tr><td>Video</td><td>&#x027a2; Mental and physical consequences caused by drug use (11&#x02032; 02&#x02033;)</td></tr><tr><td/><td>&#x027a2; Changes in the brain (11&#x02032; 39&#x02033;)</td></tr><tr><td/><td>&#x027a2; How to stop a drug craving (7&#x02032; 43&#x02033;)</td></tr><tr><td>Exercise</td><td>&#x025a0; Think about your pros and cons for drug use and quitting drugs.</td></tr><tr><td/><td>&#x025a0; Define your drug use situation: when, where, who, why, what and emotion.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">2.&#x000a0;Triggers of drug use</td></tr><tr><td>Video</td><td>&#x027a2; Process of craving and drug use (5&#x02032; 27&#x02033;)</td></tr><tr><td/><td>&#x027a2; Various internal and external triggers of drug craving (11&#x02032; 00&#x02033;)</td></tr><tr><td/><td>&#x027a2; Anchors keeping you from drug use (5&#x02032; 01&#x02033;)</td></tr><tr><td>Exercise</td><td>&#x025a0; Define your internal and external triggers.</td></tr><tr><td/><td>&#x025a0; Who and what are your anchors?</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">3.&#x000a0;Recovery process; &#x0201c;Just for today&#x0201d;</td></tr><tr><td>Video</td><td>&#x027a2; Process and stage of recovery (12&#x02032; 38&#x02033;)</td></tr><tr><td/><td>&#x027a2; Safe lifestyle and signs of relapse (10&#x02032; 19&#x02033;)</td></tr><tr><td/><td>&#x027a2; How to plan a safe daily life (9&#x02032; 27&#x02033;)</td></tr><tr><td>Exercise</td><td>&#x025a0; Think of your signs of relapse and barriers to recovery.</td></tr><tr><td/><td>&#x025a0; Plan a safe daily life schedule without drugs.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">4.&#x000a0;Features of dependence symptoms</td></tr><tr><td>Video</td><td>&#x027a2; Typical features of dependence (9&#x02032; 05&#x02033;)</td></tr><tr><td/><td>&#x027a2; Typical thoughts and behaviors when people fall for drugs (12&#x02032; 32&#x02033;)</td></tr><tr><td/><td>&#x027a2; Justification for relapse (9&#x02032; 21&#x02033;)</td></tr><tr><td>Exercise</td><td>&#x025a0; Think of your patterns of thinking and behavior during drug use</td></tr><tr><td/><td>&#x025a0; Think of your possible justification for relapse</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">5.&#x000a0;Supporters for recovery</td></tr><tr><td>Video</td><td>&#x027a2; Typical internal triggers: &#x0201c;HALT&#x0201d; (hungry, angry, lonely and tired) (10&#x02032; 05&#x02033;)</td></tr><tr><td/><td>&#x027a2; To trust and be honest to yourself and others (5&#x02032; 41&#x02033;)</td></tr><tr><td/><td>&#x027a2; Support from peers and professionals (13&#x02032; 39&#x02033;)</td></tr><tr><td>Exercise</td><td>&#x025a0; Think of ways to handle internal triggers.</td></tr><tr><td/><td>&#x025a0; Think of your supporters.

SRRS was developed to measure multidimensional relapse risk and consists of 35 items measured on a 3-point Likert scale. The SRRS has five subscales: anxiety and intention to use drug (AI), emotionality problems (EP), compulsivity for drug use (CD), positive expectancies and lack of control over drug (PL), and lack of negative expectancy for drug use (NE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. All items ask about a drug-related situation in the past 1 week. Examples of the items are &#x0201c;I am anxious about reusing the drug&#x0201d; (AI), &#x0201c;I cannot control my feeling&#x0201d; (EP), &#x0201c;I want to obtain the drug even by working illegally&#x0201d; (CD), &#x0201c;If I use the drug, I would feel invigorated&#x0201d; (PL), and &#x0201c;If I use the drug, it would badly influence my job&#x0201d; (NE, inversed item). Higher average scores for total and subscale items indicate higher relapse risk. Its reliability and validity was confirmed among stimulant drug users in Japan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p><p>We will add another primary outcome, the longest duration of consecutive abstinence (days), according to previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. This is because the cut-off point of the SRRS has not been confirmed and interpretation of the score is difficult. Additionally, the SRRS was developed and is only used in Japan, and as such, a more objective outcome measure is needed. The longest duration of consecutive abstinence from the primary abused drug during intervention (56&#x000a0;days) will be counted, using the self-monitoring calendar and the TLFB method.</p><p>We hypothesize that both of the two primary outcomes will differ significantly between groups.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Secondary outcome</title><p>The secondary outcomes (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) will be the following ten measures.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Motivation to change</title><p>Motivation to change will be measured with the Stage of Change Readiness and Treatment Eagerness Scale-8 version for Drug Use (SOCRATES-8D) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The SOCRATES-8D consists of 19 items assessed on a 5-point Likert scale and three subscales: Recognition, Ambivalence, and Taking Steps. Examples of the items are &#x0201c;I really want to make changes in my use of drugs&#x0201d; (Recognition), &#x0201c;Sometimes I wonder if I am an addict&#x0201d; (Ambivalence) and &#x0201c;I have already started making some changes in my use of drugs&#x0201d; (Taking Step). Higher scores indicate higher motivation to change. Positive correlations have been reported between high scores and the development of readiness for treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] and engagement in treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Reliability and validity of the Japanese version of the SOCRATES-8D has been confirmed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. However, a different factor structure (two-factor structure) was observed in the previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], so we will use only the total score in this study.</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Self-efficacy</title><p>Confidence (i.e., self-efficacy) in handling drug use and craving is measured with the Self-efficacy Scale for Drug Dependence (SSDD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. The SSDD has two domains: general self-efficacy (GE) and self-efficacy in specific situations (SS). The GE domain consists of five items assessed on a 5-point Likert scale from 1 (not confident) to 5 (confident). Examples of GE items include, &#x0201c;I can seek help when I have a problem&#x0201d;. The SS domain consists of 11 items assessed on a 7-point Likert scale from 1 (not at all confident) to 7 (absolutely confident). Examples of an SS item includes, &#x0201c;I can handle a drug craving when I am depressed and anxious&#x0201d;. Higher GE and SS scores mean more confidence in handling a drug craving.</p></sec><sec id="FPar3"><title>Abstinence</title><p>Abstinence from the primary abused drug will be measured using the following three methods. First, percentages of abstinent days from the primary abused drug in the past 28 or 56&#x000a0;days at each assessment point will be compared. Next, differences in change of abstinent days from the primary abused drug in the past 28&#x000a0;days between baseline (T1) and follow-up (T2, T3 and T4) will be assessed. Finally, the longest consecutive abstinent days during the intervention period will be compared. Abstinent days will be summed using self-monitoring and the TLFB method.</p></sec><sec id="FPar4"><title>Quality of life</title><p>Health related quality of life measured with WHO/QOL-26 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], which consist of 26 items measured on a 5-point Likert scale. There are two items which asks about an individual&#x02019;s overall perception of quality of life (QOL) and their health. The remaining 24 items are divided into four domains: physical domain, psychological domain, social relationships and environment. All items ask about respondents&#x02019; life in the last 4 weeks. Higher scores indicate higher QOL.</p></sec><sec id="FPar5"><title>Sense of coherence</title><p>Sense of coherence (SOC) is considered to be an individual&#x02019;s personality as a fundamental source of coping in stressful events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. The SOC of people with substance use disorder has been considered lower than that of healthy people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Among people with mental health problems and substance use disorders, previous studies have revealed that high SOC is associated with a better ability to cope with stressful life situations and improved life satisfaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] and high SOC is one of the predictors of treatment success: treatment retention and drug abstinence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. We will use the University of Tokyo Health Sociology version of the SOC3 scale (SOC-3-UTHS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], which consists of three items measured on a 7-point Likert scale.

In Japan, methamphetamine is more expensive than other drugs (above 10,000 yen for use of methamphetamine several times). New psychoactive substances (NPS) are relatively cheap (about 2000 to 5000 yen for one package).</p><p>Cost of psychiatric treatment use in the past 6 months will also be assessed. We will ask about frequency and period of psychiatry hospitalization and outpatient treatment, frequency of use of emergency room, total cost of prescription drugs, frequency and period of specialized outpatient treatment for drug addiction, the participant&#x02019;s income and amount of time required to receive one outpatient treatment including travel time. We will calculate total psychiatric medical cost using the annual report of medical costs by diseases and treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Users&#x02019; feedback, feasibility, usability</title><p>In addition, completion, usability and satisfaction of the program will be assessed for utilization and a feasibility test. The intervention completion rate of each group will be assessed. Usability of the e-SMARPP website will be assessed using the Web Usability Scale (WUS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. The WUS consist of 21 items measured on a 5-point scale and seven subscales: ease of use, ease in understanding structure, ease in reading, response speed, favorable, helpfulness and credibility. The subscale average score will be calculated, higher score indicates higher website usability. Usability of e-SMARPP contents will be assessed using original questionnaires. Example of questions include, &#x0201c;What is the most useful/unuseful content?&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;Are videos easy to use? (with options ranging from very easy to very difficult)&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;How long does it take to complete one exercise?&#x0201d;. Perceived program satisfaction will be assessed using the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire 8-item version (CSQ-8) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. CSQ-8 consists of eight items measured on a 4-point scale. A higher score indicates a higher satisfaction with service use.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Participant characteristics</title><p>At the baseline assessment, sociodemographic information will be gathered including age, sex, marital status, cohabitation status, educational history, employment status and Internet use (use days per week, hours per day and main devices to access).</p><p>Information about history of drug use will be also asked. The primary problematic drug will be asked. Drug use in the past 28&#x000a0;days will be collected using the self-monitoring calendar based on the TLFB method. In addition, we assess first-abused drug, onset age of any drug abuse and the primary drug abuse, polydrug abuse (yes/no), abstinence duration calculated from the day when they last used a drug, experience of past arrest (yes/no), past experience in a correctional facilities (yes/no), and self-reported psychiatric comorbidity with an option to select a diagnosis based on the International Classification of Diseases-10. Similarly, we evaluate history of treatment in several ways: duration of psychiatry outpatient ward, number of psychiatry hospitalization, specialized behavioral treatment for drug problems in the past (yes/no), and self-help group use (yes/no).</p><p>In order to assess severity of drug use problems, we use the Japanese version of the Drug Abuse Screening Test (DAST-20), which consists of 20 binary items [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. All items will ask participants&#x02019; drug use condition in the past year. Total score ranges from 0 to 20 and a high score represents a severe condition.

We will use all obtained data at the 2, 5 and 8&#x000a0;months assessment without imputation, assuming the missing mechanism will be at random given observed data within the groups. We will include the following variables as fixed effects: the group, time, the baseline scores and the interaction of group and time. Time will be coded as months after the baseline assessment, giving values of 0, 2, 5 and 8. We will also include random effects of participants for intercept and time.

The research question regarding the economic evaluation is, &#x02018;Is e-SMARPP potentially a cost-effective means of helping abuse drug users to increase abstinent days? Specifically, we will employ a cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) framework, and the results of analysis will be summarized as an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). A within-trial analysis will evaluate cost-effectiveness from a patient and institutional perspective. Sensitivity analysis will be undertaken for parameter uncertainty of benefits measures and assumptions to calculate average costs. Subgroup analysis will be of great interest to make policy recommendations for a more targeted approach.

Before the baseline survey, candidates will be fully informed that their participation is totally voluntary and can withdraw the consent if they want and they can send a withdrawal e-mail to researchers and also tell their intention to withdraw to their primary doctor. Even if they withdraw the consent, they will not receive any disadvantage. In addition, they will be informed that the findings of this study will be disseminated without participants&#x02019; personal infromation via publication and website. Face-to-face informed consent will be conducted (AT) and signed consent forms will be obtained from all participants. The participants will be told that the web-based program does not provide emergency support verbally and on the website and will be encouraged to use proper medical services or talk to their primary doctor in case of an emergency. If a researcher becomes aware of an emergency condition (e.g., imminent suicide intention, violence) through e-SMARPP, the researcher will consult with the participant&#x02019;s primary doctor.

First, to the best of our knowledge, this study is the first clinical trial using a web-based program for drug users in Japan. The randomized design and 8-month follow-up will allow for conclusive results. Second, the e-SMARPP contents were developed based on an existing evidence-based face-to-face program and usability has been confirmed. If successful, e-SMARPP will be promising approach to addressing problems of treatment implementation and will be useful for assisting drug user recovery without lower costs and ease of use. Finally, the study findings will be also useful for Asian countries where there are many amphetamine-type stimulants users and strong drug-use stigma. This circumstance in Japan reflects a different situation for drug abuse and policy from that of Western countries where many web-/mobile-based programs have been developed for that context.</p><p>There are possible limitations to this study. All data from participants will be self-reported and affected by situation and perception of participants. Regarding the program, the relapse prevention sessions of e-SMARPP requires the involvement of human resources, and web-therapists who give feedback comments to users&#x02019; homework. This raises concerns about scalability. More web-therapists and automated functions using algorithms to support a personalized program will be required when we disseminate e-SMARPP more widely. Additionally, it is important to consider whether e-SMARPP is useful and safe when recruiting drug users who do not receive other treatment and support. For now, we think e-SMARPP is an adjunct or a partial replacement for standard treatment. It is important to consider the possibility of implementation of e-SMARPP with collaboration from primary care and providers of mental health services. The Internet penetration rate is more than 90&#x000a0;% among people age 13 to 59 in Japan and it has been increasing year by year, but the rate is low among people with a low household income [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. Individual Internet literacy and computer skills may affect not only usability and completion of the intervention, but also improvement of drug use problems in this study. Further revision may be required to provide a more use-friendly program.</p><sec id="Sec31"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p>A person who is interested in this study will communicate trial results via publications.
