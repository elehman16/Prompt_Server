However, it is not clear whether a gradient approach focused on a wider SES distribution or a binary poverty approach is more salient for mental health in LMIC. Yet this distinction has implications for interventions aimed at improving population health. We contribute to the literature by examining how multiple indicators of socioeconomic status, including gradient SES and binary poverty indicators, contribute to prenatal depression symptoms in a LMIC context. Prenatal depression is an important public health concern with negative sequela for the mother and her children. We use data on assets, education, food insecurity, debt, and depression symptoms from a sample of 1154 pregnant women residing in rural Pakistan. Women who screened positive for depression participated in a cluster randomized controlled trial of a perinatal depression intervention; all women were interviewed October 2015-February 2016, prior to the start of the intervention. Cluster-specific sampling weights were used to approximate a random sample of pregnant women in the area. Findings indicate that fewer assets, experiencing food insecurity, and having household debt are independently associated with worse depression symptoms. The association with assets is linear with no evidence of a threshold effect, supporting the idea of a gradient in the association between levels of SES and depression symptoms. A gradient was also initially observed with woman&#x02019;s educational attainment, but this association was attenuated once other SES variables were included in the model. Together, the asset, food insecurity, and debt indicators explain 14% of the variance in depression symptoms, more than has been reported in high income country studies. These findings support the use of multiple SES indicators to better elucidate the complex relationship between socioeconomic status and mental health in LMIC.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="author-highlights" id="ab0015"><title>Highlights</title><p><list list-type="simple" id="li0005"><list-item id="u0005"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0005">We compare the association between poverty, gradient measures of SES, and depression.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0010"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0010">Above the poverty level, SES predict depression in a low income country.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0015"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0015">Relying on simple, dichotomous, poverty measures in studies of mental health is not recommended.</p></list-item></list></p></abstract><kwd-group id="keys0005"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Socioeconomic status</kwd><kwd>Prenatal depression</kwd><kwd>Maternal depression</kwd><kwd>Poverty</kwd><kwd>LMIC</kwd><kwd>South Asia</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s0005"><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0020">There is a growing interest in the relationship between socioeconomic status (SES), poverty, and mental health in lower and middle income countries (LMIC) (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Lund et al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Lund et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Burns, 2015</xref>). Recent reviews confirm that lower socioeconomic status is correlated with worse mental health outcomes (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Lund et al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Coast et al., 2012</xref>), although the findings are not unequivocal (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Das, Do, Friedman, McKenzie &#x00026; Scott, 2007</xref>). For example, there is evidence that studies using domains such as education or financial stress yield more consistent results than those using income or expenditures (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Araya, Lewis, Rojas &#x00026; Fritsch, 2003</xref>). However, as this body of evidence grows, a distinction that is often overlooked is that between the construct of socioeconomic status, measured often as a gradient, and poverty, a binary indicator of deprivation below a demarcated threshold. Indeed, the terms SES and poverty are often used interchangeably (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Lund et al., 2010</xref>). The failure to distinguish between SES and poverty may potentially explain differences in findings, and has implications for policies aimed at improving population health.</p><p id="p0025">In general, SES, or socioeconomic position (SEP), refers to a person&#x02019;s position in their community&#x02019;s social hierarchy; it reflects a person&#x02019;s access to key social and economic resources, including money, power, and social connections (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Glymour, Avendano &#x00026; Kawachi, 2014</xref>). SES exists on a continuum, or a gradient, and is usually understood as having multiple dimensions. Commonly used indicators of SES are occupation-based measures, income, expenditures, education, wealth/assets, as well as various composite measures (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Galobardes, Shaw, Lawlor, Davey Smith &#x00026; Lynch, 2006</xref>). Research from high income countries (HIC) has shown a clear gradient in the SES-health association, in that there are health benefits of belonging to every higher step on the SES ladder (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Hemingway et al., 1997</xref>, <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Lorant et al., 2003</xref>). A discussion of poverty, on the other hand, focuses on those at the very bottom of the SES continuum. Poverty is a binary construct; the level below which &#x0201c;society deems it unacceptable to live&#x0201d;, a level of deprivation that prevents an individual from participating in normal life (<xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Smith, 1776</xref>). Commonly used binary indicators of poverty in LMIC are living on less than $1 or $2 a day or home overcrowding, as well as qualitative indicators such as food insecurity. SES indicators can be dichotomized in a way to identify those who are most disadvantaged, i.e. poor, such as having no education vs. at least some education, or belonging to the bottom quintile of an income/expenditure distribution vs. everyone else.</p><p id="p0030">The question of whether gradient indicators of SES or absolute poverty are most salient for mental health is important in that they may imply different mechanisms operating to influence health and, in turn, different potential policy solutions. If poverty is the key driver of negative health outcomes then interventions focused on the poorest in society would have the largest beneficial impact in reducing the burden of disease (i.e. the &#x02018;high risk strategy&#x02019; (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Rose, 1985</xref>)). However, if lower SES negatively impacts mental health relative to each higher step of the SES ladder, as has been found in HICs, then a broader strategy may be necessary to have the largest impact.</p><p id="p0035">The majority of existing research on this topic focuses on Common Mental Disorders (CMDs) such as depression and anxiety. We extend this research by focusing our analysis on depression among women during the prenatal period, estimated to affect at least 16% of women in LMIC (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Fisher et al., 2012</xref>). The majority of women who are depressed prenatally remain depressed postnatally (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Rahman &#x00026; Creed, 2007</xref>) and depression during this perinatal period has been linked with other health problems for the mother as well as with multiple negative developmental outcomes for her offspring (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Brown and Lumley, 2000</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Galler et al., 2004</xref>, <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Rahman et al., 2004</xref>, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Gelaye et al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Maselko et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, a better understanding of the relationship between socioeconomic status and depression during pregnancy can inform efforts to improve the mental health of mothers as well as to improve the developmental trajectories of their children.</p><p id="p0040">The goal of this paper is to examine the relationship between multiple indicators of socioeconomic status, especially gradient SES and binary poverty indicators, and prenatal depression symptoms in a LMIC context. To do so, we use data from a community sample of pregnant women residing in rural Pakistan. First, we examine the association of multiple indicators of SES and poverty with prenatal depression symptoms. Finally, we conduct an exploratory analysis to see whether each SES and poverty indicator uniquely predicts depression symptoms, independent of the other indicators.</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s0015"><title>Sample</title><p id="p0045">The data for the analysis come from the baseline data collection wave (during the prenatal period) of a cluster randomized controlled trial (c-RCT) of a perinatal depression intervention, the Thinking Healthy Peer Delivered Plus (THPP+) program. The study is situated in a rural area of Pakistan; sample recruitment and trial details are described elsewhere (<xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Sikander et al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Turner et al., 2016</xref>). Briefly, all pregnant women living in 40 village clusters (half of which were randomized to the intervention and half to the control arm) were screened for depression during their third trimester of pregnancy using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 cutoff score of 10 or greater (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Kroenke, Spitzer &#x00026; Williams, 2001</xref>). In order to be eligible to participate, women needed to be married, plan to reside in the study area, understand one of the study languages (Urdu, Punjabi, or Potohari), and not require immediate medical attention. All eligible women who screened positive were invited to participate in the c-RCT and an equal number of non-depressed women in each village were recruited to participate in the follow-up study. About one out of every three non-depressed women in the villages were recruited, resulting in a 1:1 ratio of women who screened positive for depression and those who did not. After the baseline prenatal interview, women in the intervention clusters began the program; and all women were interviewed during the postnatal period. The results presented in the current paper use data from the 1154 women in the baseline sample, all of whom were interviewed during third trimester of pregnancy prior to the start of the intervention.</p></sec><sec id="s0020"><title>Measures</title><sec id="s0025"><title>Gradient indicators of socioeconomic status (SES)</title><sec id="s0030"><title>Household assets index score</title><p id="p0050">Data on assets were collected based on the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) wealth index approach (<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Rutstein &#x00026; Johnson, 2004</xref>). Questions cover domains such as ownership of land/home, animals, various household durable goods (TV, car, etc.), as well as items relating to type of home materials, access to water and sanitation. Asset data are considered one of the more valid and reliable indicators of SES, especially in LMIC, where data on factors such as income or expenditures are often unreliable (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Kolenikov &#x00026; Angeles, 2004</xref>).</p><p id="p0055">As recommended in the literature, an &#x0201c;asset index&#x0201d; was generated rather than using each asset variable separately (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Filmer and Pritchett, 2001</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Kolenikov and Angeles, 2004</xref>, <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Vyas and Kumaranayake, 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Kolenikov and Angeles, 2009</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Howe et al., 2012</xref>). To do so, categorical asset variables with more than 2 levels were transformed in to binary variables based on natural groupings agreed to by the study team (e.g. the 5 types of floor materials were combined to distinguish floors made of tiles and chips/terrazzo from all other types of flooring such as cement, bricks and mud). Using a preliminary cut of the data, items for which most (&#x0003e;90%) or few (&#x0003c;10%) owned the asset were excluded as these variables provided minimal information to distinguish between women in the study. Because the proportion of variance explained was important, the polychoric correlation principle components approach was applied to the remaining 22 binary assets using the polychoricpca command in Stata (version 14.1) (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Kolenikov &#x00026; Angeles, 2004</xref>). In simulations (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Kolenikov &#x00026; Angeles, 2009</xref>), this approach has been shown to perform better than the traditional principal components approach which uses correlations based on multivariate normality of the assets (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Filmer &#x00026; Pritchett, 2001</xref>). The first principal component was used as the asset index (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Filmer &#x00026; Pritchett, 2001</xref>); it explained 41% of the overall variability in assets. Specifically, it was used in a standardized form by subtracting the weighted mean and dividing by the weighted standard deviation (see <italic>Analysis</italic> for details of the weighting). This approach was preferred to that commonly used whereby study participants are classified in to three groups (e.g. &#x0201c;poor&#x0201d; the lowest 40%, &#x0201c;middle&#x0201d; the next 40%, and &#x0201c;rich&#x0201d; the top 20%).</p></sec><sec id="s0035"><title>Education</title><p id="p0060">Each woman reported years of education completed for herself and her husband.

We coded the education variable categorically rather than continuously to be comparable to other studies examining education gradients in health outcomes. Additional analyses using a continuous indicator of education showed a similar pattern of results with no major thresholds in the association with depression observed (results not shown).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0040"><title>Binary indicators of poverty or financial stress</title><sec id="s0045"><title>Food insecurity</title><p id="p0065">A single question asked whether the family had sufficient money to purchase food for the family during the previous month.</p><p id="p0070"><italic>Debt.</italic> A single question asked whether the household was currently in debt.

The PHQ-9 inquires about frequency of depression symptoms in the last 2 weeks; it has been validated and used extensively in the region, including in Pakistan (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Kroenke et al., 2001</xref>, <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Patel et al., 2008</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Fraz et al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Gholizadeh et al., 2017</xref>).

In the current analyses, we use both the continuous score as a representation of depression symptom severity and the dichotomized score as an indicator of a positive screen and, hence, eligible for the future intervention (<xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Sikander et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s0060"><title>Other variables</title><p id="p0080">Additional potential confounding variables used in the analysis include the woman&#x02019;s age and number of living children (parity).</p></sec><sec id="s0065"><title>Analysis</title><p id="p0085">To make the sample of 1154 women representative of the local population, we up-weighted non-depressed women to account for their sub-sampling during study sample recruitment (approximately 1 in 3) when all women were screened for depression. To do this, we created cluster-specific weights for the non-depressed (PHQ-9 score &#x0003c;10) women to match their sampling fraction, which varied slightly between clusters. All non-depressed women in a given cluster were weighted by the same value, the inverse of the proportion of non-depressed from the sample of women screened for depression that were subsequently enrolled in the study. This was in contrast to the depressed women who were all invited to participate in the c-RCT and therefore all received a weight of 1. All analyses and statistics computed using data from the 1154 women were weighted using the cluster-specific weights.</p><p id="p0090">The SES variables, PHQ-9 scores, and demographic variables (woman&#x02019;s age, parity) were summarized using means and standard deviations (SDs) for continuous variables and counts and percentages for categorical variables and were presented separately for depressed and non-depressed screened women in line with the sampling design. We then modeled the relationship between PHQ-9 total score and the SES (education and asset index) and poverty variables (debt and food insecurity) individually and in combined models using linear regression and generated figures with predicted values and 95% confidence intervals. Models with random intercepts for clusters were considered, but the random intercept covariance was estimated to be zero because the women were weighted so that the clusters were population representative and therefore the PHQ-9 score distribution was essentially the same in each cluster (i.e. there was no clustering effect on the outcome of PHQ-9 score). Therefore, linear regression was chosen. We adjusted all models for woman&#x02019;s age and number of living children, and all analyses were weighted.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0070"><title>Results</title><p id="p0095">After weighting the sample of 1154 pregnant women to make it representative of the population from which it was drawn, the women were on average 26.6 (SD=5.7; range = 18&#x02013;45) years old; 32.3% were pregnant with their first child, and 39.3% already had two or more children. Among women, 12.7% had no education, 24.2% completed at least 10<sup>th</sup> grade, and 14.2% had some tertiary education. Husbands were more likely to have at least some education, with only 6.9% having no schooling at all, but were somewhat less likely to have any tertiary education with only 6.7% having gone to college. The weighted mean standardized asset index score was 0, with a standard deviation of 1 and a range of -2.6 to 1.3.

We found that lower assets, food insecurity, and debt were independently associated with higher depression symptoms. An initial statistically significant association with educational attainment (both the woman&#x02019;s and the husband&#x02019;s) was attenuated once the other SES variables were included in the model. Furthermore, the association of the asset index score with depression symptoms was linear, with no evidence of a threshold effect. In other words, these data support the existence of an SES-mental health <italic>gradient</italic>, suggesting that binary indicators capturing poverty, while also associated with depression, do not tell the entire story. The incremental association between SES and mental health persists above a level of absolute material deprivation.</p></sec><sec id="s0085"><title>Assets</title><p id="p0130">We used the polychoric principal components analysis method to create an asset index score.

The relative homogeneity of a population can lead to small cell sizes (in a &#x02018;rich&#x02019; tertile, for example, when the majority of the population is poor), resulting in wide confidence intervals and a seemingly weak correlation between higher SES and mental health (<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Shidhaye &#x00026; Patel 2010</xref>).</p><p id="p0140">The population sample presented in the current analysis has a range of assets; for example, only 4.9% of people in the bottom quintile owned a car while, at the top, 38.7% did.</p><p id="p0145">The regression coefficient for the asset score remained stable and statistically significant even after adjusting for all other SES variables. Since household assets usually change slowly over time, the asset score itself likely captures the longer term, cumulative effects of economic stress. However, relying on only an asset score would miss the mental health consequences of recent negative shocks, such as loss of work/income or newly acquired debt. Some researchers have argued that these <italic>changes</italic> in socioeconomic indicators are more important for current mental health symptoms (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Araya et al., 2003</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Das et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p id="p0150">It is noteworthy that the continuous asset index variable revealed a gradient in the association with depression symptoms with no evidence of a threshold effect below a certain level of assets. This finding is consistent with research from HIC revealing that individuals in the top socioeconomic position have fewer health problems than those just below, even when both are well above a poverty line (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Marmot et al., 1991</xref>). Our finding suggests that the mental health gradient in LMIC may extend above a poverty line as well. Fewer LMIC studies explicitly compare whether gradient vs. threshold characterizations of SES measures are a better fit. Furthermore, although often gradient associations are reported, the common use of the term &#x02018;poverty&#x02019; implies an association driven by individuals at the very bottom of the SES scale (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Cooper et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Kang et al., 2016</xref>). In this study, 239 cases of a positive screen for depression (39.1% of total depression cases) came from women living in households above the median asset score. This population distribution reinforces the idea that interventions focused exclusively on improving the SES solely of those at the very bottom might have only a limited impact on the population prevalence of depression (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Rose 1985</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s0090"><title>Education</title><p id="p0155">Education is a commonly used marker of SES in LMIC (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Cooper et al., 2012</xref>): it is easily measured and fairly stable in adulthood; yet its relationship with an individual&#x02019;s current level of socioeconomic standing is potentially complex. It is also possible that education may affect the reporting of depression symptoms. In the analyses presented here, the woman&#x02019;s own educational attainment was more strongly correlated with her depression symptoms than her husband&#x02019;s education. There is also a gradient among women with a lowering of depression symptoms with each educational milestone. Both woman&#x02019;s and husband&#x02019;s education levels were correlated with assets, as well as with each other; and this may partially explain why education did not remain a significant contributor in the final model. Importantly, we do not interpret this finding to mean that education is not relevant for mental health; but rather that the mechanisms involved in its link to depression are potentially similar to those of assets or flow through assets. Education captures SES earlier in the life-course, and it has been interpreted as a more upstream determinant of health (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Cutler &#x00026; Lleras-Muney, 2006</xref>). If the role of education is mediated through the other domains such as current assets, then its main association is likely to be ameliorated. Additionally, educational attainment may also uniquely reflect the &#x02018;social&#x02019; component of socioeconomic status that is not well captured in the other SES measures.</p></sec><sec id="s0095"><title>Food insecurity</title><p id="p0160">The presence of food insecurity was meant to capture the experience of poverty itself (vs. an SES gradient) and so it is not surprising that its presence was correlated with the highest depression symptoms. It reflects both the low level of a basic necessity available to the family, as well as the psychological stress that this may cause, and so likely influences mental health through multiple pathways. For example, recent experimental research suggests that uncertainty about basic needs can create cognitive load, leading to suboptimal decision making in other domains of life which, in turn, can worsen poverty (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Lichand &#x00026; Mani 2016</xref>). Furthermore, evidence that the link between food insecurity and mental health varies by season, with stronger associations during times when most people in the community are food secure and weaker associations when food insecurity is more prevalent, points to the importance of one&#x02019;s social environment in either buffering or exacerbating this link with mental health (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Cole &#x00026; Tembo, 2011</xref>). Similarly, food insecurity may be especially stigmatizing to women, who may then be less likely to activate their social networks for support, leading to more distress (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Piperata, Schmeer, Rodrigues &#x00026; Salazar Torres, 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s0100"><title>Debt</title><p id="p0165">Although the presence of debt on its own is not indicative of poverty, in areas with poorly functioning credit markets and high interest rates, people may be more likely to borrow only under duress. Difficulties in paying back a loan can lead a family to deplete assets and fall deeper into a poverty trap (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Krishna, 2010</xref>). The inclusion of debt may therefore help us understand the local context better, although any findings may not be widely generalizable. Our findings of worse depression symptoms in the presence of debt are also consistent with those from a prior study in Pakistan in which women whose families were in debt and who were categorized as lower SES by the local community health worker (the study&#x02019;s definition of &#x02018;poor&#x02019;) had 3 times higher odds of having persistent depression relative to women were not considered poor (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Rahman &#x00026; Creed, 2007</xref>). Indeed, in the current study there was weak evidence that the association between debt and depression symptoms was stronger among those towards the bottom of the asset score distribution, although this difference did not reach statistical significance (results not shown). Even in contexts outside of poor functioning credit markets, having debt can cause psychological distress. For example, in one poverty alleviation intervention that provided even low-interest loans in South Africa, the authors found that stress levels increased among those receiving the new loans (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Fernald, Hamad, Karlan, Ozer &#x00026; Zinman, 2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s0105"><title>Limitations</title><p id="p0170">The current study has several limitations. We were not able to examine the contribution of other SES indicators such as income, expenditure, employment, or occupation. The majority of women in this sample were not able to estimate either the household income (62% were not able to provide this information) or expenditure (53% were not able to). Concerns about the accuracy of expenditure data have been raised before (<xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Xu, Ravndal, Evans &#x00026; Carrin, 2009</xref>); and in this study area, financial matters, including food shopping, are more commonly handled by men. Although this is not unique to a rural Pakistan setting, it does present a challenge in research specific to income/expenditure and women&#x02019;s mental health in such settings. Additionally, in this sample there was little variation in employment or occupation indicators: 91% of husbands were employed; all of them were manual laborers. Only 6% of the women were employed outside the household. Our analyses also only focused on a narrow set of social disadvantage factors related to socioeconomic status. Other social vulnerability factors such as exposure to intimate partner violence, lack of empowerment, or pressure to have male children are also strongly associated with women&#x02019;s mental health and may be potential sources of omitted variable bias/confounding in our results. Our team&#x02019;s ongoing research is examining the contribution of these factors to maternal mental health. Our study population comprises entirely of pregnant women so the findings should not be generalized beyond this population. Given the cross-sectional, observational nature of these data, we make no claims about the causal relationship, or its direction, between the SES variables and depression symptoms. There is growing evidence illustrating how both the social selection (mental health problems leading to lower SES) and social causation (lower SES causing mental health problems) pathways can simultaneously create the observed association between SES and mental health, both in high and low income countries (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Lund et al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Quidt and Haushofer, 2016</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0110"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="p0175">Together, the asset, debt, and food insecurity indicators in this study explained about 13% of the variance in the depression symptoms, which is more than what has been reported in high income countries or for non-mental health outcomes (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Glymour &#x00026; Rudolph, 2016</xref>). This is consistent with the idea that mental health may be more sensitive to the social context and might even be on the pathway between low socioeconomic status and physical health problems such as cardiovascular disease. For example, the stress and worry associated with lower socioeconomic status may in itself be an important independent mechanism leading to worse mental and physical health (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Reading &#x00026; Reynolds, 2001</xref>).</p><p id="p0180">Recent evidence from experimental interventions may be able to contribute key data towards estimating the relative contribution of each link in the SES-mental health cycle: There are a growing number of (a) poverty reduction programs that assess mental health outcomes and (b) mental health interventions that assess economic outcomes (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Lund et al., 2011</xref>). For example, Mexico&#x02019;s Opportunidades conditional cash transfer program has shown improved mental health outcomes, although not all programs have been successful (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Ozer et al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Madhani et al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Green et al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Kilburn et al., 2016</xref>). Evaluations of the economic impact of mental health interventions (addressing the social drift hypothesis) are still relatively rare. A few studies have reported improvements in patient employment levels post intervention (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Hu, Wang &#x00026; Fu, 2007</xref>), ability to participate in economic activities (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Bolton et al., 2003</xref>), or increased financial empowerment (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Baranov, Bhalotra, Biroli &#x00026; Maselko, 2017</xref>), but others have not found an association (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Lund et al., 2011</xref>). In the current sample, formal labor participation by all women is very low, and one might argue that the household indicators of SES are largely outside of her control. This would make the social drift mechanism a somewhat less likely explanation for our findings. Looking forward, analyses based on experimental studies have significant potential to elucidate both the social causation and social drift pathways (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">De Silva, 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Lund, 2015</xref>).</p><p id="p0185">Independent of the contribution of each causal pathway, the data presented here strongly support the idea of a gradient between different socioeconomic indicators and depression symptoms. While a dichotomous poverty measure may be easier to measure and perhaps more likely to yield a larger and statistically significant correlation with mental health, it is not ideal for gaining a better understanding of the nature of the association between lower socioeconomic status and mental health. We hence strongly recommend that, whenever possible, indicators of socioeconomic status be presented in a gradient, and not dichotomous, fashion in order to gain the most from the available data.</p><p id="p0190">Our findings are also consistent with the idea that various domains of SES, such as assets and food insecurity, potentially have independent pathways leading to mental health. A better understanding of any underlying relationship will also result from a deeper understanding of the theoretical basis, and lived experience, of a given socioeconomic indicator (e.g. (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Mill, 1865</xref>, <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Sen, 1999</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Banerjee &#x00026; Duflo, 2011</xref>)). Health researchers are generally not exposed to this wider literature (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Araya&#x000a0;et al., 2003</xref>), leading to a critique that convenience of measurement has guided choice of SES measures and not their theorized associations with other variables of interest (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Cooper et al., 2012</xref>). Future research that measures SES with multiple, theoretically anchored, domains holds the most promise in improving our understanding of the nature of the SES-mental health relationship.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="bibliog0005"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Araya</surname><given-names>R.</given-names></name><name><surname>Lewis</surname><given-names>G.</given-names></name><name><surname>Rojas</surname><given-names>G.</given-names></name><name><surname>Fritsch</surname><given-names>R.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Education and income: Which is more important for mental health?</article-title><source>Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health</source><volume><bold>57</bold></volume><issue>7</issue><year>2003</year><fpage>501</fpage><lpage>505</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">12821693</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib2"><mixed-citation publication-type="other" id="othref0005">Banerjee, A. and Duflo E.
