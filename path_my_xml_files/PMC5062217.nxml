Exchange of endotracheal tube (ETT) with Classic laryngeal mask airway (LMA&#x02122;) prior to emergence from anesthesia also serves similar purpose.

The American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) I and II patients between age range of 20&#x02013;50 years and weighing 40&#x02013;60 kg, who gave informed consent, were included in the study. Patients with predicted difficult airway and those who refused to participate were excluded from the study. Patients were randomly divided into two groups of 50 patients each on the basis of extubation methodology, using random computerized table. The two groups were OPA group, in which OPA&#x02122; was placed before extubation and LMA group, in which LMA&#x02122; was placed before extubation.</p><p>All the patients were premedicated with midazolam 0.025 mg/kg intravenous (i.v.), fentanyl 2 &#x000b5;g/kg i.v., and ondansetron 0.1 mg/kg i.v. 15 min before induction of anesthesia. Anesthesia was induced with propofol 2 mg/kg i.v., and neuromuscular blockade was achieved with vecuronium bromide 0.1 mg/kg i.v. After achieving adequate relaxation, trachea was intubated, and anesthesia was maintained with a step down technique of propofol infusion (10 mg/kg/h for initial 15 min, 8 mg/kg/h for the next 15 min, and thereafter 5 mg/kg/h i.v. via syringe pump, until the conclusion of surgery). In addition, all patients received 66% of N<sub>2</sub>O in O<sub>2</sub> and muscle relaxant top-up doses as per peripheral nerve stimulator. After the conclusion of surgery, N<sub>2</sub>O was discontinued, but propofol was continued to run at the rate of 5 mg/kg/h. In OPA group, Guedel's OPA&#x02122; (size 3) was placed while in LMA group, LMA&#x02122; (size 3) was placed, but the cuff remained un-inflated. Residual neuromuscular block was now reversed using a mixture of neostigmine (2.5 mg) and glycopyrrolate (0.4 mg). Adequate reversal of neuromuscular block was confirmed by a train of four ratios &#x0003e;0.9 and return of adequate tidal volume. ETT was now removed keeping OPA&#x02122;/LMA&#x02122; in place. In OPA group, facemask breathing was now commenced with OPA&#x02122; in place. In contrast, in patients of LMA group, the cuff of LMA&#x02122; was now inflated with 20 mL air and the breathing system connected to laryngeal mask. An adequate and smooth, spontaneous respiration was reconfirmed clinically and by capnography. If inadequate, OPA&#x02122;/LMA&#x02122; was removed and reinserted. Propofol was now discontinued, and the patient continued to breathe 100% of O<sub>2</sub>. After full awakening, OPA&#x02122;/LMA&#x02122; was removed. During this period of exchange of ETT with OPA&#x02122;/LMA&#x02122;, patient's hemodynamic parameters, i.e., heart rate (HR) and systolic blood pressure (SBP) were recorded just before OPA&#x02122;/LMA&#x02122; placement, post-OPA&#x02122;/LMA&#x02122; placement, preextubation, postextubation, and thereafter at 3 and 5 min, immediately after OPA&#x02122;/LMA&#x02122; removal, and after 3 and 5 min. Any episode of coughing/bucking during OPA&#x02122;/LMA&#x02122; placement, ETT and OPA&#x02122;/LMA&#x02122; removal were recorded. Coughing/bucking was graded as - Grade I, if there was no coughing/bucking, Grade II, if there was mild coughing/bucking (&#x0003c;5 cough) and Grade III, if there was severe bout of coughing/bucking/laryngospasm (&#x0003e;5 cough).</p><p>Postoperative sore throat was recorded in the immediate postoperative period by an independent observer after 1 h. The absence of sore throat was recorded as Grade I. Sore throat which was less severe than common cold was Grade II, that was similar to common cold was Grade III, and one which was more severe than common cold was Grade IV.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The primary outcome measured was change in hemodynamic parameters while secondary outcome included coughing/bucking and postoperative sore throat for both the groups.</p><p>We conducted a pilot study with seven patients in each group and presuming the difference in the SBP and effect size obtained to be true, with &#x003b1; error of 0.05 and &#x003b2; error of 0.8, calculated that 41 patients in each group would be required for the study. Fifty patients were taken in each group to compensate for dropouts.</p><p>All data in the tables have been presented as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation.

The value of <italic>Z</italic> &#x0003e; 1.96 was considered statistically significant.

The average age of patients in OPA group was 35.6 years (range 25&#x02013;45.6 years), and LMA group was 36.9 years (range 25.4&#x02013;44.8 years).</p><p>In both the groups, hemodynamic parameters rose significantly as OPA&#x02122;/LMA&#x02122; was placed (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) and then started declining. Again, there was an insignificant rise in both the parameters on extubation. Thereafter, in OPA group, hemodynamic parameters continued to rise after extubation and declined only when OPA was removed. However, in LMA group, hemodynamic parameters started declining after extubation and continued to fall thereafter [Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>].</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Changes in systolic blood pressure during periextubation period</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AER-10-552-g001"/></table-wrap><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Changes in heart rate during periextubation period</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AER-10-552-g002"/></table-wrap><p>None of the patients of both the study groups had coughing or bucking during the placement of OPA&#x02122;/LMA&#x02122; as well as during the removal of ETT.

This could be secondary to rigid nature of the device with a relatively blunt end. Hemodynamic parameters continued to rise in these patients even after extubation. This could be attributed to the plastic material and rigid structure of Guedel's OPA&#x02122; that gives continuous irritation to the supraglottic structures in an awakening patient. Moreover, the occasional push is needed to maintain the position of the device in place. Fall of hemodynamic parameters started only after the removal of OPA&#x02122;.</p><p>As the LMA&#x02122; was inserted in LMA group patients, a significant rise of hemodynamic parameters was seen. This might be attributed to the standard technique of insertion of LMA&#x02122; that requires finger support. After extubation, hemodynamic parameters started declining. Minimal changes in SBP and HR following the removal of LMA&#x02122;, in this study, are in accordance to the previous findings that removal of an LMA&#x02122; is associated with significantly reduced hemodynamic responses.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>None of the patients of both study groups had coughing or bucking during the placement of LMA&#x02122;/OPA&#x02122; and this might be due to the use of propofol with its known ability to suppress the cough reflex during upper airway manipulation. In contrast, Takita <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] recorded 33.3% of incidence of coughing/bucking during placement of CLMA&#x02122;, using variable concentration of sevoflurane for maintenance of anesthesia. We did not observe higher incidence of coughing/bucking as fixed dose of propofol was used in present study.</p><p>The incidence of smooth removal of CLMA&#x02122; was better than OPA&#x02122;, the difference being insignificant. The findings of this study are in agreement with other studies which reported occasional coughing during removal of laryngeal mask.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>The majority of patients (50%) in both the groups had no postoperative sore throat. This might be attributed to the fact that extubation of ETT was done over LMA&#x02122; or on OPA&#x02122; and thus avoided straining on tube.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Postoperative sore throat is also dependent on the duration of insertion[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and cuff pressure of ETT.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] In our study, we did not measure the duration of insertion and cuff pressure.</p><p>There has been no reported study comparing OPA&#x02122; and LMA&#x02122; for hemodynamic changes during exchange with ETT. We have shown that between OPA&#x02122; and LMA&#x02122;, latter provides significantly better hemodynamic control.</p><p>There is a natural hesitancy to perform ETT/LMA&#x02122; exchange as the procedure involves jeopardizing a secure airway. Further, malpositioning of LMA&#x02122; may be considered as a risk involved in such exchange. Malpositioning occurs due to the insufficient insertion depth of LMA or epiglottis blocking the glottis even when LMA is fully inserted.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>However, studies have reported adequate spontaneous respiration on LMA even in the presence of any malpositioning.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Therefore, any concerns due to above are misplaced.</p><p>Pharmacological agents though are effective in controlling hemodynamic changes are costly with variable success rate. Shorter acting opioids such as remifentanil, alfentanil, inhalational agents such as desflurane, isoflurane sevoflurane, though prevent hemodynamic changes, are associated with prolonged sedation.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Vasodilators such as sodium nitroprusside, nitroglycerine, and hydralazine, are associated with reflexive tachycardia and increase in the plasma renin activity.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] &#x003b2;-blocker labetalol is low-potency drug[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] while esmolol is associated with bradycardia, hypotension, and conduction defects.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Calcium channel blockers have been associated with dose-dependent cerebral vasodilation, inhibition of autoregulation, and hypotension.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Dexmedetomidine in infusion can cause bradycardia and prolonged sedation.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Moreover, their exact dosage and administration times are still debated.</p><p>There are certain limitations of this study. ETT/LMA exchange should always be attempted under adequate anesthesia. Otherwise, this method offers no advantage.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Although we could not measure the depth of anesthesia due to nonavailability of bispectral index monitoring in our institute, but we had used propofol infusion to maintain adequate depth of anesthesia. Moreover, we conducted the study on ASA I/II patients who can tolerate the hemodynamic variations associated with extubation. However, this study would be more useful in ASA III/IV, cardiac, or neurosurgical patients. Both LMA&#x02122; as well as OPA&#x02122; are reusable after autoclaving and carry the risk of infection with prion disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion"
