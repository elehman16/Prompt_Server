The neuromuscular elements required to arrest a fall are more impaired in people with knee OA compared to their asymptomatic counterparts. Therefore, these elements may need to be incorporated into an exercise intervention to reduce the risk of falling. The aim of this study will be to examine the feasibility, safety and patient satisfaction of a high-speed resistance-training program, with and without balance exercises, in people with knee OA compared to a control group.

Thirty people with knee osteoarthritis aged 60&#x02013;90 years will be recruited and randomized to one of the three groups. Feasibility and safety will be assessed by examining adherence to the exercise program, dropout rate, pain level during and following exercise, number of exercises stopped due to pain, and any adverse event or any incident that prevents the participant from completing the prescribed exercise. Secondary measures of lower-limb strength, physical function, self-reported pain and function, fear of falls, and executive function and quality of life will also be assessed.

Knee osteoarthritis (OA), a common painful, debilitating and life-altering joint disease, is present in 50% of adults over 65&#x000a0;years of age. The prevalence of falls in people with OA is substantially higher than in older individuals generally (30%), with approximately 50&#x02013;60% of those with knee OA over the age of 60&#x000a0;years reporting one or more falls each year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. However, despite the high prevalence of falls in people with knee OA, the mechanism of falling in this group is unclear. Moreover, there are no randomized controlled trials demonstrating the effectiveness of different types of exercise or other fall-prevention approaches in reducing falls in people with OA.</p><p id="Par23">Aging is associated with neuromuscular changes that affect the ability to maintain dynamic postural control during imbalance episodes such as slower muscle response, poorer muscle strength and muscle power. In people with knee OA, these neuromuscular deficits might be more impaired, leading to a greater risk of falling when rapid balance recovery responses are required such as when falling. In our previous research, we found that when simulating a forward fall, those with knee OA demonstrated slower step responses and an impaired ability of the knee joint to absorb impact forces and slow down the body&#x02019;s forward momentum to arrest a fall [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. These biomechanical responses observed in people with knee OA might be related to loss of muscle power, especially the quadriceps, which is the most commonly affected muscle in this patient group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Muscle power reflects the ability of the muscle to produce force rapidly. Given that recovering balance requires a rapid response, exercises that target fast muscle activation might be effective in maintaining adequate muscle function to prevent falls in older people and in those with knee OA.</p><p id="Par24">Exercise interventions that focus on balance exercises have been shown to be effective in reducing falls for older people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, there is no evidence to suggest that current fall-prevention programs will be effective for people with knee OA. Moreover, existing exercise-based fall-prevention programs mainly focus on maintenance of balance and do not focus on training the neuromuscular elements required to arrest a fall. The neuromuscular elements required to arrest a fall are more impaired in people with knee OA compared to their asymptomatic counterparts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. To recover balance from falling, adequate muscle force and joint power generation is required [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. This is adversely affected by OA. Hence, these unique factors and the associated pain must be taken into account in the design of fall-prevention strategies in this high-risk group. Consequently, development of an exercise approach aimed at reducing falls that is specifically designed to address these neuromuscular factors for people with knee OA is essential.</p><p id="Par25">In this study we aim to examine the feasibility, safety and patient satisfaction of a high-speed resistance-training program, with and without balance exercises, in people with knee OA compared to a control group. Given the pain associated with knee OA, it is crucial to determine what effect high-speed resistance training that focuses on muscle power has on knee pain. This is of particular importance as this mode of exercise may potentially increase impact load on the knee joint due to the rapid and powerful movements involved. Therefore, feasibility and safety of the proposed exercise intervention must be assessed to determine if this exercise approach is safe to prescribe for those with knee OA. The effect of the exercise interventions on strength, physiological and functional risk factors for falls, pain, and executive function will also be assessed to provide data to support a sample size calculation for a fully powered trial.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par26">All procedures involved in this trial will be conducted in compliance with the National Statement on Ethical Human Resource and the Australian Code for the Responsible Conduct of Research.

The groups will be assessed before and after the 8-week program to examine the effect of the intervention on pain, adherence to the intervention, lower-limb muscle strength, physiological and functional risk factors for falls, executive function, fear of falling, quality of life and participant perceptions of the interventions.</p><sec id="Sec4"><title>Participants</title><p id="Par28">Participants aged 60&#x02013;90 years with knee OA who have had a fall in the previous 12&#x000a0;months, or who are concerned about having a fall, will be recruited.
