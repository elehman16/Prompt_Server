We assessed the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a brief psychological treatment (Healthy Activity Program [HAP]) for delivery by lay counsellors to patients with moderately severe to severe depression in primary health-care settings.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In this randomised controlled trial, we recruited participants aged 18&#x02013;65 years scoring more than 14 on the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9) indicating moderately severe to severe depression from ten primary health centres in Goa, India. Pregnant women or patients who needed urgent medical attention or were unable to communicate clearly were not eligible. Participants were randomly allocated (1:1) to enhanced usual care (EUC) alone or EUC combined with HAP in randomly sized blocks (block size four to six [two to four for men]), stratified by primary health centre and sex, and allocation was concealed with use of sequential numbered opaque envelopes. Physicians providing EUC were masked. Primary outcomes were depression symptom severity on the Beck Depression Inventory version II and remission from depression (PHQ-9 score of &#x0003c;10) at 3 months in the intention-to-treat population, assessed by masked field researchers. Secondary outcomes were disability, days unable to work, behavioural activation, suicidal thoughts or attempts, intimate partner violence, and resource use and costs of illness. We assessed serious adverse events in the per-protocol population. This trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN95149997.</p></sec><sec><title>Findings</title><p>Between Oct 28, 2013, and July 29, 2015, we enrolled and randomly allocated 495 participants (247 [50%] to the EUC plus HAP group [two of whom were subsequently excluded because of protocol violations] and 248 [50%] to the EUC alone group), of whom 466 (95%) completed the 3 month primary outcome assessment (230 [49%] in the EUC plus HAP group and 236 [51%] in the EUC alone group).

We supplemented this evidence with searches of PubMed and PsycINFO from Jan 1, 2009, to Jan 1, 2011, with no language restrictions, as well as hand searching reference lists of selected papers, contacting key informants, and visiting key libraries in the region. Structured psychological treatments based on cognitive behavioural or interpersonal theories are recommended as first-line interventions by WHO's Mental Health Gap Action Programme for moderate to severe depression. Simpler versions of these treatments, such as behavioural activation, are as effective as are more elaborate versions, such as cognitive behaviour therapy. However, the existing evidence has limited generalisability to many low-income and middle-income countries where both supply side (low availability of mental health professionals) and demand side (low levels of mental health literacy) barriers lead to large treatment gaps.</p><p><bold>Added value of this study</bold></p><p>This study is the first report of findings from any low-income and middle-income country assessing the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a psychological treatment for moderately severe to severe depression in primary care.

Additionally, we condensed delivery of the core intervention strategies from the normal 20&#x02013;24-session format<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> into a six-session to eight-session protocol. We delivered HAP in an individual format, each lasting 30&#x02013;40 min, with initial sessions at weekly intervals. We typically conducted sessions face-to-face, at the PHC or patient's home, but used telephone sessions when necessary. The beginning phase focused on orientation to treatment, a multisession middle phase focused on teaching of core intervention strategies, and a late phase focused on review of gains and termination. The middle phase could be extended by up to two additional sessions for patients who did not show sufficient improvement (consistently high PHQ-9 scores and absence of activation), allowing a maximum of eight sessions. Patients who did not respond could be referred for specialist care. We considered patients who met treatment goals or completed the maximum number of sessions or were referred to specialists to have a planned discharge; we considered all other patients to have an unplanned discharge.</p><p>A detailed description of counsellor selection and training is provided elsewhere.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> An international expert in behavioural activation (SD) trained and provided ongoing supervision for five local specialists, who in turn provided onsite training and supervision for lay counsellors. Training of lay counsellors involved a 3 week participatory workshop covering both HAP and CAP treatments, followed by an internship phase of 6 months, in which trainee counsellors delivered the treatment to eligible patients in primary health-care clinics, combined with peer-led group supervision as the trainees gained experience in delivery of the treatment.<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> 11 counsellors who met competency standards as assessed by standardised roleplays and therapy quality measures participated in the trial.

Secondary outcomes were disability on the WHO Disability Assessment Schedule II and total days unable to work in the previous month, behavioural activation on the five-item abbreviated Activation Scale based on the Behavioural Activation for Depression Scale-Short Form, suicidal thoughts or attempts in the past 3 months, intimate partner violence (not a prespecified hypothesis), and resource use and costs of illness estimated from the Client Service Receipt Inventory.<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> We assessed behavioural activation concurrently with the primary outcome, precluding drawing of any causal inference. Concurrent assessment of mediator and outcome provides only a very weak test of mediation and we are hesitant to report findings in that regard since we consider them potentially misleading. Instead, we have reframed behavioural activation as a putative target of the treatment rather than an outcome in its own right. We will be examining the potential mediating role of behavioural activation on the effect of intervention at 12 months separately. All adaptations to outcomes, including the decision to drop the item enquiring about sexual drive (because of cultural sensitivity considerations), were finalised and approved by the Trial Steering Committee and the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee before the start of the trial.

We assessed serious adverse events in the per-protocol population. All models adjusted for PHC as a fixed effect to allow for within-PHC clustering and adjusted for baseline PHQ-9 scores. For continuous outcomes, we estimated intervention effects using linear regression and reported them as adjusted mean differences (AMDs) and effect sizes, with 95% CIs.

Thus, we carried out a sensitivity analysis as a multilevel model with both PHC and counsellor included as random effects. Sensitivity analyses also included complete case analyses.

We derived quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) scores using an approach previously used in India.<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> We bootstrapped incremental cost-effectiveness ratios to derive 95% CIs. We explored statistical uncertainty around the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios through cost-effectiveness acceptability curves showing the likelihood that HAP would be cost-effective at different levels of willingness to pay. We did post-hoc analyses of remission as defined by a PHQ-9 score of less than 5 or a 50% reduction in score as a stringent indicator of remission. We did all statistical analyses using Excel 2016, SPSS 21, and Stata 14. All costs are presented in 2015 international dollars. A Data and Safety Monitoring Committee oversaw the trial.

The internal consistency (Cronbach's &#x003b1;) observed in this study was 0&#x000b7;86 for PHQ-9 and 0&#x000b7;91 for BDI-II. Of the 245 participants in the HAP group, 169 (69%) had a planned discharge, of whom seven (4%) were referred for specialist care. Their median number of sessions was six (IQR five to seven). 61 (25%) received more than the optimal dose of six sessions. Patients with an unplanned discharge were likely to stop attending early (median one session [IQR none to two]). Of the total 1181 sessions delivered, 1133 (96%) were face-to-face. Although 173 (77%) of the 226 first sessions (typically on the day when patients were enrolled) took place in the PHC, 522 (91%) of the 575 subsequent sessions were delivered at home. 51 (21%) of participants had a significant other involved in at least one session. The mean session duration was 40&#x000b7;2 min (95% CI 39&#x000b7;1&#x02013;41&#x000b7;4). Mean TQS score was 2&#x000b7;58 (2&#x000b7;53&#x02013;2&#x000b7;64) on the basis of peer supervisor ratings (n=186), similar to expert supervisor ratings (n=186; mean 2&#x000b7;55 [2&#x000b7;47&#x02013;2&#x000b7;62]) and the mean score of the independent rater (n=100; mean 2&#x000b7;76 [2&#x000b7;69&#x02013;2&#x000b7;82]), indicating good to average therapy quality. The most frequently endorsed HAP elements by the counsellor at the end of treatment were activation (178 [73%]), followed by problem solving (62 [25%]). 31 (13%) of 245 investigators were unmasked, with 16 (7%) unmasked before the primary outcome assessment.</p><p>From the health system perspective, the total health-care cost per person, including the intervention cost, was significantly higher in the EUC plus HAP group than in the EUC alone group, with significantly better QALY scores (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">table 3</xref>). Excluding the cost of intervention, the use and thus cost of other health-care service costs was not different between groups. Health system planners will need to consider whether or not the additional budgetary costs of investment in HAP are worth the health improvements gained. One aid to decision making is assessment of cost-effectiveness; an incremental cost per QALY gained of less than gross domestic product per capita has been considered to be highly cost-effective.<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref> HAP has a favourable cost per QALY gained (<xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">table 4</xref>) as GDP per capita in the state of Goa in 2015 was $16 060.<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref></p><p><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> provides a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve, indicating that HAP has an 87% chance of being considered cost-effective from a health system perspective in the state of Goa. No consensus exists on the cost-effectiveness thresholds per additional remission at 3 months on the PHQ-9 scale, but as <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">table 4</xref> shows, the incremental costs are modest; if society is willing to pay up to the equivalent of 1 month's wages in Goa for an unskilled manual worker per remission ($415),<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref> HAP has a 99% chance of being cost-effective (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>). The cost per BDI-II point improvement was $6, approximately one third of the daily wages of an unskilled worker in Goa. From a societal perspective, productivity losses due to days unable to work and work cutback are significantly lower in the EUC plus HAP group than in the EUC alone group (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">table 3</xref>), which means that the overall costs of HAP are no longer significantly different to those in the EUC alone group. This finding means that HAP then has a 98% chance of being cost-effective and a 42% chance of being cost saving&#x02014;ie, having lower costs and better outcomes than has EUC alone, with similar results for remission and BDI-II outcomes (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="cesec100"><title>Discussion</title><p>HAP as delivered by non-specialist health workers in routine primary care settings is effective in treatment of moderately severe and severe depression. HAP produced a moderate effect on depressive symptoms, an almost two-thirds increase in remission, and small effects on secondary outcomes related to functional impairment after only six to eight sessions of treatment. Baseline severity slightly moderated the effects of treatment; as in other trials,<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr"><sup>36</sup></xref> the magnitude of the effect was largest among participants with severe depression, but unlike those other trials, the effect is also present among those less severely depressed. The economic analysis per QALY gained indicates that HAP is cost-effective; when wide societal effects on productivity are considered, the economic case is further strengthened, with a high probability that the intervention could be cost saving. The numbers of serious adverse events observed were small and consistent with our observations in a previous trial<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr"><sup>37</sup></xref> in primary care with patients with common mental disorders.</p><p>The effect of HAP on secondary outcomes is important for multiple reasons. Functional impairment can persist after a major depressive episode and represents an important target of treatment. The pragmatic emphasis on behaviour change in HAP might be valuable to guide individuals with depression to improve functional capacity and capacity to work. Moreover, most patients with depression are women and the association between sex disadvantage and depression among women has been widely documented.<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr"><sup>38</sup></xref> Women who received HAP were nearly 50% less likely to report intimate partner physical violence at the end of treatment than were women in usual care. The focus of HAP on improvement of life context and problem solving directly targets many of the components of sex disadvantage that have been associated with depression among women, including those that are specific to the family and interpersonal context.<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr"><sup>38</sup></xref> This finding should be interpreted with caution and examined further in future trials. The economic case will be strengthened if differences in health service use and productivity are sustained over time. The marginal costs of HAP delivery would also fall once a pool of trained lay counsellors has been established that can continue to provide services. Moreover, the effect of HAP on depression outcomes was similar to that of other studies of behavioural activation and cognitive and behavioural interventions delivered by specialist providers over more sessions than in this study.<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr"><sup>39</sup></xref></p><p>The study has certain limitations. First, even though HAP was better than what is usually done, about a third of participants remained depressed even after treatment. Our emphasis on the brevity of the intervention could possibly have resulted in this less than optimal absolute effect. Still, we believe at the very least that HAP would be a suitable candidate for the initial intervention in a stepped care system of treatment delivery for severe depression.<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr"><sup>40</sup></xref> Second, our two measures of depression were somewhat discordant at the end of treatment; thus, although BDI-II scores suggested that patients ended treatment at the low end of the moderate range of severity (on the basis of the norms used in trials in high-income countries),<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr"><sup>41</sup></xref> PHQ-9 indicated only mild residual symptoms. We have more confidence in PHQ-9 than in BDI-II in this regard as it has been used extensively cross-culturally and validated in the study setting.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> Furthermore, we caution against application of the existing norms to our study population as BDI-II was administered in an interview format rather than as self-report. Third, diagnostic interviews were not carried out at baseline, although PHQ-9 is widely used to define case-level morbidity in trials and, importantly, we used locally validated cutoffs in this study.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> Finally, the results in this study are restricted to the primary endpoint outcomes at 3 months for which our interest lies in the response and remission to our treatment of participants with moderately severe to severe depression. We intend to assess the sustainability of these outcomes, including recovery from depression, at a 12 month follow-up.</p><p>The findings of this trial, along with the companion trial<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> assessing CAP treatment, represent a substantial step in global mental health for several reasons. First, the interventions are brief, delivered by lay people and provided to primary health-care attenders with almost no exclusion criteria, thus enhancing their generalisability. Second, treatment was delivered by the same counsellors who concurrently delivered treatment for alcohol problems. We have thus shown the potential real-world value of our study to address the most common mental health and substance use disorders encountered in primary care by a single counsellor. However, the real-world responsibilities of such a counsellor could potentially extend to other mental disorders, such as psychoses, and future implementation research would need to address how the PREMIUM treatments can be integrated with these broad roles. Third, the treatment was adapted from behavioural activation, a treatment that has a strong theoretical and empirical evidence base across multiple countries and patient populations.<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> Findings from the COBRA trial<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr"><sup>42</sup></xref> from the UK have further substantiated the equivalence of this simpler psychological treatment with more elaborate treatments such as cognitive behavioural therapy. Fourth, the conduct and analyses of the trials were carried out in adherence with the protocol and the trial indicators testify to high levels of internal validity. Finally, the target population has very low levels of awareness of depression as a mental health condition and virtually all participants primarily present for somatic concerns.<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr"><sup>43</sup></xref> Few, if any, would have had a previous diagnosis of depression or received a psychological treatment or antidepressants, as evidenced by the low number of prescriptions, even after the diagnosis was conveyed to the primary care physician.<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr"><sup>44</sup></xref> Ratings of therapy quality, both independent and by supervisors, and the high levels of treatment completion testify to the acceptability and feasibility of this non-specialist-delivered treatment, even in this previously untreated population.</p><p>This particular trial represents, to our knowledge, the first ever publication from any low-income and middle-income country assessing the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a psychological treatment for moderately severe to severe depression in primary care. Further research should focus on replication of our findings and dissemination of HAP in routine care settings in diverse contexts. Our dissemination efforts for HAP include launching of an online platform for those interested to learn the treatment<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> and collaborations to reverse engineer the treatment by assessing its effects in high-income settings, such as in the USA.
