</p></sec><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Plaque psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory disease affecting approximately 3% of adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] that substantially impacts quality of life (QoL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Psoriasis involvement in distinct body regions differentially affects patient QoL. Lesions on the face and scalp have a more negative impact on QoL because of their high visibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Treatment responsiveness also varies by location; areas such as the head and neck are more difficult to treat than other body regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>Treatment efficacy in clinical trials is commonly evaluated using the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI), which quantifies disease burden based on severity of erythema, desquamation, and induration, and extent of psoriatic lesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, overall PASI score is weighted only by regional body surface area (BSA), failing to account for the disproportionate burden in more visible/sensitive locations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The burden of psoriasis may be related to disease location and impact on QoL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>The relationship between treatment efficacy in different body regions and patient-reported QoL is clinically relevant, but represents a critical gap in psoriasis research. Improvements in the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) significantly correlate with PASI responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. However, the relationship between QoL and regional disease severity has not been examined. In the REVEAL trial, the tumor necrosis factor inhibitor adalimumab significantly improved clinical disease activity vs. placebo in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Using REVEAL data, we performed an exploratory analysis of regional PASI score improvements and examined their relationship with disease-related QoL.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study Design</title><p>REVEAL was a 52-week, phase III, randomized study conducted in USA and Canada (NCT00237887). Patient-level data from the 16-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment period (Period A) were obtained for this analysis. Study design and patient details were previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Briefly, patients were randomized 2:1 to receive subcutaneous adalimumab (80&#x000a0;mg at week 0, followed by 40&#x000a0;mg every other week) or placebo for 16&#x000a0;weeks. Enrolled patients were aged &#x02265;18&#x000a0;years with a clinical diagnosis of psoriasis &#x02265;6&#x000a0;months and stable moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis for &#x02265;2&#x000a0;months before screening, defined as an affected BSA &#x02265;10%, PASI score &#x02265;12, and a Physician&#x02019;s Global Assessment of at least moderate severity at baseline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study Assessments</title><p>Clinical efficacy was assessed using PASI score (ranging from 0&#x02013;72), a composite index based on lesion severity and percentage of BSA involved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Regional PASI scores were calculated for head, trunk, upper extremities, and lower extremities as the sum of the degree of severity of erythema, induration, and desquamation (0, none; 1, slight; 2, moderate; 3, severe; 4, very severe), multiplied by the estimated BSA involved (0, none; 1, &#x0003c;10%; 2, 10&#x02013;29%; 3, 30&#x02013;49%; 4, 50&#x02013;69%; 5, 70&#x02013;89%; and 6, 90&#x02013;100%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Overall PASI score was calculated as a weighted sum of regional PASI scores based on surface area (head, 0.1; upper extremities, 0.2; trunk, 0.3; lower extremities, 0.4). Regional and overall PASI mean percentage improvements from baseline were calculated; percentages of patients achieving &#x02265;75, &#x02265;90, or 100% improvement relative to baseline (PASI 75/90/100) were determined.</p><p>Patient-reported QoL outcomes were evaluated using the DLQI questionnaire to assess the extent skin problems affect QoL. The DLQI consists of ten items answered on a scale of 0 for &#x0201c;not at all&#x0201d; to 3 for &#x0201c;very much&#x0201d; (0&#x02013;30) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Scores of 0/1 reflect no negative effect on QoL; scores &#x0003e;10 indicate a greater negative impact on QoL. DLQI change from baseline and percentage of patients achieving a score of 0/1 were calculated.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Analyses were performed on the intent-to-treat population from Period A, defined as all patients randomized at baseline. Percentage improvement and PASI 75/90/100 responses were determined for patients with non-zero baseline values. Mean percentage changes from baseline in PASI and DLQI were compared using one-way analysis of variance. Differences in PASI responses were compared between treatment groups using Fisher&#x02019;s exact test. Correlation between change from baseline PASI score and DLQI score at week 16 was analyzed using a Pearson correlation coefficient. Missing data were imputed using last observation carried forward for continuous variables or non-responder imputation for categorical variables.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>Patients</title><p>As previously reported, demographics and baseline disease characteristics for the 1212 patients enrolled in REVEAL were balanced across adalimumab (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;814) and placebo (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;398) groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

</p><p>Achieving a DLQI score of 0/1 after 16&#x000a0;weeks of treatment with adalimumab was associated with improvements in overall and regional PASI scores (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b). The correlation between change from baseline in PASI score and change from baseline in DLQI score at week 16 was significant for the overall PASI score and for all body regions (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001).

For the head, trunk, and lower extremities, achieving a PASI 100 vs. a PASI &#x0003c;100 response had a major impact on the percentage of patients achieving a DLQI score of 0/1.

Serious adverse events occurred in 2% of patients in either group. Serious infections occurred in 0.6 and 1.0% of patients receiving adalimumab and placebo respectively. No patients had an adverse event of tuberculosis in the double-blind period. Two patients in the adalimumab group and one in the placebo group had malignancies other than non-melanoma skin cancer.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Discussion</title><p>Understanding the impact of regional psoriasis severity on QoL and its response to therapeutics is critical for identifying therapies that maximize clinical outcomes and QoL. Overall, these results showed that adalimumab provided significant clinical improvements across body regions and was associated with improved QoL. Clinical improvements occurred rapidly (significant PASI improvements occurred by week 4 across all regions) and regional PASI scores improved significantly through 16&#x000a0;weeks of treatment. Improvements in PASI scores were faster and more prominent in the head and trunk than in the extremities. Notably, the greatest response at week 4 occurred in the difficult-to-treat head region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. These findings are important because the emotional and psychosocial effects on QoL caused by lesion visibility are significant.</p><p>For patients, both symptom improvement and alleviation of QoL impairments are important. PASI scores do not always correspond with the impact psoriasis has on QoL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Based on the mean baseline DLQI score, psoriasis had a &#x0201c;very large effect&#x0201d; on QoL in the REVEAL population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The mean DLQI improvement at week 16 was similar to a REVEAL study subanalysis (range 7.1&#x02013;9.6; mean 8.3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Furthermore, rapid and significant improvements in DLQI were achieved with adalimumab by week 4, and scores continued to improve through week 16. Our results are clinically meaningful, as the difference between adalimumab and placebo groups met or exceeded the 2.3- to 5.7-point between-group difference that is suggested to be clinically relevant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>Both the mean percentage improvement in DLQI scores and the proportion of patients achieving a DLQI score of 0/1 at week 16 were associated with regional PASI responses. These results are consistent with previous studies demonstrating an association between overall improvements in PASI and DLQI with adalimumab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. A recent systematic review of randomized controlled trials with biologics used to treat psoriasis demonstrated a significant correlation between mean reductions in overall PASI and DLQI (<italic>r</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.898; <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.01) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. However, changes were not assessed by body region. Our findings indicate that the degree in which clinical improvements were associated with QoL varied by body region. Although the head and trunk were more responsive to adalimumab, there was a higher threshold for PASI responses in these regions to significantly impact DLQI scores. Additionally, despite the head and trunk achieving higher PASI 75/90/100 rates, a lower percentage of patients with improvements in the head and trunk achieved a DLQI score of 0/1. This could be because other body areas may still have residual psoriasis.</p><p>The relationship between regional PASI improvement and DLQI improvement is consistent with the previous observation that psoriasis treatment goals are rarely met without achieving at least a PASI 75 response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], and demonstrates that the degree to which alleviation of the clinical symptoms of psoriasis improves QoL depends on which area is affected. A PASI 75 response has predominated as the primary endpoint in clinical studies, yet a recent opinion has suggested PASI 90 response as a more relevant measure with regard to QoL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In our analysis, incremental achievement in PASI response was generally associated with incremental DLQI 0/1 achievement. When comparing PASI 90 vs. PASI 75 responders for the head and trunk, the incremental benefit of achieving PASI 90 response was limited. However, approximately half of patients achieving PASI 75 response and the majority achieving PASI 100 response for each body region achieved a DLQI score of 0/1, indicating little or no remaining impact on their QoL.</p><p>A limitation of this study was that the methods used to score PASI responses did not distinguish the specific distribution of improvements within each body region, such as difficult-to-treat areas (e.g., scalp) or visible areas (e.g., face and hands). Additionally, there is no QoL instrument that can be used to study PASI improvement by specific body region. Finally, this was a post hoc analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Treatment with adalimumab for 16&#x000a0;weeks provided statistically and clinically significant improvements in PASI responses across body regions, as well as in DLQI scores. Improvements in QoL corresponded with PASI responses in each region, with a lower threshold for PASI responses in the extremities to impart an improvement in QoL. Conversely, there was a higher threshold for treatment response in the head before QoL improved, underscoring the need for effective therapy to clear psoriatic lesions in this highly visible region.
