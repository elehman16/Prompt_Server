One prominent non-systemic treatment is the topical application of paromomycin-containing creams. To create a paromomycin cream that would be simultaneously effective, well tolerated, and improve healing, we developed a cream (WR 279,396) containing paromomycin sulfate 15% plus gentamicin sulfate 0.5% in a complex base to aid drug penetration. Gentamicin was included in the formulation because gentamicin augmented the effect of paromomycin in mouse models of CL, particularly against the New World species, <italic>Leishmania panamensis</italic> and <italic>Leishmania amazonensis</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref> In a Phase 2 clinical trial in Tunisia,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref> WR 279,396 was significantly more effective than vehicle control versus <italic>Leishmania major</italic> at the same study site at which a WHO topical formulation (paromomycin without gentamicin) was ineffective.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></p><p>In the course of developing WR 279,396, two studies of the pharmacokinetics (PKs) of this combination formulation and of Paromomycin Alone in the same complex base were performed in CL patients in Panama and Peru. The combined PK data from both sites is being reported in a separate publication (accepted for publication). Efficacy and safety data were secondary endpoints in these studies. Here, we report the efficacy and safety of WR 279,396 compared with Paromomycin Alone against CL in the Panama study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics.</title><p>The study was sponsored by the Office of the Surgeon General, Department of the Army, USA, and it is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT 01083576. The protocol was approved by the Panamanian National Committee of Bioethics for Research, Panama City, Panama, and by the Human Research Protections Office, U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command, Ft. Detrick, Maryland.</p><p>The study complied with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations of the United States and Panama, and it was conducted in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice Guidelines, the Belmont Principles, and the ethical principles that have their origins in the Declaration of Helsinki. The investigators adhered to the policies for protection of human subjects as prescribed in U.S. Army Regulation 70-25. Informed consent was obtained from all study participants and/or guardians before enrollment. Minors also provided assent.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Study patients.</title><p>Eligible patients were males or non-pregnant/non-lactating females; &#x02265; 5 years of age; with &#x02264; 10 lesions; and with one of these lesions (the index lesion) having the following characteristics: ulcerative, at least 1 cm, and &#x0003c; 5 cm in greatest diameter of lesion, including induration, and confirmed to contain <italic>Leishmania</italic> by culture or microscopic examination of lesion material. The reason to designate one lesion as the index lesion is that the response of at least that lesion would reflect the efficacy of treatment on an ulcer known to be caused by <italic>Leishmania</italic>. Subjects could not have signs of disseminated disease, against which a topical treatment would not be expected to be effective or recent treatment (within 8 weeks of starting study treatments) with a recognized antileishmanial, and were generally healthy otherwise.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Sample size.</title><p>As the study was primarily a PK evaluation that was not designed to compare the efficacy of the two topical creams, the selection of the number of subjects (15 in each arm) was based on the following objectives: 1) to obtain PK data which, when combined with PK data from a similarly designed Phase 2 study in Peru, would provide a collective body of data to determine the extent of systemic drug exposure; and, 2) to obtain sufficient data to have a preliminary estimation of the initial clinical cure rate as a basis for calculating sample sizes for a possible larger trial.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Study design.</title><p>This was a randomized, double-blinded, parallel-group study in which the PKs, efficacy, and safety of WR 279,396 and Paromomycin Alone creams were compared for the treatment of <italic>L. panamensis</italic> CL in Panama. After establishing eligibility for the study, a total of 30 patients were randomly assigned in 1:1 allocation to the two treatment groups in a blinded manner. To balance treatment assignments by age group, a permuted block randomization method was used to generate the treatment randomization within age groups. Subjects were stratified by age group: 5&#x02013;11 years, 12&#x02013;7 years, and &#x02265; 18 years of age. No more than 18 subjects could be randomized in any age range, so that there would be at least six subjects in each age stratum evaluable for the PK analysis.</p><p>Subjects were treated once daily for 20 days with the topical creams. Blood samples for PKs were collected during the first 20 days, local application site toxicity was assessed daily, and lesion sizes were measured five times during the treatment period. Subjects were followed at weekly intervals after completing treatment of safety and efficacy up to Day 63, and then had final follow-up visits at Days 100 and 168.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Study area.</title><p>This study was conducted between 16 February 2010 and 28 March 2011 on patients recruited from the area surrounding Panama City, Panama, where <italic>L. panamensis</italic> is prevalent.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Parasitology.</title><p>Lesion samples were obtained from ulcerative lesions by scraping and aspiration at baseline and 1 day after the end of therapy on Day 21.

For each patient, all lesions (i.e., the index lesion plus any non-index lesions) were treated topically once daily for 20 days. Before the first application, the lesions were cleaned with soap and water, debrided, and then dried. At each subsequent application of the investigational creams, the previous day's application and dressing were removed, the lesion sites were cleaned with soap, water, and sterile 0.9% saline, and then dried using sterile cotton gauze sponges, and redressed. A generous amount of cream was applied to each lesion by rubbing the cream into the lesion for about one minute before applying the dressing.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Study procedures.</title><p>Medical history, physical exam, vital signs, parasitology, and baseline clinical laboratory measurements (alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, glucose, sodium, potassium, creatinine, white blood cells, hemoglobin, and platelet count) were performed to establish patient eligibility for inclusion in the study. Females of childbearing potential had a pregnancy test. Serum creatinine was repeated at the end of treatment (Day 20), and parasitology was also repeated one day after completing treatment (Day 21). Adverse events were assessed at every visit during the study. Lesion measurements and vital signs were taken before treatment, five times during treatment, and at all follow-up visits.

It was not designed to compare the efficacy of the two topical creams, but rather to collect data to support the design of a possible Phase 3 trial. However, exploratory analyses were performed on efficacy endpoints to determine if the observed differences in the two study groups were statistically significant.

These were attributed to the tape that had been used in the dressings overlying treatment application sites.</p><p>Topical treatment with WR 279,396 can be compared with topical treatment with Paromomycin Alone in this study, to topical treatment with paromomycin 15% plus methylbenzethonium chloride (MBCL) 12% in the literature, and to treatment with vehicle/no treatment in the literature. In this study, WR 279,396 trended toward superiority versus Paromomycin Alone on the basis of the index lesion cure rate, and was statistically superior to Paromomycin Alone on the basis of per patient and per-lesion cure rate. Although the gentamicin component that differentiates WR 279,396 from Paromomycin Alone is not known as an antileishmanial agent, Daneshvar and others<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref> succeeded in producing attenuated <italic>Leishmania</italic> by culturing promastigotes under pressure of gentamicin. Promastigotes of the attenuated lines could enter but not survive in macrophages derived from murine bone marrow, and mice inoculated subcutaneously with attenuated parasites did not develop CL skin lesions. In lesions treated with WR 279,396, it may be that parasites' constant exposure to the gentamicin component of WR 279,396 leads to their attenuation, thereby increasing their vulnerability to both paromomycin treatment, and host immune mechanisms.</p><p>Paromomycin 15% plus MBCL 12% has not been evaluated alone against <italic>L. panamensis</italic>. However, the combination of this topical formulation with short courses of parenteral antimony was tested in an <italic>L. panamensis</italic>-endemic area of Colombia, and it did not augment the cure rate compared with short courses of antimony alone.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref> In contrast, Paromomycin 15% plus MBCL 12% was tested in Guatemala (infecting species <italic>L. braziliensis</italic> and <italic>L. mexicana</italic>), where it was very effective (86% of patients were cured) compared with vehicle control (39% of patients were cured).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></p><p>The mITT and per protocol cure rates for this formal study were identical, and can be compared with the per protocol cure rate for <italic>L. panamensis</italic> treated with placebo/no-treatment in investigator-initiated studies. The WR 279,396 cure rate in this study was considerably higher than published placebo/no-treatment cure rates of 33&#x02013;36% reported for <italic>L. panamensis</italic> in Colombia.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref> The index lesion cure rate of 87% for WR 279,396 also compares favorably with cure rates after treatment with the antimonial Glucantime for <italic>L. panamensis</italic> in Colombia of 36&#x02013;81% in three different studies after the same 6-month follow-up period.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref> However, the cure rate of WR279,396 in <italic>L. panamensis</italic> observed in this study will be confirmed in a Phase 3 study (<italic>N</italic> = 300), planned to start in Panama in Spring 2013.</p><p>Topical treatments are being developed for uncomplicated CL where the less tolerable systemic antileishmanial therapies may not have an acceptable benefit-risk profile. Patients with uncomplicated CL present with diagnostically confirmed CL, but lesion location and infecting <italic>Leishmania</italic> species are such that the parasite has little or no potential to disseminate to the mucosal tissue or elsewhere. Entry criteria for patients in our studies of WR 279,396 include patients with &#x0003c; 10 lesions and no evidence of systemic dissemination to mucosal tissue by qualified physician examination.</p><p>Compared with systemic treatments, important advantages of all topical or local treatments for CL are 1) their failure to generate clinically meaningful systemic drug exposure, and 2) their relatively low risk for systemic side effects. Topical or local interventions may, however, generate considerable application site reactions, depending on the formulation. For example, topical paromomycin 15% formulated with MBCL 12% causes unacceptable stinging<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>; intralesional injections of antimony are painful<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref> and particularly problematic for children and patients with facial lesions; the ThermoMed device requires anesthetics to dull the blistering pain that results from intense heating of the skin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>; and cryotherapy creates edema and bullae, which necessitate 1&#x02013;2 weeks of saline compresses and antibiotic creams.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref> In contrast, both WR 279,396 and Paromomycin Alone were formulated to promote drug penetration into the dermis while avoiding substantial local toxicity. With WR 279,396, any application site reactions are typically mild and have yet to cause a patient to withdraw from treatment.</p><p>In conclusion, new topical therapies containing paromomycin with or without gentamicin may offer an effective low toxicity alternative to the current standard of care pentavalent antimonials for the treatment of uncomplicated CL in Panama.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>Acknowledgments for contribution to the conduct of the study at the Gorgas Memorial Institute: Yaravi Suarez (administrative), Aracely Miranda (Dr. Calzada's assistant), Lourdes Kirshenbaum (study coordinator), Manuel Mann Yi (laboratory and pharmacokinetics), and Salomon Puga (general clinical support).
