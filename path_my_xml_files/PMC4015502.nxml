Despite this, cardiovascular disease-related mortality has decreased over the past few years due, amongst other reasons, to the better diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular risk factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>Current data suggest that there remains significant room for improvement in cardiovascular risk factor and diabetes care in our setting. According to data from the Provider Agreement in 2008 only 41.3% of diabetic patients in the Autonomous Community of the Basque Country had a glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level of less than 7.5%, basic analysis was performed in 44.9% of patients and only 27% had a blood pressure of less than 140/80&#x000a0;mm Hg.</p><p>The almost anecdotal use of tools to calculate cardiovascular risk at that time suggests that statin treatment in primary prevention is chosen on the basis of cholesterol level rather than overall cardiovascular risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>As far as hypertensive patients in our setting are concerned, it is estimated that only 33% have their blood pressure well controlled and that 46.4% do not receive the antihypertensive agent of choice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical practice guidelines as a tool for improving healthcare</title><p>The implementation of evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) may help to ensure that the care of patients with cardiovascular risk factors or diabetes complies with the best quality criteria and standards.</p><p>CPGs are statements that include recommendations intended to optimize patient care which are informed by a systematic review of evidence and an assessment of the benefits and harms of alternative care options [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. As such, they have the potential to reduce variability and improve healthcare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>In the past few years we have witnessed the consolidation of a CPG program in both the Basque Country and the Spanish National Health System as a whole that has led to the Guiasalud program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], the development of a common methodology for drafting such guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and the availability of an increasing number of guidelines prepared in Spain.</p><p>Thus, in the cardiovascular field, 2008 and 2009 saw the publication of the &#x0201c;Clinical practice guideline on the management of lipids as a cardiovascular risk factor&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], an update to the regional &#x0201c;Clinical practice guideline on arterial hypertension&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and the &#x0201c;Clinical practice guideline on type 2 diabetes&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], the latter of which was drafted within the framework of the National Health System's Clinical Practice Guideline Program in collaboration with the Health Technology Assessment Agency Osteba.

</bold></title><p>Grol&#x02019;s 10-step model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] is a theoretical reference for guideline implementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. This model brings together elements from different disciplines, such as the diffusion of innovation theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], the reasoned action theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and social cognitive theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], and postulates that professionals pass through different phases or stages (orientation, insight, acceptance, change and maintenance) when achieving a change, with specific barriers predominating in each phase. This study concentrates on the orientation, insight and acceptance phases.</p></sec><sec><title><bold>
<italic>Barriers and facilitators</italic>
</bold></title><p>Although there are numerous studies concerning the barriers and facilitators for CPG implementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], this is not the case in our setting. As a result, before designing the guideline implementation intervention, we undertook a study to explore the barriers faced by CPGs in primary care using the Delphi technique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The main barriers detected are the following [18].</p><p>Dimension: Presentation of the guidelines<bold>:</bold></p><p>&#x02013;&#x02009;The teaching method used by the speakers at each session.</p><p>&#x02013;&#x02009;The choice of speaker.</p><p>Dimension: Format of the guidelines:</p><p>&#x02013;&#x02009;The need for a summarized version.</p><p>&#x02013;&#x02009;The need to stimulate and promote the on-line version, which makes term search easier, and the links within the guidelines and to other material of interest.</p><p>&#x02013;&#x02009;The need to enhance user participation (discussion fora, asking questions, debates, etc.).</p><p>Dimension: Use and utility facilitators:</p><p>&#x02013;&#x02009;Application of CPGs gives good results in clinical practice.</p><p>&#x02013;&#x02009;The need to attach action protocols or other practical tools to the guidelines.</p><p>Internal barriers:</p><p>&#x02013;&#x02009;Willingness of the physicians themselves.</p><p>&#x02013;&#x02009;Too much time and effort required to understand the CPGs.</p><p>&#x02013;&#x02009;Lack of acceptance of guidelines as a work tool.</p><p>&#x02013;&#x02009;Discouragement due to lack of use at other healthcare levels.</p><p>External barriers:</p><p>&#x02013;&#x02009;Specialized practice does not follow the guidelines.</p><p>&#x02013;&#x02009;Lack of dissemination and implementation in specialized care.</p><p>&#x02013;&#x02009;Pressure from the pharmaceutical industry.</p><p>&#x02013;&#x02009;Methodology followed to learn the guidelines.</p></sec><sec><title><bold>
<italic>Effectiveness of guideline implementation interventions</italic>
</bold></title><p>According to Grimshaw&#x02019;s systematic review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], the effectiveness of different clinical practice guideline dissemination and implementation strategies varies but, in general, tends to be modest. The dissemination of educational materials tends to be poorly effective but at low-cost, whereas continual medical training is more effective if undertaken in small groups using realistic scenarios [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The efficacy of opinion leader-based training tends to vary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Multifaceted interventions appear to make sense if they are intended to overcome specific barriers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Indeed, tailored interventions are more effective than passive guideline dissemination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>In the field of diabetes, the review by Shojania [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] showed that multifaceted interventions provided a larger effect than interventions involving a single component. Educational interventions showed an acceptable efficacy. In the field of hypertension, educational interventions aimed at healthcare professionals resulted in a modest improvement in blood pressure control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The most effective strategy for implementing the use of risk tables in cardiovascular disease prevention is still unknown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title><bold>
<italic>Context</italic>
</bold></title><p>The intervention and study were designed in the context of a primary care research group with a clinical and/or methodological profile involved in the drafting and implementation of evidence-based guidelines. The intervention was aimed at primary care professionals (physicians and nurses) and no organisational changes or interventions in patients were considered. A further assumption was that the proposed interventions had to be feasible and result in a reasonable cost to the health system.</p><p>As no single implementation strategy is effective in all contexts, the impact of such strategies needs to be evaluated by way of studies with a robust design and low risk of bias. Randomized designs are the gold-standard for assessing healthcare interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>Although we are witnessing significant support for the drafting of CPGs by public health organisations in Spain, evaluation of their subsequent implementation remains uncommon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>In our setting, the availability of three recently published CPGs in the cardiovascular field provides a unique opportunity to assess CPG implementation strategies in primary care.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Main endpoint</title><p>To evaluate the effectiveness of a multifaceted tailored intervention in the implementation of three cardiovascular risk-related CPGs (hypertension, type 2 diabetes and lipids as cardiovascular risk factor) in primary care in the Basque Health Service compared with usual implementation.</p></sec><sec><title>Secondary endpoints</title><p>&#x02022;&#x02009;To evaluate the impact of the intervention on the degree of compliance with process quality indicators and subrogate clinical endpoints for the care of patients with type 2 diabetes.</p><p>&#x02022;&#x02009;To evaluate the impact of the intervention on the degree of compliance with process quality indicators and subrogate clinical endpoints for the care of patients with hypertension.</p><p>&#x02022;&#x02009;To evaluate the impact of the intervention on the degree of compliance with coronary risk screening process quality indicators.</p><p>&#x02022;&#x02009;To evaluate the impact of the intervention on the prescription of statins in primary and secondary prevention.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><sec><title>Study design and setting</title><p>This study is a cluster randomized trial conducted in two urban primary care districts in the Basque Health Service (Ekialde and Bilbao). These districts cover 36.9% of the population in the Basque Country.

Such an approach is appropriate when the aim of the study is to determine the impact of CPG implementation on the population and provides greater long-term power [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].
