Participants completed 6 lessons, weekly homework assignments, and received weekly email contact from a clinical psychologist or psychiatrist until completion of lesson 2. After lesson 2 email contact was only provided in response to participant request, or in response to a deterioration in psychological distress scores. The primary outcome measure was the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9). Of the 35 participants recruited, 68.6% completed 6 lessons and 65.7% completed the 3-months follow up.

Worldwide it is currently the fourth leading cause of disability and is expected to become the second leading cause of disease burden by the year 2020 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) has been shown to be effective in the treatment of depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. However, a number of barriers prevent patients from accessing treatment. For example, three&#x02013;quarters of people in the UK with depression received no treatment, with cost being the major barrier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Treatments that are more affordable and accessible are necessary.</p><p>CBT via the internet (iCBT) has been shown to be as effective as face to face treatment for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and more cost effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Johanssen and Andersson (2012) reviewed 25 controlled trials of iCBT for MDD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Effect size (ES) superiority of the intervention over the control group ranged between 0.1 and 1.2, but there were six studies in which the effect size superiority was greater than 0.85 (mean = 1.0, NNT=2). The intervention in one of these [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>](ES=1.2) was the basis of the present work.</p><p>Delivery of CBT using the internet has increased the options available for patients with depression to access evidenced based effective treatment. For some, using a fixed computer may mean little or no privacy, or it may simply be inconvenient. Moreover, a patient may want to review the treatment lesson material in context, for example, re-reading material on a computer just prior to entering a challenging situation may not be feasible. For others, access to the internet may be unreliable and this may not be a useful alternative. It is for these reasons, that alternative modes of treatment delivery should be considered. Mobile applications (apps) offer a viable, cost effective and highly accessible solution. Recently mobile apps have been utilized to deliver health treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and whilst a plethora of apps are available, evidence based, evaluated apps remain sparse. With almost 6 billion mobile phone subscriptions worldwide in 2011, it is anticipated that this mode of health delivery will rise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. To our knowledge, there are no published RCTs using a mobile app to deliver treatment for MDD. Using a mobile app may enable greater choice in preferred treatment options, increased convenience, greater accessibility and enhanced privacy.</p><p>Bang and colleagues (2007) have described the advantages of using a mobile phone over other delivery methods for some of the elements of CBT, explaining a mobile phone has the functionality to record, scale and label anxiety-provoking situations when and where the need arises [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. These advantages were evidenced in a recent study that showed people&#x02019;s everyday mood, stresses, responses and general functioning, can be helpfully communicated to primary care practitioners by tracking and capturing data in context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Furthermore, participants from this study reported this method of data collection as convenient and acceptable. This positive sentiment was echoed in a study exploring community attitudes towards the use of mobile phones for mental health monitoring and self management. Proudfoot and colleagues found attitudes were positive towards using a mobile phone for mental health monitoring, however, participants identified the importance of privacy, security provisions and an easy to use program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>On this basis, we revised our previously evaluated 6-lesson clinician assisted treatment program for depression (The Sadness Program) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] into a mobile app version, complete with security settings. The name of the program was changed from The Sadness Program to The Get Happy Program to convey a sense of optimism and empowerment. In order to demonstrate the efficacy of the program using a mobile app, we decided to compare the delivery mode of the same program between a mobile vs. computer group. It was hypothesized that all participants would show significant improvement on measures of depression, a reduction of psychological distress, and participants would find the treatment modes equally acceptable. Given the transportable nature and use of mobile phones, we thought it would be important to understand the type of environment utilized, and if, any, environmental factors, such as noise, may have an impact on the efficacy of the program for mobile users. Thus, based on the Experience Sampling Method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], three items were constructed to identify the location of where the participant was completing the lesson, how distracting the level of noise was, and the self rated ability of the participant to concentrate in this environment. Adherence towards homework was also measured using self reported effort and amount of homework completed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title><sec><title>Design</title><p>A CONSORT-2010 compliant, registered RCT compared two modes of delivery, a mobile versus computer group.

Following this, the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview Version 5.0.0 (MINI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] was used to confirm the applicant met DSM-IV criteria for a Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). 52 applicants met all inclusion criteria and were randomised via a true randomisation process (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.random.org">http://www.random.org</ext-link>) generated by a team member not involved in the study, to either the Mobile Group (<italic>n</italic>=22) or Computer Group (<italic>n</italic>=30). However, at baseline we had 15 participants in the Mobile Group and 20 in the Computer Group, due to participants not starting the first lesson. Concealment of allocation was maintained until the applicant met all inclusion criteria and an offer of participation made. The unsuccessful applicants (<italic>n</italic>=49) were advised about more appropriate treatment options.

The program consisted of 6 lessons conducted over an 8&#x02009;week period. The lessons read like a comic book and participants follow the story of Jess, a comic character that has depression, and through her story learn how she comes to manage her symptoms, and participants can then apply these principles to their own life. The size of the font was adapted for the mobile version and some minor revisions were made to the content of the program. On completion of each lesson, participants were assigned and encouraged to carry out the relevant homework activities and review the lesson. Additional resources, such as information on assertiveness skills and sleep hygiene, and stories from previous participant&#x02019;s experiences were also available Figure&#x02009;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, Figure&#x02009;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>.

Participants rate the frequency of symptoms over the last fortnight on a scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day), where 1 = several days, 2 = more than half of the days. A PHQ-9 score of &#x02265;10 is used as a clinical cut-off for probable DSM-IV diagnosis of MDD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].

This provides preliminary support for the efficacy of a CBT program delivered using a mobile phone. The results, including the effect size, shown in this study are commensurate with our previous RCT&#x02019;s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], indicating that using a mobile phone to offer this program shows similar promise.</p><p>There were a number of limitations to this study. Firstly, the small sample size necessitates replication, in order to reproduce the benefits identified in this study of delivering a CBT program via a mobile phone or computer. Other possible limitations include the self-selecting nature of the sample. Those applying to complete treatment programs using technology must be motivated; however, this does not make the results of this study invalid. A further limitation is the absence of a control group. A control group would have provided the additional advantage of ensuring the effects observed were able to be explained by the treatment. However, due to the small sample size of this study, a control group was not included. Lastly, this study did not collect data on the environment, level of concentration and distractibility in the Computer Group. Future research could explore and compare this data to inform recommendations as to the best placed environment for patients to complete the program in order to obtain the most optimal results.</p><p>The results of this pilot study indicate the usefulness of replicating this study in the future research with a larger sample size and control group. Minor additions to utilise the functionality available on a mobile phone/tablet are planned, for example, including the ability for participants to set automated reminders in their calendar, and complete the homework on their phone/tablet. Data on the time of day and amount of usage for the mobile users is also intended to be collected to understand if the increased proximity of the mobile, does lead to increased use, and greater benefits over time. Very little is currently known about the possible benefits of offering patient&#x02019;s treatment programs using a mobile app on their mobile phone, however, the ubiquity of mobile apps, the growing community uptake and interest in this form of technology, and low cost associated with access, indicates that this area of research necessitates attention.</p><p>In summary, depression is common and costly. Affordable, accessible and innovative interventions should be developed, evaluated, and made available to improve the lives of those affected by this disorder. Mobile based interventions can be easily implemented and can be made widely available to the community at large. The patients and their families affected by depression deserve the opportunity to recover, and readily accessible, evidenced based treatment via a mobile phone/tablet offers hope, and an opportunity to transform current clinical practice.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interest</title><p>The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributors</title><p>SW drafted the initial manuscript, prepared and cleaned the data and conducted initial data analysis.
