Recent studies reported that the soy has beneficial effects in diabetic mellitus patients. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of soybean flour fortified bread consumption on metabolic profile in type 2 diabetic women.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Methods:</title><p>This randomized, cross-over, controlled clinical trial was carried out in 30 type 2 diabetic women. At first, a 2-week run-in period was applied. Then, participants were randomly assigned to either intervention or control groups. Participants in the intervention group were asked to replace 120 g of soybean flour fortified bread with the same amount of their usual bread intake or other cereal products for 6 weeks. After a 4 weeks washout period, participants were crossed over for another 6 weeks.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>Mean (&#x000b1;standard deviation) age and body mass index of subjects was 45.7 &#x000b1; 3.8 years and 29.5 &#x000b1; 3.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, respectively. The results of our study showed no significant effects of soybean flour fortified bread on metabolic profile.

Exclusion criteria were use of oral hypoglycemic agents, insulin injection, lipid-lowering medications, use of hormone replacement therapy, hypo- and hyper-thyroidism and allergy to soybean. Participants who were pregnant or breastfeeding were also excluded. All participants were recruited from Endocrine and Metabolism Research Center of the Isfahan University of Medical Sciences. Participants were not undergoing dietary changes in the last 3 months. Sample size for this study was calculated based on suggested equation for cross-over trials:[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] N=([z<sub>1-a/2</sub> + z<sub>1-b</sub>]<sup>2</sup>.s<sup>2</sup>/)/2D<sup>2</sup> with considering type 1 error of 5% and type 2 error of 20% (power = 80%). Low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-C was considered as key variable.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] According to this equation, we reached the sample size of 19 participants for the whole intervention. Since there are high dropouts in cross-over trials, we recruited 30 women in this study.

Participants were asked to continue their habitual diet and physical activity and wanted them to consume 1 serving/day of soybean flour fortified bread during this period to be prepared for the intervention and have a better compliance during the study. All participants completed 2 days dietary records (nonconsecutive days) and a 2 days physical activity record in the run-in period. After a 2 week run-in period, all measurements were done. Then, participants were random, using randomized block design method, assigned to either intervention (soybean flour fortified bread) or control groups (habitual diet) for 6 weeks. After the first phase of intervention, a 4-week wash-out period was applied. Participants were crossed over for another 6 weeks. During wash-out period, subjects were asked to avoid any soy based foods and soybean flour fortified bread intake that they were received during the intervention. All measurements were taken at baseline and 6, 10 and 16 weeks.

Several dietary factors can influence serum levels of lipids and glycemic parameters. Soy products have been reported to positively affect glycemic and lipid profiles. In this study, we calculated HOMA-IR as a measure of insulin resistance. However, it was not significantly affected. Our findings are consistent with the earlier study. Where, Gobert <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] showed soy protein isolate consumption did not significantly affect HbA1C, HOMA-IR, fasting blood glucose and insulin levels in type 2 diabetes. In line with our study, Dent <italic>et al</italic>. showed that 40 g/d soy protein consumption in premenopausal women had no effect on lipid profile.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] In contrast to our findings, a meta-analysis among diabetic patients indicated that soy protein could decrease serum concentrations of total cholesterol, LDL-C and TGs.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] In one study that conducted in type 2 diabetes patients with obesity, Anderson <italic>et al</italic>. observed a reduction in serum cholesterol and triacylglycerol levels.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] In an earlier study among postmenopausal women, Chiechi <italic>et al</italic>. indicated that a soy-rich diet had beneficial effects on lipid profile.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Mechanisms of lipid-lowering effect of soy are not clear. However, there are some mechanisms suggested for hypocholesterolemic and hypoglycemic effect of soy, such as: Soy fiber content,[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] trace component such as plant setrols, phytates, folates, and oxalates. As well as amino acid profile of soy is one of the suggested mechanisms. The higher arginine to lysine and methionine ratio in soy might be responsible for its hypocholesterolemic effects. Animal studies have shown that the amino acids lysine and methionine were hypercholesterolemic, while arginine was hypocholesterolemic.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Also soy bean &#x003b2;-conglycinin (7S globulin), a protein exists in soy, up-regulate LDL receptors and decreased serum levels of cholesterol.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] The beneficial effects of soy may be due to soy proteins. Soy protein contains a high amount of arginine and glycine. These amino acids are associated with decreased serum cholesterol levels arginine and glycine also involved in insulin and glucagon secretion from the pancreas. The insulin to glucagon ratio is a major determinant of the metabolic directions in lipid and glucose metabolism and thereby a major contributor to metabolic homeostasis.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Decrease in plasma insulin that caused by soy protein may be due to decreased in insulin release from the pancreas or increased hepatic removal. Furthermore, cholesterol-lowering effect of soy protein may be due to the decreased insulin to glucagon ratio caused by arginine and glycine.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Findings of Moriyama <italic>et al</italic>. study showed that the soy &#x003b2;-conglycinin diet reduced serum TG levels by acceleration of &#x003b2;-oxidation, inhibition of fatty acids synthase and increasing fecal excretion of TG and also decreased serum levels of insulin and glucose.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] A meta-analysis on 23 clinical trial indicated that improvements in HDL-C were only occurred in studies of more than 12 week duration,[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] whereas our study duration was 6 week. In a randomized, double-blind, cross-over clinical trial,[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] dietary supplementation with soy phytoestrogens for 12 weeks in 32 diabetic postmenopausal women, favorably affect serum insulin, HOMA-IR, HbA1C, LDL and total cholesterol, but no significant change were seen in HDL-C and TGs levels. The controversial findings might be explained by different study designs, characteristics of study participants or intervention duration.</p><p>According to our knowledge, the present study is the first study that examined the effects of soybean flour fortified bread intake on metabolic profiles among diabetic women. Strengths of our study are the cross-over design, a high percentage of participants who completed the study and enriching bread with soy to facilitate in soy consumption by participants. Despite the strength points, there are some limitations that deserve attention. It was not possible for us to use a double-blind design due to texture and taste of the bread. Also, daily distribution of bread package was impossible. The effects of soy on metabolic profile may be linked to the dosage of soy. We were not able to increase the soybean flour dosage in bread more than 30% because of unfavorable effects on texture and taste of the bread.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Our findings suggest that daily consumption of 120 g soybean flour fortified bread for 6 weeks had no significant effects on serum levels of metabolic parameters in diabetic women. Further studies with longer duration might be needed.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>This study was extracted from M.Sc dissertation which was approved by School of
