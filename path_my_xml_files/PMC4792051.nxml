Periodontal plastic surgery procedures address these esthetic and functional demands and have become an integral part of the periodontal treatment. Several therapeutic modalities such as free gingival autografts, pedicle grafts, connective tissue graft, grafts combining the two modalities, and guided tissue regeneration have been used for covering the denuded roots and to augment the width and thickness of the keratinized gingival.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] These procedures have resulted in reduction or elimination of root hypersensitivity, improved esthetics, and facilitation of plaque control.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Among various surgical techniques, subepithelial connective tissue (SECT) grafts remain the most commonly used and most successful root coverage procedures. The esthetic and functional success of SECT graft techniques is highly predictable and reliable which has been documented in several longitudinal studies.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] These advantages have given root coverage procedures a common place in the clinical practice.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>Thickness and volume of the tissue to be harvested from the donor site are among the important factors in determining the appropriate treatment method. Variations of size and shape of the palatal vault may also affect the dimensions of the donor tissue harvested.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Although an ample number of studies have evaluated the results of utilizing SECT graft at the recipient site, a very few studies are focused on evaluating the wound healing and assessing patient-centered outcomes at the palatal donor area.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Furthermore, the oral cavity provides a unique environmental challenge for the healing wounds produced during various periodontal surgical procedures.</p><p>The ideal technique for procuring a connective tissue graft should harvest an adequate graft, be user-friendly, produce minimum palatal discomfort, have minimal operative complications, and create a wound in the donor area that heals quickly with minimal postoperative complications. Various techniques have been developed for harvesting soft tissue grafts from the palate such as trap door technique,[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] parallel incision technique,[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and single incision technique.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>In the present study, a new instrument &#x0201c;Unigraft knife&#x0201d; (also called the &#x0201c;free gingival graft knife&#x0201d; from Ace Surgical Supplies) was used which when activated elevates a partial thickness flap beneath which the connective tissue graft is procured. The healing of the palatal wound created with this knife was compared with the wound created by Langer and Langer trap door technique.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] The purpose of the present study was to evaluate and compare the healing of the wound at the palatal donor site and root coverage results of the two different techniques.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Sixteen systemically healthy patients with 30 sites (gingival recession &#x02265;2 mm) were recruited from the outpatient Department of Periodontology and Implantology who presented with Miller Class I and II recession (&#x02265;2 mm).

Identical assessment was made at the same time in the corresponding contralateral area to collect the most reliable data possible. Objective sensory loss was recorded using a rubbing movement and a pin-pressure nociception. Patients were asked to give a rating of their loss of sensibility based on a 3-point verbal descriptor scale (&#x0201c;none,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;mild or moderate,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;severe&#x0201d;).[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>PP: At the subsequent postoperative appointments, the patients were asked to rate their discomfort level in the palate for the previous week.

Anesthesia was given by infiltrating the area with lidocaine and epinephrine 1: 80000. The donor area was sounded with a periodontal probe to ensure that there was a minimum of 3 mm soft tissue thickness. Unigraft knife was assembled in a conventional manner to permit cutting in a pulling motion. The knife was assembled with a cutting shoe reversed so that the cutting shoe would cut in a pushing direction. It was then used to elevate a partial thickness trap door flap by pushing the knife, under control, distally across the palate. This trap door flap was retracted mesially to permit access to the connective tissue beneath it. The distal border of the flap was allowed to remain attached to the palate. The knife was then assembled in a conventional manner to permit cutting in the pull motion. Now, starting at the distal edge of the trap door flap, the knife was then used to elevate a connective tissue flap [Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">k</xref>]. This secondary flap, made up of connective tissue, was incised at the mesial edge. Pressure was applied with wet gauze to the donor area.

Vertical incisions were placed at the mesial and distal end of the most external incision. A 4-0 silk suture was placed through the palatal tissue to retract the palatal tissue and to provide access to the tissue between the initial incisions.

Among the techniques used for SECT graft harvestation, Langer and Langer trapdoor method has stood the test of time. Langer and Langer method along with most of the techniques relies on free hand dissection of the palate and, therefore, is a highly technique sensitive procedure. The aim of the present study was to compare healing at the palatal donor area using two different surgical techniques to harvest a SECT graft for a root coverage procedure. The recipient sites were treated in a similar manner so that the only difference in the therapy each group received was the method used to obtain the graft. Thirty sites in 16 patients were selected (gingival recession &#x02265;2 mm) for root coverage procedures.</p><p>This comparative, clinical, randomized study was designed to assess the differences in healing pattern and patient discomfort between the two groups. The connective tissue graft from the palatal site was harvested 2&#x02013;3 mm away from the gingival margin for both the techniques.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Harris in 1997[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] also advocated that at least 3 mm of palatal mucosa (thickness) was needed for harvesting a connective tissue graft; therefore in our study, sounding with a periodontal probe was done in both the groups. A uniform connective tissue graft with a thickness of 1.5 mm was obtained using unigraft knife. For Langer and Langer trap door technique, freehand incisions were made 1.5 mm apart, and an effort was made to keep the thickness of the graft uniform. Two releasing vertical incisions were also given to facilitate the removal of connective tissue graft and to aid in wound closure.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>At recipient site, in both the groups, attempt was made to completely cover the connective tissue graft by overlying flap. Studies have shown that total vascularization in the part of the connective tissue graft occurred when the flap at the recipient site completely covered it.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>As per the best of our knowledge, no data have been reported in the literature regarding the assessment of depth of wound at the palatal donor area. Visual cues, such as wound bed color and wound measurements, cannot be relied upon.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Therefore, apart from measuring the wound using UNC-15, clinical photographs were taken at each postoperative visit to access complete wound epithelization.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>The WS was measured with UNC-15 (to the nearest of 0.5 mm) at 1 week postoperative visit was significantly larger in Group I as compared to Group II (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001; <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>). This could have been the result of the high rate of sloughing of the flap seen with the technique using unigraft knife. If the knife was engaged superficially, a thin trap door flap was obtained which might have resulted in high rate of sloughing. Making the incisions freehand could have permitted a deeper trap door incision or a wider base on the trap door flap which may have helped to reduce the sloughing seen. At 4 weeks too, the mean WS was larger in Group I as compared to that in Group II (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001; <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>). A deeper incision or a wider base in the unigraft knife group might have helped to reduce the sloughing. This was not possible as there are limited no of sizes of cutting shoe available for this knife.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>At 4 weeks follow-up visit, although the wound area was epithelized, there was a depression seen at all the palatal sites in the Group I, whereas in the Group II, wound area was fully diminished at all palatal sites at 4 weeks follow-up except for 1 patient. By 12 weeks, in both the groups, complete epithelization of the palatal wound area had occurred and clinically wound area was fully diminished. The percentage of complete palatal wound epithelization using Langer and Langer trap door technique cited in the relevant literature is quite similar to that seen in our study. The rate of sloughing of the primary flap using the Langer and Langer trap door technique was similar to those seen in previous reports.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Edel[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] who performed this technique also reported that degeneration of the primary flap in most patients takes about 1 week. Harris, 1997,[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] in a comparative study of the clinical healing in the donor area demonstrated that a high rate of sloughing occurs in the superficial flap when free gingival graft knife was employed. Unigraft knife method resulted in a larger wound area at 1-week postoperative visit than the Langer and Langer trap door method. This could have resulted due to a variation in the WS created by the unigraft knife where the flap design was such that the distal border instead of the medial one served as the base of the reflected primary flap. The base of the primary reflected flap in the Langer and Langer trap door was toward the mid-palate in the region of first molar and canine and was broader than the base of the primary reflected flap in the unigraft knife method.</p><p>Intragroup comparison of CE showed that in Group I, it was completed at 12 weeks postsurgery, whereas in Group II, it was completed at 4 weeks except for one patient where it was observed at 12 weeks period. This could be attributed to unusual wound healing response at the donor site. The results could be correlated to a study by Del Pizzo <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] who also found complete palatal wound epithelization by 4 weeks after surgery. Kahnberg and Thilander[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] in a study on palatal healing in rats, noted that epithelization progressed from the wound borders, and reduction of the wound surface preceded by contraction of the wound margins and by epithelial cell migration.</p><p>At none of the time, intervals of iB were noticed in either of two groups. dB at 1-week postoperative visit was higher in Group I as compared to Group II, but the difference was not statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> = 0.825; <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>). According to Griffin <italic>et al</italic>., 2006,[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] bleeding is associated with postoperative irritation or trauma, rather than the surgical procedure. Proper care was taken in both the groups to ensure that postoperative instructions are abided by.</p><p>No statistically significant differences were observed regarding the return of sensibility in the palatal donor site in both the groups. Literature supports that transient-postoperative sensory dysfunction is a possible complication after harvesting the graft from the palatal region.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Halata <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] were able to show different nerve endings in the hard palate. In addition to free nerve endings within the epithelium and lamina propria, they also found Merkel nerve endings, as well as Meissner and Ruffini corpuscles, inside the basal lamina and the adjacent connective tissue, all of which are sensitive to touch and pressure. Although SD is not an objective measurement, in our study, both 2-point discrimination and soft-touch discrimination were used which have been reported to be reliable methods to detect the function of these mechanoreceptors.</p><p>In both groups, mean VAS and number of analgesic pills intake in the group at 1 week were higher as compared to that in Group II, yet the difference was not statistically significant. No pain or number of analgesic pills intake was reported by any patient in both the groups after 4 and 12 weeks follow-up intervals.</p><p>Lengthy surgical procedures may create extensive tissue injury, prolong vasodilation that permits more fluid to accumulate in the interstitial spaces, and results in higher level of biologic mediators released by inflammatory and resident cells.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Duration of the soft tissue grafting procedure is an important indicator for PP. However, differences in patient perception can also influence the levels of reported PP.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>Both the unigraft knife method and the Langer and Langer trap door method simplify the technique for obtaining the SECT graft from the palate. Undoubtedly, in certain clinician's hands, with certain skill levels and in certain situations, one technique with or without the aid of instrument may be superior to another technique.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>On assessing the root coverage parameters at the recipient site, it was found that the difference in the mean VR in both the groups at baseline, 3, and 6 months was not statistically significant. Mean root coverage achieved for Group I was 54%, whereas for Group II, it was 68.13% at final (6 months) postoperative visit. This could be explained by the fact that recipient area in both the groups was treated in a similar fashion. Harris, 1997,[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] also observed similar trends on comparison of root coverage at the recipient site using the unigraft knife method and Langer and Langer trap door technique.</p><p>Intergroup comparison of mean width of keratinized gingiva (KT) showed no statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> = 0.419) difference at all time intervals. Intragroup comparison of mean KT showed that both the groups gained a statistically significant amount of tissue at 3 months and 6 months postsurgically as compared to baseline. Transplanted SECT of subsequent size has shown the availability to result in predictable root coverage and increased width of attached gingival. Wennstr&#x000f6;m and Zucchelli[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] reported that transplanted connective tissue from palate has an ability to alter the differentiation of epithelial cells of the thin covering coronally advanced flap to become keratinized cells. Granulation tissue formation derived from the periodontal ligament also contributes to the increased width of keratinized gingiva. Mucogingival junction regains its &#x0201c;genetically&#x0201d; defined position following its coronal dislocation with the coronally repositioned flap resulting in the increased gingival dimension.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] The increase in width of keratinized gingiva observed between 3 and 6 months has been attributed to creeping attachment.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Therefore, this study suggests that in terms of operator factors, both the techniques yielded sufficient SECT graft suitable for periodontal plastic procedure with minimal operative complication. However, unigraft knife technique created a slightly larger wound area at the palate as compared to the free-hand incisions made in Langer and Langer technique. The wound in the Langer and Langer trap door technique method healed slightly more quickly as compared to the unigraft knife method, thus might have accounted for less patient discomfort. During the study, it was observed that the use of unigraft knife was technique-sensitive and it was difficult to adapt the instrument in situations where the palatal vault was high and narrow. Because of only a few sizes of cutting shoes available for unigraft knife, its adaptation to a variety of anatomic forms of palate is limited. It could not compensate for the anatomic variations encountered on various occasions. The Langer and Langer trapdoor technique was more user-friendly as the angles of the free-hand incisions could be easily adjusted if some anatomic variations were encountered.</p><sec
