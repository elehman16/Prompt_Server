This phase III study (NCT01034462) evaluated the efficacy, the safety, and the tolerability of 40 to 120 mg/d of levomilnacipran ER versus placebo in the treatment of patients (18-80 y) with major depressive disorder. This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, flexible-dose study comprised a 1-week single-blind, placebo run-in period; an 8-week double-blind treatment; and a 2-week double-blind down-taper period. The primary efficacy parameter was total score change from baseline to week 8 on the Montgomery-&#x000c5;sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS); the secondary efficacy was the Sheehan Disability Scale. Analysis was performed using the mixed-effects model for repeated measures on a modified intent-to-treat population. A total of 434 patients received at least 1 dose of double-blind treatment (safety population); 429 patients also had 1 or more postbaseline MADRS assessments (modified intent-to-treat population). The least squares mean differences and 95% confidence interval were statistically significant in favor of levomilnacipran ER versus placebo for the MADRS total score (&#x02212;3.095 [&#x02212;5.256, &#x02212;0.935]; <italic>P</italic> = 0.0051) and the SDS total score (&#x02212;2.632 [&#x02212;4.193, &#x02212;1.070]; <italic>P</italic> = 0.0010) change from baseline to week 8. Adverse events were reported in 61.8% of the placebo patients and in 81.6% of the levomilnacipran ER patients. Frequently reported adverse events (&#x02265;5% in levomilnacipran ER and twice the rate of placebo) were nausea, dizziness, constipation, tachycardia, urinary hesitation, hyperhidrosis, insomnia, vomiting, hypertension, and ejaculation disorder. In conclusion, there was a statistically significant difference in the score change from baseline to week 8 between levomilnacipran ER and placebo on several depression rating scales, reflecting symptomatic and functional improvement; treatment was generally well tolerated.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key Words</title><kwd>major depressive disorder</kwd><kwd>SNRI</kwd><kwd>depression</kwd><kwd>selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor</kwd><kwd>antidepressants</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>OPEN-ACCESS</meta-name><meta-value>TRUE</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading cause of global disease burden; by 2030, it is projected that it will be only second to human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome in worldwide burden of disease.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Some defining symptoms of MDD are thought to be related to reduced noradrenergic activity exacerbating the depressed mood state.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> These symptoms, which include fatigue, lack of motivation, decreased concentration, and lassitude, complicate the depressive state by impairing social and occupational functioning.</p><p>An inability to correlate changes in the biological indices that accompany improvement in MDD has restricted the definition of treatment response to a reduction in the number and the severity of symptoms. However, the complex nature of depression is better suited to a multifaceted concept of recovery and wellness that includes broader outcome criteria and improvement in key domains, including both symptomatic and functional improvement.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p>Research suggests that changes in symptom severity and improvement in functional impairment may occur asynchronously, with functional improvement often lagging behind changes in symptoms.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4,5</xref> As such, symptom improvement may provide an early sign of treatment response, whereas functional improvement may be a better indicator of meaningful change.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Independent assessments of symptoms and functioning in MDD may improve clinical research by providing greater insight into the relationship between symptoms and functioning.</p><p>Levomilnacipran (1<italic>S</italic>, 2<italic>R</italic>-milnacipran) is a potent and selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI); an extended-release (ER) formulation was developed to allow for once-daily dosing. Levomilnacipran has approximately 2-fold greater potency for norepinephrine than serotonin reuptake inhibition. Compared with duloxetine or venlafaxine, levomilnacipran has more than 10-fold higher selectivity for norepinephrine relative to serotonin reuptake inhibition.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Studies suggest that antidepressants with a prominent noradrenergic component may be especially effective in improving symptoms related to functioning<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2,7,8</xref>; as such, levomilnacipran ER may be an antidepressant that can provide both symptomatic and functional efficacy.</p><p>Levomilnacipran is the more active enantiomer of milnacipran, an SNRI that is approved for the treatment of fibromyalgia in the United States (prescribing information: Savella [milnacipran hydrochloride], 2011; Forest Laboratories, Inc, St Louis, MO). Milnacipran is not approved for the treatment of MDD in the United States; it is approved for that use in many countries outside the United States. Milnacipran studies in MDD were conducted more than a decade ago, and no head-to-head trials have been performed; as such, no valid comparison between levomilnacipran ER and milnacipran clinical data can be made.</p><p>Milnacipran is a racemic mixture of levomilnacipran (1<italic>S</italic>, 2<italic>R</italic>-milnacipran) and F2696 (1<italic>R</italic>, 2<italic>S</italic>-milnacipran); the 2 enantiomers are not interconvertible.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Regulatory guidelines in the United States and Europe recommend development of enantiomers over racemic drugs where appropriate,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> for a variety of reasons.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Levomilnacipran exhibited high affinities for human recombinant transporter proteins for norepinephrine and serotonin (<italic>K</italic><sub>i</sub> = 92.2 and 11.2 nM, respectively) that were at least 10 times higher than the other enantiomer, F2696.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Moreover, levomilnacipran was substantially more potent than was F2696 in an animal model of antidepressant activity and in vitro functional assays.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Levomilnacipran also has pharmacokinetic advantages relative to F2696. When the milnacipran racemate was administered to human subjects, levomilnacipran was eliminated more slowly than was F2696, with higher maximum concentration (Cmax) and area under the curve (AUC) values. The elimination half-life was &#x0223c;9 hours for levomilnacipran and 6 hours for F2696. The AUC<sub>0-&#x0221e;</sub> of levomilnacipran was &#x0223c;85% greater than that of F2696. Plasma clearance was &#x0223c;2 times greater for F2696 than for levomilnacipran. The pharmacokinetic results are consistent with those of a milnacipran human mass balance study, in which the elimination rate for F2696 was higher than for levomilnacipran.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Given the favorable characteristics of this enantiomer, levomilnacipran was selected for development as an antidepressant.</p><p>Levomilnacipran ER is approved for the treatment of MDD in adults. Efficacy and safety have been evaluated in 4 additional randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. In 1 flexible-dose (75-100 mg/d of levomilnacipran ER) study<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> and 2 fixed-dose (40, 80, and 120 mg/d of levomilnacipran ER<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> and 40 and 80 mg/d of levomilnacipran ER<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) studies, differences in scores on the primary efficacy parameter were statistically significant in favor of levomilnacipran ER over placebo. In a second flexible-dose study, 40 to 120 mg/d of levomilnacipran improved depressive symptoms but did not achieve statistically significant separation from placebo.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Levomilnacipran ER was generally well tolerated in all 4 studies. The objective of this study (NCT01034462) was to evaluate the efficacy, the safety, and the tolerability of 40 to 120 mg/d of flexibly dosed levomilnacipran ER versus placebo in the treatment of patients with MDD.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was conducted at 23 US study centers between December 2009 and December 2011 in full compliance with the Food and Drug Administration guidelines for Good Clinical Practice and the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.

The patients were randomized by a computer-generated list of numbers and assigned to identically appearing treatment that corresponded to the sequence of randomization numbers; investigators and patients were blinded to treatment assignment.</p><p>This study consisted of a 1-week single-blind, placebo run-in period followed by an 8-week double-blind treatment period and a 2-week double-blind down-taper period. At the end of screening, patients meeting entry criteria were randomized on a 1:1 basis to placebo or levomilnacipran ER. The patients assigned to receive levomilnacipran ER were initiated at 20 mg/d for days 1 and 2 and to 40 mg/d beginning on day 3. Dosage increase from 40 to 80 mg/d was allowed at the end of week 1 or 2, and an increase from 40 to 80 mg/d or 80 to 120 mg/d was allowed at the end of week 4 on the basis of patient response (&#x0003c;50% improvement in the Montgomery-&#x000c5;sberg Depression Rating Scale [MADRS] total score from baseline) and tolerability. No dosage increase was allowed after week 4; dosage decrease to the previous level was possible if significant tolerability issues developed. The patients who completed the 8-week, double-blind treatment period or who prematurely discontinued from the study were eligible to enter the 2-week double-blind down-taper period.</p></sec><sec><title>Inclusion Criteria</title><p>Male or female outpatients, 18 to 80 years of age, inclusive, who met the criteria for MDD according to the <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision</italic>, with an ongoing major depressive episode of at least 4 weeks&#x02019; duration were eligible to participate in this study. Major depressive disorder diagnosis was confirmed by the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> and a computerized depression diagnostic interview. Additional criteria included a score of 30 or higher on the clinician-rated MADRS<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> and a score 26 or higher on the self-rated MADRS. Additional inclusion criteria included normal or abnormal results that were judged as not clinically significant by the investigator on physical examinations, clinical laboratory test results, and electrocardiogram (ECG); serum pregnancy test negative for <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-human chorionic gonadotropin for the female patients and urine screening negative for alcohol and prohibited substances; and body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 40, inclusive.</p></sec><sec><title>Key Exclusion Criteria</title><p>Patients who met the criteria for an axis I disorder other than MDD within 6 months of screening or who had a lifetime history of other major psychiatric diagnoses (eg, manic/hypomanic episode, depressive episode with psychotic features, substance abuse/dependence within the previous 6 months, borderline or antisocial personality disorders, or cognitive disorders) were excluded; comorbid generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, and/or specific phobias were allowed. Additional exclusion criteria included a history of nonresponse to adequate treatment with at least 2 antidepressants or intolerance or hypersensitivity to milnacipran or other SNRIs, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or selective noradrenergic reuptake inhibitors. Suicide risk, defined as suicide attempt within the past year, a score of 5 or higher on MADRS item 10 (suicidal thoughts), or significant risk as judged by the investigator or determined by information obtained from the Columbia&#x02013;Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS),<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> was an additional reason for exclusion. Patients with medical conditions that might interfere with the conduct of the study, confound the interpretation of study results, or endanger well-being (eg, history or evidence of malignancy or any significant hematologic, endocrine, cardiovascular, respiratory, renal, hepatic, gastrointestinal, or neurologic disease) were excluded. The use of concomitant psychotropic medications (except eszopiclone zaleplon, zolpidem for insomnia) was prohibited, as was treatment with any other investigational product during the study or within 3 months of screening.</p></sec><sec><title>Efficacy Assessments</title><p>The MADRS was assessed at all study visits (screening [week &#x02212;1]; baseline [week 0]; and weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8), and the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS)<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> was assessed at weeks 0, 4, 6, and 8.</p><p>In addition, the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD<sub>17</sub>)<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> (all study visits), the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity (weeks 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8) and the Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement (CGI-I) (weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8),<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> and the Motivation and Energy Inventory&#x02013;Short Form (MEI-SF) (weeks 0, 4, 6, and 8)<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> were also evaluated.

An unstructured covariance matrix was used to model the covariance of within-patient scores; the Kenward-Roger approximation,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> based on all postbaseline scores using only observed cases without imputation of missing values, was used to estimate denominator degrees of freedom.</p><p>Sensitivity analyses were performed on the primary parameter using the last observation carried forward (LOCF) approach to impute missing postbaseline values and the pattern mixture model (PMM). In the LOCF analysis, the treatment groups were compared using an analysis of covariance model, with the treatment group and pooled study center as factors and the baseline MADRS total score as the covariate. The PMM approach, based on non&#x02013;future-dependent missing value restrictions,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> was performed to assess the robustness of the primary MMRM results to the possible violation of the missing-at-random missingness assumption.</p><p>The secondary efficacy parameter was change from baseline to week 8 on SDS total score; the SDS total score was calculated only for patients with valid scores on all 3 SDS subscale domains (work, family life, and social life). Subscale scores were calculated on the basis of nonmissing observations for each domain. The method used for SDS analysis was similar to that for the primary outcome analysis; LOCF sensitivity analysis was also performed.</p><p>For most additional efficacy parameters, change from baseline to week 8 was analyzed using MMRM and LOCF approaches, similar to those used for the primary efficacy parameter.

The cost of depression in the United States in 2000 was estimated to be $83.1 billion, with 31% of the total attributed to direct medical costs, 7% attributed to suicide-related mortality, and 62% attributed to workplace costs.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> The substantial social and economic consequences of MDD indicate that symptomatic improvement and normalizing function should be considered integral components of recovery and return to well-being.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p>In this phase III study, the total score change from baseline to week 8 on the MADRS, the primary efficacy parameter, was statistically different in favor of levomilnacipran ER (&#x02212;15.3) versus placebo (&#x02212;12.2; <italic>P</italic> = 0.0051; MMRM); statistically significant separation from placebo started from week 4 and persisted through the remainder of the double-blind treatment.

Statistically significant differences in SDS total score, the secondary efficacy parameter, for levomilnacipran ER versus placebo occurred as early as week 4, the time of the first SDS assessment; a statistically significant difference versus placebo was also observed on each SDS subscale score at week 8.</p><p>Patients with depression commonly experience reduced motivation and energy as a consequence of the disorder or as a side effect of pharmacotherapy; identifying interventions that can restore vigor is an important component of effective treatment.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Improvement in patient motivation and energy was demonstrated by a statistically significant difference in MEI-SF total score change from baseline to week 8 in favor of levomilnacipran ER compared with placebo. In addition, statistically significant differences in the MEI-SF social and cognitive subscale scores for levomilnacipran ER versus placebo demonstrated improvement in domains that are relevant to improved functional impairment.</p><p>Significant differences in score change from baseline to week 8 were observed on many additional efficacy measures. Cognitive impairment and fatigue, MDD symptoms that commonly impair daily functioning,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> were independently assessed in this trial to more fully elucidate patient progress. Because norepinephrine may be related to specific depression symptoms including attention,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> the strong noradrenergic component of levomilnacipran ER may be of particular importance in relation to improving attention and associated functional impairment. A statistically significant difference between levomilnacipran ER and placebo was observed on the continuity of attention score, and numerical improvements were noted in several of the other attention-related measures. It is possible that the short-term duration of the study might not be long enough to detect drug treatment effects on cognitive measures, and future research in this area is warranted.</p><p>The proportion of patients achieving MADRS response (&#x02265;50% reduction from baseline) was significantly greater for levomilnacipran ER compared with placebo, and the NNT for response showed that 8 patients would need to be treated with levomilnacipran ER to show 1 additional MADRS response outcome.

More patients receiving drug or placebo achieved symptomatic remission (HAMD<sub>17</sub> &#x02264;7 or MADRS &#x02264;10) than functional remission (SDS &#x02264;6 and score &#x02264;2 on each item). In contrast, no apparent lag in functional improvement compared with symptomatic improvement was observed in the current study. Rates of MADRS and SDS response for the patients receiving drug or placebo were similar in this case, as were rates of MADRS and SDS remission. However, in light of the potential for asynchronous symptomatic and functional improvement, separate evaluations of the 2 domains may more accurately determine the overall state of wellness in patients with MDD.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></p><p>Levomilnacipran ER was generally well tolerated by the patients in this study. The overall rate of premature discontinuation was slightly higher for the levomilnacipran ER group (24.9%) than the placebo group (20.7%); 3.2% of the placebo patients and 7.8% of the levomilnacipran ER patients discontinued because of AEs. Treatment-emergent AEs were reported more frequently in the levomilnacipran ER group (81.6%) compared with the placebo group (61.8%), although most were considered mild in intensity. Nausea, the most common levomilnacipran ER&#x02013;associated TEAE, was not dose dependent, had onset early in the course of treatment (week 1&#x02013;2), and was transient. No SAEs that occurred during the double-blind period, including a suicide attempt reported in 1 levomilnacipran ER patient, were considered by the investigators to be related to the investigational product. Of the 2 SAEs that occurred in the down-taper period, the investigator considered 1 SAE (hypertension/noncardiac chest pain) to be related and 1 SAE (suicidal ideation) to be unrelated to levomilnacipran ER treatment.</p><p>Pulse rate and blood pressure increases were greater for the levomilnacipran ER patients compared with the placebo patients, which is consistent with the AE profile of other SNRIs.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>
<sc>p</sc>otentially clinically significant changes in pulse rate or blood pressure during the double-blind treatment were reported in 2 levomilnacipran ER patients and 1 placebo patient. The incidence of vital sign&#x02013;related TEAEs was higher in the levomilnacipran ER group. QTcB increase was greater for the levomilnacipran ER patients compared with the placebo patients, which is consistent with the heart rate increase also observed in the levomilnacipran ER treatment group; QTcB interval increase of 60 milliseconds or greater was observed in 6 patients (2.8%) in the levomilnacipran ER group. The mean change in QTcF was similar in both groups. No patients met the PCS criteria for PR, QTcB, or QTcF interval.</p><p>The limitations of this study include the lack of an active comparator arm; the short 8-week, double-blind treatment period; and the strict inclusion and exclusion criteria that may limit the ability to generalize the findings. The level of baseline depression in the study population may be considered a confounding factor in regard to MADRS and SDS remission rates because high baseline depression can affect the interpretation of clinical study results.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28,33</xref> In this study, low and similar rates of remission for levomilnacipran ER and placebo on the MADRS or the SDS may reflect the difficulty of detecting remission differences in short-term individual studies and the extended period needed to achieve remission in a majority of patients with MDD, especially when baseline MADRS and SDS scores are high and stringent remission criteria are used.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> The use of the SDS as the prespecified secondary outcome to measure functional impairment is a strength of this study, and significant differences on SDS total and subscale scores in favor of levomilnacipran ER compared with placebo should be of great interest to the field.</p><p>Symptomatic improvement and functional improvement are both critical components of recovery from MDD. In this phase III clinical trial, score change from baseline to end of treatment on the MADRS was statistically different in favor of levomilnacipran ER compared with placebo, indicating improvement in symptomatic severity for the levomilnacipran ER patients. In addition, statistically significant differences in score change on the SDS and its subscales suggest that treatment with levomilnacipran ER compared with placebo decreases functional impairment across the domains of work, social life, and family life. The statistically significant difference in MEI-SF total and subscale scores indicated greater motivation and energy in the patients treated with levomilnacipran ER compared with placebo. Levomilnacipran ER exhibited a generally good safety and tolerability profile. This study suggests that levomilnacipran ER is a safe and effective treatment of the symptoms and functional impairments associated with MDD.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>The authors thank Carol Dyer, MS, and Adam Ruth, PhD, of Prescott Medical Communications Group, Chicago, IL, and a contractor for Forest Research Institute for writing assistance and editorial support for the preparation of this manuscript.</p></ack><ack><title>AUTHOR DISCLOSURE INFORMATION</title><p>Angelo Sambunaris has received consultant fees from Forest Research Institute, Inc.
