A unique purpose-built exercise park was designed to provide a fun but physically challenging environment to support exercise in a community setting. This project is a randomised controlled trial designed to evaluate the effectiveness of an exercise intervention using an exercise park specifically designed for older people in reducing the risk of falls.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>This study will be a parallel randomised control trial with pre and post intervention design. One hundred and twenty people aged between 60 and 90&#x000a0;years old will be recruited from Melbourne suburbs and will be randomly allocated to either an exercise park intervention group (EPIG) or a control group (CG). The CG will receive social activities and an educational booklet on falls prevention. The BOOMER balance test will be used as the primary outcome measure. Secondary outcome measures will include hand grip strength, two minute walk test, lower limb strength test, spatio-temporal walking parameters, health related quality of life, feasibility, adherence, safety, and a number of other psychosocial measures. Outcome assessment will be conducted at baseline and at 18 and 26&#x000a0;weeks after intervention commencement. Participants will inform their falls and physical activity history for a 12-month period via monthly calendars. Mixed linear modelling incorporating intervention and control groups at the baseline and two follow up time points (18&#x000a0;weeks and 26&#x000a0;weeks after intervention commencement) will be used to assess outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This planned trial will be the first to provide evidence if the exercise park can improve functional and physiological health, psychological and well-being. In addition, this study will provide empirical evidence for effectiveness and explore the barriers to participation and the acceptability of the senior exercise park in the Australian older community.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>This trial is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry - Registry No. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.anzctr.org.au/TrialSearch.aspx?searchTxt=ACTRN12614000700639&#x00026;ddlSearch=Registered">ACTRN12614000700639</ext-link> registered on Jul 3rd 2014.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12877-015-0057-5) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Falls prevention</kwd><kwd>Older adults</kwd><kwd>Exercise park</kwd><kwd>Social interaction</kwd><kwd>Effectiveness</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Falls are a leading cause of death and disability among older adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. About one third of people aged 65&#x000a0;years or older fall at least once a year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In 2013, Australia had 14&#x000a0;% of its population aged 65&#x000a0;years and over [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] with approximately 10&#x000a0;% have multiple falls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and 20&#x000a0;% of those who fall experience injuries requiring medical attention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In 2011&#x02013;12, there were 88,386 fall related hospitalisations in Australia for people aged over 65&#x000a0;years, with the most common injury being hip or other lower limb fracture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Hip fractures in particular are associated with high level of mortality and morbidity, with recent studies reporting that 20&#x000a0;% of hip fracture patients die within 12&#x000a0;months of injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and over half do not regain pre-fracture mobility or large muscle group abilities up to two years after the fracture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>Most falls are associated with one or more identifiable risk factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and the risk of falling has a direct association with the number of risk factors involved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Physiological factors, such as lower extremity muscle weakness, gait and balance impairments and functional impairments, have been highly associated with the risk of falls and are most often targeted by preventive programmes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Therefore, targeting these modifiable risk factors through exercise programmes seems to be a suitable way to reduce the risk of falls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>Exercise programmes have been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of falling and the rate of falls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] as they can improve muscle strength, flexibility, balance, coordination, proprioception, reaction time and gait [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. These positive outcomes have been observed even in the very old and frail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. A meta-analysis identified that 50&#x000a0;h cumulative exercise (irrespective of exercise frequency) is needed to reduce the risk of falls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. A recent telephone survey applied in NSW has shown that older people&#x02019;s participation to strength or balance-challenging activities was 21.0&#x000a0;% (95&#x000a0;% CI: 9.8&#x02013;22.2) with only 5.3&#x000a0;% participating in both forms (strength and balance-challenging activities) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Thus, there is a need to improve long-term participation in physical activity, which is not a common habit for most older individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>The &#x0201c;exercise park for older people&#x0201d; was originally introduced in Europe in 2009 as a novel purpose-built exercise park designed to improve muscular strength, flexibility, coordination and balance through active fun activities. The exercise park aims to inspire older people to be playful, to exercise, and to challenge their bodies, which can lead to a more active and healthier life style. Such indoor and outdoor exercise parks are widely available in Finland, Spain and China with only few operating in Australia. Preliminary data from The Netherlands suggests the purpose-built exercise parks may be safe and acceptable to older people. However, no evidence-based research exists that demonstrates the effectiveness of the exercise park in improving physical health, psychological well-being or independence. A report from The Netherlands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] provided preliminary evidence of the feasibility of a 10&#x000a0;weeks exercise program with the exercise park equipment for a small sample of older people (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;13), reporting high attendance (92&#x000a0;%), reduction in fear of falling and increased muscle strength and balance. Although these results are promising, further research is needed with a larger sample size and a longer intervention period to determine the effectiveness of the exercise park program on physical and psychological outcomes, well-being and independence of older adults, as well as determining the feasibility and acceptability of this type of program in the Australian community.</p><p>Therefore, the aims of this study are (1) to evaluate the effectiveness of such an exercise park in reducing the risk of falls and (2) to evaluate what other benefits, including psychosocial, functional and physiological, can be achieved by using this specific exercise park for 18&#x000a0;weeks with a structured and progressive program in community dwelling older adults using a randomised controlled trial design and (3) what benefits are sustained eight weeks after completion of the exercise park program.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods and design</title><p>All procedures involved in this trial will be conducted in compliance with National Statement on Ethical Human Resource and the Australian Code for the Responsible Conduct of Research. Ethical approval has been obtained from the Human Research Ethics Committee from Victoria University, Melbourne (Application ID. HRE13-215). The study was design according to the Consolidated Standard of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines and publications associated with the trial will be reported according the CONSORT 2010 Statement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design and setting</title><p>This study will be a parallel randomised controlled trial (RCT) with pre and post intervention design (outcome assessments at baseline and at 18 and 26&#x000a0;weeks after participation commencement) comparing an exercise park intervention program for older people with a control group, aiming at evaluating the effectiveness of an exercise intervention using an exercise park specifically designed for older people in reducing the risk of falls.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Participants</title><p>One hundred and twenty older people living in the community aged between 60 and 90&#x000a0;years old who have had one or more falls in the previous 12&#x000a0;months or who are concerned about having a fall will be recruited. Participants who are generally active and independent in the community with no more than a single point stick used for regular outdoors walking (at least three times per week) will be included. The aim in these inclusion criteria is to target those with mild falls risk, but who remain relatively active, using a health promotion and prevention approach.</p><p>Older adults will be excluded from this study if they have: 1) any uncontrolled non-musculoskeletal conditions that would make testing difficult and uncomfortable, such as chronic obstructive airways disease and congestive heart failure; 2) a pre-existing neurological or orthopaedic condition that affects lower limb strength (e.g.: polio, stroke); 3) any of the following foot conditions: partial foot amputation or ulceration or foot fractures; 4) any uncontrolled musculoskeletal conditions that may affect ambulation (rheumatoid arthritis, gout, etc.). Participants with heart problems (e.g. chest pain (angina), heart murmur, heart rhythm disturbance, heart valve disease or heart failure) will be required to obtain a medical clearance from their general practitioner in order to participate in this study. Participants with any documented medical condition or physical impairment that is judged by the medical practitioner to contraindicate their inclusion will be excluded. Written informed consent will be sought from the participants</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Recruitment and randomization</title><p>Participants will be recruited from Melbourne suburbs. Local senior organizations, retirement villages, community centres, senior clubs and associations in the areas around the park location will be contacted for recruitment purposes. Participants will be also recruited via community health promotion events and advertisement in local newspapers, magazines and online social networking media. Participants will be informed about the project by posters placed in healthcare facilities and places with high circulation of senior citizens and mail-out advertisements to health care practitioners in Melbourne. Participants will be randomly allocated to one of the following groups: (1) Exercise Park Intervention Group (EPIG) or (2) Control Group (CG). Block randomization stratification by gender will be undertaken, so that blocks of 12 participants will be recruited at a time, randomized into one control group of six participants and one exercise groups of six participants (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). To accommodate couples (e.g. partners/married couples) participation, randomisation by couple will also take place. Assessors will prepare the envelopes with six paper codes (three exercise intervention and three control group) which will be added to opaque not concealed envelopes. There will be three envelopes: one for couples, one for females and one for males. Participants will be asked to pick one paper from their respective envelope and the picked paper will assign the participant to either the exercise intervention group or control group. Recruitment will be undertaken over a period of 14&#x000a0;months to achieve a sample size of 60 participants in each group. Assessors and participants will not be blinded to their respective group allocation (EPIG or CG).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Consort flow diagram of recruitment and randomization</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12877_2015_57_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p>Participants from the EPIG will undergo an 18-week exercise intervention. The exercise sessions will be provided two times a week (each class approximately 1 to 1.5&#x000a0;h duration) and will be supervised by a qualified physiotherapist or an accredited exercise physiologist. Each session will consist of 5 to 10 min warm-up exercises, followed by 45 to 75 min on the equipment stations, and will conclude with 5 to 10 min of cool down exercises. The exercise classes will include 6 to 8 participants and will be circuit-based with the warm up and cool down exercises being performed in a group and the core session being carried out in training pairs.

EPIG or CG participants&#x02019; participation and attendance will be recorded via a spreadsheet diary and will be collected respectively by the exercise supervisor of that participant on each specific session or by the principal researcher. Physical activity calendars will be used to monitor if EPIG or CG participants have participated in any other physical activities during their participation in the study. Reasons for participants missing sessions will be documented on the spreadsheet diary. Participants will be given a phone call in case they miss two consecutive sessions without any communication with any exercise supervisors.</p><p>Considering that the exercise sessions are held outdoors, this study intends to investigate if the participants&#x02019; adherence would be influenced by weather conditions during the four seasons in Melbourne. Seasonal adherence will be recoded as adherence over Summer (December to end of February), Fall (March to end of May), Winter (June to end of August) and Spring (September to end of November). Also, the number of sessions that were cancelled due to rainy, windy and excessively hot days (above 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C) will be recorded given that these conditions would potentially put participant&#x02019;s safety and health in risk.</p><p>Safety and adverse effects will be measured by the number of falls incidents that occur during exercise sessions, and will be recorded via an incident report form (treatment needed post-incident and related lesions or injuries). The circumstances surrounding the fall (e.g. muscle fatigue, dizziness) will be recorded. EPIG participants will be also asked in the following session (48&#x000a0;h) to report if they experienced any uncomfortable delayed muscle soreness or fatigue post-exercise that limited them from doing their daily tasks such as ascending and descending stairs, rising from a chair, and carrying shopping bags. The following question will be used: &#x0201c;Did you experience any muscle soreness after the session that limited you from doing your normal daily activities such as carrying shopping bags, rising from a chair or putting a t-shirt on?&#x0201d;. If they answer &#x0201c;yes&#x0201d; the muscle soreness event will be recorded on the participant&#x02019;s spreadsheet diary.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Community partner organizations</title><p>An important aspect of projects of this nature is the identification of the community partner organizations that can help with personnel, infrastructure and logistical matters needed for its successful running. A key element of the design of this project is to conduct it in the community and therefore create a better platform for research translation. Therefore, a number of community organizations with a focus on older people&#x02019;s health promotion and specialised care were approached. These community organizations were mainly selected based on the nature of the work they have been involved in with this specific population group. Two community organisations: Catholic Homes and Gateway Social Support Options have partnered to collaborate in this research project. Catholic Homes provided the infrastructure and land for the equipment installation and allow for the exercise session to be conducted in the community setting. Gateway Social Support Options is a community-based organisation with over 200 older people living in the western suburbs of Melbourne. Gateway Social Support Options will provide access to its members for participant recruitment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Exercise park</title><p>The senior exercise park used on this project was provided in-kind by Lappset (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) and it was installed at the St Bernadette&#x02019;s Community Respite House in Sunshine North. The exercise park consists of a number of components and stations that aim to work on the following aspects of physical performance: upper body mobility and fine motor skills, balance and coordination, lower limb and upper limb strength, stretching and flexibility (Tables&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>, <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref> and <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Lappset&#x02019;s exercise park for senior population</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12877_2015_57_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Familiarisation and exercise intensity</title><p>A familiarisation session will be organised for each participant prior to commencement of the exercise program. The exercises will follow the guidelines of the Australian Position Statement of exercise for falls prevention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>].

Adjustment of the exercises (i.e. increase in intensity and difficulty) will be made based on the participant individual progression. RPE will be used to determine the intensity of each exercise where participants will be encouraged to exercise with a RPE between 4 and 7/10. New exercises will be gradually introduced to the participants every 1&#x02013;2 weeks (See Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab7" ref-type="table">7</xref>).

Two participants will be allocated in each station such that each participant will perform one at a time and will swap over (See Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>). However, a participant can be exercising only with their exercise supervisor in case there is an uneven number. Participants will have different pairs and exercise supervisors on each session to stimulate social interaction. Participants will be given a resting period of 30&#x02013;60&#x000a0;s which will be adjusted according to program progression as detailed in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab8" ref-type="table">8</xref>. The duration of each exercise will also increase based on program progression (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab8" ref-type="table">8</xref>). Rest periods between exercises will be used to discuss about difficulties and to provide further feedback. Participants will be allowed to have as many breaks as necessary to keep them performing the exercises with good technique and proper form. As some exercises such as step-ups on platform, ramp&#x02009;+&#x02009;walking through a net, and taps onto a platform can be more challenging to some participants due to the platform height, wooden blocks (L 70&#x000a0;cm x W 40&#x000a0;cm x H 10&#x000a0;cm) will initially be used for these participants.

Firstly, all exercise supervisors will receive a written exercise protocol manual to be followed in all sessions. Secondly, participants will have their attended sessions recorded by the supervising researcher to make sure that they are receiving nearly the same amount of exercise prescription at the end of the 18&#x000a0;weeks of exercise intervention. Participants who have missed more than eight sessions (for being unwell or away) at the end of the 18-week period will be asked to make up these missed sessions until they reach a minimum of 35&#x000a0;h (out of 50 expected hours) of exercise delivery. Finally, fidelity to treatment delivery will be monitored via the use of exercise cards (per participant) for the specific training date with further details of the participant&#x02019;s performance and general suggestions for the next session (i.e. improve level of certain exercise, monitor pain, watch technique, etc.).</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Sample size</title><p>Power analysis was undertaken using previously published discharge data on the primary outcome measure - the BOOMER balance measure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], and assuming an improvement of 3 points (reported as the minimum detectable difference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]) and an effect size of 0.5. A sample size of 48 participants per group will be required for a power of 0.80 and alpha of 0.05. We will allow for 20&#x000a0;% dropout rate (this is a conservative estimate based on previous exercise programs with older people), and therefore will recruit 60 participants per group.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Data management and statistical analysis</title><p>All analyses will be conducted on an intention-to-treat basis. If there are chance imbalances in baseline participants&#x02019; characteristics, then these variables will be used as covariates. Mixed linear modelling incorporating intervention and control groups at the baseline and two follow up time points (18&#x000a0;weeks and 26&#x000a0;weeks after intervention commencement), with the number of sessions attended and baseline physical activity level as covariates, will be carried out using SPSS. Comparisons will be made for the primary outcome (BOOMER) and secondary outcomes (functional tasks, strength measures, gait parameters, health related quality of life measures, and psychosocial measures). Although the number of falls is being recorded over a period of 12&#x000a0;months after the commencement of participants, this study is not powered for falls outcomes. Regarding the qualitative data being collected, the interviews from EPIG participants will be analysed using a thematic analysis approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>], as described above.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec19" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this community based study we aim to evaluate the effectiveness of an exercise intervention using an exercise park specifically designed for older people in reducing the risk of falls and improving strength and balance. Whether such exercise parks have an impact on reducing the risk of falls, improving muscle strength and balance and quality-of-life is not yet known. As such this planned trial will be the first to provide evidence if the exercise park can improve physical health or psychological well-being. In addition, this study aims to describe this innovative exercise approach, and report its feasibility and the challenges associated with running this in a community setting.</p><p>Falls and related injuries are the leading cause of disability among older adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Physical activity, more specifically exercise, has been shown to be effective in preventing falls in older people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, data from the 2011&#x02013;12 Australian Health Survey: Physical Activity report found that only 36.6&#x000a0;% of males and 38.8&#x000a0;% of females over 65 engage in sufficient physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. Considering the 75 and over group, these figures are even more problematic with just one in three men and one in five women being sufficiently physically active [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. Thus, finding falls prevention initiatives that increase levels of physical activity and factors that contribute to adherence such as the exercise park initiative is important to reduce their risk of falling and their rate of falls.</p><p>Exercise parks may offer a playful and enjoyable experience to their users which may increase compliance for participation in fall prevention programs. By providing a fun but physically challenging environment, this novel and unique concept may provide an alternative strategy to enhance physical activity levels in older individuals and consequently increase their health and ability to cope more effectively with the challenges faced in their daily life. Subscribing to this idea, a recent study recommended that physical activity sessions that focus on overall movement rather than structured exercise program might be more achievable for the older population group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>].</p><p>Community-based exercise programs that focus on health and wellness for physically inactive community-dwelling seniors have been shown to be effective in reducing feelings of loneliness and social isolation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. After people retire, they are more likely to stay at home alone, watching television and reading newspapers, and consequently become sedentary in their lifestyle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. The senior exercise parks may provide an opportunity for seniors to socialize more, improve their quality of life and, their physical and mental health. This novel method could be an option for them to exercise their bodies and minds in an enjoyable way through strength, balance and coordination exercises as well as simple activities to support a variety of activities of daily living.</p><p>The type of environment on which exercise-based therapeutic interventions are offered is vital for their success [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. A study with post-menopausal women showed that indoor activities have been associated with negative feelings such as frustration, anger, sadness and anxiety whereas outdoor programs have been associated with positive feelings such as happiness, joy and pleasure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. Contributing to these findings, outdoor exercises were shown to improve mood and self-esteem in older people, and seniors tend to attend more to the outdoor sessions compared to the indoor ones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. However, outdoor sessions such as the one proposed by the senior exercise park program can be dependent on climate and seasonal conditions which has the potential to influence adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. The planned project will explore how participation can be affected by seasonal conditions.</p><p>The proposed intervention will use task-specific exercises (e.g. step and stair climbing, walking on unstable and uneven surfaces, etc.) which can be easily translated to older adults&#x02019; activities of daily living. In addition, senior exercise parks can be installed outdoors or indoors in public places such as community centres and parks free of charge to the public. While an intervention of this nature might comprise some financial and logistic engagement of the local councils and community organizations, this initiative could potentially be a cost-effective way to engage older individuals in a more active and healthier lifestyle.</p><p>This study is evaluating not only quantitative data but also qualitative data through EPIG participant interviews. Therefore, more comprehensive information to assess the acceptability, likely barriers, facilitators to adherence and general experiences of this targeted group throughout participation in the project can be obtained and that may help in the analysis of the feasibility of the proposed exercise intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>].</p><p>It has been demonstrated that older people of lower socio-economic status have a higher rate of hospitalisation due to falls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. Specifically in Melbourne, the western and northern suburbs of Melbourne comprise one of the areas of lowest income and more socioeconomic disadvantage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. Therefore, this would be an important area to target future interventions to prevent falls in older populations and one of the reasons why the exercise park used in this project is installed in Sunshine North, a western suburb of Melbourne. However, the western side of Melbourne is also marked by the existence of many multicultural groups and ethnicities (high presence non-English speaking immigrants) which can potentially make recruitment and retention of participants more complicated due to cultural and language barriers. Low literacy levels, competing responsibilities and location of the testing site and intervention have been listed as reasons why recruitment in these areas of lower socio-economic status may face challenges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. Thus, the outcomes of this study will examine how these mentioned factors play a role and may affect the feasibility of this kind of initiative in these areas.</p><p>Community based falls prevention interventions supported by community organizations are important as they have the potential to be sustained. Our focus will be on the benefits to the individual and the opportunities to continue such a program beyond the duration of the project. In addition, this project will provide policy makers with empirical evidence of the effectiveness of an exercise park and the factors which might influence the implementation of such parks on a larger scale.</p><sec id="Sec20"><title>Limitations</title><p>This study has a number of limitations. Firstly, it has been reported that some participants who do not receive their preferred treatment may experience &#x0201c;resentful demoralisation&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], may not comply with the program structure proposed, may not report accurate responses on the follow-up appointments and may even drop out from the trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. This may introduce some bias which could possibly affect the internal validity of the trial. However, because their preference is being recorded before the randomization occurs, this preference will be taken into account when analysing and interpreting the results. Secondly, due to budget limitations, this study will not be blinded where the principal researcher will be conducting the assessments, the randomization and the exercise intervention. However, despite these limitations, the results of this study will be able to provide an insight on how older adults will respond to this novel and unique senior exercise park. Furthermore, this study will report the possible health benefits and well-being improvements on older people when using this exercise park and will guide further larger research trials.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec21" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The outcomes of this project will provide empirical evidence for the effectiveness of the use of the novel exercise park in the community and how its use can improve physical (e.g. strength and balance), psychological (e.g. fear or falling and self-perception) as well as psychosocial (e.g. increased social participation) aspects of older people's lives. In addition, this study will explore the barriers to participation and the acceptability and feasibility of the senior exercise park in the Australian older community as a mode of physical activity in older age.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec22"><title>Additional file</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12877_2015_57_MOESM1_ESM.docx" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>
