Digital technology offers platforms for making such programs widely available in a cost-efficient manner. However, it remains unclear who accesses online parenting advice and in particular, whether the parents who would most benefit are represented amongst users. It is also unknown whether the uptake of online programs can be improved by health professional recommendations, or whether parents require additional prompts and reminders to use the program. In this study we aim to: (1) determine whether weekly email prompts increase engagement with and use of a brief online program about infant sleeping and crying, (2) determine whether encouragement from a maternal and child health nurse promotes greater engagement with and use of the program, (3) examine who uses a brief online program about infant sleeping and crying; and, (4) examine the psychosocial characteristics of participants.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>This study is a randomised, parallel group, superiority trial, with all participating primary carers of infants aged 2 to 12&#x000a0;weeks, receiving access to the online program.

Common parent concerns centre on the amount and pattern of their infant&#x02019;s sleep, strategies for settling, and how to best manage infant crying [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Evidence suggests that anticipatory guidance delivered face-to-face, helps parents to establish good infant sleep habits, reduces parent distress about normal infant crying, and reduces postnatal depression (PND) symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, it has not been determined whether this type of approach can be effectively delivered online. The internet potentially offers a cost effective and convenient platform for delivery of anticipatory guidance to large and geographically diverse audiences. Currently, little is known about the characteristics of parents who particpate in online programs during the early postpartum period, or how to best enhance recruitment and maintain engagement with the program content. An evidence based program, <italic>Cry Baby</italic>, was developed for online delivery. The aim of this study is to examine the characteristics of parents (and their infants) who seek help for infant behaviour via a parenting website, and identify any under- or over- representation of population subgroups within the sample. We also seek to determine whether encouragement from a health professional to take part in an online program, and/or regular weekly email support, promotes greater engagement with the program and greater use of suggested strategies.</p><p>Infant sleep problems are common (38&#x000a0;% of parents of 4 week old infants report infant sleep problems) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], costly to treat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], and are associated with increased risk of PND [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and parental fatigue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. A number of randomised controlled trials have shown that behavioural-education interventions that give advice on how to set up good sleep habits in infancy can successfully prevent problems with infant settling and night waking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. These interventions promote parenting efficacy; enhancing parent confidence and competence with managing infant sleep and crying behaviours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>Infant crying is normal and has a natural peak in frequency of around 2.5&#x000a0;h of crying per day at around 6&#x02013;8 weeks of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. While infant crying rarely has a medical cause [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], 27&#x000a0;% of parents report their infant&#x02019;s crying is a problem and many of these parents will seek assistance in the belief that something is medically wrong [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Educating parents on normal infant crying behaviour may reduce parental distress and the incidence of parents unnecessarily seeking costly medical support. Additionally, providing parents with advice on strategies for coping with infant crying, may help prevent cases of Abusive Head Trauma (AHT; previously known as Shaken Baby Syndrome) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Frequent infant crying is a proximal risk factor for AHT, and is potentially more readily modifiable than other risk factors such as being of low socioeconomic status, or born prematurely [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>Mothers who report infant sleep and crying difficulties are at increased risk for PND [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In a short-term longitudinal study, Goldberg and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] found that mothers who were experiencing symptoms of distress at 6 months had infants with more sleep and crying issues, and reported being more bothered by those issues. This trend was still apparent when the infant was 12&#x000a0;months of age. Hiscock and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] found that providing parents with a brief behavioural intervention delivered by a primary healthcare professional at 8 months of infant age was effective in reducing infant sleep problems and improving maternal mental health. Early intervention for unsettled infant behaviour, may reduce the risk of ongoing maternal symptoms of depression and distress through later infancy. Emerging research also suggests that infant sleep and settling problems may impact on parental fatigue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In an Australian sample Giallo and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] found the mothers of young children (0&#x02013;4 years) with sleep and settling difficulties had an increased risk of experiencing high levels of fatigue, with the potential for adverse impacts upon their daily functioning, parenting and later child outcomes.</p><p>Several research trials have established the effectiveness of interventions designed to improve infant sleep or help parents manage infant crying [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. An Australian randomised controlled trial evaluated the <italic>Baby Business</italic> program, which provided anticipatory guidance on infant sleep and crying with content delivered via booklet, DVD, telephone consultation and a parent group session [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Compared to the control condition, the program resulted in significantly better outcomes for mothers and infants, including a greater decline in PND symptoms from 4 to 6 months post-natally, less time spent attending to the infant during the night, fewer changes to infant formula to &#x02018;manage&#x02019; infant behaviour, less doubt about settling the infant at bedtime and better ability to set limits at bedtime. Additionally, mothers of a sub-group of infants that were &#x02018;frequent feeders&#x02019; (fed greater than 11 times per 24&#x000a0;h) reported fewer daytime sleep and crying problems. These findings bode well for the prevention of future sleep problems in these infants.</p><p>While the efficacy of face-to-face interventions has been established, low income parents and those residing outside of major metropolitan areas, face major obstacles to accessing parenting interventions. Key barriers include difficulties with transportation, problems accessing childcare to attend appointments, and inflexible work hours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Studies have shown that mothers of young children frequently consult the internet for information about their children&#x02019;s health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and social isolation amongst young mothers is associated with greater amounts of time spent online overall [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. A study from the Royal Childrens Hospital (Melbourne, Australia) indicated that 81&#x000a0;% of mothers had access to the internet and 18&#x000a0;% had changed the way they managed their children&#x02019;s health based on information found online [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. While the internet offers the potential for better access to evidence-based interventions for vulnerable, low income and/or remote families, particularly via the ubiquitous smartphone, little is known about actual uptake of online interventions by these families. Given the higher adoption rates of home internet connection and smartphone ownership in higher income groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], it is possible that online programs that target infant sleep and cry problems will attract the same over-representation of parents who are more highly educated and of higher socioeconomic status, as traditional face-to-face interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>One way this imbalance may be addressed is for infant health care providers to encourage participation. In the Australian state of Victoria all newborn infants are assigned a Maternal and Child Health (MCH) nurse, who provides free health checks at 7 to 10 days, 2 weeks, and then at 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 18, 24 and 42&#x000a0;months of age. Access is almost universal &#x02013; 98&#x000a0;% of infants participate in the first (in-home) visit, and 96.6&#x000a0;% attend the MCH clinic for the 2&#x000a0;week (infant age) check up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. MCH nurses are in a unique position to direct parents to suitable evidence-based online interventions that are specific to the first few weeks postpartum, because they have frequent contact with parents during this time. In addition, evidence suggests that support or encouragement from nurses or other health professionals during online program participation helps to keep parents engaged [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. A strategy often employed to increase engagement and retention to online programs, is the use of email prompts, however, little research has specifically examined their effectiveness. Email prompts have been shown to increase the number of adults who returned to computer tailored lifestyle interventions (targeting smoking behaviour and fruit and vegetable intake, for example) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], and this effect was increased when the prompt occurred soon (2&#x000a0;weeks) after initial program login [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], but we can find no research that evaluates the usefulness of email prompts in samples of parents of infants, whose needs and time demands would be quite different. Uptake of, and retention to, online programs varies considerably, but is generally reported to be lower than anticipated (~2&#x02013;10&#x000a0;% and ~15&#x02013;97&#x000a0;%, respectively) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. If online interventions are intended to be used broadly, then evidence for strategies employed to engage and retain participants, will be necessary.</p><p>Research examining the reach and acceptability of online parenting programs is still in its infancy, however, results so far look promising. A trial of an online intervention designed to treat <italic>existing</italic> sleep problems in infants/toddlers aged 6 to 36&#x000a0;months, resulted in increased infant and mother sleep duration, and reduced infant sleep onset latency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Participant retention to the trial at follow up was very high (97&#x000a0;%) however a financial incentive was offered to parents who took part (ranging from $90&#x02013;$175), making it difficult to determine how many parents would engage with online programs without an incentive. Other trials have demonstrated the effectiveness of online programs for a variety of purposes including educating parents on child mental health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], increasing positive body image in adolescents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] and treating child anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], to name a few. Online programs targeting mental health have also been useful for those in a rural or remote setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p><p>While the effectiveness of face-to-face interventions for <italic>preventing</italic> infant sleep and crying problems has been consistently supported, to the authors&#x02019; knowledge, there have been no trials examining whether the same advice can be effectively delivered via an online program. Such an approach may be particularly appropriate for parents who face complex and competing demands in the first few weeks postpartum. Parents may favour a resource that can be accessed at any time day or night; can be quickly and easily navigated; and that allows access to specific relevant content when the parent needs it. Initial encouragement from a MCH nurse, and/or onging participant support via email, may also be helpful in bolstering parent engagement and rentention to the program. Such strategies would be relatively easily built in to existing postpartum health services or as a feature in an online platform. With this in mind, the <italic>Cry Baby</italic> online program was developed. The current research aims to examine factors influencing participant engagement and retention to the Cry Baby online program, with the intention that results will inform the design of a larger efficacy trial.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Study objectives</title><p>Our objectives are&#x000a0;to examine:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>whether randomisation of participants to a condition that receives additional email prompts that encourage parents to log in to the program, will result in greater use of program strategies (primary outcome) as well as greater retention to the research at follow-up (at 4 months of infant age)</p></list-item><list-item><p>whether parents who have the program recommended by their MCH nurse are more likely to engage with the program (as measured by program completion rates), than those who are recruited via an online advertisement for the program; and, whether they are also more likely to use the suggested strategies</p></list-item><list-item><p>the demographic profile of parents who choose to take part in the online program with a view to identify any over- or under-representation of parents (compared to Australian Census data where possible) based on: household income, socioeconomic status, education, language spoken and support available to parents; or child characteristics, including birth order of infant, infant age, gender, birth weight, gestation, and where the baby sleeps at night; and, to see how this differs for participants who are recruited via a popular parenting website compared to those recruited via their MCH nurse</p></list-item><list-item><p>the psychosocial well being of participants (specifically depression symptoms, fatigue and cognitions surrounding infant sleep in parents, and in infants, night waking behaviour, and, sleep, crying or feeding problems), with a view to identify any specific concerns that may be addressed in the development of new online programs for parents of infants</p></list-item></list></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study design</title><p>The <italic>Cry Baby</italic> trial is a randomised, controlled, superiority trial with two parallel groups (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

The Raising Children Network website is a non-commercial, evidence-based, quality assured, government-funded online resource that covers a broad range of parenting topics and had over 5.7 million visits in the 2013 calendar year (personal communication). A notice will be placed on relevant pages on the Raising Children Network, as well as its social media (e.g., Facebook, Twitter). This notice will contain a link to the study website where parents can gain more information and take part in the program if desired.</p><p>Recruiting some of our sample from Australian wide online advertising and some from a specific region, introduces systematic differences to the groups. In an attempt to reduce this as much as possible, we selected the Melbourne (state of Victoria, Australia) Local Government Area (LGA) of the City of Yarra for MCH nurse recruitment, due to both its high birth rate per annum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], and broad cultural and socioeconomic diversity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. All MCH nurses within this LGA (11) will invite parents of infants attending the 2 week appointment to participate in the trial. The 2 week appointment will be specifically targeted as it was suggested by the nurses that this appointment is less intensive than the in-home appointment at 7&#x02013;10 days postpartum, and it is unusual for parents of infants aged less than 2&#x000a0;weeks to request information on infant sleep and crying so soon after birth. Recruitment will run for a 12&#x000a0;week period and will allow for later determination of the percentage of parents in the general community that are likely to take part in an online program if suggested by their MCH nurse (birth rate data for this region, throughout this time period will be compared to our sample). MCH nurses will provide parents with a postcard, inviting them to participate in the program. The postcard will contain brief information about the study and a link to the study website so they can gain further information about the research. Participants who indicate that they heard about the Cry Baby program via their nurse <italic>and</italic> via online advertising will be classified as having been recruited via their nurse since it is the effect of encouragement from a health professional that we aim to examine. The Cry Baby program is currently only available to those willing to take part in the research trial and has not been broadly advertised outside the Raising Children Network. This means it is very unlikely that parents would have the program suggested to them by other health professionals.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Sample size and condition allocation</title><p>Power analysis using Stata 13.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] was conducted in order to determine the required sample size for the study. There is no prior published data on our primary outcome (&#x02018;use of program strategies&#x02019;). We have based our estimate of the required sample size on the mean total &#x02018;strategy use&#x02019; score of the first 20 participants to be randomised to the control (Cry Baby without email prompts) condition (M&#x02009;=&#x02009;62.53, SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;6.04). A clinically relevant shift in the mean &#x02018;strategy use&#x02019; score of the Cry Baby plus email prompt condition, would be half a standard deviation away from the control group mean. Based on this data, a 2 group comparative study would require a total sample size of 126 participants (63 in each arm) to have 80&#x000a0;% power to detect a statistically significant finding at p&#x02009;&#x0003c;.05 and a moderate effect size. Allowing for a 20&#x000a0;% drop out rate, we aim to recruit 152 parents.</p><p>Participants will be randomly assigned to either the <italic>Cry Baby Only</italic> or the <italic>Cry Baby with Additional Email Prompts</italic> condition, with a 1:1 allocation as per a computer generated randomisation schedule, performed as a simple randomisation. Participants will be randomised using a feature within the online survey program, which offers an online, central randomisation service. Allocation concealment will be ensured, as the service will not release the randomisation code until the participant has been recruited into the trial, and baseline measures have been completed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Eligibility criteria</title><p>Participants will provide informed consent online (by selecting a checkbox that appears after the Information Statement and before the baseline questionnaire), before any study procedures occur.

All content is delivered within the online platform. The program is brief, taking no longer than an hour to complete. The program has inbuilt activities, for example, parents can move objects to make a cot a safe place for a baby to sleep, they can also &#x02018;burst&#x02019; bubbles (using the mouse pointer) to bust common myths about baby care. There is a video showing how to wrap (swaddle) a baby for sleep, links to a coping plan for parents who are feeling overwhelmed by persistent infant crying, as well as links to local parenting support services.</p><p>Participants allocated to the <italic>Cry Baby Only</italic> condition will receive log in details to the <italic>Cry Baby</italic> program. Participants can log in or out of the program whenever they please and can move around different areas of the program according to their interests and requirements. If participants decide to complete the program in one sitting it will take approximately 1 hour to finish. The program is designed to be accessed during the first 6 to 8 weeks post-partum, as this is the time when infant crying is most frequent and the advice offered may be most useful. However, we will allow parents of infants up to 12&#x000a0;weeks of age to take part, as evidence indicates that infants who are very unsettled (this may continue after the usual peak in crying has subsided) are at increased risk for AHT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. The Cry Baby program may be useful for these parents, and gathering data from those with babies aged 8&#x02013;12 weeks, will allow for later determination of the age at which parents find the program most useful.</p><p>Participants who are randomly allocated to the <italic>Cry Baby with Additional Email Prompts</italic> condition will receive access to the <italic>Cry Baby</italic> program and brief, weekly email prompts from the research team. These messages will contain evidence-based, age appropriate information on infant sleep and crying and parent self care, that is already provided within the online <italic>Cry Baby</italic> program. The email prompts will also direct participants back to the program for more detailed information. As above, participants will be encouraged to access the program before their infant is 6 to 8 weeks of age (when possible), and are encouraged to revisit the <italic>Cry Baby</italic> program as often as needed.</p><p>Participants may withdraw from the study at any time for any reason. Likewise, participants allocated to the <italic>Cry Baby with Additional Email Prompts</italic> condition may withdraw from receiving the additional email prompts at any time.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Outcome measures</title><p>Our primary outcome measure will be the frequency with which participants use the strategies recommended in the program (see description of the Follow-Up Questionnaire below). This will be compared across recruitment mode (recruited via the Raising Children Network or via MCH nurse) and trial arms (Cry Baby only versus Cry Baby with Additional Email Prompts conditions).</p><p>Secondary outcome measures include: retention to the program at follow up; program completion rates (indicated by every module of the program having been accessed); participant demographic characteristics; infant characteristics; whether the participant would recommend the program to family/friends; report of infant sleeping, crying and feeding problems; average time the infant spends awake during each night waking; and, parent depressive symptoms, fatigue and cognitions surrounding infant sleep.</p><sec id="Sec10"><title>Baseline questionnaire</title><p>The participant will be asked to complete a baseline questionnaire online.
