These values obtained were higher than values obtained by Buonocore,[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Wickwire and Rentz (25 &#x003bc;m),[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] Voss and Charbeneau (5&#x02013;10 &#x003bc;m),[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and Pahlavan (7 &#x003bc;m) <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] but similar to values obtained by Retief,[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Arakawa <italic>et al.</italic> (50 &#x003bc;m),[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Asmussen,[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] Sundfeld <italic>et al.</italic> (53 &#x003bc;m),[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and Ramesh Kumar <italic>et al.</italic> (53.9754 &#x003bc;m).[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] The reason for this increased tag length by phosphoric acid etched groups could be due to severe etching by unattenuated phosphoric acid.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] However, intergroup comparison showed statistically less significant value (0.065).</p><p>In Group C and Group D the SEP samples showed mean tag lengths of 41.4921 &#x003bc;m and 37.2623 &#x003bc;m, respectively and were thereby comparatively shorter than phosphoric acid groups. The depth of penetration of the tags in this study co-relates with the studies conducted by Bishara <italic>et al.</italic>,[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] Dos Santos[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and Ramesh Kumar <italic>et al.</italic> (53.9754 &#x003bc;m).[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] Intergroup comparison between the SEP's showed significant difference (0.002) such that PEAK SE had shorter tag lengths than Transbond PLUS SE thereby indicating that PEAK SE even though showed conservative etch pattern and depth of penetration, it might not be suitable for orthodontic bonding of brackets pending additional tests like bond strength test. In dentinal areas, greater bond strengths have been reported to occur in areas where dentin tubule density is high and long resin tag formation observed.[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] However, since longer tag lengths are not formed in these groups there has been a consistency in the tag lengths in Group C than in Group D, which thereby increased the surface area of mechanical undercuts thus making the system efficient.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] Group D was included in the study as this could be shown as a parameter for comparison with already existing SEP for orthodontic use.</p><p>The power settings for laser groups had been selected on the basis of various studies on adequate shear bond strengths[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and dentinal studies.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] The mean depth of penetration for Group E, Group F, and Group G were 48.7958 &#x003bc;m, 46.6552 &#x003bc;m, and 51.3578 &#x003bc;m. However, studies pertaining to dentinal penetration, where the cavity was prepared and laser directly applied to dentin region showed, tag lengths greater than 100 &#x003bc;m were observed.[<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] Thus, Group G using 2 W and 20 Hz power produced the maximum tag length in the laser alone group, which produced comparable results to that of SEP group (Group C). Studies by T&#x000fc;rk&#x000f6;z and Ulusoy have proved that laser etching followed by conventional etching provided greater SBS values.[<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] Thus, this group had been included in the study. Groups H, I, and J gave mean penetration values of 54.8632 &#x003bc;m, 66.1526 &#x003bc;m, and 90.25830 &#x003bc;m. These groups provided greater tag lengths than compared to the laser alone etched groups. It, however, results in further roughening of enamel with the addition of acid etching.[<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] Therefore, this group produced the least conservative etch depth patterns.</p><p>From <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref> mean comparison was done between all the groups and it was found that Acid Etch group (Group 1) showed 52.7074 &#x003bc;m, SEP groups (Group 2) showed 39.3772 &#x003bc;m, Laser alone group (Group 3) showed 48.9363 &#x003bc;m, and laser with acid etching group (Group 4) showed 70.4247 &#x003bc;m. Thus, it could be inferred that, though laser with etching group showed greater depths of penetration it was least conservative in terms of enamel demineralization and the operator time is increased with an additional step of conventional etching. Laser alone groups had comparable mean values to that of SEP groups and much lower than conventional acid etched groups. Nevertheless, additional studies have to be conducted in this area thereby leading to more innovative approach for bonding and much needed improvements in material science and laser technology.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Considering the results of the present <italic>in vitro</italic> study it was concluded that:</p><p>
