To compare inflammation, scarring, and alignment in horizontal strabismus, operated uniocularly by either resections or plications (with recessions): recession and resection (R&#x00026;R) or recession and plication (R&#x00026;P) groups. This was a prospective, patient and assessor blind, randomized trial.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Methods:</title><p>All consenting strabismus patients qualifying for the first-time uniocular horizontal rectus surgeries underwent detailed ocular examination and were randomized into standard R&#x00026;R or R&#x00026;P groups. For the latter, we folded the tendon-muscle strap the desired amount using 6-0 polyglactin, suturing it to its insertion, entailing no disinsertion. We compared the groups for inflammatory grades (individually for congestion, chemosis, discharge, foreign-body sensation, and drop intolerance and aggregated to a total inflammatory score (TIS), scar visibility (SV) at 1 m, and successful alignment (&#x02264;10 prism diopter of orthotropia).

As pointed out by Helveston, plication involves far less disruption of the anterior segment circulation and lesser postoperative tissue reaction.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Wright further adds that a lost muscle is less likely with plication, and there is the option of reversibility.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Apart from preserving the anterior ciliary circulation, plication is particularly recommended in uniocular multiple recti surgery where the anterior segment ischemia is of greater concern.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>Recently, a series of articles and books have been published by Mojon on strabismus surgery; although his emphasis is on minimally invasive strabismus surgery (MISS) approach, it is interesting to observe that his favored EOM tightening technique is plication,[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and as his pictures show, the immediate postoperative appearances are remarkable. He operated on a total of 250 patients (approximately) using plication alone or with recession and successfully achieved the surgical target, suggesting that plication offers a good success rate (65% approximately). Later, Velez <italic>et al</italic>. published their series of five patients to exemplify successful outcomes with adjustable plication,[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] reinforcing its many advantages. Recently, Chaudhuri and Demer have retrospectively compared their series of 22 patients who underwent recession and plication (R&#x00026;P) with historical controls who had undergone recessions with resections and have found cosmetically acceptable outcomes with a comparable success rate.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>Plication does seem to have numerous inherent advantages compared to resection, even appearing less &#x0201c;bloody,&#x0201d; technically easier, and perhaps quicker: yet, despite a diligent search of literature (PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and Scopus), we found that no prospective studies have compared the two.</p><p>We therefore designed a prospective study to compare the postoperative inflammation, scar visibility (SV), and success rates in cases of horizontal strabismus, randomized to undergo resection or plication surgery, in combination with recessions.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-1"><title>Methods</title><p>After obtaining institutional ethical clearance, we recruited patients of horizontal strabismus qualifying for uniocular surgical correction involving a tightening and weakening procedure on the recti. We included cases &#x02265;8 years of age, who willingly provided informed consent. Patients with neurological abnormality, lid malpositions, and significant vertical deviation (needing oblique muscles or vertical recti surgeries), prior surgery, or recent chronic topical anti-inflammatories were excluded.</p><p>All patients underwent a thorough examination: uncorrected visual acuity (VA) and best-corrected VA, in logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution, both dry and wet retinoscopy (cyclopentolate 1% drops), biomicroscopy, and ophthalmoscopy. Strabismus-related workup included cover tests, Bruckner and Hirschberg reflex tests, and measurement of deviation using prism bar cover test (PBCT) or prism bar reflex test (PBRT), along with grading of amblyopia (with VA poorer than 20/80 considered severe; and the rest as mild-moderate) and evaluation of ocular motility. Fixation pattern was recorded as foveal or extrafoveal. Bagolini striated glasses classified binocularity as one of the fusion, diplopia, or suppression. Forced duction and force generation tests were undertaken where indicated. Patients were then randomized to recession and resection (R&#x00026;R) or R&#x00026;Pgroups, with allocation concealment using sealed opaque envelopes, opened in the operation theater, after the recession had been carried out.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Surgical steps</title><p>R&#x00026;R were carried out in a standard manner, using a para-limbal conjunctival approach.</p><p>For plication, locking bites were placed at previously marked sites using 6-0 polyglactin (Vicryl, Ethicon, Johnson and Johnson, NW2670) and the points brought anteriorly to the insertion, taking care that the tendon folded on the global aspect of the muscle [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>].

Chemosis was assessed with a slit lamp. Inflammatory symptoms were assessed subjectively by a questionnaire which included discomfort, discharge, and drop intolerance; graded from nil to mild-moderate-severe, resulting in a score between 0 and 3.

The proportions of cases with visible scars were also similar. There was no significant difference in the success rate either. Our study serves to point to the fact that plications as an alternative to resections offer comparable outcomes, in their postoperative inflammatory resolution, SV, and surgical success.</p><p>We found only one study, by Chaudhuri and Demer, in which the author compares the surgical outcomes of resection and plication.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Like us, they found no significant differences in the postoperative surgical outcomes between patients plicated and/or resected. Their study involved a series of 22 patients (17 males, 5 females) undergoing plications (either bilateral or combined with recession of the antagonist), compared to 31 historical controls (14 males, 17 females) who had undergone resections (again either bilateral or combined with the recessions of the antagonist). Their technique of rectus muscle plication was similar to the technique used in our study. Naturally, their follow-up periods were longer with the latter group: a mean of 1243 days, compared to a mean of 137 days for the former. At last follow-up, like our study, similar outcomes were reported both among esotropes and exotropes, whether the patients were resected or plicated. The preoperative deviation in Chaudhuri and Demer's study was of lesser amount as compared to our study; therefore, the amount of muscle plicated, resected, and recessed was also of lesser amount in their study as compared to ours. Compared to Chaudhuri and Demer's retrospective comparison with historical controls, our study involved a prospective, double-masked, randomized design with allocation concealment. Admittedly, our patients are fewer: 40 overall as compared to 53 of Chaudhuri and Demer's, although the number undergoing plications is better matched: 18 in ours compared to 22 in theirs. Our cases were on average younger: 18.5 (4.1) years as compared to 38 years in Chaudhuri and Demer's study. Unlike us, they did not evaluate postoperative inflammation or appearance. Interestingly, Chaudhuri and Demer included reoperations in their study, whereas we excluded such patients. Chaudhuri and Demer go on to predict the quantum of deviation corrected for each millimeter resected or plicated, using linear regression; however, this was not the purpose of our study. We too have undertaken a comparison of this outcome and found no significant differences between the two techniques.</p><p>Mojon in his series of articles demonstrating the MISS approach has used plication for the tightening of rectus muscles.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] A cursory assessment of just five of these studies involves a total number of 250 patients, and considering that all have undergone plication as the surgery of choice for tightening an EOM, it seems that plications do have successful outcomes.</p><p>In a small retrospective case series involving five patients, Velez <italic>et al</italic>. describe plication using adjustable sutures.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Their steps for plication were similar to our study. The mean age of patients was 49 years. Of the five patients, three underwent lateral rectus plication and two underwent superior rectus plication. The amount of plication ranged from 5.5 mm to 7 mm for lateral rectus and 3 mm to 4 mm for superior rectus. All patients had satisfactory alignment within six PD for horizontal deviation and two PD for vertical deviation.</p><p>An interesting technique of mini-plication for rectus muscles in small-angle strabismus is described by Wright.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] This involved using 6-0 polyglactin 910 suture applied to the central 3&#x02013;4 mm of the muscle belly 5 mm posterior to the insertion, which was then passed through the sclera just anterior to the muscle insertion, to plicate the central portion of the muscle. Thus, compared to the standard procedure, this did not involve plicating the entire width of the muscle tendon. Mini-plication reduced vertical and horizontal deviations, an average (&#x000b1;SD) of 6.7 PD &#x000b1; 3.5 PD. Diplopia which was noted in 50% of the adults preoperatively was not reported postoperatively. All patients experienced a decrease in strabismus, with an average of &#x0003c;5 PD of postoperative deviation.</p><p>Our study did not include assessment of the change in anterior segment circulation and the time taken for both the procedures although other studies report plication as being quicker and better in preserving the vascularity of anterior segment.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>Plication also has certain benefits over resection: it is far less bloody, with diminished chance of anterior segment ischemia, allows an adjustable option, is doable through a minimally invasive approach and under topical anesthesia, and is eminently reversible. Moreover, since muscle plication does not require any disinsertion of the EOM from the globe, it has no risk of &#x0201c;slipped&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;lost&#x0201d; muscles in the postoperative period. Moreover, since it is less &#x0201c;invasive,&#x0201d; it does appear technically easier than a resection.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Results from our study suggest that when combined with recessions, plication is a worthwhile alternative to resections, to achieve successful alignment in horizontal strabismus. The postoperative course and cosmesis are comparable to R&#x00026;R as are evident with similar postoperative inflammatory scores, SV, and success rates. Considering that it has the advantages of lesser trauma, better preservation of anterior segment circulation, and the possibility of remedial correction in the immediate postoperative situation, we feel that plications should be more commonly performed instead of resection.</p><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>von Noorden</surname><given-names>GK</given-names></name></person-group><person-group person-group-type="editor"><name><surname>Lampert</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Principles of surgical treatment</article-title><source>Binocular Vision and Ocular Motility: Theory and Management of Strabismus</source><year>2002</year><edition>6th ed</edition><publisher-loc>St Louis</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Mosby</publisher-name><fpage>566</fpage><lpage>624</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Nihalani</surname><given-names>BR</given-names></name><name><surname>Hunter</surname><given-names>DG</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Adjustable suture strabismus surgery</article-title><source>Eye (Lond)</source><year>2011</year><volume>25</volume><fpage>1262</fpage><lpage>76</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">21760626</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Nelson</surname><given-names>BA</given-names></name><name><surname>Gunton</surname><given-names>KB</given-names></name><name><surname>Lasker</surname><given-names>JN</given-names></name><name><surname>Nelson</surname><given-names>LB</given-names></name><name><surname>Drohan</surname><given-names>LA</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The psychosocial aspects of strabismus in teenagers and adults and the impact of surgical correction</article-title><source>J AAPOS</source><year>2008</year><volume>12</volume><fpage>72</fpage><lpage>6.e1</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">18314071</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kothari</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Balankhe</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Gawade</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Toshnival</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Comparison of psychosocial and emotional consequences of childhood strabismus on the families from rural and urban India</article-title><source>Indian J Ophthalmol</source><year>2009</year><volume>57</volume><fpage>285</fpage><lpage>8</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">19574696</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Archer</surname><given-names>SM</given-names></name><name><surname>Musch</surname><given-names>DC</given-names></name><name><surname>Wren</surname><given-names>PA</given-names></name><name><surname>Guire</surname><given-names>KE</given-names></name><name><surname>Del Monte</surname><given-names>MA</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Social and emotional impact of strabismus surgery on quality of life in children</article-title><source>J AAPOS</source><year>2005</year><volume>9</volume><fpage>148</fpage><lpage>51</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15838442</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref6"><label>6</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Wright</surname><given-names>KW</given-names></name></person-group><person-group person-group-type="editor"><name><surname>Farzavandi</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Principles of strabismus surgery</article-title><source>Color Atlas of Strabismus Surgery: Strategies and Techniques</source><year>2007</year><edition>3rd ed</edition><publisher-loc>New York</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Springer</publisher-name><fpage>8</fpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref7"><label>7</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Helveston</surname><given-names>EM</given-names></name></person-group><source>Resection of a rectus muscle.
