Introduction</title><p>
<italic>Mycobacterium avium</italic> subspecies <italic>paratuberculosis</italic> (MAP) is the cause of chronic incurable infection of animals called Johne's disease (JD) and is also associated with Crohn's disease (CD) in human beings [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. MAP has wide host range and interspecies transmission has been reported frequently [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. JD causes huge economic losses by way of reduced productivity in domestic ruminants, all over the world. It is estimated that 68.0% of US dairy herds are infected with JD, costing $200 million to $1.5 billion per year to dairy industry [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. These losses have been neither estimated nor realized in most of the developing and poor countries. In animals vaccination is the only cost effective method for controlling JD. After the first description of a live attenuated vaccine in France [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], many of the developed countries resorted to vaccination and have effectively decreased JD prevalence in their herds and flocks [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Both killed and live attenuated vaccines have the same efficiency in small ruminants [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]; however, killed vaccine has many advantages in terms of safety, marketing, and storage [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Vaccine prepared from field isolate worked better than &#x0201c;commercial vaccine&#x0201d; in calves [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Goatherds maintained at Central Institute for Research on Goats (CIRG), Makhdoom were endemic for JD [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Using &#x0201c;test-and-cull&#x0201d; policy for past 25 years, prevalence of JD could not be reduced. Contrarily the incidence and pathogenicity of MAP increased over the years [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Native &#x0201c;S 5&#x0201d; strain of MAP [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] recovered from a terminally sick goat has been characterized as &#x0201c;Indian Bison type&#x0201d; [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and is most prevalent genotype in India [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. This native &#x0201c;S 5&#x0201d; strain is highly pathogenic and is a newly evolved genotype as compared to MAP K10 strain [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], therefore, used for the development of ELISA kit [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and &#x0201c;Indigenous vaccine&#x0201d; for JD [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. This pilot study was the first randomized trial to know the efficacy of &#x0201c;Indigenous vaccine&#x0201d; in comparison to a &#x0201c;commercial vaccine&#x0201d; for the control of Johne's disease in clinically infected farm goatherds.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2. Materials and Methods</title><sec sec-type="subsection" id="sec2.1"><title>2.1. Animal Ethics</title><p>Institute (CIRG) is registered with Committee for the Purpose of Control and Supervision of Experimentation on Animals (CPCSEA), Government of India, and use of JD-infected goats was approved by the Institute Ethics Committee.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subsection" id="sec2.2"><title>2.2. Animals and Management Conditions</title><p>Seventy-one discarded ready to cull (stunted/weak/diarrheic) and naturally infected goats with clinical JD (positive in culture and ELISA) from the farm herds of CIRG were randomly divided into 3 groups: &#x0201c;Bison&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;Gudair&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Sham immunized&#x0201d;, consisting of 29, 24, and 18 goats, respectively. This pilot trial to study the efficacy of &#x0201c;Indigenous vaccine&#x0201d; was truly random, with respect to age, sex, and breed, stage of disease, and body weights of goats. In each group, age of goats varied from 1 to 8.2 years (85.0% were between 2&#x02013;4 years). Goats in 3 groups were maintained together under semiintensive system of management with 150 gr of concentrate per goat, irrespective of sex, age, body weight, and physiological status. Physically goats were weak and emaciated when transferred from different goats units at CIRG, and JD, being endemic in goats, was primarily responsible for poor health condition of goats [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Skin was rough, hard, and dry, eyes were dull and depressed, body weights were below normal, and JD was major cause of morbidity, mortality, and culling of goats.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subsection" id="sec2.3"><title>2.3.

Similarly &#x0201c;Gudair&#x0201d; group was vaccinated with 1&#x02009;mL of &#x0201c;Commercial vaccine&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Sham-immunized&#x0201d; group was given 1&#x02009;mL of sterilized PBS.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subsection" id="sec2.5"><title>2.5. Data Recordings and Collection of Samples</title><p>Body weights of the goats were recorded, zero day post vaccination (DPV) and at 30&#x02009;DPV intervals up to 210 days. Average gain in body weights by goats of three groups was analyzed using ANOVA. Serum samples of all the goats and blood samples of 9 goats <bold>(</bold>3 from each group) were screened by ELISA and Lymphocyte Transformation Test (LTT), respectively. Nitric oxide (NO) estimation was performed on serum samples of all the goats at 30-day interval. Improvements in body condition, mortality, and morbidity were recorded. Goats that died during the trial period were subjected to detailed necropsy and lesions were recorded. Goats falling sick were treated symptomatically.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subsection" id="sec2.6"><title>2.6.

Briefly, PBMCs isolated from goats of each group were stimulated in triplicate with mitogen Con A (Sigma) and sonicated protoplasmic antigen of MAP &#x0201c;Indian Bison Type&#x0201d; each at 20&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/mL concentration, and a set of PBMCs of the same goat was kept as unstimulated control. PBMCs were cultured in 96-well tissue culture plates at 37&#x000b0;C at 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 120 hours (5 days). At the end of 120 hours MTT assay was performed and 25&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>l of MTT [3-(4, 5- dimethyl trizol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide] dye (5&#x02009;mg/mL) was added to each well of the tissue culture plate.

After incubation 150&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>l of DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide) was added to each well and incubated overnight at 37&#x000b0;C and absorbance was read at 570&#x02009;nm. Proliferation of lymphocytes was indicated by optical density value of the well with test samples and that of the unpulsed wells. For analysis of data, a signal-to-noise ratio, that is, Stimulative Index (SI) was calculated for individual goats using the following formula: <italic>Average OD at 570&#x02009;nm in stimulated wells/Average OD at 570&#x02009;nm in nonstimulated control wells</italic>.

Similar results were reported by Crowther et al. [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] in sheep in Cyprus by vaccinating all stocks with live attenuated vaccine. Similarly in Norway, after several years of unsuccessful efforts to eradicate JD in goats (isolation and slaughter), vaccination program with &#x0201c;live attenuated vaccine&#x0201d; for kids was started in 1967 and the infection of MAP was reduced from 53% to 1% [<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In 1964, Great Britain introduced a scheme for the voluntary vaccination of the stock on infected farms and freedom from clinical disease was achieved after an average of 4 years [<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In 1983, a control program based on killed vaccine was initiated in The Netherlands and this strategy has been successful in reducing clinical JD and was less expensive than subsidized cull and slaughter program [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Results of the present study also indicated that vaccination could be practiced in any stage of disease (sub-clinical, clinical, and advance clinical), in any age group (kids above 3 months old to adults) and in any physiological stage (dry, lactating, or pregnant). Initial priming of the goats with MAP infection at the start of trial could have elicited higher immune response against vaccine (second inoculation of the antigen). JD was endemic in CIRG herds; therefore, continuous and slow reinfection of vaccinated animals from environment might have booster effect, thereby complete turnaround in the condition of ready to cull goats when trial was started. Incomplete degree of the response in 15-day-old kids as observed by Corpa et al. [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] might be due to immature immune system at that age. JD vaccination has been practiced during first weeks of life on the basis that the protection would be conferred for the first contact with mycobacteria [<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. However, other studies on vaccination of adult animals also showed very good results in controlling JD [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Corpa et al. [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] also showed that immune response was higher in adult animals as compared to few weeks old animals.</p><p>Lymphoproliferative response to antigen stimulation has been widely used as in vitro correlates of cell-mediated immunity [<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. PBMCs from vaccinated and &#x0201c;sham-immunized&#x0201d; goats were used to assess the response to protoplasmic antigen of MAP. Proliferative response was higher in PBMCs from vaccinated groups on stimulation with MAP antigen than in PBMCs from &#x0201c;sham-immunized&#x0201d; group. However, stimulative index was higher in PBMCs from &#x0201c;Bison&#x0201d; than in &#x0201c;Gudair&#x0201d; group. Low responsiveness may be attributed to the suppressive factors secreted by monocytes and lymphocytes [<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Another possibility may be a shift from Th l to Th 2 type of cytokine response [<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Further preferential sequestration of antigen-specific T cells into the infected areas leads to their absence in peripheral blood [<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p><p>It is generally believed that reactive nitrogens, such as NO, are most effective in direct killing of mycobacteria [<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Significantly higher NO concentration was seen in vaccinated groups (maximum in &#x0201c;Bison&#x0201d; group and least for &#x0201c;sham-immunized&#x0201d; group). Increased production of NO induced by antigen may cause effective immune response towards MAP and may lead to inhibition of MAP in macrophages. </p><p>Significant rise in the peripheral blood antibodies was seen in vaccinated groups after vaccination and &#x0201c;peak titers&#x0201d; were attained at 60&#x02009;DPV that gradually declined, such pattern was absent in &#x0201c;sham-immunized&#x0201d; group. Comparative antibody titers, in the vaccinated groups, were higher in &#x0201c;Bison&#x0201d; group. In vaccination of sheep by a killed vaccine maximum ELISA reactors were observed around 30&#x02009;DPV [<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In a study, 13 of the 15 vaccinated calves also became ELISA positive within 60 to 360&#x02009;DPV [<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In some goats of vaccinated group there was again rise in the antibody titer at 180&#x02009;DPV. But this rise in the antibody titer was less than the primary maxima observed at 60&#x02009;DPV. Although antibody response may not have the protective effect, it would be an indicator of the degree of the activation of immune system against mycobacteria [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Th1 and Th2 responses are not antagonist and IFN<italic>&#x003b3;</italic> can play stimulatory effect on B-lymphocytes and antibody production [<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Antibody titers were higher in few goats of &#x0201c;sham-immunized&#x0201d; group but titers were low as compared to vaccinated groups.</p><p>There was decreasing trend of NO concentration in &#x0201c;sham-immunized&#x0201d; goats. Probably protective Th1 response decreased due to decrease in the concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IFN<italic>&#x003b3;</italic>, IL-12, IL-2, TNF<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>, etc.). Though NO concentration also showed decreasing trend in vaccinated goats, they still maintained significantly higher concentration of NO as compared to &#x0201c;sham-immunized&#x0201d; goats. These results were further supported by antibody results, in &#x0201c;sham-immunized&#x0201d; goats, where titers increased slightly towards the end of the experiment. As &#x0201c;&#x02018;sham-immunized&#x0201d; goats approached terminal stage of JD, inhibitory Th2 responses might be increased with suppressed activity of antiinflammatory cytokines to limit the host tissue damage.</p><p>Necropsy of goats from &#x0201c;sham-immunized&#x0201d; group exhibited marked gross lesions of JD. Lymph nodes were highly enlarged and swollen, intestinal mucosa was thickened with prominent ridges (corrugation), and degeneration of visceral fat was marked in these goats. Goats from vaccinated groups did not show severe lesion of JD grossly due to remission of lesions after vaccination. In a study of vaccination in infected animals, Corpa et al. [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] also reported reduction in progression of granulomatous lesions and in bacterial shedding. Similarly, Juste et al. [<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] also noticed regressive type granulomas (tuberculoid forms of lesions) located exclusively in the intestinal organized lymphoid tissues in vaccinated animals, whereas in nonvaccinated animals lesions spread to other areas of intestine causing severe enteritis. Therefore, vaccination may have potential to direct the inflammatory cascade into a beneficial mode.</p><p>Vaccination reduced fecal shedding in significant number of vaccinated goats. Initially, 16 (88.8%) goats were positive in &#x0201c;sham-immunized&#x0201d; group, but at 210&#x02009;DPV all the goats were positive in fecal culture. At zero and 210&#x02009;DPV, the number of goats excreting MAP decreased from 23 (79.3%) and 19 (79.1%) to 5 (17.2%) and 7 (29.1%) in &#x0201c;Bison&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Gudair&#x0201d; groups, respectively. Number of goats negative for MAP infection were more in &#x0201c;Bison&#x0201d; group. Colony-forming units (cfu) counts also decreased in vaccinated goats as compared to 0 DPV. However, in &#x0201c;sham-immunized&#x0201d; group, cfu increased in 55.0% of goats.</p><p>Vaccination of lambs against ovine JD reduced deaths up to 90% and also reduced amount of bacilli passed in feces by up to 90% [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Rapid decrease in new clinical cases was achieved following immunization of infected adult sheep flocks having severe clinical disease [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Similar results have been reported by Uzonna et al. [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], where vaccine prepared from field isolate reduced the number of fecal shedders more than that of commercial vaccine.</p><p>Present trial indicated that &#x0201c;Indigenous vaccine&#x0201d; used in this study exhibited &#x0201c;Therapeutic effect&#x0201d; by reversing the clinical signs. There was reduction in shedding of number of MAP bacilli per goat, number of goats with clinical, JD and number of goats positive bacteriologically (fecal shedders), and complete turnaround was visible in the physical condition of the vaccinated goats as compared to &#x0201c;sham immunized&#x0201d;. Internally the lesions of JD reduced and there was regeneration of visceral fat layer and fat layer around all the visceral organs. Goat became alert active, and udders were filled with milk despite continuous suckling by kids. &#x0201c;Indigenous vaccine&#x0201d; using aluminum hydrooxide gel as adjuvant was superior to &#x0201c;Gudair&#x0201d; using mineral oil, in controlling JD in the naturally infected goats. However, these minor differences in vaccine-induced immune response may have resulted due to use of two different adjuvants, differences in the genetic makeup of individual animals and level of MAP infection.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>Single dose of &#x0201c;Indigenous vaccine&#x0201d; developed from highly pathogenic locally isolated &#x0201c;Indian Bison Type&#x0201d; genotype of MAP significantly reduced morbidity and mortality, reversed clinical signs as well as reduced shedding of MAP, and there was marked improvement in physical and internal body condition (Therapeutic effect). Therefore, &#x0201c;Indigenous vaccine&#x0201d; worked as &#x0201c;Therapeutic Vaccine&#x0201d; in goats suffering from clinical to advance clinical symptoms of JD.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>Authors are thankful to Director, CIRG, for extending necessary facilities for the work and DSIR, New Delhi for providing financial assistance.</p></ack><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>MAP:</term><def><p>
