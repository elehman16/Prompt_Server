Various pharmacological agents in added to local anesthetics (LA) modify their original effects in terms of block characteristics and quality of analgesia.

Despite detailed characterization of opioid receptor systems at the cellular and even molecular level,[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] the mechanisms of LA-opioid interaction are still largely unknown.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>The combination of opioids with LA agents administered subarachnoidally in lower section cesarean section for block characteristics and intra- and post-operative analgesia seems promising. Although they have been used since decades, the issues regarding the proper opioid choice and dosage are still lacking. To the best of our knowledge, there is a paucity of studies comparing these opioids in a single study setting.</p><p>The present work studied the comparative evaluation of adding fentanyl and morphine to bupivacaine with the conventional dose of bupivacaine in patients undergoing lower segment cesarean section under spinal anesthesia along with neonatal outcome to confirm the best combination.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>After approval of the Hospital Ethics Committee and written informed consent, 60 American Society of Anesthesiologists I and II parturients, undergoing elective cesarean section, were included in our study. Females with multiple pregnancies, pregnancy-induced hypertension, placenta previa, morbid obesity, fetal distress, and any contraindication to spinal analgesia were excluded from the study. The parturients were allocated randomly to three groups of 20 each using sealed envelopes. Group I was designated to be the control group. The spinal agents to be used were as follows;</p><p>Group I: Spinal analgesia with bupivacaine 12.5 mg</p><p>Group II: Spinal analgesia with bupivacaine 12.5 mg + morphine 0.2 mg</p><p>Group III: Spinal analgesia with bupivacaine 12.5 mg + fentanyl 25 &#x000b5;g.</p><p>Preservative-free physiological saline 0.9% was added to all the solutions to achieve a total volume of 4 ml. All the subjects were advised tablet ranitidine 150 mg and tablet metoclopramide 5 mg a night before as well as 2 h before surgery. In the operating room, intravenous (IV) access was established with 18-gauge cannula and baseline vital signs, for example, pulse rate and noninvasive blood pressure (NIBP) were recorded. The parturients were then preloaded with 500 ml of Ringer's lactated solution. With the parturients in sitting position, spinal analgesia was administered at L3-4 space, using 25-gauge Quincke-Babcock spinal needle by anesthetist blind to the type of drug being used. On completion of the spinal injection, the parturients were placed supine on the table and a wedge was put under right hip to provide 15&#x000b0; lateral tilt. NIBP was monitored every 5 min until the end of surgery. The onset of sensory block was assessed by the loss of pinprick. Dermatomal level was assessed every 2 min until stabilized and time to reach maximum block height was noted. Furthermore, time of regression to T10 dermatome and time when patient demanded first rescue analgesia was noted.</p><p>Motor block was assessed by modified Bromage scale as follows: I - free movement of legs and feet; II - just able to flex knees with free movement of feet; III - unable to flex knees but with free movement of feet; and IV - unable to move legs and feet. Onset of motor block was assessed by time to reach Bromage II. Time to achieve complete motor block and its regression to Bromage I were noted. In the event of patient experiencing discomfort during surgery, a bolus of injection fentanyl 2 &#x000b5;g/kg IV was given as a rescue analgesic. If fall in NIBP was &#x0003e;30% of the base line, injection ephedrine was administered in repeated boluses. Injection Oxytocin 10 units in an infusion was administered after delivery of the baby.</p><p>The patients were also assessed for postoperative pain, nausea, vomiting, and shivering. A pediatrician assessed the neonatal Apgar score at 1, 5, and 10 min after delivery. Assessment of block characteristics and duration of analgesia were the primary outcome, and the intraoperative side effects and neonatal Apgar score were secondary outcome measures.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>With &#x003b1; value determined at 0.05 and power of study at 80%, this study required 50 patients.

Our study demonstrated that spinal anesthesia for cesarean section with bupivacaine &#x02013; fentanyl combination has the fastest onset of sensory block, but the onset of motor block is delayed as compared with bupivacaine-morphine. Doses of fentanyl 20&#x02013;30 &#x003bc;g[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and morphine 0.2 mg[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] have been used intrathecally in studies and have shown prolongation of analgesic effect of hyperbaric bupivacaine in a dose-dependent manner. Hence, a dose of 25 &#x003bc;g fentanyl versus 0.2 mg morphine was compared with heavy bupivacaine.</p><p>Although the onset of block with fentanyl was faster than morphine. The duration of analgesia was significantly prolonged in bupivacaine-morphine group as compared to other groups. Recent evidence suggests that bupivacaine also potentiates the binding of morphine to spinal opioid receptors, especially the highly dense k receptors, as the result of an associated conformational change in opioid receptors.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] It is possible that this conformational change may be responsible for prolonging the inhibitory effect of opioids in the spinal cord.</p><p>Our results differ from Palmer <italic>et al</italic>. and by Milner <italic>et al</italic>. who concluded that although a dose of 0.1 mg intrathecal morphine provides optimal analgesia for postcesarean section parturients. However, in their none of their patients was completely pain-free and all patients requested additional IV analgesia.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] In our study, we used 0.2 mg intrathecal morphine, just double the dose used in the above studies which could be the reason for prolonged analgesia.</p><p>In another study, Siti and Choy[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] compared the quality of postoperative analgesia between intrathecal fentanyl 25 mcg and intrathecal morphine 0.1 mg in patients undergoing cesarean section. They found that postoperative analgesia of intrathecal fentanyl was inferior to that of intrathecal morphine similar to our observation.</p><p>The side effect profile of this study revealed nausea and vomiting more in patients of control than study groups. Many studies on the use of intrathecal fentanyl have demonstrated decreased incidence of intraoperative nausea and vomiting. We found reduction in the incidence of nausea, vomiting, and shivering by the addition of fentanyl to bupivacaine, which is in accordance with the findings of Rudra <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>Pregnant women seem to be more susceptible to pruritus after neuraxial opioid administration than other populations, with incidence of 60&#x02013;100%.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] This increased incidence may be due to an interaction of estrogen with opioid receptors,[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] but it was more pronounced in the fentanyl group. The results published by other authors are comparable pruritus has previously been reported as the most common adverse effect of intrathecal fentanyl. The incidence of pruritus with the administration of opioid into the subarachnoid space was reported to be 62% for morphine, 67% for fentanyl, and 80% for sufentanil.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] In this study, the incidence of pruritus was 30% and 10% for Group III and Group II, respectively, and although the incidence was about thrice that of intrathecal fentanyl, the occurrences appeared as mild to the face and upper chest regions. However, most cases were tolerably mild and no patient required therapeutic intervention to alleviate the symptoms.</p><p>Respiratory depression caused by morphine is more prolonged and may occur much later up to 12 h. These are generally due to an effect of stimulation at the &#x000b5; receptor.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] The true incidence of respiratory depression is unknown; two large studies quote the incidence in obstetric population between 0.003% and 0.01%.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] In our study, no evident respiratory depression, either immediate or delayed, was observed postoperatively, as preventive measures, all patients received oxygen via a facial mask and SpO<sub>2</sub> was continuously monitored for at least 24 h. Although respiratory rate and monitoring oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry can detect respiratory depression, arterial blood gas analysis would have given better and accurate idea of it, which was not done in our case. Another reason could be the small sample size of the study to confirm this complication.</p><p>About 30% of the patients become drowsy but arousable with the intrathecal fentanyl as compared to those without fentanyl addition. However, there is report where fentanyl addition does not cause any change in the sedation.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>On the basis of our results, 0.2 mg morphine intrathecally provided excellent postoperative pain relief without any intolerable side effects in patients undergoing cesarean section. In addition, the overall patient satisfaction was significantly greater in the morphine group. In the existing literature, there are very few reports showing possible effects of low doses of opioids on the neonate outcome in terms of Apgar scores, and successful breast-feeding initiation within 24 h after birth, which was statistically comparable in all the groups demonstrating that both opioids seem safe for newborns.</p><p>The limitations of this study were that we did not consider relative density of an LA in relation to that of cerebrospinal fluid, which is one of the most important physical properties that affect the level of analgesia obtained after subarachnoid administration of the drug.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Secondarily, umbilical pH and blood gas status could not be done for evaluation of fetal outcome.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The study has established that LA can be safely administered with addition of both lipophilic or lipophobic opioids avoiding hemodynamic fluctuation and providing a stable peri- and post-operative period in the obstetric patients. In addition, the duration of sensory analgesia is significantly prolonged with addition of morphine ensuring neonatal well-beings.</p><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Choi</surname><given-names>DH</given-names></name><name><surname>Ahn</surname><given-names>HJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>MH</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Bupivacaine-sparing effect of fentanyl in spinal anesthesia for cesarean delivery</article-title><source>Reg Anesth Pain Med</source><year>2000</year><volume>25</volume><fpage>240</fpage><lpage>5</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">10834777</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Subedi</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Tripathi</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Bhattarai</surname><given-names>BK</given-names></name><name><surname>Gupta</surname><given-names>PK</given-names></name><name><surname>Pokharel</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Regmi</surname><given-names>MC</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The effect of height and weight adjusted dose of intrathecal hyperbaric bupivacaine for elective caesarean section</article-title><source>JNMA J Nepal Med Assoc</source><year>2011</year><volume>51</volume><fpage>1</fpage><lpage>6</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">22335087</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Hunt</surname><given-names>CO</given-names></name><name><surname>Naulty</surname><given-names>JS</given-names></name><name><surname>Bader</surname><given-names>AM</given-names></name><name><surname>Hauch</surname><given-names>MA</given-names></name><name><surname>Vartikar</surname><given-names>JV</given-names></name><name><surname>Datta</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Perioperative analgesia with subarachnoid fentanyl-bupivacaine for cesarean delivery</article-title><source>Anesthesiology</source><year>1989</year><volume>71</volume><fpage>535</fpage><lpage>40</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">2679237</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Reuben</surname><given-names>SS</given-names></name><name><surname>Dunn</surname><given-names>SM</given-names></name><name><surname>Duprat</surname><given-names>KM</given-names></name><name><surname>O&#x02019;Sullivan</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>An intrathecal fentanyl dose-response study in lower extremity revascularization procedures</article-title><source>Anesthesiology</source><year>1994</year><volume>81</volume><fpage>1371</fpage><lpage>5</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">7992905</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Reisine</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Review: Neurotransmitter receptors V.
