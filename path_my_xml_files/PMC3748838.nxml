A further exclusion criterion will be complications during the tooth extraction or wound healing, such as fracture of the alveolar bone, the root, or an infection during wound healing. In this case not the patient, but the extraction region will be excluded from the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Study interventions</title><p>The study intervention will be: the initiation of the orthodontic tooth movement in a time interval 2 to 4 weeks after tooth extraction (group A) <italic>versus</italic> tooth movement initiated in a time interval &#x0003e;12 weeks after extraction (group B).

If a gingival invagination is present its entire depth will be examined using a periodontal probe (Periodontmeter from Williams 17; Hu-Fridey, Rotterdam, The Netherlands). The measurement will be taken parallel to the occlusal plane in vestibular and oral orientation and in vertical direction at a 90&#x000b0; angle to the occlusal plane. Maximum values from all three angles will be noted in a three-figure code, for example, probes of 3&#x000a0;mm in a vestibular orientation, 2&#x000a0;mm vertical, and 4&#x000a0;mm oral result in the code: 3-2-4. Complete penetration in oro-/vestibular orientation will be identified with an x and only the vertical penetration will be noted (for example, &#x000d7;4).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Blinding</title><p>To ensure quality and neutrality of the obtained data a blinded rater will perform the documentation at the time points &#x02018;Initiation of the space closure&#x02019; and &#x02018;End of the study&#x02019;.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical methods</title><p>Primary aim of the study is the estimation of the frequency of gingival invaginations under both therapies. In group A the initiation of the orthodontic tooth movement will be performed in a time interval 2 to 4 weeks after tooth extraction <italic>versus</italic> tooth movement initiated in a time interval &#x0003e;12 weeks after extraction (group B). At the endpoints &#x02018;space closure&#x02019; or &#x02018;10 months +/- 14 days after initiation of the space closure&#x02019;, the frequencies of gingival invaginations will be given together with 95% confidence limits. Also the odds ratio for the occurrence of gingival invaginations in both study arms will be calculated together with a 95% confidence interval. Finally, a two-sided Fisher&#x02019;s exact test will be performed to descriptively compare the rates between treatment arms.</p><p>For the secondary aim, the difference in the dimensions of the gingival invaginations according to LC<sup>2</sup>, the median, minimum and maximum values as well as quartiles will be given. For the comparison of the values a two-sided Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test will be performed. Also the odds ratio in both study arms will be calculated together with a 95% confidence interval. In the case of an absence of a gingival invagination LC<sup>2</sup> will be set to zero.</p><p>If some patients do not achieve the primary endpoint &#x02018;fulfilled space closure&#x02019; and finish the study within the alternative endpoint &#x02018;10 months +/- 14 days after initiation of space closure&#x02019; we would excluded these patients for later statistical analysis because they could possibly represent confounders.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study is a preliminary study targeting on the effect of a timely coordinated space closure after tooth extraction on the development of gingival invaginations. Other factors like extraction technique, treatment mechanics for space closure or patient-related features could also have an impact on their development. As there is no prospective data up to now, this study can only have preliminary character and therefore it is focused on only one potential risk factor. Having this data, it will be possible to plan future RCTs with adequate sample size, focusing on new risk factors identified in this study.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial status</title><p>Patient recruitment since 10.12.2012</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>Ref.
