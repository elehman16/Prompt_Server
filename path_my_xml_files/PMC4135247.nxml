The four-week clinical-trial (randomized, open-label, prospective, controlled) was followed by a one week wash-out period. Healthy Chinese college students (over 20 years of age with a body mass index of 18.5-23.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) volunteered for this study. Forty-three students were randomly classified into two groups, <italic>Kimchi</italic> (n = 21, supplemented with 100 g of <italic>Kimchi</italic> per day) or non-<italic>Kimchi</italic> (n = 22, supplemented with 100 g of radish per day, control) groups. During the four-week intervention period, students were asked to maintain their usual diet and activity, and instructed not to take any medications, functional food products, or dietary supplements. Anthropometrics, nutritional intake, and blood immune parameters (lymphocyte subsets, cytokines, and immunoglobulins) were measured before and after the four weeks of intervention. Thirty-nine students (19 in the <italic>Kimchi</italic> group, 20 in the non-<italic>Kimchi</italic> group) finished the study. After the intervention, no significant changes were observed in lymphocyte subsets (T-cell, B-cell, NK cell), pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-&#x003b1;), anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4 and IL-10), and immunoglobulins (Ig A, G, and M) between groups in either the <italic>Kimchi</italic> or non-<italic>Kimchi</italic>. These results suggest that the short-term consumption of <italic>Kimchi</italic> has no immunomodulatory effects in healthy Chinese college students.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Immunomodulation</kwd><kwd>Fermentation</kwd><kwd><italic>Kimchi</italic></kwd><kwd>Randomized Controlled Trial</kwd><kwd>Chinese</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source country="KR">The World Institute of <italic>Kimchi</italic>, An Annex of Korea Food Research Institute, Republic of Korea</funding-source><award-id>KE1201-3</award-id></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Kimchi</italic>, a traditional fermented vegetable, is an indispensable component of every meal in Korea [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. There are about 187 kinds of <italic>Kimchi</italic> according to the ingredients and processing methods [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. <italic>Kimchi</italic> is prepared by various ingredients, such as Chinese cabbage, garlic, onion, and red pepper in the presence of salt [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. <italic>Kimchi</italic> is currently recognized worldwide as a nutritious and healthy food. Nutritionally, <italic>Kimchi</italic> is a low-calorie food (18 kcal/100 g) and an important source of vitamins, minerals, and fiber [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. It is also a good source of phytochemicals (e.g., &#x003b2;-sitosterol, glucosinolates, isothiocyanate, indoles, allyl compounds) and probiotic strains (e.g., <italic>Lactobacillus plantarum</italic>, <italic>Lactobacillus brevis</italic>, <italic>Leuconostoc mesenteroides</italic>) [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In regard to these nutrition properties, many functional properties of <italic>Kimchi</italic> have been reported including anti-oxidative activity [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], anti-mutagenic and anti-tumor activities [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], anti-atherogenic activity [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], and weight-controlling activity [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Immune system is very complex and a delicate network associated with the balance between health and disease. Any biologically active substances or food, which can enhance, suppress or modulate the immune system, is called an immunomodulator. Typical examples such as vitamins (A, C, E, B6), minerals (Zn, Fe, Se), probiotics and other foods (tomato, garlic, mushroom, soybean etc.) were explored [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p><italic>Kimchi</italic> has been reported to have potential effects on the immune system [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Previous studies also reported that <italic>Kimchi</italic> has beneficial effects on stimulating the growth of spleen cells, bone marrow cells, thymus cells, and B cell proliferation in the spleen lymphocytes of rats [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Also, it is often believed that taking <italic>Kimch</italic> strengthen the immunity, and has been reported to decrease the risk of acquiring avian influenza (AI), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and flu.</p><p>To our knowledge, no published study has examined the effect of <italic>Kimchi</italic> consumption on the blood immune parameters in a clinical trial setting. Thus the present study was designed to determine assessed immunomodulatory properties of <italic>Kimchi</italic> consumption in the Chinese healthy college student.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>This four-week clinical trial (randomized, open-labeled, prospective, and controlled) was carried out with healthy college students. The study was approved through the Institutional Review Board (IRB, KMC IRB1211-04) of Kyung Hee University Medical Center (Seoul, Korea).</p></sec><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>Recruitment was performed from July 2012 to September 2012, and the study was completed in November 2012. Forty-three healthy normal weight (BMI 18.5-23.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) Chinese college students over 20 years-old were enrolled in the study. Subjects suffering from any kind of disease/disorder, have a history of medication in the past few months were excluded. Subjects possessing any underlying conditions which might affect immunity and smokers were also excluded. All subjects were assessed for eligibility and provided written informed consent for participation in the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Randomization and intervention</title><p>Subjects were randomly assigned, using a computer-generated randomization sequence, into two groups, a <italic>Kimchi</italic> (n = 21, 100 g/day) or a non-<italic>Kimchi</italic> (n = 22, control) group. All eligible subjects were instructed to discontinue <italic>Kimchi</italic> and dishes made with <italic>Kimchi</italic> (e.g., <italic>Kimchi jjigae</italic>, <italic>Kimchi guk</italic>, <italic>Kimchi bokkeumbap</italic>, <italic>Kimchi bosaam</italic>) during one week of washout period.</p><p>At the beginning of the study, subjects underwent anthropometric and dietary assessment. A 24-hour dietary record (using food models) by a registered dietitian was used to examine nutrient intake. Nutrient intake was analyzed using the Computer Aided Nutritional Analysis version 4.0 (CAN-pro 4.0, The Korean Nutrition Society, Seoul, Korea). During the four-week intervention period, the <italic>Kimchi</italic>-group consumed 100 g of <italic>Kimchi</italic>/day and the non-<italic>Kimchi</italic> group consumed 100 g of radish/day.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>Kimchi</italic> preparation</title><p><italic>Kimchi</italic>, prepared with a standardized method by the Nonghyup <italic>Kimchi</italic> factory (Gyenggi, Korea) was provided every other day.

Lymphocyte subset profiles were analyzed by flow cytometry (Beckman Coulter, USA). The absolute number and percentage of helper T cells (CD4+) and suppressor T cells (CD8+) were automatically calculated. Also, total T cells (CD3+), B cells (CD19+), and natural killer (NK) cells (CD16/56) were quantified using monoclonal antibodies against T cells, B cells, and NK cells, respectively. Antibody-bound cells were counted through flow cytometry using FACS can (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ).</p><p>Serum total immunoglobulins (Ig A, G, and M) were measured using nephelometry by the Siemens Dimension Vista 500 automated analyzer according to the manufacturer's instructions (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics Inc., Newark, DE, USA). Pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-&#x003b1;) and anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4, IL-10) in serum were measured by the Luminex Multiplex Human High Sensitivity Cytokine Panel assay (Millipore, Billerica, USA). All assays were conducted according to the manufacturer's instructions.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis was performed using Statistical Package of Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20.0. The categorical variables of the two groups were compared with the Chi-square test, and the data presented as percentages or numbers.

Our findings indicated that there is no clear effect of <italic>Kimch</italic> intake on immune parameters, which is somewhat surprising. Because previous reports have suggested that various <italic>Kimchi</italic> ingredients (cabbage, garlic, onion, red pepper, and ginger) or probiotic strains improve immune markers both in vivo and in vitro studies, we hypothesized that fermented <italic>Kimchi</italic> exerts immunomodulatory effects.</p><p>Chinese cabbage, a main ingredient of <italic>Kimchi</italic>, is rich in minerals, vitamin C, dietary fibers, and especially phytochemicals [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Also, cabbage contains several organic sulfur compounds (OSCs), such as isothiocyanates and dithiolethiones. In a previous study [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], these OSCs were shown to exert diverse biological effects including the inhibition of tumor cell proliferation, antimicrobial effects, and free radical scavenging. Another ingredient, garlic, contains various sulfur-contained compounds; S-allyl-l-cysteine, S-allyl-l-cysteine sulfoxides and alliin [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. It suppress the production of inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-a, IL-1, IL-6, and interferon-&#x003b3; [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Red pepper contains high levels (25-80 mg%) of capsaicin. Capsaicin (8-methyl-N-vanillyl-6-nonenamide) is involved in physiological functions related to immune response [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>Probiotics are living micro-organisms that have a health benefit for their host. Orally ingested probiotic bacteria are able to modulate the immune system; however, differences exist in the immunomodulatory effects of different probiotic strains [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Especially, lactic acid bacteria (LAB) produced during the fermentation process from <italic>Kimchi</italic> : <italic>Leu. mesenteroides, Leu. citreum, Leu. gasicomitatum, Leu. kimchii, Leu. inhae, Weissella Koreensis, Weissella cibaria, Lac. plantarum, Lac. sakei, Lac. delbrueckii, Lac. buchneri, Lac. brevis, Lac. fermentum, Ped. acidilactici and Ped. Pentosaceus</italic> [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. According to the Lee et al. [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], suppressor T cells and NK cells are increased with <italic>L. casei and Bifidobacterium longumi</italic> treatment. However, in present study, T-helper cells and suppressor T cells were not affected by the consumption of <italic>Kimchi</italic>. T cells play central roles in the immune system, in which their major function assisting B cells in the production of antibodies. Serum Ig levels are routinely measured in clinical practice to examine immune balance. Typical ranges are suggested (Ig A; 1.4-0.4 mg/mL, Ig G; 8-16 mg/mL, and Ig M; 0.5-2.0 ng/mL). Low levels of Ig were observed in humoral immunodeficiency, while high levels of Ig were observed in chronic inflammatory diseases. Until now, many studies showed that <italic>Kimchi</italic> inhibited Ig E levels in the NC/nga mice atopic animal model [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Also, <italic>lactobacillus plantarum</italic> isolated from <italic>Kimchi</italic> increased the production of Ig A in normal or S180-bearing BALB/C tumor-induced mouse [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. On the other hand, 4 weeks of <italic>Kimchi</italic> supplementation does not changes of Ig A, G, M.</p><p>Cytokines, protein mediators produced by immune cells, are involved in immune regulation. The levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines are increased in chronic inflammatory diseases while the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines are decreased. Kim et al. [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] showed that the consumption of fermented <italic>Kimchi</italic> (300 g/day for 4 weeks) had no effects on the levels of TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-6 in overweight and obese patients (22 subjects, mean age of 38.6 &#x000b1; 8.5 years). In our study, the levels of TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-6 were significantly decreased in the <italic>Kimchi</italic> and non-<italic>Kimchi</italic> groups. It is unclear why the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the non-<italic>Kimchi</italic> group were decreased.</p><p>In previous of clinical trials, anti-obesity, anti-hypertension, anti-hypercholesterol effects of <italic>Kimchi</italic> have been investigated however, their immunomodulatory effects are not reported. The strength of this study is that the effects of the <italic>Kimchi</italic> supplementation on blood immune parameters are examined. These study results are useful information in further research of the patients with dysregulated immune responses. On the other hand, small sample size and short duration may limit the power in detecting differences between groups. Further studies examining a various subjects with unbalanced immune system, larger samples for longer periods are necessary to determine the immune-modulation of fermented <italic>Kimchi</italic>. In addition, the decreased levels of TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-6 in placebo group may be due to the use of radish. Because nutritional intakes of the <italic>Kimchi</italic> and non-<italic>Kimchi</italic> groups during the 4 weeks of intervention were similar in this study, more research is need to interpret changes observed in the control group.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgement</title><p>This work was supported by the World Institute of <italic>Kimchi</italic>, An Annex of Korea Food
