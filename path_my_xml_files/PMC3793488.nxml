Sesamin, as a major lignan in sesame seeds has multiple functions such as cholesterol lowering, anti-hypertensive, anti-cancer, and lipid lowering effect. It induces expression of aldehyde dehydrogenase (an alcohol-metabolizing enzyme) gene, as a result the sesamin regulate metabolism of lipid, xenobiotics, and alcohol at level of mRNA.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] A daily 25-mL dose of all types of olive oil, reduced lipid cardiovascular risk-factors, and improved glutathione antioxidant status. Daily consumption of high- and medium-polyphenol olive oil decreased oxidative damage on lipids. Consumption of olive oil with high phenolic content provided the greatest benefits by increasing HDL cholesterol levels and reducing the oxidative damage on lipids.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] Very recently, MUFA-rich diets were reported to decrease plasma total cholesterol and LDL-C without decreasing HDL-C in humans. In contrast to some recent reports, a study indicates that a large amount of dietary MUFA may raise some fractions of plasma lipids in humans. The present study indicates that a large amount of dietary MUFA may raise plasma lipids, especially TGs. It is not known whether this effect is harmful, However, the possibility that MUFA may also increase liver cholesterol in humans may need consideration.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] A study evaluated the metabolic effect of MUFA rich oils and <italic>P</italic> rich oils on the plasma lipid pattern of moderately hypercholesterolaemic subjects under controlled isocaloric condition. After a 30-day run-in diet, 44 healthy Caucasian subjects with moderate hypercholesterolaemia were randomly assigned to one of four different isocaloric diets, differing only regarding the oil used (corn oil, corn oil supplemented with vitamin E, extra-virgin olive oil or different self-selected oils), for 45 days. At the end of the study, when compared to the baseline value, LDL-cholesterolaemia was significantly lower only in patients taking corn oil (&#x02212;13.9%; 95% CI = &#x02212;5.9 to &#x02212;20.1; <italic>P</italic> = 0.02) or corn oil with added vitamin E (&#x02212;19.1%; 95% CI = &#x02212;6.9 to &#x02212;24.1; <italic>P</italic> = 0.03). Differences in plasma HDL-C and TG levels from baseline levels and between the four diets did not reach statistical significance.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] Low sample size can be considered as a limitation of our study and hence we suggest to perform study with higher sample size in future.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Choudhury</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Tan</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Truswell</surname><given-names>AS</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Comparison of palmolein and olive oil: Effects on plasma lipids and vitamin E in young adults</article-title><source>Am J Clin Nutr</source><year>1995</year><volume>61</volume><fpage>1043</fpage><lpage>51</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">7733026</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Trevisan</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Krogh</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name><name><surname>Freudenheim</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Blake</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Muti</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Panico</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Consumption of olive oil, butter, and vegetable oils and coronary heart disease risk factors.
