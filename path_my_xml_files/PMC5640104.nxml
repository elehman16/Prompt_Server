A good voice requires two moving vocal folds; if one fold is paralysed (unilateral vocal fold paralysis (UVFP)) people suffer from a breathy, weak voice that tires easily and is unable to function normally. UVFP can also result in choking and breathlessness. Current treatment for adults with UVFP is speech therapy to stimulate recovery of vocal fold (VF) motion or function and/or injection of the paralysed VF with a material to move it into a more favourable position for the functioning VF to close against. When these therapies are unsuccessful, or only provide temporary relief, surgery is offered. Two available surgical techniques are: (1) surgical medialisation; placing an implant near the paralysed VF to move it to the middle (thyroplasty) and/or repositioning the cartilage (arytenoid adduction) or (2) restoring the nerve supply to the VF (laryngeal reinnervation). Currently there is limited evidence to determine which surgery should be offered to adults with UVFP.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>A feasibility study to test the practicality of running a multicentre, randomised clinical trial of surgery for UVFP, including: (1) a qualitative study to understand the recruitment process and how it operates in clinical centres and (2) a small randomised trial of 30 participants recruited at 3 UK sites comparing non-selective laryngeal reinnervation to type I thyroplasty. Participants will be followed up for 12 months. The primary outcome focuses on recruitment and retention, with secondary outcomes covering voice, swallowing and quality of life.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>Ethical approval was received from National Research Ethics Service&#x02014;Committee Bromley (reference 11/LO/0583).

We acknowledge the challenges associated with recruiting to a phase III surgical study of this type and have sought to overcome them by: (1) learning from this previous trial; (2) designing this rigorous feasibility study to be conducted prior to running a larger scale phase III randomised controlled trial and (3) involving patients with UVFP throughout the feasibility study design, set up, analysis and dissemination processes.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Our research team is multidisciplinary and our study design incorporates both qualitative and quantitative components.</p></list-item><list-item><p>While our study focuses on voice-related criteria for inclusion, our design includes outcomes relating to both the voice and swallowing.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Although participants and study personnel are not blinded to their allocated treatment group, the speech therapist and neurophysiologist outcome raters are blinded.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Very few ear, nose and throat surgeons in the UK are trained to perform laryngeal reinnervation and so our study is limited to recruiting at those relevant UK sites.</p></list-item><list-item><p>While we aim to follow-up all participants for 12 months, budget and time constraints may limit some of the latterly recruited participant follow-up to 6 months.

The vocal folds are innervated by the recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) and when this nerve supply to one vocal fold is interrupted, unilateral vocal fold paralysis (UVFP) ensues. Patients suffering with UVFP typically display a weak, hoarse voice<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> that tires easily, with some also suffering from breathing and swallowing problems. Quality of life of these patients is significantly reduced, with UVFP affecting their ability to interact socially and perform job functions.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 3</xref>Therefore, optimum restoration of the paralysed larynx is important for patients to lead full personal and professional lives.</p><p>The aim of treatment for UVFP is to achieve optimum vocal fold (VF) closure for voice production. Where speech therapy alone does not improve the voice sufficiently, surgical treatment is undertaken. While short-term relief of symptoms can be achieved via injection of the paralysed VF with a material to improve its position for the functioning VF to close against it, permanent results are only possible by two types of operation: surgical medialisation and laryngeal reinnervation. One method of the former is to insert a synthetic implant to move the paralysed VF into a better position for speaking (type1 thyroplasty), while the latter resupplies nerves to improve muscle bulk and tone (non-selective laryngeal reinnervation). Type I thyroplasty is a 1-hour operation under local anaesthetic where the medium grade silastic implant is inserted through a window in the cartilage lamina of the larynx. This implant medialises the paralysed VF in the midline position enabling the normal opposite vocal fold to make a firmer contact, producing a stronger voice. However, voice improvement may be short-term due to progressive atrophy of the denervated laryngeal muscles.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Furthermore, this procedure does not restore vocal fold tension, meaning that pitch variation remains suboptimal.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 6</xref> Reports on short and long-term voice outcomes of patients with thyroplasty are sparse and methodologically poor.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> The newer approach to restoring laryngeal function in UVFP patients, non-selective laryngeal reinnervation, is a 2-hour operation under general anaesthesia in which the injured RLN and the donor nerve are identified and anastomosed. Its aim is to restore innervation to the larynx by &#x02018;borrowing&#x02019; the activity of other motor nerves, specifically the ansa cervicalis. As such it may re-establish the tone and bulk of the vocal folds during speech and re-enable pitch control, resulting in normal or sufficient voice. The operation is safe and results in sustained improvement of glottal closure, maintenance of the vocal fold edge and significant improvements in voice quality have been reported.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
</p><p>A systematic review of studies on laryngeal reinnervation revealed that the quality of current literature is low and a formal prospective trial was recommended using standardised, internationally accepted outcomes.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Before embarking on a trial that will use public resources and the time of patients and healthcare staff, we need to confirm that running a trial is feasible and that the chosen outcome measures truly reflect voice quality and patients&#x02019; perceptions.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10 11</xref> For these reasons, and others given above, a feasibility study is critical prior to designing, with patients, a multicentre, phase III randomised clinical trial of treatment for this disabling condition.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods and analysis</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Objectives</title><p>The primary research objective is to determine the feasibility of performing a multicentre phase III randomised controlled trial (RCT) of laryngeal reinnervation versus type I thyroplasty for adult patients with UVFP.</p><p>The secondary research objectives are to test the feasibility of:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>The multicentre recruitment process, including continuous improvement to the process based on qualitative methodology;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Recruiters being able to present true equipoise with the treatment arms;</p></list-item><list-item><p>The randomisation processes and to investigate reasons for any difficulties that affect recruitment;</p></list-item><list-item><p>The use of the following characteristics of the proposed primary and secondary outcomes: variability across patients, variability over time, differences in outcome between randomised groups over time;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Process of follow-up visits;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Means of gathering health economics and health-related quality of life data suitable for measuring cost-effectiveness.</p></list-item></list>

Throughout the recruitment process the RN will remind patients that they are under no obligation to enter the study and that they can withdraw at any time, without having to give a reason. No clinical trial procedures will be conducted prior to taking consent from the participant.

A consort flow diagram will be produced to show the progress of the participants through the phases of the feasibility study and describe the follow-up at the various time-points. The study dataset will be analysed on an intention-to-treat basis.

Any local data collection or data entry queries raised by local sites will be brought to the attention of the central London team (TM). Identification logs, screening logs and enrolment logs will be kept at the trial site in a locked cabinet within a secured room.</p><p>Qualitative data will be recorded on encrypted audio recorders and transferred to the University of Bristol&#x02019;s secure Research Data Storage Facility (RDSF). Interviews will be transcribed verbatim, with personal identifiers removed. Files will be stored on the University of Bristol&#x02019;s secure RDSF.</p><p>At the end of the study, all study-related documents will be archived. The chief investigator will archive the study master file for 15 years in line with all relevant legal and statutory requirements.

Patients and the public have been involved in confirming the need for the research, developing the trial design, choice of outcome measure and wording of patient documentation. Two patient representatives are active members of the SMG and SSC and have been provided with lay research training and support to ensure they understand their role in the research project, remain engaged as active partners and feel confident in their relationships with the research team. These patient representatives will continue to be involved throughout the feasibility study, including assisting with optimising recruitment and retention, interpreting the findings and disseminating the results to their formal and informal patient networks.</p></sec><sec id="s2n"><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>A favourable ethical approval was granted by the NRES&#x02014;Committee Bromley (reference number 11/LO/0583) prior to commencement of the study. Local approvals for each site have been sought prior to commencement of recruitment. All members of the research team and at each site will be trained in the aspects of good clinical practice appropriate to their role in the study.</p><p>To ensure the results from this feasibility study can be taken forward into a plan for a future large-scale RCT, there is a need to engage all those involved in voice health including ENT surgeons, speech therapists, voice and singing teachers, general practitioners and practice nurses. Therefore, results will be disseminated through the publication of articles in peer-reviewed medical journals targeted at health professionals involved in the care of patients with voice disorders and presented at national and international scientific meetings. Our findings and future trial plans will be discussed with relevant professional organisations including the British Laryngological Association (BLA) and Royal Colleges to ensure they are disseminated to their members through electronic newsletters, websites and national meetings. Our Patient and Public Involvement&#x000a0;representatives will assist in disseminating results in a suitable lay language to relevant journals and patient information sections of health-related websites, ensuring that patients and the public are both informed and engaged for the future RCT.</p></sec><sec id="s2o"><title>Study status</title><p>At the time of manuscript submission, the feasibility study is open to recruitment.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s3"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Reports on short and long-term voice outcomes of patients who undergo thyroplasty are sparse and methodologically poor. The quality of the current literature regarding laryngeal reinnervation is also poor. For these reasons, the experienced multidisciplinary VOCALIST research team have designed this feasibility study to provide reliable information on how to conduct a future multicentre trial to determine the clinical and cost-effectiveness of laryngeal reinnervation versus thyroplasty for patients with UVFP. The combination of quantitative and qualitative approaches and the support of the BLA and National Institute for Health Research Clinical Research Network will ensure that all aspects of feasibility are assessed, including patient recruitment strategies and appropriate outcome measures. The lessons learnt in this feasibility study will ensure the success of a future RCT (including whether training courses need to be developed to enable greater numbers of UK surgeons to perform laryngeal reinnervation surgery) ultimately enabling an evidence-based pathway of care to be developed for patients with UVFP.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e389" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2017-016871.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e390" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2017-016871.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank Eilis Longley-Brown and Jaqueline Sayers for their dedicated work as patient representatives on the VOCALIST SMG and SSC, respectively.
