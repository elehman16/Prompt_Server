Thus, there is uncertainty regarding the benefit of PAH-targeted therapy in some forms of CTD-PAH.</p></sec><sec><title>Objective</title><p>To explore the safety and efficacy of initial combination therapy with ambrisentan and tadalafil versus ambrisentan or tadalafil monotherapy in patients with CTD-PAH and SSc-PAH enrolled in the AMBITION trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This was a post hoc analysis of patients with CTD-PAH and SSc-PAH from AMBITION, an event-driven, double-blind trial in patients with WHO functional class II/III PAH. Treatment-naive patients were randomised 2:1:1 to once-daily initial combination therapy with ambrisentan plus tadalafil or monotherapy with ambrisentan or tadalafil, respectively. The primary endpoint was time to the first clinical failure event (first occurrence of death, hospitalisation for worsening PAH, disease progression or unsatisfactory long-term clinical response).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In the primary analysis set (N=500), 187 patients had CTD-PAH, of whom 118 had SSc-PAH. Initial combination therapy reduced the risk of clinical failure versus pooled monotherapy in each subgroup: CTD-PAH (HR 0.43 (95% CI 0.24 to 0.77)) and SSc-PAH (0.44 (0.22 to 0.89)). The most common AE was peripheral oedema, which was reported more frequently with initial combination therapy than monotherapy in the two PAH subgroups. The relative frequency of adverse events between those on combination therapy versus monotherapy was similar across subgroups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This post hoc subgroup analysis provides evidence that CTD-PAH and SSc-PAH patients benefit from initial ambrisentan and tadalafil combination therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p>

Safety endpoints included adverse events (AEs) and laboratory assessments.</p><p>Efficacy and safety assessments were performed at screening and randomisation visits; at weeks 4, 8, 16, 24 and every 12&#x02005;weeks thereafter; at the final assessment visit; and at the end-of-study visit.

Analyses are presented by diagnosis of PAH; because these subgroup analyses are post hoc, p values are not presented. The Kaplan-Meier product limit method was used to generate survival curves for time from randomisation to first adjudicated clinical failure. Cox proportional-hazards regression models were used to calculate the HR and 95% CI. NT-proBNP levels are presented as the geometric mean and geometric mean ratio and were analysed using mixed models repeated measures. The percentage of patients with a satisfactory clinical response was analysed as a binary endpoint using logistic regression, with no imputation for missing values. 6MWD was analysed using the stratified Wilcoxon rank-sum test; missing values were imputed using last observation carried forward or worst rank scores for missing data following death or adjudicated hospitalisation for PAH.</p><p>Among patients recorded as having &#x02018;other&#x02019; forms of CTD-PAH, 12 of 26 were further described as having CREST syndrome (calcinosis cutis, Raynaud's phenomenon, oesophageal dysfunction, sclerodactyly and telangiectasias), or limited or diffuse cutaneous SSc. To explore the possibility that misclassification of these patients led to a bias in favour of a treatment effect in the SSc-PAH population, a sensitivity analysis on the primary endpoint was performed where these patients were assigned to the SSc-PAH population.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 187 of 500 patients in the PAS had CTD-PAH, and slightly more than half (n=103) of patients with CTD-PAH, were randomised to initial combination therapy and 84 to pooled monotherapy.

Results for the primary endpoint (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">supplementary figure S1</xref>) and individual components of the primary endpoint (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">supplementary figure S2</xref>) were similar in the iPAH/hPAH population compared with the CTD-PAH and SSc-PAH populations. For the primary endpoint in the iPAH/hPAH population, initial combination therapy reduced the risk of experiencing a first clinical failure event compared with initial monotherapy (risk reduction: 49%; HR 0.51 (95% CI 0.31 to 0.83)). Overall, in patients with iPAH/hPAH 19% (25/134) of the combination group and 32% (46/145) of the monotherapy group experienced a primary endpoint event. Among the secondary endpoints in the patients with iPAH/hPAH, mean change in NT-proBNP from baseline at week 24 was &#x02212;71.2% with combination therapy and &#x02212;50.0% with pooled monotherapy; geometric mean ratio expressed as percentage difference was &#x02212;42.5% (95% CI &#x02212;54.6 to &#x02212;27.0). Compared with pooled monotherapy, combination therapy was associated with a greater proportion of patients with a satisfactory clinical response at week 24 (40% vs 28%, OR 1.736 (95% CI 1.035 to&#x000a0;2.911)) and a greater increase in median 6MWD from baseline at week 24 (+52.5 vs +26.6&#x02005;m). The corresponding median difference was +26.6&#x02005;m (95% CI +11.6 to +41.5).</p><p>Among patients with iPAH/hPAH, AEs occurring in &#x02265;25% on initial combination therapy were peripheral oedema (48% combination vs 31% ambrisentan and 27% tadalafil) and headache (45% vs 32% and 31%, respectively). Other AEs as well as rates of SAEs and AEs leading to permanent discontinuation of study drug were more evenly distributed among treatment groups. Rates of SAEs and AEs leading to permanent discontinuation of study drug were lower in the iPAH/hPAH population (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">supplementary table S4</xref>) compared with the CTD-PAH and SSc-PAH populations. In patients with iPAH/hPAH, rates of SAEs were 33% with combination therapy, 37% with ambrisentan monotherapy and 39% with tadalafil monotherapy, and rates of AEs leading to permanent discontinuation of study drug were 11%, 8% and 11%, respectively.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>The AMBITION trial included a sizable number of patients with CTD-PAH, and within this SSc-PAH, and thus provides an opportunity to explore whether this population responds to initial combination therapy with ambrisentan and tadalafil compared with monotherapy of either agent. Initial combination therapy resulted in a reduction in the risk of clinical failure versus pooled monotherapy of 57% in patients with CTD-PAH and 56% in the subset of patients with SSc-PAH. While inferential statistics are not presented, the 95% CIs around the HR for both CTD-PAH and SSc-PAH were well within the bounds of 0&#x02013;1. This result is further supported by the secondary endpoints, where we see a greater improvement in plasma NT-proBNP levels and 6MWD on combination therapy compared with monotherapy. The benefit of combination therapy over monotherapy is of similar magnitude to that observed in the whole trial population.</p><p>No new safety signals were identified in the CTD-PAH subset. However, some AEs appeared to be more frequent in CTD-PAH than in the iPAH/hPAH population (eg, diarrhoea and anaemia), possibly due to coexisting connective tissue disease.</p><p>This subgroup analysis offers a number of insights that are informative to the management of patients with CTD-PAH. As previously reported, patients with CTD-PAH tend to have more modest haemodynamic dysfunction than patients with iPAH/hPAH, though do not appear to have a better outcome. It has been reported that the CTD-PAH population, particularly SSc-PAH, has a relatively poor prognosis, and their response to PAH-targeted monotherapies in short-term trials (eg, reduction of clinical worsening events, improvements in exercise ability) has, with the exception of the initial epoprostenol trial,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> not been as robust as in the iPAH/hPAH population.</p><p>The present findings in the monotherapy arm support this, with 32% of patients with iPAH/hPAH, 36% of patients with CTD-PAH and 40% of patients with SSc-PAH experiencing a clinical failure event. However, the combination therapy arm of iPAH/hPAH, CTD-PAH and SSc-PAH had an overall incidence of a clinical failure event of 19%, 19% and 21%, respectively. This corresponds to a risk reduction for combination therapy of 49% in iPAH/hPAH, 57% in CTD-PAH and 56% in SSc-PAH compared with pooled monotherapy, suggesting that initial oral combination therapy in the CTD-PAH population may result in similar outcomes to that observed in the iPAH/hPAH patient group, at least over the duration of this study.</p><p>This is supported by the results of the 6MWD, particularly for SSc-PAH, where monotherapy provided a limited improvement from baseline over 24&#x02005;weeks (12.2&#x02005;m), which is in line with the previous short-term monotherapy trials. However, initial combination therapy resulted in a 40.9&#x02005;m improvement from baseline, indicating perhaps that the 6MWD may not be an inappropriate endpoint in patients with SSc-PAH and may be a useful indicator of response to treatment.</p><p>Additionally, a 15% worsening of 6MWD has been associated with a significantly worse prognosis in the REVEAL study.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> In AMBITION, the number of subjects with a &#x02265;15% worsening at any time was 31/131 (24%) with combination therapy compared with 46/144 (32%) with monotherapy in the iPAH/hPAH group and similarly was 21/67 (31%) on combination therapy compared with 20/45 (44%) on monotherapy in the SSc-PAH group over the course of this long-term study (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">supplementary table S2</xref>).</p><p>These results support the notion that CTD-PAH, particularly SSc-PAH, may need a more aggressive treatment regimen to see similar benefits to patients with iPAH.</p><p>In AMBITION, a protocol amendment was made to allow for a more rigorous approach of excluding postcapillary pulmonary venous hypertension from the PAS population,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> which may have provided a possible explanation for the results. However, an analysis of the modified intent-to-treat population (all randomised patients who received study drug), which includes a further 29 patients with CTD-PAH (19 of whom were SSc-PAH), shows similar results, with risk reductions of 52% for CTD-PAH (HR 0.48; 95% CI 0.29 to 0.82) and 54% for SSc-PAH (HR 0.46; 95% CI 0.24 to 0.90), indicating that excluding patients who failed to meet the revised inclusion criteria had limited impact on the outcome. Other eligibility criteria, including pulmonary function parameters, remained unchanged and in line with other PAH trials. The purpose of the pulmonary function test (PFT) parameters is to exclude those patients whose PH was likely driven by lung disease. However, such restrictions would not remove the possibility of including patients with a modest degree of pulmonary fibrosis or exclude the possibility of pulmonary veno-occlusive disease in the CTD-PAH population.</p><p>Our data are supported by a recent study published by Hassoun and colleagues.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> In this open-label study of 24 treatment-naive patients diagnosed with SSc-PAH, the initiation of treatment with ambrisentan (10&#x02005;mg) and tadalafil (40&#x02005;mg) daily for 36&#x02005;weeks resulted in a statistically significant improvement from baseline in the co-primary endpoint of reduction in right ventricular mass and PVR. There were also significant improvements in the secondary endpoints, including an estimate of pulmonary artery compliance (stroke volume/pulmonary pulse pressure ratio), echo-measured tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion, 6MWD, functional class and serum NT-proBNP. The most common AEs included fluid accumulation (29%), headache (29%) and nasal congestion (16%); SAEs were rare and limited, and included one case of fluid overload requiring hospitalisation.</p><p>Our study has several limitations. These were post hoc analyses of the subgroups with CTD-PAH and SSc-PAH. Given the small number of non-SSc-CTD-PAH patients, no reliable comparisons of treatment response between the CTD sub-aetiologies are possible. Twelve patients were classified as &#x02018;other&#x02019; CTD-PAH when subsequent descriptors suggested that these patients may have had SSc-PAH; however, a sensitivity analysis showed that this did not affect the overall findings.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This post hoc analysis of patients with CTD-PAH in AMBITION suggests that this subpopulation did at least as well on initial combination therapy compared with patients with iPAH/hPAH, both in terms of clinical failure risk reduction and improvement in exercise ability. There were no new safety signals observed in the CTD-PAH cohort compared with the full study results, though rates of SAEs and AEs leading to permanent discontinuation of study drug were higher in the CTD-PAH group than the iPAH/HPAH group. In the CTD-PAH population, an aggressive approach to treatment with initial combination therapy may improve outcomes and exercise capacity as opposed to treatment with monotherapy.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Editorial support was provided by Michael S.
