ICM is a problem-based learning (PBL) course that introduces students to the integration of basic sciences into the clinical setting.</p><p>Recent studies have examined strategies to incorporate radiology into the undergraduate medical program.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Online-spaced education, referred to as &#x0201c;Qstream,&#x0201d; is an e-learning platform in which &#x0201c;information is presented and repeated over spaced intervals and is learned and retained more effectively.&#x0201d;[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Qstream is shown to facilitate knowledge recall and behavior.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>The purpose of this study, conducted between the fall 2013 and the winter 2014 at the College of Medicine, is to assess the impact of Qstream on the student's acquisition and retention of interpretative radiology skills. In our study, we compared the long-term retention of the basics of radiology and interpretive skills in the students undergoing training using PBL format/Qstream.</p><p>The Alliance of Medical Student Educators in Radiology curriculum[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] provided the foundation for the outline of the core concepts used in the ICM laboratories.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>aterials and</sc> M<sc>ethods</sc></title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study design</title><p>The AUA College of Medicine Ethics Research Council approved this case&#x02013;control study.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Study setting and population</title><sec id="sec3-1"><title>The control group</title><p>The control group comprised the class of ICM 3 throughout the 1<sup>st</sup> year of the introduction of the radiology module. The group was exposed to the module in a standard PBL format and had 187 and 210 students for winter and fall 2013, respectively. Their age ranged from 20 to 25 years (average 23 years). The students were split up into small groups of 10&#x02013;12 each, and the students attended the radiology course (i.e., 100% of attendance to laboratories).</p><p>All the small groups participated into two 2 h of the basics of radiology laboratories (August, September, October for the fall semester; February, March, April for the winter semester) dedicated to exploring appropriate imaging and using imaging to make a diagnosis. Furthermore, two review lectures were provided, the first for ICM 3 students at the end of the training during a single large group event, and the second, as need arose for ICM 4 students, toward the end of the 4<sup>th</sup> semester.</p><p>A fellowship-trained neuroradiology, chest and musculoskeletal (MSK) imaging radiologist (Eli Tshibwabwa, with clinical and research interest in medical education) served as instructor and facilitator of the module for the two groups. Indeed, previous works on the incorporation of radiology in the preclinical program have demonstrated that one radiologist educator with PBL involvement could facilitate these types of small group teachings.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>In the context of PBL, application of the new knowledge is intended to enhance understanding and retention of the student's skills knowledge. Indeed, the student is expected to make links with prior relevant experience or reading, ask questions to stimulate the group's discussions, thus enhancing his/her own and the group's learning experience.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] The new module integrates the basics of diagnostic imaging into critical concepts learned in ICM and designates time for applying radiology concepts in tutorials. Indeed, PBL format requires learners to research issues of interest surrounding the clinical vignette under discussion.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Therefore, the students in the current study were advised to review the foundational radiology materials ahead of their laboratories. For instance, specific terminologies are used; thus, students need to come well prepared and know how opacities or a lucent structure refer to chest, abdomen, and MSK plain radiographs and hyperdense or hypodense structures to computed tomography (CT) scan. They also need to know how &#x0201c;anechoic/posterior enhancement&#x0201d; and hyperintense/hypointense terminologies pertain to ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), respectively. Further, they are required to describe axial/coronal/sagittal CT/MRI scans of the brain or abdomen.</p><p>To assist students in determining where to start for their upcoming tutorial, all the relevant learning materials were disseminated through the school's learning management system (Blackboard: Elearning.auamed.net). The available content was structured as follows: an accompanying PowerPoint presentation (PPT) on basics of radiology for the chest, abdomen, genitourinary, MSK, and nervous systems (with integrated interactive elements), which was prepared by the first author. The goals and overall learning objectives of the current module [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>] were included in the PPT. The platform of blackboard was only used as an electronic delivery system for learning material. Since blackboard was already in existence at the college of medicine during the study period, the use of this system by the students would not be a confounding factor in the assessment of PBL.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Goals and learning objectives of the basics of radiology labs for the chest, gastrointestinal tract, genitourinary system and the nervous and musculoskeletal systems</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JCIS-7-22-g002"/></table-wrap><p>The sessions took place in the ICM laboratory. As in a previous research,[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] the room was adequately lit, and the PPT projected on a large high-definition television display to allow for all the students in the laboratory to view them and to effectively participate in the discussion. The learning experience focused on describing the modalities for imaging body systems, deciding which modality to use and when to order it, and becoming familiar with the overall learning objectives and images of some important clinical scenarios frequently investigated with imaging modalities [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>].</p><p>In tutorials, under guidance of the facilitator, the group may ask questions to challenge peers in a way to support the student's learning. Furthermore, the face-to-face setting allowed for interaction among the students and between the group and the facilitator. The feedback from peers and faculty leads to the student's skills of self-assessment. In this context, the teaching promotes collaboration among the students, and this professional competency is necessary for the practice of medicine.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-2"><title>Experimental group</title><p>The experimental group was made of the class of ICM 3, during the second half of the 1<sup>st</sup> year and first half of the 2<sup>nd</sup> year of the introduction of the module. The students&#x02019; age and the small group size were of the same range as the control group. All the students attended the training (100% of laboratories attendance).</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Intervention</title><p>The students of the experimental group received the face-to-face PBL with an online Qstream supplement integrated into their learning and were required to complete this Qstream program. However, the duration to impart the theoretical radiological interpretative skills to the group was identical to the control group, i.e., 2 &#x000d7; 2 h of laboratories. Further, the experimental group received the same preparatory resources as the control group.</p><p>The second author (RM) was granted access and editing privileges and created the Qstream link.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] The course was made live, and a link was sent to the group through the College of Medicine's learning management system for each student to begin online spaced education. To this end, the first author created a 10-item Qstream course of the basics of radiology for students to practice, and all the authors could follow the student's progress with the course. Although different from the vignettes discussed during ICM laboratories, the health problems for the 10 items also addressed the core radiological concepts outlined in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>. Allowing the students in the &#x0201c;Qstream&#x0201d; to work along the same overall learning objectives of the module allowed for consistency and comparability of the control and the intervention groups. An example of Qstream item is provided along with its evaluative component and educational component. On completion of their training, students were given 4 weeks to complete the &#x0201c;Qstream course.&#x0201d; Here is how the Qstream is structured.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] each learner receives two questions every day through E-mail. The Qstream program is highly interactive as &#x0201c;The participant submits an answer, the response is recorded in a central server, and the student receives immediate feedback.&#x0201d;[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] If the question is not answered correctly, it is repeated 1 week later. If a question is answered correctly two times in a row, the item is removed from the course.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] When students complete the course and all the questions are retired, they receive a certificate.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Evaluation</title><p>Pre- and post-tests and delayed test including identical multiple-choice questions (MCQs) in various arrangement order of topics at each testing were used to assess the students&#x02019; skills of interpreting diagnostic images.</p><p>Before the beginning of the laboratories, a pretest was performed to assess student interpretative skills. The required learning objectives [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>] provided the framework for 10 MCQs. The authors ensured that these questions had appropriate level of difficulty, knowledge validity, and testing of readily identifiable concepts referenced to the goals and learning objectives. To allow for comparability of the groups, there was one set of 10-item MCQs constant throughout the study, covering the same radiology concepts though presented with different scenarios and varied order of arrangement. The questions were administered without prior notice and not aimed at a block examination.</p><p>Posttest was carried out 4 weeks after completion of the laboratories, i.e., toward the end of the semester before a review lecture. It was anticipated that, by the time of this review, students in the intervention group would have completed the Qstream course. On completion of the posttest, no further radiology laboratories were given although the students had to continue with other ICM3 and ICM4 curriculum courses. Immediately after the posttest, the students were asked to assess their overall experience and satisfaction with the radiology module. Since there was only one instructor/facilitator for the two groups, there were no differences in skill sets of instructors to contend with.</p><p>A delayed test was then performed toward the close of the ICM4 courses. In advance of their Step 1 and Step 2 of the United States Medical Licensing Examination, the ICM4 students usually requested a review session aimed at the ICM3 basics of radiology, i.e., chest, gastrointestinal tract, genitourinary system, MSK system, and nervous systems. These requests were done each year for May and November of the following semester for the fall and winter groups, respectively. This length of time was the justification for using 7 months to define long-term retention. As in the previous posttest, again, the students were polled to determine whether the module helped them meeting their learning expectations.</p><p>The assessment of the students&#x02019; skills in interpreting basic radiology findings was done using a 10-point Likert scale. Evaluation of differences between pre- and post-test and delayed test students&#x02019; scores was made with a paired <italic>t</italic>-test. Results of the student's impressions on the module were expressed as percentage of very strongly agree, strongly agree, disagree, strongly disagree, and very strongly disagree. Further, differences in student-reported satisfaction between groups were analyzed to see if they are significant or not. Chi-square test was used to compare control versus experimental for very strongly agree and differences in student-reported satisfaction between groups.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Data collection</title><p>To record the outcomes measures, a rapid audience response device (&#x0201c;clicker&#x0201d;) in conjunction with Turning Point and PowerPoint software was used. As with a previous research elsewhere, again, in the current study, the students were issued a ResponseCard RF Audience Response device, henceforth referred to as a &#x0201c;clicker&#x0201d; available in all the classrooms.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] The clicker interfaces with the software Turning Point (Turning Technologies Headquarters, 255 West Federal Street, Youngstown, Ohio, 44503, USA) and Microsoft PowerPoint to record the students&#x02019; selection of answers to various MCQs and to provide immediate feedback on student performance on the questions or content area, i.e., correct answer and additional explanation, the students&#x02019; overall satisfaction with the module. The clicker [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>] was chosen for audience voting and data collection because it has been deemed as an efficient method of collecting data within the classroom while allowing students&#x02019; participation. At each test, the facilitator included the MCQs into the PPT; these were displayed on large screens for all the students to answer using their &#x0201c;clicker,&#x0201d; but answers were anonymous. The clicker allows students to answer polling questions with a click of a button.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>An original sample of ResponseCard RF Audience Response device henceforth referred to as a &#x0201c;clicker.&#x0201d;</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JCIS-7-22-g003"/></fig></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>R<sc>esults</sc></title><p>The focus of the learning format for both groups was the PBL.

Further, the results also indicate better long-term retention of the basics of radiology and interpretive skills in the students undergoing training using PBL format/Qstream.</p><p>Previous studies with the inclusion of spaced education into the medical student courses have reported varied completion rates ranging from 55% to 74%.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] However, the strength of the current study lies (i) in the larger size of the population from one single institution; (ii) 100% of participation into &#x0201c;Qstream&#x0201d; along with completion rates, in addition to the relatively high rates of students on the delayed test (27%&#x02013;30% of attrition rates [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>]; (iii) along with constant and significant obvious students&#x02019; enthusiasm for Qstream [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">Table 5</xref>]. This observation leads to a sense of the student ownership of the Qstream activity. Furthermore, similar level of spaced education acceptance and enthusiasm was found in other studies.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] This type of teaching can be considered as a way of continuous communication and interaction with students outside of the classroom. Karpicke and Blunt emphasize that &#x0201c;a retrieval event may actually represent a more powerful learning activity than an encoding event.&#x0201d;[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Indeed, several studies have shown that interactive-spaced education enables the retrieval of useful information.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Furthermore, spaced education, consisting of clinical scenarios with questions and explanations distributed on a weekly basis, can significantly improve students&#x02019; retention of medical knowledge.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] There is also evidence that, even without feedback, free recall testing has positive effects on retention.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] However, the immediate feedback to students in spaced education is shown to reinforce his/her self-assessment skills.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] This would be in addition to the learner's self-assessment skills provided by PBL.</p><p>The reader may argue that there was no justification for using 7 months to define long-term retention. However, studies in other disciplines or across years have much different time periods, ranging from 4 weeks[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] to approximately 3 and 5 months,[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] 8 months,[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and 2 years after completion of the training.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] Furthermore, data from large randomized controlled trials demonstrate that all the components of spaced education delivery can be personalized to meet the specific needs of the learners.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Thus, the 7-month period is consistent with an acceptable time period.</p><p>With regard to limitations, ANOVA could have been used to directly compare pretest and posttest results between the control and intervention groups. However, the <italic>t</italic>-test can be used in &#x0201c;before-after&#x0201d; studies or when the samples are the matched pairs. The paired test is shown to be appropriate to compare significance between groups, for example, in the comparison between face-to-face PBL versus PBL with additive spaced education. However, unavoidable limitation lies in the impossibility to identify individual student and follow his/her personal progress due to the anonymity of the audience response.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>onclusion</sc></title><p>This study demonstrates that online-spaced education radiology course combined to a face-to-face PBL enhances not only the student's knowledge of basic radiology skills but also the long-term retention of radiology material. This is accomplished by placing the students&#x02019; interest into an integrated interactive system-based curriculum. Self-assessment skills are also reinforced by immediate feedback provided by spaced education. Therefore, students in this study may apply their acquired knowledge to other preclinical courses and toward their medical career goals. Future research is needed to see if medical students in need of additional education support may benefit from spaced education in the field of remediation.</p><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Financial support
