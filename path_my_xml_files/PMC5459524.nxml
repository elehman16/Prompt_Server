The study included 38 paramedics and paramedic students. In stationary and moving environments, a classical endotracheal intubation with a stylet, an intubation with a gum elastic bougie (GEB), a laryngeal mask airway (LMA), and a laryngeal tube (LT) were applied randomly.

Intubation can be performed by a staff with sufficient experience. A staff with insufficient experience in intubation must be familiar with alternative airway techniques. The selected alternative airway management technique should be easy to use, and the method should protect the patient from airway aspiration.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> There is evidence that an appropriate and timely intubation affects mortality and morbidity. The supraglottic airway maintains standard airways. Studies in simulated clinical environments have obtained high success speeds versus endotracheal intubation.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> In a surgical series, the reported success rates were between 44% and 100%.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Studies have reported that for airway management outside the hospital, supraglottic airway access methods are extremely successful.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>The European Resuscitation Council recommends supraglottic airway management techniques outside the hospital. However, the most appropriate method for use in patients in a moving ambulance remains unknown. Although endotracheal intubation (ETT) outside the hospital is slightly less successful than other methods, it is the gold standard. In a study comparing various airway management techniques applied to cases with a cardiac arrest outside the hospital, the survival rates of patients with ETT were slightly better than patients with other airway management techniques.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref></p><p>There are many studies evaluating various airway access methods both inside and outside the hospital. Studies evaluating intubation methods in an ambulance or a simulator are rare. A study by Gough et&#x000a0;al. showed that paramedics could successfully complete ETT in a moving ambulance.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> In contrast, when a patient requires an airway access outside the hospital, the ambulance is stopped and started again only after the airway is secured, which may delay patients from reaching in time for emergency services. As a result, we planned to complete a study assessing the airway skills of emergency medical personnel in the ambulance environment.</p><p>We compared various airway management techniques (LMA, LT, and endotracheal intubation with normal and gum elastic stylets) in moving and stationary ambulance simulations to test the hypothesis that choosing the correct airway management technique will allow a successful airway intervention in a moving ambulance. We proposed that ETT with a GEB could increase the possibility of success and would be as easy to apply as supraglottic methods. The criteria for success were the duration until sufficient respiration, a cuff inflation and first respiration, and the number of attempts. In addition, the practitioners were asked about their perception of ease or difficulty of the methods in both environments.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><p>This study was planned as a methodological and randomized crossover study.

Before each use, the standard road choice and weather conditions are set and operated by a driver each time. This program allows the driver to follow the road visually. The ambulance is set to allow only the use of the fourth gear after the third gear. The individual drives the ambulance by visually tracking the road on three projectors mounted on the ambulance.</p><p>The cameras within the simulator monitor interventions in the back of the ambulance, which allows the director operating the main command system of the ambulance simulation to observe two different camera images simultaneously.</p><p>Inside the ambulance, an advanced cardiac life support manikin allowing airway intervention was placed on a trolley for patient simulation (Deluxe CRiSis&#x02122; Manikin &#x02014; LF03955U. Wisconsin. USA, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>). A sufficient tidal volume ventilation value for this manikin was set to 0.8&#x000a0;L, and this was monitored from outside the ambulance. After intubation, successful ventilation was assessed by monitoring this metrically.<fig id="fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Outer appearance of simulator ambulance, position of the manikin and outer command center.</p></caption><alt-text id="alttext0010">Fig.&#x000a0;1</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><label>2.3</label><title>The training of practitioners</title><p>Before the study, 38 paramedics were given theoretical and practical training in all airway management techniques on two different days.

The supraglottic methods were applied faster in both, but there was no difference observed in terms of success. While one might think that a moving ambulance would affect the success rates, we found no difference between the moving and stationary conditions. This was true for both the success rate and the duration of the procedure.</p><p>The use of supraglottic methods outside the hospital varies depending on the country. In Turkey, the LMA is an alternative airway management technique frequently used in ambulances. In the USA, the most frequently used methods are combitube and LT. The LT is the most successfully applied method among supraglottic methods for airway management.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> Wahlen et&#x000a0;al. studied endotracheal intubation and six different supraglottic airway devices, comparing the success of health workers with varying levels of experience in accessing the airway of a manikin. Although the anesthetists were the ones to complete the endotracheal intubation the quickest, experience did not play a role in the success rate for the insertion of a classic LMA, a proseal LMA, an LT, and an esophageal combitube.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> In our study, the laryngeal tube (LT) was inserted in the first attempt by all the practitioners participating in the study. An LT comes to the fore among supraglottic airway devices. Trabold et&#x000a0;al. compared the use of a combitube, an easytube, and a LT on a manikin in terms of success and speed of insertion. They found that the LT was the most successful method.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> Studies comparing it to an LMA found that LT is employed more quickly and successfully.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref></p><p>We found no difference in terms of the durations and success of supraglottic methods. The moving environment did not change the success or duration of application of both the supraglottic methods. Endotracheal intubation is a skilled intervention. There are differences in the rates of application outside the hospital. The success rate outside the hospital is in the range of 77%&#x02013;85%. The success of the application is related to the training of the practitioner; however, other factors that affect success are important.<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> For example, it is known that a rapid sequential intubation of critical patients changes the results. A study in Germany determined the intubation success of paramedics as 46.4%, but the success rate is 99% in the USA<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> and 78% in Israel.<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> Manikin studies have showed variable results. Keier et&#x000a0;al. studied 56 paramedic students in sequential classes over 3 years. They found that 30.4% of the intubations were completed outside the hospital for a total of 1616 intubations with a first attempt success of 66%. The mean intubation success was 88%.<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> The success rate was affected by situations such as the educational level of the paramedic and skill in rapid sequential intubation applications. In our study, paramedics and paramedic students had a 97.3% success rate. The success rate in our study may be higher than that reported in the literature due to the airway model used or the use of a lifeless manikin. The results may be different for a more complicated airway model or actual patients.</p><p>The GEB is an introducer for intubations, and it is an alternative airway management technique for difficult situations. Difficult airways may be successfully applied outside the hospital.<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> The Joint Royal Colleges Ambulance Liaison Committee in the UK announced the necessity of having a GEB in ambulances for intubation.<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> This study tested the hypothesis that it would ease intubation in moving environments. In our study, all of the intubations with a GEB were successfully completed, while only two intubations were unsuccessful for intubations using a classic stylet. We found that the use of a GEB in the moving environment did not contribute positively to the ease of application but that it clearly lengthened the duration of intubation. While our practitioners had no experience with a GEB, they easily utilized this tool. This result is similar to that of Gregory et&#x000a0;al. on paramedics and difficult airways.<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref></p><p>Contrary to expectations, we found that airway interventions in a moving environment were completed more quickly. However, there were no statistically significant differences in the duration of interventions in both environments. There are very few studies involving moving ambulance environments in the literature. We are not aware of any study completed in an ambulance simulator. Interestingly, Wong et&#x000a0;al. found that difficult airway interventions were completed in a shorter time in a moving environment than in a normal airway.<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> We think that these unexpected results may be due to the practitioners using the methods on manikins consecutively. In our study, the order of application of airway interventions was randomly determined; however, all of the interventions were completed sequentially. The interventions were first completed in the stationary ambulance and then in a moving simulator, which increased the experience of the practitioners. As a result, we think that the latter interventions became easier.</p><p>Voscopoulos et&#x000a0;al. compared different supraglottic methods used by emergency medical technicians and found that LMA and LT were successful and rapidly applied.<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> This study did not initially observe any difference between the two methods. Muller et&#x000a0;al. monitored uses of LT for cardiac arrest outside of the hospital. There were 57 successful interventions completed in under 10&#x000a0;s, 58 in 10&#x02013;20&#x000a0;s, 8 in 21&#x02013;30&#x000a0;s and 7 over 30&#x000a0;s.<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> Similar to LT, in our study, the mean duration in the moving environment was 9.4&#x000a0;s and 10.5&#x000a0;s in the stationary environment. The practitioners stated that LT was the easiest device to use. LT can be rapidly and effectively used in moving and stationary environments even by inexperienced individuals.</p><sec id="sec4.1"><label>4.1</label><title>Limitations</title><p>Our study used a simulator to reproduce the ambulance environment. It is not the same as the real environment no matter how closely the movement and visual environment of the simulator recreated reality. In a real ambulance, differences exist due to road conditions and the use of vehicle.</p><p>The airway interventions were performed on a standard lifeless manikin. While standard airway conditions can be accurately recreated in manikin studies, there are clear differences versus the airways of live models and real patients. In practice, complications such as vomiting, hemorrhage, airway obstruction, and masses are observed in airway interventions. In addition, applications outside the hospital are hampered by psychological effects created by movement and the stressful environment, which is difficult to recreate. In addition, complications linked to the intervention were not assessed by this study. In conclusion, the conditions in this study only simulate real life, and the results may be different from real situations.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec5"><label>5</label><title>Conclusions</title><p>The moving environment did not affect the duration or success of an endotracheal intubation. The GEB was successfully used by practitioners with no previous experience; however, the duration of the intubation was longer. The results of this study show that all airway management techniques can be effectively used in a moving environment before the patient reaches the hospital. We believe that new studies are required to assess these findings in a real ambulance.</p></sec><sec id="sec6"><label>6</label><title>Funding</title><p>This research received no specific grant from
