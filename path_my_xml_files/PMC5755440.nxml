A small study established a sensitivity and specificity estimate for PALN metastases of 50% (95% CI; 7&#x02013;93%) and 83% (95% CI; 52&#x02013;98%), respectively. Surgical staging of PALN may lead to a higher diagnostic accuracy. However, surgical staging of para-aortic lymph nodes in locally advanced stage cervical cancer is not common practice. Therefore, a phase 2 randomised controlled trial is needed to assess its safety and feasibility.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p id="Par2">In addition to standard imaging (MRI or CT scan) with PET-CT, 30 adult women with FIGO stage IB2, IIA2&#x02013;IVA cervical cancer will be randomised to receive either surgical staging or usual PET-CT staging. Administering extended field radiotherapy will be based on lymphadenectomy results for the intervention group and on the PET-CT results for the control group. Follow-up visits at 0, 3, 6, 9 and 12&#x000a0;months will assess health-related quality of life and progression-free survival.</p><p id="Par3">Primary safety and feasibility outcomes of surgical staging will be assessed by calculating means with 95% confidence intervals for duration of surgery, number of complications, blood loss, nodal yield after para-aortic lymphadenectomy and treatment delay due to surgical staging. Secondary patient-centred outcomes on quality of life and first year survival will be documented and compared between the two groups. Estimates of sensitivity, specificity and negative and positive predictive values of MRI, PET-CT and surgical staging will be presented with 95% CI..

Staging is based on the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging system for cervical cancer. It uses clinical features and becomes increasingly inaccurate as the disease progresses, with accurate staging failure rates rising from 25% in FIGO stage I and II to 65&#x02013;90% in stage IIIB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The lymph node status of pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodes is, besides tumour stage, the most important prognostic factor for disease recurrence in cervical cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Failure to detect metastases in these lymph nodes may lead to suboptimal treatment. Para-aortic lymph node (PALN) metastases are quite common in FIGO IIA patients with positive pelvic lymph nodes (16%), whereas solitary PALN are rare (0.8%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. PALN metastases affect around 20% of all stage IB2&#x02013;IVA, although other studies claim considerably higher rates up to 40% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par22">Patients with advanced stage cervical cancer (FIGO stage IB2, IIA2&#x02013;IVA) are primarily treated with pelvic radiotherapy and concomitant chemotherapy. Para-aortic lymph node (PALN) status and a subsequent need for extended field radiotherapy is assessed using a positron emission tomography (PET) combined with computed tomography (CT) scan (PET-CT). PET-CT provides a higher sensitivity and specificity than magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However, for detecting PALN metastasis, PET-CT seems to have a sensitivity and specificity of 50% (95% CI; 7&#x02013;93%) and 83% (95% CI; 52&#x02013;98%), respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. This uncertainty and these broad confidence intervals are due to the fact that only one small study (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;16) explicitly assessed the diagnostic accuracy of the PET-CT. So far, this study is the only study that compared the PET-CT results of para-aortic lymph nodes in cervical cancer to the gold standard of histology. More evidence on diagnostic accuracy of PET-CT in detecting PALN metastases is needed. Some intervention studies provide a part of these data as they include surgical staging and the PET-CT in advanced stage cervical cancer, such as the LILACS trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, in the LILACS trial, surgical staging is only performed in PET-CT negative patients and not in PET-CT positive patients. This may be due to the fact that the PET-CT seems to have a sensitivity of 50% and specificity of 83%, thus possibly being false negative in half of all patients with PALN metastases while being false positive in 17% of all patients without PALN metastases, or due to the assumption that the specificity and positive predictive value of the PET-CT are already acceptable. Regardless, although missing a PALN metastases due to a false negative result may be more detrimental to survival than &#x02018;overtreating&#x02019; patients due to a false positive result, the radiotherapy-induced complications can also have a negative impact on the quality of life of patients. In addition, the confidence interval surrounding the specificity of the PET-CT ranges from 52 to 98%, leading to a large uncertainty. As such, more evidence on both the sensitivity and specificity of the PET-CT is warranted..</p><p id="Par23">Recent studies show that surgical staging not only validates the imaging results, but may also lead to a treatment modification in 20&#x02013;40% of the patients with locally advanced cervical cancer compared to PET-CT results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Surgical staging, i.e. removing the para-aortic lymph nodes by performing a para-aortic lymphadenectomy, leads to a gain in diagnostic accuracy by allowing adequate histological evaluation of the retrieved lymph nodes. Additionally, the resection of enlarged positive lymph nodes may provide therapeutic benefit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Whether this is due to removing the bulk of the disease or ensuring the radiation field includes confirmed nodal disease, or both, is unclear.</p><p id="Par24">The proportion of treatment modifications may depend on both the diagnostic accuracy of the PET-CT and a clinician&#x02019;s experience with interpreting the PET-CT results and performing the surgical staging. The validity of detecting metastasis with surgical staging compared to standard diagnostics remains to be elucidated. Currently, PET-CT is the gold standard in the Netherlands when there is a suspicion of para-aortic lymph node metastases based on either clinical data, MRI or CT scan. In addition, surgical staging of PALN in locally advanced stage cervical cancer is not common practice. Therefore, a phase 2 trial to assess safety and feasibility is warranted.</p><p id="Par25">The PALDISC (<italic>P</italic>ara-<italic>A</italic>ortic <italic>L</italic>ymphadenectomy <italic>I</italic>n advanced stage <italic>C</italic>ervical cancer) trial will assess safety and feasibility of surgical staging in locally advanced cervical cancer in the Netherlands.

As a result, patients may have a high chance on false negative and/or false positive PET-CT results, leading to subsequent under- and overtreatment, respectively. Undertreatment may lead to a deterioration of overall and progression-free survival, while overtreatment may lead to unnecessary radiation. Both have detrimental effects on the quality of life of patients as well as hospital and health care expenses.</p><p id="Par66">To compare the effectiveness and diagnostic accuracy of a PET-CT with surgical staging, a phase 3 randomised controlled trial is the most warranted design. However, as para-aortic lymphadenectomy is not standard of care for cervical cancer patients in the Netherlands, we feel the need to first assess its safety and feasibility.</p><p id="Par67">A major strength of our study is that safety and feasibility of the para-aortic lymphadenectomy is assessed on both subjective (quality of life) and objective (time of treatment delay, blood loss, adverse events, etc.) outcome measures.

These strengths will provide vital information for a group of experts in order to make the final decision whether or not a phase 3 trial is deemed safe and necessary.</p><p id="Par68">As for most surgical trials, blinding is not possible. To preclude bias due to this lack of blinding, we have chosen objective outcomes on safety and feasibility as the primary outcome for this trial and the subjective quality of life as a secondary outcome. Combining these results will provide insight in the safety and feasibility of para-aortic lymphadenectomy in advanced stage cervical cancer.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par69">The PALDISC trial is currently cancelled, and further inclusion is on hold due to a too low inclusion rate. Recruitment began in July 2015 and a total of five patients were enrolled by October 2017. This low inclusion rate which has led to the cancellation of the study is mainly due to the fact that the incidence of advanced stage cervical cancer is low in the Netherlands and there was only one actively participating centre. With the publication of this protocol, we do hope to spark the interest of other centres for such a trial. In addition, we would like to open a scientific discussion on the diagnostic accuracy of the PET-CT as there is currently no study that compares PET-CT positive results to gold-standard histology analyses. The specificity of 83% (95% CI; 52&#x02013;98%) based on only 16 patients implies that possibly 17% of all patients have false positive PET-CT results without PALN metastases. This may lead to misinformed treatment decisions including &#x02018;unnecessary&#x02019; extended field radiotherapy with associated comorbidities. As such, more evidence on both the sensitivity and specificity of the PET-CT is warranted.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>AE</term><def><p id="Par6">Adverse event</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CI</term><def><p id="Par7">Confidence interval</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CT</term><def><p id="Par8">Computed tomography</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EBRT</term><def><p id="Par9">External beam radiotherapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EORTC</term><def><p id="Par10">European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FIGO</term><def><p id="Par11">International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>METC</term><def><p id="Par12">Medical-Ethical Committee</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MRI</term><def><p id="Par13">Magnetic resonance imaging</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PALN</term><def><p id="Par14">Para-aortic lymph node</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PET</term><def><p id="Par15">Positron emission tomography</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>QLQ-C30</term><def><p id="Par16">Quality of Life Core Questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>QLQ-CX24</term><def><p id="Par17">Quality of Life Questionnaire cervical cancer specific</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WBC</term><def><p id="Par18">White blood cell</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WHO</term><def><p id="Par19">World Health Organization</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WMO</term><def><p id="Par20">Medical Research Involving Human Subjects Act (in Dutch: Wet Medisch-wetenschappelijk Onderzoek met Mensen</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Not applicable</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par70">Not applicable</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p id="Par71">Not applicable</p></sec></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>CT designed and started the study and wrote the manuscript.
