Essentially, there have been no randomized controlled studies comparing the efficacy, cost-effectiveness and cultural adaptability of suicide-prevention strategies in schools. There is also a lack of information on whether suicide-preventive interventions can, in addition to preventing suicide, reduce risk behaviors and promote healthier ones as well as improve young people's mental health.</p><p>The aim of the SEYLE project, which is funded by the European Union under the Seventh Framework Health Program, is to address these issues by collecting baseline and follow-up data on health and well-being among European adolescents and compiling an epidemiological database; testing, in a randomized controlled trial, three different suicide-preventive interventions; evaluating the outcome of each intervention in comparison with a control group from a multidisciplinary perspective; as well as recommending culturally adjusted models for promoting mental health and preventing suicidal behaviors.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and design</title><p>The study comprises 11,000 adolescents emitted from randomized schools in 11 European countries: <italic>Austria, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Romania, Slovenia and Spain</italic>, with <italic>Sweden </italic>serving as the scientific coordinating center. Each country performs three active interventions and one minimal intervention as a control group. The active interventions include gatekeeper training (QPR), awareness training on mental health promotion for adolescents, and screening for at-risk adolescents by health professionals. Structured questionnaires are utilized at baseline, 3- and 12-month follow-ups in order to assess changes.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Although it has been reported that suicide-preventive interventions can be effective in decreasing suicidal behavior, well-documented and randomized studies are lacking. The effects of such interventions in terms of combating unhealthy lifestyles in young people, which often characterize suicidal individuals, have never been reported. We know that unhealthy and risk-taking behaviors are detrimental to individuals' current and future health. It is, therefore, crucial to test well-designed, longitudinal mental health-promoting and suicide-preventive interventions by evaluating the implications of such activities for reducing unhealthy and risk behaviors while concurrently promoting healthy ones.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>The German Clinical Trials Register, DRKS00000214.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Suicide is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, and the third leading cause of death among people aged below 25. Globally, every year, there are nearly a million deaths from suicide -- roughly one every 40 seconds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Each year, in the 27 EU member states, approximately 63,000 Europeans commit suicide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]; and, in 2006, suicide mortality exceeded the number of deaths due to traffic accidents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Europe currently includes seven countries among the top 15 with the highest suicide mortality rates worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Moreover, among the 15-24 age group, it is estimated that approximately 100 to 200 suicide attempts take place for every completed suicide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Research has demonstrated that suicidal behaviors are underestimated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]: the actual prevalence of suicidal behavior is much higher than the reported rate. Unfortunately, comprehensive knowledge of the many risk factors associated with suicidal behavior in young people is lacking. It is, therefore, essential for research to focus on understanding the multiple underlying factors that contribute to or prevent suicidal behavior.</p><p>Suicidal behavior does not consist of isolated acts. Rather, it is the outcome of a long process usually associated with a psychiatric disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] that, in many cases, goes undiagnosed and untreated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. There is, thus, evidence that suicidal behavior coincides with many underlying psychological and psychiatric conditions, ranging from depressive episode [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and alcoholism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] to psychotic manifestations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Psychological factors, though substantially interrelated with suicidal behaviors, are far from being the sole causes. In addition to psychiatric illnesses, certain risk behaviors have also been identified. For example, suicidal behaviors have been shown to be strongly associated with various types of risk behaviors, including peer victimization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], risky sexual behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], delinquency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], substance abuse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], physical inactivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] and poor nutrition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Risk behaviors rarely occur in isolation; rather, they tend to be integrated and often overlap in what is known as a '<italic>risk behavior syndrome'</italic>. Studies have demonstrated that risk behaviors are significantly correlated with one another and often appear in clusters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Since unhealthy behaviors are significant predictors of subsequent mental health problems, and often occur in clusters, there is a paramount need to promote the adoption of healthy and positive lifestyles, especially during the early years of life.</p><p>Where unhealthy and risky behaviors are established in adolescence, the risk of health problems in adulthood is elevated. The association of such behaviors, with the leading causes of mortality and morbidity, underscores the importance of carrying out preventive interventions, particularly among young people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], for the purpose of modeling healthy behaviors.</p><p>Effective prevention strategies should comprise measures that specifically focus on defined target groups. They should include evidence-based efforts designed to address an immediate problem, and, its underlying factors, through long-term follow-up. Accordingly, those few suicide prevention studies, which have been pursued among young people have included (i) gatekeeper training programs in schools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] (ii) awareness-raising training among school pupils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], combination of both [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], and (iii) professional screening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] with subsequent clinical referral [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p><p>There is an ongoing debate in the scientific community about which strategy represents the most effective and efficient approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Reports indicate that suicide-preventive interventions in adults can reduce suicidal behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], but well-documented and randomized studies for young people are still lacking.</p><p>The SEYLE (Saving and Empowering Young Lives in Europe) longitudinal research project is, therefore, based on a multi-site mental health promotion and suicide prevention program; studying the three above-mentioned strategies separately to understand which approach is the most effective and pragmatic across the participating schools, and considers cultural and national differences; as well as recommending evidence-based, combined and multifaceted interventions.</p></sec><sec><title>Objectives</title><p>The key objectives of the study are:</p><p>(i) to collect baseline and follow-up assessments of the mental health and well-being, alongside demographic data, information about lifestyles, values, risk behaviors and other psychosocial information of European adolescents and compile an epidemiological database;</p><p>(ii) to carry out an evaluation of three types of interventions: gatekeeper training involving referrals by teacher and school staff, awareness-raising training for pupils encouraging self-referral and professional screening with subsequent clinical referral among adolescents; in comparison with a control group that comprises self-referral;</p><p>(iii) to focus on reducing risk-taking and suicidal behavior while simultaneously promoting improved mental health;</p><p>(iv) to evaluate the intervention outcomes (in terms of the efficacy, maintenance, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the programs), in a multidisciplinary (i.e. social, psychological and economic) perspective, in comparison with a control group;</p><p>(v) to evaluate treatment and social support outcomes for referred pupils.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>The study is a randomized controlled trial (registered in the German Clinical Trials Register, DRKS00000214) that assesses three different types of intervention strategies in comparison with a control group.

Eligible schools are categorized by size as (1) <bold>small </bold>(less than or equal to the median number of pupils in all schools in the study catchment area or region) and (2) <bold>large </bold>(greater than the median number of pupils in all schools in the study catchment area or region). Every class in each school selected (regardless of size) where 15-year-old pupils make up a majority is surveyed. This age group is selected because of its risk propensity and the feasibility of performing 12-month follow-ups. Schools are randomized on the basis of their size category and sequentially assigned to respective intervention and control arms, comprising both large and small schools. The remaining large and small schools are then sequentially numbered.</p><p>To avoid contamination and confounding, only one type of intervention is performed in each school. Given the insufficient evidence of effectiveness of the interventions, equipoise can be assumed so that no institution or group will be put at (dis)advantage systematically. Schools are only aware of the respective intervention arm implemented at their facility, i.e. pupils are not informed of the other types of intervention performed in other schools. The effect that information could eventually spread through informal suggestions can be neglected; in case this becomes a topic, project members would apply a strategy to openly give appropriate additional information. A coordinator is assigned to each intervention arm and its implementation. Coordinators in the respective schools for each arm are instructed only on how to implement their own intervention arm, and have no prior experience of the procedures for the other interventions. Informed consent to participate in the study is obtained from all the adolescents and their parents.</p></sec><sec><title>Inclusion and exclusion criteria</title><p>Schools and adolescents in the study areas are eligible to participate if they meet all the following criteria:</p><p>(1) the school authority agrees to participate;</p><p>(2) the adolescents attend non-specialist public schools;</p><p>(3) school contains at least 40 pupils aged 15;</p><p>(4) school has more than two (3+) teachers for pupils aged 15;</p><p>(5) no more than 60% of pupils are of either sex;</p><p>(6) informed consent from parents and pupils is obtained.</p><p>If the school-based adolescents meet the following exclusion criteria, they are ineligible to participate:</p><p>(1) the school authority refuses to participate;</p><p>(2) the adolescents attend a specialist and/or independent or private school;</p><p>(3) the adolescents attend single-sex schools;</p><p>(4) a school has fewer than 40 pupils aged 15;</p><p>(5) the parents of pupils in a participating school, or the pupils themselves, have refused to sign the consent document.</p></sec><sec><title>Identification of referral facilities</title><p>In the SEYLE project, healthcare facilities that are available to receive the referral of pupils and provide treatment are identified within each respective community prior to the commencement of the project. Pupils who are categorized as high risk for mental ill-health or suicidal behavior are remitted to the local healthcare facilities for professional treatment. Pupils who do not meet the criteria of high risk for mental illness or suicidal behaviors, but necessitate changing or improving their lifestyles, are referred to a non-clinical healthy lifestyle group for social support and development.</p><sec><title>Healthcare services</title><p>Prior to the launch of the SEYLE project, all local healthcare services in each respective center are identified, including general practitioners, public healthcare facilities and specialized psychiatrists and psychologists. Personnel is informed about the project and notified regarding the possibility of subsequent increases of pupil referrals. Information describing the SEYLE project is provided to all local healthcare services, including contact information for SEYLE researchers, and information on suicide prevention interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. All adolescents ascertained to be at-risk are referred by professionals, or self-referred, to the local healthcare facilities for treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Healthy Lifestyle Group</title><p>Pupils who are referred by teachers, or by themselves, for perceiving to have at-risk behaviors, but who are not in need of professional help, are recommended to a non-clinical healthy lifestyle group. The healthy lifestyle groups comprise facilities in which pupils are positively encouraged to adopt or improve healthy behaviors. On the local level, this could be a boy scouts club, organized sport activities and other local activities in the community. On the national level, healthy lifestyle groups could be national adolescent self-help programs, etc. Moreover, SEYLE centers unable to identify sufficient healthy lifestyle groups are encouraged to create their own version of a healthy lifestyle group in which they choose the topics and involve local volunteers to organize the meetings. The concept of the healthy lifestyle group is to provide a positive and uplifting localized atmosphere for adolescents who are not classified as high risk and do not fit the criteria for professional help; however, do need positive support for adopting healthy behaviors and changing unhealthy ones.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Baseline assessment of pupils</title><p>The baseline evaluation questionnaire, completed within the confines of the classroom, is followed up with a post-intervention evaluation questionnaire 3- and 12-months post-baseline to study changes in attitudes, lifestyles, behaviors and mental health problems of pupils. The baseline assessment obtains data on lifestyles, behaviors, values, mental health and suicidality. Data are collected by means of structured questionnaires, including:</p><p>(i) the <italic>Global School-Based Pupil Health Survey </italic>(GSHS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], which assesses lifestyles and risk-taking behaviors;</p><p>(ii) the <italic>WHO Well-being Scale </italic>(WHO-5) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>], which evaluates mood (good spirits, relaxation), vitality (being active and waking up fresh and rested) and general interests (being interested in things);</p><p>(iii) the <italic>Beck Depression Inventory </italic>(BDI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], which measures depressive symptoms;</p><p>(iv) the <italic>Paykel Suicide Scale </italic>(PSS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>], which determines suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior;</p><p>(v) the <italic>Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire </italic>(SDQ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>], which collects information on emotional symptoms, conduct problems, hyperactivity and/or inattention, peer relationship problems and pro-social behavior;</p><p>(vi) the <italic>Deliberate Self-Harm Inventory </italic>(DSHI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], which evaluates deliberate self-harm behavior;</p><p>(vii) the <italic>Young's Diagnostic Questionnaire </italic>(YDQ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>] for Internet Addiction, which identifies Internet dependency among adolescents;</p><p>(viii) questions from the <italic>European Values Study </italic>(EVS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>], which examines values, such as religion, family, marriage, work and friendship;</p><p>(ix) specific items developed or modified for the SEYLE study, concerning reading, music, and internet habits, as well as coping, trauma and bullying, stressful life events, stigma and discrimination, peer and parent-child relations, children's physical health, alcohol and substance use, and future outlook.</p></sec><sec><title>Emergency cases</title><p>A specific procedure to evaluate and immediately assist emergency cases is compulsory for all pupil participation of the SEYLE project. Emergency cases are identified by means of two specific questions prompted in the baseline questionnaire. Pupils are considered emergency cases if they respond "sometimes", "often", "very often" or "always" to the question "<italic>During the past two weeks, have you reached the point where you seriously considered taking your life or perhaps made plans how you would go about doing it</italic>?"; and/or if they respond "Yes" to the question "<italic>Have you tried to take your own life during the past 2 weeks</italic>?". Pupils identified in the baseline questionnaire as emergency cases are immediately referred for clinical evaluation and directed to healthcare services for treatment if necessary. However, once evaluated, and even when subjected to treatment, pupils are permitted to continue in the intervention arm to which they were originally assigned.</p></sec><sec><title>Interventions</title><p>The preventive interventions comprise: Gatekeeper Training (QPR), training of pupils in awareness of mental health and crisis management (Awareness Training), and screening of at-risk pupils by health professionals (Professional Screening) with subsequent clinical evaluation. These three types of intervention arms are compared with the control group. Interventions are designed to promote overall healthy behaviors; raise awareness; improve lifestyles; refer subjects who demonstrate signs of suicidal risk and mental ill-health for treatment or to a non-clinical healthy-lifestyle group; and ultimately, enhance psychological well-being while reducing suicidal risk and mental illness.</p><sec><title>I. Question, Persuade and Refer (QPR)</title><p>The QPR 'preventive intervention' program, developed in the US <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.qprinstitute.com/">http://www.qprinstitute.com/</ext-link>, focuses primarily on training gatekeepers to identify and intervene when individuals are engaged in risk behaviors. It involves asking the individuals questions concerning their behavior, <italic>persuading </italic>them to seek help if they are displaying suicidal warning signs and, when appropriate, <italic>referring </italic>the individual to a treatment facility. In medical ethics, the doctrine of Informed Consent and respecting the individual's rights does not preclude persuasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. Gatekeepers, in this study, are teachers and school staff who are in daily contact with the subjects concerned. Teachers and school staff in the randomly selected schools are trained by staff in the SEYLE project that have undergone the official QPR training program in the USA, or online, and are certified trainers of this method. Training consists of a two-hour interactive lecture and a one-hour role-play session. Teachers and school staff receive a QPR booklet on suicide prevention with education that focuses on describing the epidemiology and risk factors of the phenomenon of suicide; deals with common myths and facts about suicide; provides detailed guidance on how to recognize young people at-risk; and gives basic information about how to support pupils who are contemplating suicide and persuade them to get help. SEYLE has, however, modified one aspect of the QPR intervention in order to fit the needs of the project. In the original QPR intervention, business cards with information concerning contact information for local healthcare services are distributed to the gatekeepers during the training, in which case, gatekeepers keep the business cards on their person in the occurrence they need to utilize the information when referring someone presumed to be at-risk.</p><p>In the SEYLE modified version, the business cards contain contact information not only for healthcare services, but for non-clinical healthy lifestyle groups as well. Moreover, business cards are dispersed to each teacher and school staff participant during the training advising them to distribute the business cards to adolescents who they presume to be at-risk for mental ill-health or suicidal behavior.</p><p>The active intervention period for the QPR in SEYLE is a period of four weeks.</p></sec><sec><title>II. Awareness Training of Pupils</title><p>The awareness intervention is designed to promote knowledge of mental health, healthy lifestyles and behaviors among adolescents enrolled in the SEYLE project. It is an extended, refined version of an awareness trial conducted in nine countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] developed by researchers from Columbia University, New York and the National Prevention of Suicide and Mental Ill-Health (NASP), Karolinska Institutet, Sweden and incorporates methodology used in preventive interventions for suicidal behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. All pupils in the schools concerned are provided with a customized educational, awareness-raising booklet covering six specific topics concerning: (i) awareness of mental health; (ii) self-help advice; (iii) stress and crisis; (iv) depression and suicidal thoughts; (v) helping a troubled friend; and (vi) getting advice - who to contact [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>] with telephone numbers and email addresses to local healthcare facilities and healthy lifestyle groups in case pupils wish to seek help. Once the intervention commences, six posters are hung in the classroom covering the six key topics as in the awareness booklets. Lessons, which are also combined with role-play sessions, address the six topics covered in the awareness booklet and posters.</p><p>During the classroom sessions, the instructor and an assistant distribute the awareness booklets to all the pupils. The instructor addresses these six topics along with role-play sessions during subsequent five one-hour sessions over 4-week duration (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Timeline for the Awareness Intervention</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2458-10-192-2"/></fig><p>In the role-play sessions, the adolescents have the opportunity to act out conflict issues they experience in their everyday lives (i.e. with parents, peers, teachers etc.) under the supervision of the same trained instructor who gives the lectures and leads role-play sessions, along with an assistant, while pupils acquire skills in resolving such problems. The role-play sessions comprise the following three themes: <bold>Theme I</bold>, <italic>Awareness about choices</italic>; <bold>Theme 2</bold>, <italic>Awareness about feelings and how to manage stress and crisis situations</italic>; and <bold>Theme 3</bold>, <italic>Awareness about depression and suicidal thoughts</italic>. Pupils who, through this intervention, recognize their own need for help have the opportunity and are encouraged to self-refer themselves to contact an appropriate mental-healthcare provider, or join a healthy lifestyle group by using the country-specific contact information that is provided in the booklets and on a business card, which is distributed to each pupil.</p></sec><sec><title>III. Professional Screening</title><p>This intervention is designed to help health professionals to identify at-risk adolescents by using cut-off points for positive responses based on specific scales of adolescent mental health in the baseline questionnaire. This intervention was developed by the University of Heidelberg, a SEYLE center, and NASP at Karolinska Institutet, the coordinating center, and pilot-tested in the Heidelberg clinic. Based on the results of the pilot test, cut-off points were assigned accordingly (<italic>see </italic>Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). Pupils who screen at or above specific cut-off points are referred for professional clinical assessment. This assessment is conducted by a psychiatrist or clinical psychologist, who performs a semi-structured clinical interview designed for the evaluation of mental health problems, as well as self-destructive and risk-taking behaviors for adolescents screened as 'at-risk' in the baseline evaluation in accordance to the cut-off criteria.</p><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Cut-off criteria in the baseline questionnaire and in the professional screening intervention for selected at-risk pupils referral to clinical assessment</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="center" colspan="2">Theme</th><th align="left">Cut-off value/threshold value</th><th align="left">Risky and self-injurious behavior is diagnosed when</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center" colspan="2"><bold>Depression (BDI)</bold></td><td align="left">BDI-score &#x02265; 14; depending on the responses, from 0 to 3 points are assigned (cf. manual) and added.</td><td align="left">A BDI score of &#x02265; 14 is obtained.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="center" colspan="2"><bold>Anxiety (ZUNG)</bold></td><td align="left">ZUNG-score &#x02265; 45;<break/>depending on the responses, from 1 to 4 points are assigned and added.</td><td align="left">A ZUNG score of &#x02265; 45 is obtained.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="center" colspan="2"><bold>Suicidal Ideation and Attempts</bold></td><td align="left">PAYKEL Scale</td><td align="left">The cut-off of at least one single item is obtained.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"/><td colspan="2"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td/><td/><td align="left">Yes/No response: previous suicide attempt.</td><td align="left">'Yes' is the response given.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="center" colspan="2"><bold>Non-suicidal self-injury</bold></td><td align="left">Deliberate Self-Harm Inventory (DSHI)</td><td align="left">A sum of &#x02265; 2 is obtained and all points must therefore be added.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="center" colspan="2"><bold>Eating behavior</bold></td><td align="left">Both responses are needed to calculate the BMI score.</td><td align="left">The BMI score is less than 16.5.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="center" colspan="2"><bold>Sensation-seeking and delinquent behaviors</bold></td><td align="left">Yes/No response: riding with someone who has been drinking.</td><td align="left">The sum of &#x02265; 3 for the theme 'risk behavior' is obtained.

Control group/Minimal Intervention</title><p>For ethical reasons (nonmaleficence/preventing harm; fairness/equitable access), the control group cannot be completely excluded from any intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. Therefore, a minimal intervention comprising six educational posters, which are the same as those utilized in the awareness training intervention (<italic>see above</italic>), are displayed in the classrooms. The posters display six key points, the same as in the awareness arm booklet, and provide contact details for the local healthcare services and healthy lifestyle groups. Pupils who recognize their own need for help have the opportunity to contact (self-referral) healthcare providers or a healthy lifestyle group. This minimal intervention for the control group includes no other form of intercession.</p><p>The posters hang in the classroom for four weeks, as all interventions performed in SEYLE have an active intervention period of 4 weeks.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Pupil referrals in each intervention</title><p>During and after the SEYLE interventions, students at-risk are actively referred to local health-care facilities and to healthy lifestyle groups. Students are referred according to the arm they were randomized to.

For data collection, SEYLE has developed a systematic method of recording and monitoring all referrals and obtaining feedback on their appropriateness. Pupils are asked whether they have been referred and to whom, what kinds of treatment they have received (medication, psychotherapy, both or neither etc.) and for how long. Phone calls are performed with pupils who do not participate in the follow-up evaluations, and, where possible, facilitators maintain contact with the pupils' parents. In cases, where parents or family represent a source of concern in the perception of the pupil or staff member, contacts will be handled in a particularly careful manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Professionals, teachers and school staff assessment</title><p>Baseline and 3- and 12-month evaluations is also performed among health professionals, teachers and school staff involved in the project. Health professionals are assessed by a short 12-item questionnaire on their knowledge and preparedness of treating adolescents displaying suicidal behaviors. Teachers and school staff undergo a more detailed assessment questionnaire that collects data on mental health and suicidal behavioral knowledge, perception and attitudes towards mental health and suicide, employment satisfaction, their personal well-being and perspective of the SEYLE project.</p></sec><sec><title>Data analysis</title><p>The SEYLE project generates a total sample of 11,000 European adolescents, with 8,250 (750 per site) receiving one or other of the three interventions being tested. The control arm contributes 2,750 adolescents (250 per site) to the total sample.</p><p>Power calculations adhere to the widely accepted proposals made by Cohen (1988) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>] for detection of small, medium and large effects. For all outcome measures, the sample size gives the study more than 80% statistical power to detect medium effects within the individual centers and small effects at the aggregate level of centers. Overall, the SEYLE intervention project is expected to show medium effect changes.</p><p>The SEYLE study sample potentially exceeds the sample size requirements in order to detect statistically significant changes. This will ensure the required statistical power, taking into account the possibility of some center recruiting fewer pupils than expected, attrition rates at follow-up and missing data. An initial stage of statistical analysis involves examining the consistency of psychometric properties across sites of the measures used in the SEYLE study. Reliability analysis is performed on the relevant data from each participating center. The suitability of continuous variables for parametric tests is assessed.</p><p>In cases where the diagnostics indicate that the reliability of the parametric tests may be significantly undermined, the appropriate non-parametric test is carried out. These include the Mann-Whitney test, the Kruskal-Wallis test, the Wilcoxon test and Friedman's ANOVA. Comparisons between study arms in relation to dichotomous and polychotomous variables are initially made using Fisher's exact test and chi-square tests, as appropriate. Logistic regression compares the intervention arms to the control arm in relation to the risk of an event of interest occurring in the follow-up period. The odds ratio, with its 95% confidence interval, is used as the measure of relative risk. An adjusted odds ratio is produced from multivariate logistic regression models, which include relevant covariates. Statistical analyses are carried out at the level of the individual centers and at the aggregate level. Variation in the experimental effects is examined across the 11 participating centers.</p></sec><sec><title>Research Ethics</title><p>The study was approved ethically by the European Commission as a precondition of funding approval for the project. Ethical permission for the project, including permission to follow up individual pupils, has also been obtained in each participating country by the Research Ethics Committees. All requirements of obtaining Informed Consent from pupils and parents are followed carefully. In order to maintain confidentiality and to allow for analyzing follow-up data in the individual, questionnaires include a specific code to identify each participating pupil, enabling data to be obtained at individual and not only aggregate level. An independent ethical advisor supervises the implementation of the ongoing project in order to ensure maximum protection of vulnerable individuals such as adolescents and articulate any sensitive issues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The three prevention strategies that are tested in SEYLE are built upon the concept of empowering different key persons. Each prevention strategy is governed by different scientific perspectives of empowerment.</p><p>The first strategy, gatekeeper training, encompasses education concerning mental health and suicidal behavior for key persons or 'gatekeepers', i.e. persons in frequent contact with adolescents such as teachers and school staff. Through this training, the gatekeepers learn how to persuade at-risk adolescents to seek clinical help, which essentially empowers the 'gatekeeper'. This strategy has been moderately successful [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>].</p><p>The second strategy, awareness-raising training, involves interactively teaching school pupils the importance of mental health. Consequently, it empowers individuals to identify their personal level of risk, as well as that of their peers, while informing them how best to seek appropriate care, and, if necessary, helping them to do so.</p><p>Finally, professional screening with subsequent clinical referral is an approach designed to evaluate a specific target group by utilizing a well-structured assessment instrument based on cut-off scores for meeting certain criteria for mental health problems. Individuals meeting these criteria are referred for clinical evaluation, if necessary, with appropriate treatment determined by the professional in charge. This strategy empowers the professional involved in the screening.</p><p>To date, the effects of suicide-preventive interventions in young people in terms of improving unhealthy lifestyles have not yet been reported. We know that unhealthy and risk-taking behaviors are detrimental to one's current and future health. For a number of disorders and illnesses, they are important factors contributing to premature mortality and morbidity. These types of behavior may be expected to be modifiable and even preventable with appropriate intervention measures. It is, therefore, crucial to test well-designed, longitudinal health-promoting and suicide-preventive interventions by evaluating to what extent such activities reduce unhealthy behaviors while simultaneously promoting healthy ones. The SEYLE project is unique in this respect, since suicide-preventive interventions have not previously been tested with long-term follow-up measures to assess changes in unhealthy behaviors.</p><p>The strength of SEYLE in comparison with other school-based prevention and health promotion programs is the active referral of all emergency cases to professionals. According to Mann et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], prevention programs for children and adolescents, such as curriculum-based programs, have shown mixed results in terms of effectiveness and impact. Knowledge about suicide has improved, but there have been both beneficial and harmful effects in terms of help-seeking, attitudes and peer support. Curriculum-based programs increase knowledge and improve attitudes concerning mental illness and suicide, but the evidence that they prevent suicidal behavior is insufficient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>]. Such programs may even be detrimental for emergency cases or high-risk pupils, if they do not provide direct access to care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>]. This risk will be systematically prevented in SEYLE. Moreover, psychiatric and psychological treatment are preferred options for pupils who are identified as high risk; however, some pupils may not fit the criteria to receive professional treatment, thus, it is of interest to examine the effectiveness of healthy lifestyle groups for those particular adolescents.</p><p>There are also some limitations of the study. Some families may pose problems to allow for an informed consent of an adolescent child to join the project. This may be related to dysfunctional processes in the family affecting the child's health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>]. In the SEYLE project, due to economical limitations, we are unable to examine the source of such family conflicts and, as a result, it can cause some selection bias of pupils joining the interventions. Other limitations of the study include pupils' refusal to partake in the referral process to healthcare facilities or follow-up evaluations in all intervention arms. Moreover, the information collected on treatment for pupils referred to healthcare services and healthy lifestyle groups is based on self-reports by the pupil, and is not collected from medical records or from leaders in the healthy lifestyle groups, however, in respective centers, this option is a possibility and data is collected from medical records wherever possible.</p><p>In conclusion, the proposed pragmatic SEYLE trial is expected to provide scientific evidence for understanding the effects of different preventive interventions, their cost-effectiveness and how they can also be combined and practically utilized.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethical approval</title><p>The SEYLE protocol has been granted ethical approval in each participating country where the research project is implemented:</p><p>&#x02022; <bold>Austria</bold>: Ethikkomission der Medizinischen Universit&#x000e4;t Innsbruck</p><p>&#x02022; <bold>Estonia</bold>: Tallinna Meditsiiniuuringute Eetikakomitee</p><p>&#x02022; <bold>France</bold>: Comit&#x000e9; de Protection des Personnes Sud-M&#x000e9;diterran&#x000e9;e II</p><p>&#x02022; <bold>Germany</bold>: Ethikkommission Medizinische Fakult&#x000e4;t Heidelberg</p><p>&#x02022; <bold>Hungary</bold>: Eg&#x000e9;szs&#x000e9;g&#x000fc;gyi Tudom&#x000e1;nyos Tan&#x000e1;cs Titk&#x000e1;rs&#x000e1;g, P&#x000e1;ly&#x000e1;zati Iroda, Tudom&#x000e1;nyos &#x000c9;s Kutat&#x000e1;setikai Bizotts&#x000e1;g</p><p>&#x02022; <bold>Ireland</bold>: Clinical Research Ethics Committee of the Cork Teaching Hospital</p><p>&#x02022; <bold>Israel</bold>: Helsinki Committee at the Rabin Medical Center</p><p>&#x02022; <bold>Italy</bold>: Comitato Bioetico Di Ateneo, Universit&#x000e0; Degli Studi Del Molise</p><p>&#x02022; <bold>Romania</bold>: Comisia De Etic&#x000e3;, A Universit&#x000e3;tii De Medicin&#x000e3; Si Farmacie, Cluj Napoca</p><p>&#x02022; <bold>Slovenia</bold>: Komisija Republike Slovenije Za Medicinsko Etiko</p><p>&#x02022; <bold>Spain</bold>: Comit&#x000e9; &#x000c8;tico de Investigaci&#x000f3;n Clinica, regional del Principado de Asturias</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>DW is the principal investigator, participated in the study design and coordination, and critically revised all the phases of the manuscript.
