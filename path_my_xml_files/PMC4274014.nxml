However, approximately one third of GP patients are &#x02018;idiopathic&#x02019; (ID) meaning that the pathogenic basis of the GP condition is mostly unknown. This unknown aetiology creates a challenge to their clinical and therapeutic management.<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>In the treatment of severe symptoms of drug-refractory GP, there are not many therapeutic options.<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Initial therapies include nutritional modifications, medications to stimulate gastric emptying and medications to reduce symptoms of nausea and vomiting. Botulinum toxin injection into the pylorus may provide short-term reduction in symptoms, but placebo-controlled studies have not been favorable.<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> When medications fail to control symptoms, interventional measures to support nutritional status may be required. Some GP patients refractory to medical treatment are candidates for gastric electrical stimulation (GES). The Enterra System (Medtronic Inc, Minneapolis, MN, USA) utilizes high frequency (14&#x000a0;Hz; 12&#x000a0;cpm) short pulse width (330&#x000a0;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>s) and low-energy stimulation. This neurostimulation approach with the Enterra System is FDA approved and has been available under a Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) program since March 2000 for use in the treatment of chronic, intractable (drug-refractory) nausea and vomiting secondary to GP of diabetic or ID etiology.<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p><p>Over the last 11&#x000a0;years, Enterra GES has been used for treatment of some refractory patients based on its safety and efficacy profile.<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> The improvement of nausea and vomiting shown in many open-labelled clinical trials indicates that reduction in GP symptoms can be achieved.<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> The first placebo-controlled multicenter Worldwide Anti-Vomiting Electrical Stimulation Study reported a significant decrease in vomiting during the double-blind period of 1-month ON compared with the 1-month OFF period following implantation, particularly with diabetic GP.<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> With continued ON stimulation, there was improved quality of life (QOL) and a modest improvement in gastric retention at 6 and 12&#x000a0;months of GES. Other non-placebo-controlled publications have confirmed similar outcomes with a sustained decrease in GP symptoms, nutritional support, days of hospitalization, which was associated with improvements in body mass index (BMI) and, in diabetic GP, better glycemic control.<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p><p>Due to the paucity of double-blind placebo-controlled data focused on Enterra GES therapy, this clinical trial was initiated to evaluate the efficacy and safety of gastric neurostimulation therapy for severe gastroparetic subjects with ID etiology. The purpose of this clinical evaluation was to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of Enterra&#x000ae; Therapy in the treatment of chronic, intractable (drug-refractory) nausea and vomiting secondary to GP of ID etiology. The primary objective was to demonstrate that there was a reduction in weekly vomiting frequency (WVF) when the device was turned ON, relative to when the device was turned OFF during a blinded crossover phase. The secondary objectives were as follows: (i) to demonstrate a reduction in symptom scores when the device is turned ON relative to when the device was turned OFF, and (ii) to demonstrate a long-term reduction in WVF at 12&#x000a0;months relative to baseline. Additional goals included assessment of the safety of Enterra Therapy, evaluation of the 12-month responder rate, 12-month change in symptom score, 12-month change in QOL, gastric emptying, number of days in hospital and BMI.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This was a prospective, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, controlled, two-period crossover study conducted at eight centres in the United States under Institutional Review Board approval.

During the first 7.5&#x000a0;months, the programming parameters were not changed, with the exception that the voltage was adjusted based on impedance to maintain a 5&#x000a0;mA current. Furthermore, the voltage was set to 0 during the OFF period. After the 7.5&#x000a0;month visit, programming parameters could be adjusted at the investigator's discretion based on the assessment of the subject's symptoms status.</p></sec><sec><title>Outcome measures</title><p>Subjects were required to record daily vomiting episodes in a 28-day diary to assess WVF prior to each visit. The frequency and severity of GP symptoms (vomiting, nausea, early satiety, bloating, postprandial fullness, epigastric pain, and epigastric burning) were assessed using a 5-point symptom interview questionnaire at baseline and each follow-up visit. The frequency symptom scores were rated by the patient as 0, absent; 1, rare (1 per week); 2, occasional (2&#x02013;3 per week); 3, frequent (4&#x02013;6 per week); 4, extremely frequent (&#x02265;7 per week). The severity symptom scores were rated as 0, absent; 1, mild (not influencing the normal activities); 2, moderate (diverting from, but not urging modifications, of usual activities); 3, severe (influencing usual activities, severely enough to urge modifications); 4, extremely severe (requiring bed rest). The sums of the frequency or severity ratings of the seven symptoms were used as an overall frequency or severity total symptom score (TSS).</p><p>Health-related QOL was assessed at baseline and follow-up visits using the previously validated short form-36 (SF-36) Health Status Survey questionnaire, version 1.<xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Gastric emptying was evaluated of a solid meal at baseline and 12&#x000a0;months using a standardized scintigraphy method and a low-fat test meal.<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Type of nutritional support (oral, J-tube, G-tube, TPN) and whether or not it was continuous or intermittent was collected at baseline and on follow-up visits.</p><p>Number of days in the hospital for treatment of GP was collected at baseline and visits up to 12&#x000a0;months.</p><p>Adverse events were monitored throughout the study. All events were classified using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Cause and severity of each adverse event was assessed by the principal investigator and adjudicated by an Adverse Events Committee. The cause of the adverse event was classified as being &#x02018;device-related&#x02019; (the event is caused by a suspected device malfunction), &#x02018;therapy-related&#x02019; (the event is directly or indirectly caused by the surgical implantation procedure; or is associated with the presence and/or use of the device) or &#x02018;patient-related&#x02019; (the event is associated with the subject's underlying diagnosis or a new diagnosis, unrelated to the device). Serious adverse events were considered when they resulted in death, were life threatening, required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, resulted in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, or resulted in a congenital anomaly/birth defect.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size, randomization and blinding</title><p>A 25% reduction in WVF when device was ON relative to when device was OFF was considered to be clinically significant. Based on 80% power to detect this significant difference with a standard deviation of 50% (&#x003b1;&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.05, two-sided), 32 subjects were required for analysis. To compensate for non-evaluable subjects, a maximum of 75 subjects were allowed to be implanted. Subjects were randomized by Sponsor at 1&#x000a0;:&#x000a0;1 ratio stratified by center in a block size of four to have therapy turned ON or OFF at the beginning of the crossover periods. Randomization assignments were generated centrally, put into sealed envelopes and sent to authorized unblinded personnel at the study site prior to the randomization visit. The subjects, the investigators and the study coordinators were blinded to the device settings during the crossover period. Authorized unblinded personnel checked the device status and programmed the device at follow-up visits during the crossover period. The record of such an activity was kept in a separate binder not accessible to the other study-site personnel.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The primary objective was assessed by the within subject percent (%) reduction in WVF during ON period relative to OFF period.

12&#x000a0;months decreased significantly when compared with baseline, with a median reduction of 87.1% (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001). The median WVF was 17.3 episodes at baseline and two episodes at 12&#x000a0;months. In this period, a responder was defined as having a 50% or greater reduction in WVF from baseline to 12&#x000a0;months, and there were 17 responders (94.4%, <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001) in our cohort.</p><p>Two sensitivity analyses, intent-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) were performed to address the missing WVF data at 12&#x000a0;months. The ITT analysis included all the subjects who were randomized. Per-protocol analysis included all subjects who finished 12&#x000a0;months of follow-up, including one subject with missing diary data. The imputation method of last-observation-carried-forward was applied to adjust for the missing data for the PP and ITT analyses. Only those observations made while the device was turned ON were carried forward. Per-protocol and ITT analyses revealed a median reduction of 85.3% (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001) and 80.9% (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.003), respectively, from baseline to 12&#x000a0;months.</p><p>The mean TSS frequency and severity scores were significantly decreased from baseline to 12&#x000a0;months (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001). Six individual symptom scores, specifically vomiting, nausea, early satiety, bloating, postprandial fullness and epigastric pain, were also decreased significantly from baseline to 12&#x000a0;months for both frequency and severity symptom scores (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05). There was no significant reduction in the frequency or severity symptom scores of epigastric burning at 12&#x000a0;months (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.154 and 0.114 respectively).</p><p>Quality of life scores at 12&#x000a0;months was also improved from baseline. Statistically significant improvements were observed in the PCS and MCS scores (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.043 and <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001 respectively). Increased values in sub-scores were observed in all eight domains of the SF-36 survey, with statistically significant improvements in the physical functioning, role physical, vitality, social functioning and mental health domains (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05).</p><p>Annualized median days in the hospital decreased from a median of 2&#x000a0;days at baseline to 0&#x000a0;days at 12&#x000a0;months (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.006).</p><p>There were three patients with J-tubes and one other patient on parenteral feeding, who continued in the study and they all had improvement in either WVF or symptom scores or both and their results were included in the final analysis. Two of the three patients were able to have their J-tubes removed while the parenteral nutrition-dependent patient had less frequent supplements.</p><p>BMI and weight measurements were stable over the follow-up period (Table<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">3</xref>).</p><p>Gastric emptying overall improved at 12&#x000a0;months with stimulation. Two-hour scintigraphy gastric emptying (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;16) was significantly improved at 12&#x000a0;months with a median retention at 2&#x000a0;h of 49.0% (interquartile rage 40.5&#x02013;63.5%) compared with 63.5% (interquartile rage 56&#x02013;74%) at baseline (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.016). There was a numerical improvement in 4-h gastric emptying with a median retention at 4&#x000a0;h of 16.5% (interquartile rage 4.8&#x02013;37.5%) compared with 26.0% (interquartile rage 16.5&#x02013;37%) at baseline (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.236). Overall 10 subjects (62%) had an improved rate of emptying, with six subjects (38%) normalizing their gastric emptying (&#x0003c;10% retention at 4&#x000a0;h) at 12-month visit. There was a non-significant difference in the grading of symptoms between the group of patients whose gastric emptying showed mild retention at 4&#x000a0;h (11%) <italic>vs</italic> those with profound delays in emptying (&#x0003e;40%) at the 12&#x000a0;month follow-up.</p><p>After the crossover phase, from 7&#x000bd;&#x000a0;month to 12&#x000a0;months of follow-up, stimulation parameters could be adjusted by the investigators: Pulse width remained at 330&#x000a0;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>s, except for two patients (10%) who were programmed at a 450&#x000a0;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>s. The Pulse Rate remained at 14&#x000a0;Hz in all patients; Voltage is calculated from current and impedance. For the patients whose programming data were available at both 7&#x000bd;- and 12-month visits, the mean current was 6.2&#x000a0;mA at 7&#x000bd;-month visit and there was a mean increase of 1.3&#x000a0;mA at the 12-month visit, reflecting these small adjustments.</p></sec><sec><title>Adverse events</title><p>A total of 170 adverse events were collected in the study. Of these, 145 (85.3%) were patient-related events. There were 24 (14.1%) therapy- or device-related events, of which three were serious. Among the three serious events, there was one paresthaesia, one lead migration/dislodgement and one migration of neurostimulator. The serious event of paresthaesia was described as the subject experiencing a midline &#x02018;jolting&#x02019; sensation every 15 min, which was effectively resolved with device re-programming, and no residual effects. Overall, two of 32 subjects (6.3%) required surgical intervention for the previously mentioned lead migration/dislodgment and the neurostimulator migration. There was one ID subject who died of unknown cause. As the cause of death is unknown, the relatedness could not be determined by the investigator or the Adverse Event Committee. None of the implanted subjects developed infection of the leads and/or pocket housing the implantable pulse generator. Moreover, no explants of the Enterra System were reported during 12&#x000a0;months of observation.</p><p>Among the 145 patient-related events, 70 were serious events. Signs and symptoms of GP, such as nausea and vomiting, were considered an adverse event only when they resulted in hospitalization for more than 23&#x000a0;h. Gastroparesis-related hospitalizations (coded as &#x02018;impaired gastric emptying&#x02019; in MedDRA) occurred 41 times in 11 subjects, comprising 58.6% of all serious patient-related adverse events. Other serious patient-related adverse events reported more than once were related to hypertension,<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> infection or complication of the feeding tube<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> and headache.<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p><p>There was a mortality rate of 6.3% (two of 32 subjects) at 1&#x000a0;year. The cause of death for one of the ID subjects was sudden cardiac arrest. The cause of death for the other subject remains undetermined, as the clinical-site personnel had been unable to obtain any elucidating information from public records or the family. Therefore, there is no information to indicate whether this death was device- or therapy-related.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The primary objective of this study of gastric electric stimulation in patients with refractory nausea and vomiting from ID-GP was to demonstrate an improvement in WVF when the device was turned ON, relative to when the device was turned OFF during a blinded crossover phase. Our primary outcome measure showed only a non-significant trend (17% reduction) in the improvement in WVF during the ON compared with the OFF double-blind period. Of interest, the reduction in WVF, which occurred in the first 1&#x000bd;&#x000a0;months after initiation of gastric stimulation therapy, was sustained throughout the crossover period and subsequent follow-up evaluations with more than 80% improvement in frequency of vomiting being observed at 12&#x000a0;months.</p><p>One implication of our observations is that the rapid and significant induction of symptom improvement in the first 6&#x000a0;weeks was able to be sustained, despite a period of up to 3&#x000a0;months with the device OFF. Subjects reported that when the device was ON, they experienced a median of 17.3% less episodes of vomiting per week than when device was OFF. This positive effect from being ON compared with OFF was very prominent in female patients who represented 75% of the study participants while not pronounced in male subjects. In addition, there was a statistically significant personal preference for the ON <italic>vs</italic> OFF state of gastric stimulation with 75% of patients favoring the symptoms response while being in the ON state.</p><p>This study revealed that the initial reduction in vomiting frequency and overall GP symptoms with gastric electric stimulation was able to be sustained over the year follow-up period. This major favorable effect was associated with improvements in QOL and a significant reduction in hospitalization days, thus secondary outcome goals were met in this ID group as was the case in the diabetic GP trial and also reported in the literature.<xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Mortality rate at 12&#x000a0;months in this idiopathic gastroparesis (ID-GP) study was lower than in the corresponding diabetic GP trial, 6.3% <italic>vs</italic> 12.7% respectively.<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Obviously, the clinical complications of ongoing DM provide different and more serious comorbidity and challenges.</p><p>Gastric emptying was also numerically improved over the 1-year study with GES, with 38% of patients normalizing GET results, which was higher than previously observed in diabetic GP where 25% returned to normal.<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> This outcome could be consistent with the hypothesis that time, and adequate treatment, may regenerate gastric tissue and nerves, and reverse the injury/damage secondary to a viral or bacterial gastroenteritis that is suspected as the etiology in many ID-GP patients.<xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></p><p>There were many challenges and factors, which influenced the recruitment, execution and outcome of this study, resulting in a severely underpowered data analysis limiting the interpretation of the results. The major contributing factors, which hampered the recruitment of ID cohort of GP patients were as follows: (i) the lengthy insurance approval process for the preauthorization of therapy; (ii) availabilities of Enterra Therapy through FDA approved HDE application, allowing patients to have access to the therapy without participating in the double-blind research study; (iii) A small number of centres<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> were willing to conduct the protocol, compared to many (&#x0003e;90) other centres where Enterra was available through HDE application.</p><p>We believe that lack of a &#x02018;washout period&#x02019; between any of the ON and OFF phases compromised the data we obtained and conceivably masked the GES effects. In addition, the question concerning &#x02018;placebo effect&#x02019; and the presence of &#x02018;cell/tissue memory phenomenon&#x02019; or &#x02018;carry over effect&#x02019; induced by continuous electrical stimulation for the first 1&#x000bd;&#x000a0;months, and in half the subjects up to 4&#x000bd;&#x000a0;months, remains a confounding aspect of this trial as was the case in the similarly designed trial in diabetic GP.<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> The influence of placebo or regression to the mean in this electrical stimulation trial is a possibility to explain the long-term improvement. However, the patients studied were chronically symptomatic and refractory to all other treatments. These patients were recruited at six different academic centers and historically required many admissions to their respective Emergency Departments or hospitals in the months preceding their entry into this research trial, thus providing evidence against &#x02018;a placebo&#x02019; effect that might be sustained for 1&#x000a0;year. The memory or imprinting effect of 6 or 18&#x000a0;weeks of continuous stimulation suggests that any future trials require randomization from the time of surgical implant using a parallel study design without a crossover arm. Another option would be to have an initial single-blind OFF period after surgery of 1&#x02013;2&#x000a0;months followed by randomization to either ON or OFF and no crossover phase.</p><p>One another suggestion for a future study is also to consider establishing more precise scales, indices and questionnaires to appreciate changes in symptoms of enrolled subjects. The newer condition-specific, validated tools and scales such as PAGI-SYM, PAGI-QOL and GCSI have been incorporated into GP research in the last few years, but they were not available at the time the double-blind Enterra studies were being conducted.<xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> The 5-point (0&#x02013;4) symptom interview questionnaire utilized in this study was not refined enough to distinguish differences; for example, as related to frequency of GP symptoms. The highest rating of four points on the 5-point scale was marked as an extremely frequent &#x02013; meaning &#x02265;7 episodes of vomiting/week. However, subjects could be vomiting anywhere from 8 to &#x0003e;100 times per week and would grade those events equally as extremely severe and extremely frequent by marking &#x02018;4 points&#x02019; regardless. We believe that this scale may have camouflaged many important observations and made interpretation of the results more difficult.</p><p>In conclusion, although the double-blinded ON/OFF GES treatment did not achieve its primary outcome objective, the 12-month clinical outcome data from this clinical trial of Enterra GES support the efficacy and safety of Enterra therapy for subjects diagnosed with severe, medication-unresponsive GP of ID etiology. Improvements in study design and symptoms assessment are suggested for future randomized controlled clinical trials with Enterra Therapy in GP, so that questions of clinical efficacy can be accurately addressed.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors especially thank Lisa Ruehlow for overall study management and Ye Tan for statistical analysis, as well as Kristine Westgard, Kellie Berg and their colleagues at Medtronic Neuromodulation.
