The prevalence of diabetes, especially type 2 diabetes mellitus, in China and Japan is amongst the highest in the world and is increasing dramatically<xref rid="jdi12547-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref>, <xref rid="jdi12547-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref>, <xref rid="jdi12547-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref>. More effective management and treatment of this debilitating and increasingly common disease is urgently required in Asia.</p><p>There are substantial differences in the pathophysiology of diabetes between Asian and Caucasian patients, many of which might be related to differences in diet. Greater insulin resistance and reduced &#x003b2;&#x02010;cell function leading to impaired insulin secretion are characteristic of diabetes in Chinese and Japanese patients<xref rid="jdi12547-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref>. The increased intake of carbohydrates, which is characteristic of the traditional Asian diet, has also been implicated in playing a major role in the pathogenesis of diabetes<xref rid="jdi12547-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref>. Asians also have a substantially higher glycemic response to carbohydrate intake compared with Europeans, resulting in postprandial hyperglycemia<xref rid="jdi12547-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref>. Management of postprandial hyperglycemia is vital for slowing disease progression and vascular complications, and for preserving &#x003b2;&#x02010;cell function<xref rid="jdi12547-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref>. Currently, treatments targeting postprandial hyperglycemia, such as acarbose and premixed insulins, are widely used in East Asia<xref rid="jdi12547-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref>, <xref rid="jdi12547-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref>, <xref rid="jdi12547-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref>, <xref rid="jdi12547-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref>. For example, in China, acarbose is positioned as a first&#x02010;line, oral antihyperglycemic medication with metformin, and premixed insulins are recommended for use as starter insulin after the failure of oral antihyperglycemic medication<xref rid="jdi12547-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref>.</p><p>For optimal efficacy, the choice of starter insulin should account not only for disease characteristics, but also for lifestyle factors, such as diet. Premixed insulins, such as 25% insulin lispro/75% insulin lispro protamine suspension (LM25; Humalog<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Mix 25<sup>&#x02122;</sup>; Eli Lilly and Company, Indianapolis, IN, USA) or 50% insulin lispro/50% insulin lispro protamine suspension (LM50; Humalog<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Mix 50<sup>&#x02122;</sup>; Eli Lilly and Company), are commonly used treatments in both China and Japan<xref rid="jdi12547-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref>, <xref rid="jdi12547-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref>, <xref rid="jdi12547-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref>, where they are also used as starter insulin<xref rid="jdi12547-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref>. However, few studies have considered the impact of diet and nutrition on the efficacy of LM25 and LM50 in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, despite the general belief that insulin treatment should be adjusted according to nutritional intake and the fact that calculating insulin dose based on carbohydrate intake is a well&#x02010;established practice for patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus<xref rid="jdi12547-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref>, <xref rid="jdi12547-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref>. Personalization of insulin treatment according to nutritional intake is of growing importance, because of the increased diversification of diets beyond what has traditionally been consumed in Asian countries<xref rid="jdi12547-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref>. Over the past two decades, the increased consumption of calories and fat in Asian countries has helped drive the rapid rise of diabetes in Asia<xref rid="jdi12547-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref>.</p><p>The Comparison Between Low Mixed Insulin and Mid Mixed Insulin as Starter Insulin For Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (CLASSIFY Study) randomized trial recently showed that after 26 weeks of treatment, more participants treated with LM50 achieved glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) targets compared with LM25<xref rid="jdi12547-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref>. Furthermore, participants who had carbohydrate intake (as a percentage of total energy consumed) above median levels had a significantly greater decrease in HbA1c when treated with LM50 than when treated with LM25<xref rid="jdi12547-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref>. The aim of the current subgroup analysis of the CLASSIFY trial was to characterize the effect of diet on the efficacy of LM25 and LM50 in participants from China and Japan. Efficacy was assessed based on the changes in self&#x02010;monitored blood glucose (SMBG) measurements and in the concentrations of 1,5&#x02010;anhydroglucitol (1,5&#x02010;AG) and HbA1c.</p></sec><sec id="jdi12547-sec-0006"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="jdi12547-sec-0007"><title>Study design</title><p>The present study was a subgroup analysis of the CLASSIFY study (clinicaltrials.gov NCT 01773473), a phase 4, open&#x02010;label, 26&#x02010;week, parallel&#x02010;arm, multinational, randomized trial comparing LM25 and LM50 primarily in East Asian participants<xref rid="jdi12547-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref>. Participants were assigned to treatment groups using a computer&#x02010;generated random sequence and an interactive voice&#x02010;response system. The CLASSIFY study was carried out between 21 January 2013 and 22 August 2014 at 38 sites in China, Japan, Korea, and Turkey, in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference of Harmonisation &#x02013; Good Clinical Practice. The study was approved by Ethical Review Boards at each participating site.</p></sec><sec id="jdi12547-sec-0008"><title>Study population</title><p>The main inclusion criteria for entry into the CLASSIFY study were as follows: diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus for at least 6 months; currently taking oral antidiabetic medications; and HbaA1c levels &#x02265;7.0% and &#x02264;11.0% at screening. Participants in the CLASSIFY study were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive twice&#x02010;daily subcutaneous LM25 or LM50 for 26 weeks. The dose was adjusted based on the blood glucose concentration of each participant<xref rid="jdi12547-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref>. Only participants from China and Japan were included in this predefined subgroup analysis, which included dietary evaluation.</p></sec><sec id="jdi12547-sec-0009"><title>Dietary intake</title><p>Participants in China and Japan were required to complete a 24&#x02010;h food record for two separate, non&#x02010;consecutive days during the week before week 0 (before study drug administration), and during the 2 week period before week 26 or at the early termination visit. Food records were compiled for the same meals for which SMBG measurements were recorded. Participants in China recorded dietary information about their meals by completing a questionnaire<xref rid="jdi12547-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref>. Participants in Japan kept written records and photographs of their meals (with a measurement scale for reference), including between&#x02010;meal snacks, for nutritional evaluation. Food records and photographs (where used) were then transferred to a central external evaluator who calculated the nutritional value of each meal in terms of total energy (kilocalories), carbohydrates (grams), protein (grams), fat (grams), and percentage of energy derived from carbohydrates, protein and fat.</p></sec><sec id="jdi12547-sec-0010"><title>Outcome measures</title><p>The efficacy outcomes assessed in this subgroup analysis were the changes from baseline to end&#x02010;point (week 26) in the levels of SMBG, 1,5&#x02010;AG and HbA1c. Participants carried out seven&#x02010;point SMBG measurements on two separate, non&#x02010;consecutive days during the week before week 0 (before study drug administration) and during the week before week 26 or at the early termination visit. The concentration of 1,5&#x02010;AG was measured at weeks &#x02013;2, 0, 12 and 26, or at the early termination visit. The concentration of HbA1c was measured at weeks &#x02013;2, 0, 4, 8, 12 and 26 or at the early termination visit.

Treatment differences were assessed by least squares mean change from baseline using a mixed&#x02010;effects model with repeated measures for HbA1c and 1,5&#x02010;AG, and an analysis of covariance model for SMBG. In the mixed&#x02010;effects model with repeated measures analyses, the fixed effects were treatment (LM25 or LM50), country, baseline blood glucose excursion, visit and treatment&#x02010;by&#x02010;visit interaction. The random effect was the participant, and the covariates were baseline 1,5&#x02010;AG or HbA1c values, depending on the analysis carried out. In the analysis of covariance model, the fixed effects were treatment (LM25 or LM50), country and baseline blood glucose excursion, and the covariate was baseline SMBG.

In the present study, both LM25 and LM50 improved glycemic control in East Asian participants irrespective of dietary intake, as judged by improvements in SMBG, 1,5&#x02010;AG and HbA1c levels. However, LM50 treatment resulted in significantly greater improvements in a number of glycemic markers compared with LM25, particularly in participants who consumed greater than median levels of carbohydrates or fat. In order to ensure optimal glycemic control when using premixed insulins, LM50 might be preferable to LM25 in patients with high carbohydrate intake, as is common in East Asian patients.</p><p>Participants in the LM50 group were able to achieve significantly greater reductions in SMBG when compared with the LM25 group, regardless of nutritional intake. Asian patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus are known to have increased postprandial hyperglycemia, and excursions in postprandial glucose (PPG) contribute markedly to the cardiovascular complications in diabetes<xref rid="jdi12547-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref>. The importance of monitoring SMBG levels is underscored by the fact that SMBG provides information on daily fluctuations in PPG, which are not necessarily reflected by HbA1c levels<xref rid="jdi12547-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">19</xref>. Results from the CLASSIFY study<xref rid="jdi12547-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref> and the work of others<xref rid="jdi12547-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">20</xref> show that LM50 is significantly better at controlling PPG than LM25, particularly after the morning and evening meals; the same trend was also observed in our subgroup analysis. In addition to supporting the findings of these other studies, the results of our subgroup analysis also showed that LM50 was more efficacious than LM25 at reducing SMBG in East Asian participants regardless of diet.</p><p>In contrast to SMBG levels, only participants whose intake of carbohydrate, fat (by weight) or energy was greater than median levels showed significantly greater increases in 1,5&#x02010;AG when treated with LM50 compared with LM25. The concentration of 1,5&#x02010;AG has been proposed as a useful marker of short&#x02010;term glycemic control and PPG<xref rid="jdi12547-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">21</xref>, and is expected to be sensitive to dietary carbohydrate intake, hence changes in this parameter were monitored as an outcome in the present study. Our findings further support the idea that patients with higher than median levels of carbohydrate intake might be able to improve glycemic control using mid&#x02010;mixture insulins, such as LM50. As higher carbohydrate consumption has been shown to increase PPG, especially in Asian patients<xref rid="jdi12547-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref>, a premixed insulin that enables enhanced control of PPG is likely to be of greater benefit to this population.</p><p>Participants whose intake of carbohydrate, fat or protein was above median levels showed a significantly greater reduction in HbA1c levels when treated with LM50 than when treated with LM25. A previous subanalysis of the CLASSIFY study also reported that participants with carbohydrate intake above median levels experienced greater improvement in their HbA1c levels after treatment with LM50 compared with LM25<xref rid="jdi12547-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref>. Interestingly, LM50 was significantly more efficacious than LM25 at reducing HbA1c in participants whose energy intake was lower than the median, and not in participants whose intake was higher than the median, in contrast to SMBG and 1,5&#x02010;AG. This inconsistency might be because baseline SMBG was measured on the same day that baseline dietary intake was recorded, whereas 1,5&#x02010;AG and HbA1c were measured at a later time. Furthermore, as HbA1c likely reflects long&#x02010;term glycemic control, baseline HbA1c levels are potentially less sensitive to dietary intake at baseline. In fact, the use of HbA1c for monitoring short&#x02010;term glycemic changes and PPG has been shown to have limitations<xref rid="jdi12547-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">22</xref>. However, HbA1c is the current benchmark for the assessment of long&#x02010;term glycemic control, and thus, current treatments are focused on management of HbA1c levels<xref rid="jdi12547-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">19</xref>. Similar to what was observed for SMBG and 1,5&#x02010;AG, LM50 was significantly more efficacious than LM25 at reducing HbA1c in participants whose intake of carbohydrate, fat and protein (by weight) were above median levels. The effect of insulin on markers for both short&#x02010;term (1,5&#x02010;AG) and long&#x02010;term (HbA1c) glycemic control appears to be affected by the level of carbohydrate intake, suggesting that the amount of carbohydrate in a patient's diet is an important parameter for clinicians to consider when choosing an optimal insulin treatment. Carbohydrate intake has long been proposed to be the main factor affecting PPG and insulin requirement, given that carbohydrate is converted to blood glucose within 2 h after food intake<xref rid="jdi12547-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref>. Therefore, mid&#x02010;mix insulins, such as LM50, which have higher proportions of rapid&#x02010;acting, mealtime insulin, might be more beneficial to patients with increased carbohydrate intake.</p><p>Studies have shown that traditional Asian diets include a larger proportion of carbohydrates (55&#x02013;70% total energy intake) and a smaller proportion of fat compared with typical Western diets<xref rid="jdi12547-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">23</xref>. The carbohydrate component of the diets of the participants in the present study (mean 54% daily energy intake) is consistent with a traditional Asian diet, and is well within the limits (&#x0003c;55&#x02013;65% daily energy intake) recommended for patients with diabetes in China<xref rid="jdi12547-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">24</xref>. This is in contrast to the findings from a previous study, which suggested that most newly diagnosed (less than 3 months) patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in China consumed a much larger proportion (67% of energy intake) of carbohydrates in their diet<xref rid="jdi12547-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref>. This difference might be because the participants in the present study, who had been living with diabetes for years, might have modified their nutritional intake in line with dietary recommendations (reduced carbohydrate intake) for patients with diabetes. The relative intake of carbohydrate and protein (mean 54% and 16%, respectively) by participants in the present study is very similar to the results from a recent survey of Japanese patients with diabetes (mean 53.6% and 15.7%, respectively)<xref rid="jdi12547-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">25</xref>, suggesting the study findings are relevant to patients with diabetes in Japan.</p><p>Notably, the percentage of energy derived from fat by the participants in the present study (31%) is slightly higher than what is recommended for patients with diabetes in China (&#x0003c;30% daily energy intake), and much higher than what is recommended for patients with diabetes in Japan (&#x0003c;25%)<xref rid="jdi12547-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">24</xref>, <xref rid="jdi12547-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">26</xref>. This reflects the fact that diets in Asian countries are undergoing a rapid transition in nutrition, resulting in increased intake of total energy and fat<xref rid="jdi12547-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref>, <xref rid="jdi12547-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">27</xref>. Aside from the impact of a high&#x02010;fat diet on increasing obesity and body mass index (risk factors for diabetes), a low&#x02010;carbohydrate, high&#x02010;fat diet has been shown to lead to postprandial hyperglycemia, as a result of decreases in carbohydrate oxidation and insulin sensitivity<xref rid="jdi12547-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">28</xref>. Ideally, treatments for diabetes in East Asians should maintain efficacy, even if consumption of energy and fat increase as patients consume a more Western&#x02010;style diet. The finding that LM50 resulted in significantly improved 1,5&#x02010;AG levels in participants with elevated intake of energy and fat (by weight) is of particular relevance to clinicians in Asia, who are likely to be treating growing numbers of such patients.</p><p>The strengths of the present study include its large study population, which was drawn from two of the top four countries with the largest number of patients with diabetes in East Asia<xref rid="jdi12547-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref>. Unlike many other studies where the participants' diets are controlled, participants in the present study were free to consume their normal diets. As such, the dietary and nutritional information gained from the present study is likely to reflect typical diets for patients with diabetes in China and Japan. The percentage of energy that participants derived from carbohydrate, protein and fat in their diet is also broadly similar to that reported in recently compiled surveys of nutrition in the overall population in both China<xref rid="jdi12547-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">29</xref> and Japan<xref rid="jdi12547-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">30</xref>, further strengthening the relevance of the present study to clinical practice.</p><p>The results of the present study are limited by the fact that <italic>P</italic>&#x02010;values were not adjusted for multiplicity (which might inflate type I errors), and by the open&#x02010;label design of the trial. Another limitation was that the methodology used to evaluate the nutritional content of the diets of the participants in China was different to that used for the diets of the participants in Japan, although both methods were considered sufficiently accurate for the purposes of this subgroup analysis. Furthermore, the similarity of the relative nutritional values in the present study to those recorded for the overall population in both China<xref rid="jdi12547-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">29</xref> and Japan<xref rid="jdi12547-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">30</xref> suggests that the different methodologies used to evaluate nutritional content produced broadly similar estimates.</p><p>It should also be noted that given the size of the CLASSIFY trial and the multiple centers involved, it was not feasible to measure endogenous insulin secretion or levels of C&#x02010;peptide in the participants. As such, we were not able to determine whether the observed superiority of LM50 over LM25 was related to the level of endogenous insulin being secreted. However, as the participants in the present study were no longer able to achieve adequate glycemic control using oral antidiabetic drugs, it is likely that most participants were at similar stages of disease progression, and were therefore likely to have had poor &#x003b2;&#x02010;cell function and low levels of endogenous insulin. In clinical practice settings worldwide, &#x003b2;&#x02010;cell function is not a quantitative parameter that is commonly used by physicians when selecting an appropriate insulin regimen for patients. Furthermore, the effect of any potential variations in the levels of endogenous insulin on the study would have been minimized by the randomization of participants and the large sample size. Conversely, it has been suggested that the choice of premixed insulins might affect endogenous insulin secretion; improved glucose control might lead to reduced glucose toxicity, which in turn might allow &#x003b2;&#x02010;cell function and endogenous insulin secretion to recover<xref rid="jdi12547-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">31</xref>.</p><p>Given the large and increasing number of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in Asia, particularly in China and Japan, there is a pressing need for more personalized treatment and management of the disease. In order to be maximally effective, treatments must be tailored to account for the differences in diet and disease pathophysiology in the East Asian population, which include higher carbohydrate consumption and higher glycemic responses to carbohydrates compared with Western populations<xref rid="jdi12547-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref>, <xref rid="jdi12547-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref>. The present study showed that although both LM25 and LM50 were associated with improvement in markers of glycemic control, LM50 was significantly more efficacious under certain dietary conditions, particularly in patients with greater dietary intake of carbohydrates.</p></sec><sec id="jdi12547-sec-0018"><title>Disclosure</title><p>LQ and PFL are employees of Lilly Suzhou Pharmaceutical Co.
