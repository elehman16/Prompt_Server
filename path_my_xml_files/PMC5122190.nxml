This clinical trial aimed to determine effect of flaxseed powder on IR indices and blood pressure in patients with prediabetes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study design and participants</title><p>This was a randomized controlled clinical trial and it was conducted in 2013 in Shiraz, Iran. Based on previous data,[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] to detect a change in mean homeostasis model assessment IR (HOMA-IR) of 1 standard deviation (SD) and to have a power of 80%, and 10% dropout rate, the calculated sample size was 33 in each group. In this trial, 99 prediabetic men and women were randomly selected from prediabetic patients screening project, all recruited via phone call, from Cardiovascular Research Center of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences. Participants were considered eligible if they met the following criteria: (a) The body mass index (BMI) of 25&#x02013;34.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, (b) fasting blood sugar of 100&#x02013;125 mg/dl, (c) not use of insulin and other glucose lowering medications or herbal supplements, antioxidants, or omega-3 for at least 3 months before the study, and (d) willingness to participate. Exclusion criteria include (a) an inability or unwillingness to participate, (b) diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, (c) use of flaxseed, flaxseed oil, or omega-3, insulin or hypoglycemic medications, and dugs containing estrogen or progesterone, and (d) pregnancy or breastfeeding.</p><p>On the first visit, the study protocol and objectives were fully explained to all participants before they were given an informed written consent to sign. After a 2-week run in period, participants were randomly allocated to three groups who received 20 g flaxseed (FG20) and 40 g flaxseed (FG40) as intervention groups and a control group (CG) by random table. For 12 weeks, intervention groups took 40 g and 20 g flaxseed and the CG received no intervention until the end of the study. Flaxseed were milled and prepared by researchers, packed in 40 g and 20 g packets. All participants were scheduled to visit clinic every 2 weeks to obtain new flaxseed, and their adherence was evaluated. They received verbal and written training to keep the milled seed in the refrigerator and take it along with their meal in yogurt, milk, juice, or water. They were also asked to replace it with the same amount of carbohydrate and fat in their diet. While on the study, participants were instructed to maintain their habitual diets and levels of physical activity. They were tracked to follow the intervention protocol through phone call, once a week and in the face-to-face visits. Participants were asked to return any unused flaxseeds and adherence was assessed by counting them.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Measurements</title><p>General and demographic information questionnaires were filled out by the participants at the beginning of the study. Anthropometric parameters (height and weight) were measured at the accuracy of 0.1 kg by a BC-418MA device (Tanita Company, Tokyo, Japan). Height was measured by a tape at the accuracy of 0.1 cm in the standing posture by the wall without any shoes. BMI was calculated by dividing weight (kg) by square height (m<sup>2</sup>). Blood pressure was measured with a digital system (BC 08; Beurer, Ulm, Germany) whereas the participants were seated for &#x0003e;10 min. The average of duplicate measurements was considered for blood pressure. All measurements were done between 8 and 10 AM whereas the participants were fasting and not allowed to smoke.</p><p>After fasting for 12 h, blood samples were collected at the baseline and the end of intervention. Fasting venous blood samples were collected in 10 ml ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid-treated vacutainers for insulin and fasting glucose analysis.

In a study by Rhee and Brunt, obese patients with IR received 40 g milled flaxseed for 12 weeks and finally IR showed a significant decrease after the study.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>Studies by Hutchins <italic>et al</italic>. and Rhee and Brunt on people with prediabetes have demonstrated reduced HOMA-IR and IR after consuming flaxseed[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] as similar to the outcome of this study in FG20 group. It seems that flaxseed supplement at the early stages of diabetes has a positive impact on reducing IR; however, this intervention is ineffective at the diagnosis stage of diabetes. Effect of flaxseed on reduced IR can be predicted through two mechanisms: First, antioxidant impact of the fiber existing in flaxseed and second, effect of omega-3 content of this seed.</p><p>In the present trial, flaxseed consumption in FG40 group had significantly lowered systolic blood pressure at the end of the study than did FG20 group and CG group and compared to the baseline, but Stuglin and Prasad published inconsistent results with the findings of the present study and flaxseed consumption did not lower blood pressure in healthy humans.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] On the other hand, Paschos <italic>et al</italic>. showed a significant reduction in blood pressure of hyperlipidemic men which is consistent with our results.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>In this study, since people with prediabetic did not use hypoglycemic medications, using these drugs was not a confounding factor. This issue was one of the strengths of this work.</p><p>However, the limitations of the study must be taken into consideration. Giving no placebo to CG is one of the limitations. Moreover, the changes observed in overweight and obese participants cannot necessarily be extrapolated to all prediabetic individuals. In sum, based on the findings of this study, flaxseed has no effects on glycemic control in patients with prediabetes and its recommendation as a dietary component for prediabetic patients requires further studies. Studying probable effect of flaxseed on long-term glycemic control as well as isolating lignan from flaxseed to separately observe effect of lignans and omega-3 in individuals with prediabetes should be continued in future studies.
