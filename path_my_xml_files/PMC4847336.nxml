Endometrial injury has been suggested as an intervention to increase the probability of pregnancy in women undergoing assisted reproductive technologies such as in vitro fertilisation (IVF). The majority of studies and systematic reviews have reported that endometrial injury improves the outcome<bold>s</bold> of IVF, intrauterine insemination and natural conception; however, the size and quality of the studies are poor. The low quality of the available evidence questions the presence of any real beneficial effect, and the applicability of the intervention in different populations remains unclear.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>The PIP trials are three multi-centre, randomised controlled trials designed to test three separate hypotheses: whether endometrial injury increases the probability of live birth in women or couples</p><p>1) who are undergoing autologous embryo transfer as part of an IVF cycle (PIP-IVF),</p><p>2) with unexplained infertility who are attempting to conceive naturally (PIP-UE) and</p><p>3) with subfertility related to polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) who are on ovulation induction medication and attempting to conceive (PIP-PCOS).</p><p>Participants will be randomised to either undergo endometrial injury by endometrial pipelle biopsy or to:</p><p>&#x02022; no intervention (PIP-IVF), or</p><p>&#x02022; a sham procedure (PIP-PCOS and PIP-UE).</p><p>In PIP-IVF, endometrial injury will be carried out between day three of the cycle prior to the IVF cycle, and day three of the IVF cycle. In PIP-UE and PIP-PCOS, endometrial injury or a sham procedure will be undertaken between days 1&#x02013;12 of a menstrual cycle or ovulation induction cycle respectively. Participants in PIP-UE and PIP-PCOS will then be followed for three cycles during which time they will attempt to conceive from sexual intercourse. To ensure allocation concealment, randomisation will be carried out using a web-based system or sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes. The primary outcome is live birth. Secondary outcomes include ongoing pregnancy, clinical pregnancy and miscarriage.</p><p>The required sample sizes for the PIP studies have been estimated at 840 (PIP-IVF), 350 (PIP-UE) and 280 (PIP-PCOS).

Unfortunately, up to 10&#x000a0;% of couples will not achieve pregnancy after a year of frequent, unprotected intercourse and are defined as being subfertile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Many subfertile couples seek fertility treatments to help them conceive. However, even the most successful fertility treatment, in vitro fertilisation (IVF), has a live birth rate of only 30&#x000a0;% per cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Failure of an IVF cycle to result in pregnancy can be due to a number of factors and, even when high quality embryos are replaced, implantation rates remain modest. A lack of adequate endometrial receptivity is thought to be responsible for up to two-thirds of unsuccessful embryo transfers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>Endometrial injury is currently being proposed as a technique to improve the endometrial receptivity and in turn the probability of conception in IVF cycles. Endometrial biopsy is the most common procedure used to deliver an endometrial injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The procedure involves the insertion of a catheter, such as a pipelle sampler, through the cervix and into the uterus, where a sample of the endometrium is obtained via light suction and rotation within the uterine cavity. The biopsy results in a &#x02018;scratch&#x02019; or &#x02018;injury&#x02019; to the endometrium during the process of obtaining a sample. Outside of the fertility area, pipelle biopsy is routinely performed to collect endometrial samples for diagnostic purposes, for example, in women with abnormal menstrual bleeding. It is a well-tolerated procedure with a proven safety profile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>In 2000 it was first reported in a retrospective study that 11 of 12 women who had undergone a series of investigational endometrial biopsies conceived in their subsequent IVF cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. A prospective non-randomised study by the same research group reported that women allocated to endometrial biopsy in the cycle prior to IVF cycle were twice as likely to conceive as women who had not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Several studies have since investigated the apparent beneficial effect of endometrial injury in IVF cycles, and although there is substantial heterogeneity in the study designs and participant populations, a recent Cochrane review including randomised controlled trials (RCTs) reports an increase in the probability of pregnancy and live birth following endometrial sampling in the cycle preceding embryo transfer (RR&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.34, 95&#x000a0;% CI 1.21&#x02013;1.61 and RR&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.42, 95&#x000a0;% CI 1.08&#x02013;1.85, respectively) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Other reviews and meta-analyses which have included both RCTs and non-randomised studies have similar conclusions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The effect appears to be the most pronounced in women who have repeatedly failed to achieve a pregnancy after multiple embryo transfers, that is, women with recurrent implantation failure (RIF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Note that in the only study where endometrial injury was performed on the day of oocyte retrieval, a detrimental effect on pregnancy rate was observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>Almost all of the RCTs assessing endometrial injury are associated with significant limitations that place them at a high risk of bias, which is known to be associated with exaggerated effect estimates (such as lack of adequate blinding and allocation concealment, high rates of participant attrition), or raise questions regarding the generalisability of results (such as use of multiple embryo transfer policies or ovulation induction medications in couples with unexplained infertility, timing of endometrial injury, and the device used for causing endometrial injury). Another common issue in a number of the studies is the potential exposure of the control group to unintentional endometrial injury resulting from a placebo procedure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] or a co-intervention such as hysteroscopy, either prior to study enrolment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] or simultaneously with the study procedure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Finally, only a small proportion of the studies reported live birth, arguably the most important outcome for both clinicians and subfertile couples.</p><p>The mechanism by which endometrial injury may increase the probability of conception has been the topic of a number of studies and speculations, and is extensively summarised in recent reviews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The most frequently cited theory is that of inflammation. Endometrial scratching has been shown to induce an inflammatory response in the endometrium, which is believed to mediate the dialogue between the endometrium and the blastocyst and facilitate the process of implantation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The resultant inflammatory response involves the production of inflammatory cytokines and subsequent recruitment of macrophages and other immune cells, factors known to be present during the window of implantation. This hypothesis is supported by repeat biopsy studies, in which women who had undergone a second biopsy had increased levels of cytokines such as TNF-&#x003b1; and MIP-1B, and other molecules known to be associated with implantation, such as osteopontin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. It is possible that endometrial injury may also be beneficial in women with unexplained infertility or polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) who are trying to conceive from sexual intercourse; conditions of infertility in which poor endometrial receptivity has been implicated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p>Due to the generally poor quality of the published studies and a lack of a clear understanding regarding the underlying mechanism of effect, the reproductive benefit of endometrial injury remains controversial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. This protocol describes studies to be undertaken in three separate groups of women in whom inadequate endometrial receptivity may be partly responsible for the experienced infertility: unexplained infertility, PCOS and women undergoing embryo transfer as part of an IVF/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) cycle.</p><p>Endometrial biopsy is a simple, cheap and well-tolerated procedure which can be performed without anaesthetic in the out-patient setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Endometrial biopsy may be a cost-effective method for increasing the probability of pregnancy and live birth in women or couples who are undergoing IVF or who are trying to conceive naturally or with ovulation induction.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Research questions</title><p>The Pipelle for Pregnancy (PIP) studies will evaluate whether endometrial injury delivered by an endometrial pipelle biopsy procedure increases the probability of live birth in<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Women undergoing autologous embryo transfer; a fresh transfer as part of an IVF cycle or a frozen-thaw embryo transfer (PIP-IVF)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Couples with unexplained infertility attempting to conceive spontaneously (PIP-UE)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Couples with subfertility associated with polycystic ovarian syndrome who are on ovulation induction medication and trying to conceive (PIP-PCOS).</p></list-item></list></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Methods/design</title><p>The PIP studies are pragmatic, parallel, multi-centre, superiority RCTs.</p><p>The pragmatic nature of the studies is a result of the broad inclusion criteria, time frame in which the intervention is administered and lack of restriction to specific stimulation or ovulation induction protocols.

Only participants who meet the eligibility criteria can be randomised. In instances where computer or Internet access is not reliable, participants will be randomised using sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes. Dedicated PIP study personnel will be responsible for randomising participants at each site.

For example, in participants scheduled for a long course buserelin cycle, randomisation will ideally take place on day one of the cycle, 21&#x000a0;days before down-regulation begins. Women will be informed of their allocation immediately after randomisation. Women randomised to the procedure group will be scheduled to undergo an endometrial biopsy procedure between day three of the cycle preceding embryo transfer and the third day of the embryo transfer cycle. Day one of the embryo transfer cycle is defined as either the day before the first day of controlled ovarian stimulation or day one of a menstrual period/withdrawal bleed for frozen-thaw embryo transfer cycles.</p><p>The large window of opportunity to perform the endometrial biopsy procedure is based on results from previous studies. Endometrial injury has been reported to have a beneficial effect as early as the menstrual period of the cycle preceding embryo transfer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], and as late as the menstrual period following down-regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. This flexibility is also in keeping with the pragmatic nature of these studies.</p></sec><sec id="d30e1280"><title>PIP-PCOS and PIP-UE</title><p>Women who are eligible for PIP-UE or PIP-PCOS will be scheduled for the procedure between days one and 12 of a menstrual cycle (PIP-UE) or ovulation induction cycle (PIP-PCOS). The women will be randomised once they arrive at the clinic, allocating them to either undergo the endometrial biopsy or a sham procedure (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).</p><p>The rationale behind timing the study procedure during the follicular phase of the cycle is threefold. Firstly, there is some concern that performing an intrauterine procedure in the luteal phase may disrupt a newly implanted embryo and therefore reduce the chance of pregnancy. Secondly, women would need to be asked to avoid conceiving during the pipelle biopsy cycle, and this would reduce the women&#x02019;s overall opportunity to conceive. Lastly, it is thought that the endometrial biopsy procedure may be less uncomfortable and less likely to be abandoned due to inability to pass the pipelle if performed during the menstrual period, as the cervical canal is slightly more open. This is despite suggestion that endometrial injury induced decidulisation is more prominent in the luteal phase of the cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].</p><p>The similarities and differences between the three PIP studies are outlined in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>.<table-wrap id="Tab3"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Comparison of the design of the three PIP studies</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th>PIP-IVF</th><th>PIP-UE</th><th>PIP-PCOS</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Standard care</td><td>IVF/ICSI/embryo transfer</td><td>No treatment</td><td>Ovulation induction medication (metformin, clomiphene,</td></tr><tr><td>Method of attempted conception</td><td>IVF/ICSI/embryo transfer</td><td>Intercourse</td><td>Intercourse</td></tr><tr><td>Randomisation timing</td><td>Approx. day 1 of cycle prior to treatment cycle</td><td>Immediately prior to the intervention</td><td>Immediately prior to the intervention</td></tr><tr><td>Intervention</td><td>Endometrial scratching by pipelle</td><td>Endometrial scratching by pipelle</td><td>Endometrial scratching by pipelle</td></tr><tr><td>Control group</td><td>No procedure</td><td>Placebo procedure</td><td>Placebo procedure</td></tr><tr><td>Intervention timing</td><td>Between day of the cycle prior to IVF, until day 3 of the IVF cycle</td><td>Between days 1&#x02013;12 of the first study cycle</td><td>Between days 1&#x02013;12 of the first study cycle</td></tr><tr><td>Blinding</td><td>Open label</td><td>Single-blind (participants are blind)</td><td>Single-blind (participants are blind)</td></tr><tr><td>Number of study cycles/opportunities to conceive</td><td>One</td><td>Three</td><td>Three</td></tr><tr><td>Study diary</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Study procedures</title><p>A gynaecologist or trainee gynaecologist with experience in performing endometrial biopsies will undertake the endometrial biopsy and placebo procedures.

The biopsy catheter will be inserted through the cervix up to the fundus. A tenaculum may be placed on the anterior lip of the cervix to help straighten the internal os to aid delivery. The internal piston is withdrawn to create negative pressure. The catheter is advanced to the fundus and then moved back and forth four times, rotating 90 degrees each time, to collect the biopsy (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The catheter is then removed followed by the speculum. The catheter containing the biopsy sample is then discarded unless the endometrial sample is required for another purpose.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>The endometrial biopsy procedure.

The procedure is to be abandoned at the participants&#x02019; request &#x02014; for example, due to pain or discomfort &#x02014; or if the operator is unable to pass the pipelle. These participants will be retained in the group denominator as per intention-to-treat principles.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Placebo procedure</title><p>In PIP-PCOS and PIP-UE, women in the control arm of the trial will undergo a placebo procedure which is designed to blind participants to their allocation. If couples who are attempting to conceive with sexual intercourse are aware of their study allocation, they may purposely or inadvertently influence their pregnancy outcome through behavioural changes, such as a change in sexual frequency or timing.</p><p>For the placebo procedure the women will lie in the dorsal or lithotomy position and a speculum will be inserted into the vagina. The biopsy catheter will be placed at the posterior fornix but not inserted into the external os of the cervix. The internal piston is withdrawn and the catheter moved and rotated slightly to replicate the standard biopsy action. The catheter is then removed, followed by the speculum. The catheter is then discarded.</p><p>Participants randomised to the control group in PIP-IVF will not undergo any procedure that is additional to standard care.</p><p>Shortly following the procedure and before leaving the clinic, participants will be asked to record the pain they experienced during the procedure on a 10&#x000a0;cm VAS. Participants will also be handed an information leaflet detailing what to expect following an endometrial biopsy, and told to seek medical attention and contact the study coordinator if they experience any adverse events that are potentially associated with the procedure, for example, heavy bleeding or signs of infection such as foul smelling discharge.</p><p>In PIP-IVF, participants will be contacted within one week of the procedure and asked to report whether they had any vaginal bleeding the day following the procedure. Women in PIP-PCOS and PIP-UE will be asked to complete a study diary for the three study cycles. In this diary they will record the date of the procedure, whether they had any vaginal bleeding the day following the procedure, each day that they have their period and each time they have sexual intercourse during the on-study period. Women will continue to complete the study diary until their third period following the procedure or until confirmation of a clinical pregnancy (that is, all patients have three cycles or opportunities for conception within the on-study period). Participants should be contacted at least once a month to check in and ensure they are completing the study diary and to provide an opportunity to identify any protocol violations.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Assessment of participant blinding</title><p>The sham procedure employed in PIP-UE and PIP-PCOS is designed to blind participants to their randomisation allocation. The sham procedure involves placing the pipelle in the posterior fornix and not inserting it through the cervix or into the womb, and hence it is expected to cause less pain on average than the interventional procedure. Although participants may not know how much pain to expect from either procedure, some participants may have prior expectations regarding the anticipated degree of pain from either procedure, and this may reduce the efficacy of the blinding. For example, women may have had previous intrauterine procedures or read information about endometrial biopsy on the Internet.</p><p>To assess whether participants in PIP-PCOS and PIP-UE are truly blinded to their study allocation, they will be asked to guess their study allocation (from the options of: pipelle procedure, placebo procedure or don&#x02019;t know) and to supply a reason to support their guess. Participants will be randomised a second time following the procedure to either the &#x02018;ask early&#x02019; group or the &#x02018;ask late&#x02019; group. The &#x02018;ask early&#x02019; group will be asked to guess their allocation within one week of the procedure, and the &#x02018;ask late&#x02019; group will be asked to guess their allocation at the end of the study (that is, when the participant knows whether or not they have fallen pregnant in the study). Participants randomised to early will also be asked to guess again at the end of the study, to assess whether there are changes in response over time. Participants will be informed of their allocation after they guess their allocation at the end of the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>On-study period (study duration)</title><sec id="Sec19"><title>&#x0115f;</title><sec id="d30e1493"><title>PIP-IVF</title><p>Women in PIP-IVF who undergo embryo transfer are usually scheduled for a serum human chorionic gonadotrophin test to confirm pregnancy approximately two weeks following embryo transfer (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

Additionally, due to concern regarding the possible influence of endometrial disturbance on the implantation site of an embryo, the location of the placenta will be recorded following live birth.</p><p>Participants will be asked to report any other adverse events to the study coordinator when they occur; these will not be actively recorded. All adverse events that occur during the study period will be documented on a designated data form. It should be noted that endometrial biopsy is a safe and well-tolerated procedure which is routinely performed in women in whom uterine pathology is suspected, for example, women with menorrhagia. Adverse events and complications related to this procedure include infection, haemorrhage and perforation of the uterus, but these are rare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec32"><title>Data collection</title><p>Data will be entered and stored electronically on the secure online PIP studies data collection and randomisation system. This database has inbuilt logical and validation, such that only impossible values are not allowed and to avoid cases of missing data where it is not applicable. Some information will be retrieved from source documents such as patient notes, and other clinical information may be entered directly into the PIP database. Individual logins will be issued to each person, and individuals will only have access to data regarding participants who are recruited at their clinic.</p><p>Researcher assistants, doctors and nurses involved in the PIP study will be responsible for the data collection at each site. Study data will be collected at numerous time points during the study journey (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Data may be collected directly for the purposes of the study, for example, the pain score as measured following the procedure or the intercourse frequency as recorded in the diary, or indirectly via the patient records which are routinely recorded for their treatment purposes (for example, date of embryo transfer).</p></sec><sec id="Sec33"><title>Data storage</title><p>The PIP database is hosted by the University of Auckland, and will run on a dedicated server at the University of Auckland server farm, behind firewalls with daily backup and 128-bit SSL encryption. The University of Auckland will retain ownership of the PIP studies trial data. Data will be stored securely on the PIP database for 10&#x000a0;years following the completion of the study, after which time it will be disposed.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec34"><title>Discussion</title><p>IVF is the leading treatment for subfertility; however, the success rate remains modest at approximately 30&#x000a0;% per cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Endometrial scratching is currently being suggested as a technique to improve the probability of embryo implantation and therefore pregnancy in women undergoing IVF. However, due to the potential for bias associated with many of the available studies, the presence of a therapeutic effect remains uncertain.</p><p>The PIP trials are designed to address the gaps in the utility of endometrial scratching as a treatment for subfertility in three different populations. If the beneficial effect of this intervention can be confirmed in these settings, endometrial scratching will provide a cost-effective method for helping women and couples to conceive. On the other hand, if endometrial scratching is found to have no effect, or to be detrimental to the probability of conception, the use of this procedure can be abandoned amongst the clinics and doctors who are recommending this procedure to their patients.</p><sec id="Sec35"><title>Trial status</title><p>Ongoing (recruitment commenced June 2014).</p></sec></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>CI</term><def><p>confidence interval</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FSH</term><def><p>follicle-stimulating hormone</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICSI</term><def><p>intracytoplasmic sperm injection</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IUI</term><def><p>intrauterine insemination</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IVF</term><def><p>in vitro fertilisation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PCOS</term><def><p>polycystic ovarian syndrome</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PIP</term><def><p>Pipelle for Pregnancy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RIF</term><def><p>recurrent implantation failure</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>UE</term><def><p>unexplained infertility</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VAS</term><def><p>visual analogue scale</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>SL and CF conceived the idea for the PIP studies.
