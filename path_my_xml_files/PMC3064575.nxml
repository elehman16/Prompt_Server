HIV necessitate strategies to improve vaccine efficacy.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A randomized, multi-centered, controlled, vaccine trial with three parallel
groups was conducted at 12 CIHR Canadian HIV Trials Network sites. Three
dosing strategies were used in HIV infected adults (18 to 60 years): two
standard doses over 28 days, two double doses over 28 days and a single
standard dose of influenza vaccine, administered prior to the 2008 influenza
season. A trivalent killed split non-adjuvanted influenza vaccine
(Fluviral&#x02122;) was used. Serum hemagglutinin inhibition (HAI) activity
for the three influenza strains in the vaccine was measured to assess
immunogenicity.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>297 of 298 participants received at least one injection. Baseline CD4 (median
470 cells/&#x000b5;L) and HIV RNA (76% of patients with viral load
&#x0003c;50 copies/mL) were similar between groups. 89% were on HAART. The
overall immunogenicity of influenza vaccine across time points and the three
influenza strains assessed was poor (Range HAI
&#x02265;40&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;31&#x02013;58%). Double dose plus double
dose booster slightly increased the proportion achieving HAI titre doubling
from baseline for A/Brisbane and B/Florida at weeks 4, 8 and 20 compared to
standard vaccine dose. Increased immunogenicity with increased antigen dose
and booster dosing was most apparent in participants with unsuppressed HIV
RNA at baseline. None of 8 serious adverse events were thought to be
immunization-related.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Even with increased antigen dose and booster dosing, non-adjuvanted influenza
vaccine immunogenicity is poor in HIV infected individuals. Alternative
influenza vaccines are required in this hyporesponsive population.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00764998">NCT00764998</ext-link>

groups was conducted. HIV-infected volunteers, in otherwise stable health, aged
18 to 60 years, were recruited at twelve Canadian Institutes of Health Research
Canadian HIV Clinical Trials Network sites located across Canada (see
Acknowledgements for list of contributing sites). Enrolment began following
research ethics approval obtained at each individual site. Informed, written
consent was obtained from each participant. Exclusion criteria included: receipt
or anticipated requirement of blood products, vaccine, or immunoglobulin
preparation within one month of study vaccine administration until completion of
study, use of immunosuppressive therapy or immune modulators, dialysis,
autoimmune disease, alcohol consumption &#x02265;4 drinks per day, history of cancer
with the exception of cutaneous cancers including Kaposi Sarcoma, basal cell
carcinoma and non-invasive HPV-related malignancy, known or suspected
hypersensitivity to any component of the study vaccines, including chicken eggs
or egg products and Thimerosol, history of immediate hypersensitivity reaction
and/or reaction resulting in neurological symptoms to a previous dose of any
influenza vaccine, or presentation with or any recent history (within 24 hours)
of any febrile illness (&#x0003e;38&#x000b0;C) or symptoms of significant local or
systemic infection. There were no exclusion criteria for antiretroviral use, HIV
viral load or CD4 T lymphocyte count.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Vaccine, Dosing and Immunogenicity Testing</title><p>The vaccine used was the 2008 seasonal trivalent killed split non-adjuvanted
influenza vaccine (Fluviral&#x02122;, GSK, Laval, Canada) containing
A/Brisbane/59/2007 (H1N1), A/Uruguay/716/2007 (H3N2), and B/Florida/4/2006.
Subjects recruited at each site were centrally randomized by the Canadian HIV
Trials Network to one of three groups. Participants and all study staff were
blinded to allocation, except for the individual who prepared the vaccine who
had no direct contact with study participants. Group 1 received one adult dose
of influenza vaccine (0.5 mL or 15 &#x000b5;g HA) between October 1st and November
15th 2008, followed by a booster influenza vaccine administered 28 days later.
Group 2 received one double dose of influenza vaccine (1.0 mL or 30 &#x000b5;g HA)
during the same interval, followed by a booster double dose of vaccine
administered 28 days later. Group 3 received a single adult dose (0.5 mL or 15
&#x000b5;g HA) of influenza vaccine. Placebo injections were not utilized in this
study. Randomization was stratified by CD4 T lymphocyte count (&#x0003c;200
cells/&#x000b5;L versus &#x02265;200 cells/&#x000b5;L).</p><p>Blood samples were centrifuged and the sera from each were aliquoted into vials
(minimum 2.0 ml/vial) for frozen storage at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C. Once all study
specimens were collected, three sets of aliquots of each serum sample were
transported frozen to the laboratory (GB) for hemagglutination inhibition (HAI)
titre evaluation. HAI titres were measured according to WHO standard
protocol.<xref rid="pone.0017758-WHO1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>
Briefly, non-specific inhibitors were removed from serum by overnight treatment
with receptor destroying enzyme (Denka Seiken, Tokyo, Japan). Physiologic saline
solution was then added to achieve a 1&#x02236;10 dilution, followed by incubation
with packed guinea pig red blood cells (GRBC) (Lampire Biological Laboratories
Inc., Pipersville, PA) at 4&#x000b0;C for 60 min to remove non-specific agglutinins.
Treated serum was serially diluted in 25 &#x000b5;l of PBS and then mixed with an
equal volume of PBS containing 4 hemagglutinin units of A/Brisbane/59/2007
(H1N1), A/Uruguay/716/2007 (H3N2) or B/Florida/4/2006 viruses. After 30 min of
incubation at room temperature, 50 &#x000b5;l of 1% GRBC solution was added
to the mixture and incubated for 45&#x02013;60 min before evaluation of
hemagglutination. The HAI titer was recorded as the reciprocal of the last
dilution that inhibited hemagglutination.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Flu-like Illness</title><p>All subjects developing febrile respiratory syndromes during the 20-week period
following initial influenza vaccination were asked to report to clinic for
assessment. A respiratory illness symptom diary was also provided to capture
events. Respiratory infections were defined as a temperature &#x0003e;38.0&#x000b0;C
associated with any one or more of the following clinical symptoms:
feverishness/chills; cough; tachypnea/dyspnea; wheezing/stridor; rhinorrhea;
sore throat; myalgias. An in-house real-time multiplex reverse-transcriptase PCR
assay was utilized to identify influenza in those who presented while
symptomatic.<xref rid="pone.0017758-Boivin1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>
</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Adverse Events</title><p>All subjects were observed at the site clinic for 15 minutes following each study
vaccination to monitor for anaphylactic reactions, as well as for any other
local and/or systemic reactions, to the vaccine. Subjects were then provided
with, and instructed how to use, a thermometer, a transparent ruler and a diary
to continue to monitor for any local and/or systemic reactions to the vaccine
for 7 days following the study vaccination. Subjects were asked to record their
temperature (&#x000b0;C), any redness or swelling at or near the injection site
(mm), the severity of symptoms: pain (at or near the injection site), malaise,
headache, fatigue (none, mild, moderate, severe), and any other adverse events.
They were also asked to contact the clinic if they were experiencing a fever. A
new diary was provided at each study visit to record any events that occurred
during the time before the next visit.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>The primary objective was to compare the immunogenicity of each of the two novel
vaccination strategies with the traditional strategy of a single standard dose
for each of the three influenza strains. The proportion of subjects achieving
doubling of HAI titre from baseline at week 8 was selected as the primary
outcome given the anticipated potential for diminished immunogenicity in this
vaccine hyporesponsive population. Sample size calculations for this study were
based on the comparison of two independent proportions using a two-tailed &#x003b1;
of 0.05 and a (1-&#x003b2;) of 0.90. The control rate of doubling of titres was
estimated to be 50%, and it was hypothesized that the modified doses of
vaccine would improve the proportion of those doubling titre levels to
75%, an improvement of 25%.</p><p>As recommended by the Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products (CPMP) <xref rid="pone.0017758-CPMP1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, the
proportion achieving seroconversion (quadrupling of HAI titre from baseline) and
seroprotection (HAI titre &#x02265;40 and &#x02265;80 in those with baseline HAI titres
&#x02264;10) were assessed and compared by randomized group at weeks 4, 8, and 20.
These benchmarks are associated with high level protection from clinical illness
resulting from influenza infection. Seroconversion proportions over 40%
and seroprotection titres &#x02265;40 in 70% of recipients are standard
targets required for approval of seasonal influenza vaccines. Geometric mean
titres (GMT) at these time points and geometric mean ratios (GMR) with baseline
were calculated and compared between groups. As per protocol, two pair wise
comparisons were conducted for each outcome: 1) single dose plus booster versus
single dose only, and 2) double dose plus booster versus single dose only.
Proportions were compared using chi-square tests and GMT by t-tests. Missing
values were imputed for week 8 outcomes only as follows: if an outcome, e.g.
doubling of titres from baseline, was positive at weeks 4 and 20, it was
considered to be positive at week 8 as well. Otherwise, missing responses were
considered to be negative outcomes.</p><p>Multivariable logistic regression was used to explore the effects of key
potential predictors of immunogenicity outcomes. For each outcome, all variables
with p-values &#x0003c;0.15 in individual models controlling for treatment group were
entered into multivariable regression models.</p><p>Secondary outcomes included self-reported influenza-like illness and
PCR-confirmed influenza A and B identified from nasopharyngeal swab. The
original plan was to compare proportions between groups as for the titre
outcomes, but since the number of events was unexpectedly small, simple
descriptions were used instead. All analyses were done using SAS (Statistical
Analysis Software), Version 9.1.3.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Study Population and Disposition</title><p>Baseline characteristics were well balanced between groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0017758-t001">Table 1</xref>). The mean age was

(HAI titres &#x02264;10). Note that adjustment for important prognostic factors

immunogenicity in HIV seropositive individuals: the administration a booster vaccine
dose and the use of increased antigen dose.<xref rid="pone.0017758-Nichol1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> Current Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention guidelines do not recommend either practice.<xref rid="pone.0017758-Smith1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> However, the
studies on which these recommendations are based were conducted in the pre-HAART
era, evaluated small sample sizes, were not randomized and did not assess clinical
outcomes.<xref rid="pone.0017758-Miotti1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>,
<xref rid="pone.0017758-Iorio1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0017758-Anema1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> We evaluated HIV
patients representative of most clinical settings in the developed world.
Unfortunately, no clear, uniform and clinically significant benefit was identified
with either immunization strategy.</p><p>The use of a booster dose in our analysis, either with standard dose or double dose,
slightly improved immunogenicity with two of the three antigens evaluated compared
to a single, standard dose of vaccine. This was most clearly evident in those
without HIV RNA suppression at baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017758-g004">Figure 4</xref>). However, immunogenicity was
suboptimal, irrespective of dosing strategy. Our work suggests that booster dosing
with conventional influenza vaccine will not address the issue of poor
immunogenicity in this vaccine hyporesponsive population. Although compelling, we do
not believe that our results are robust enough to recommend booster dosing in those
without HIV RNA suppression.</p><p>There is little literature evaluating the efficacy of increased influenza vaccine
antigen dose in HIV infected patients. In a sentinel work, Kroon <italic>et
al</italic> evaluated the effect of double dose immunization in a cohort of HIV
infected patients and concluded that this strategy was ineffective in augmenting
antibody response.<xref rid="pone.0017758-Kroon1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> However, the comparison arm was not randomized, the
sample size was small, and the study was conducted in the pre-HAART period. As such,
the majority of participants were profoundly immune compromised. Therefore, the
results may not be applicable to current HIV populations in the developed world. The
majority of our study population was on antiretroviral therapy with virological
suppression and CD4 counts well over 200 cells/&#x000b5;L. Despite a small increase in
immunogenicity with administration of a double dose, our analysis is consistent with
the findings of Kroon <italic>et al.</italic> Although higher antigen doses could be
assessed, widespread use of an increased antigen dose would create vaccine supply
issues. Therefore, the feasibility of this strategy is questionable, even if
demonstrated to be effective.</p><p>Overall, the rates of HAI protection achieved by these strategies, assessed by
various CPMP benchmarks of success <xref rid="pone.0017758-CPMP1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, were disappointingly low in proportion and relatively
short-lived. Even with a lower benchmark of immunogenicity (i.e. two fold increase
in HAI titres), clear benefit was not detected. This speaks to the overall poor
immunogenicity of influenza vaccine in those with HIV infection. Our work suggests
that although increased antigen dosing may slightly increase immunogenicity four
weeks after immunization when utilizing conventional vaccines, this increase is
minimal. This finding is consistent with a recently published pandemic HIN1 study of
adult immune competent individuals in which the use of increased vaccine dose did
not improve measures of vaccine efficacy.<xref rid="pone.0017758-Greenberg1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> Other strategies, including
the use of vaccine adjuvants, should be evaluated in an effort to achieve more
substantive and long-lived success without the need for increased antigen dose.<xref rid="pone.0017758-Clark1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0017758-Cooper2" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>
</p><p>Several limitations are acknowledged. The small sample size likely influenced our
ability to fully evaluate the influence of several key variables on the primary
outcome measure. However, this was the largest randomized controlled trial of
influenza vaccine immunogenicity in HIV patients ever conducted. Because of the
relatively low incidence of influenza in Canada during the 2008&#x02013;2009 season,
insufficient cases were detected to allow for evaluation of the influences of
booster dosing or increased vaccine dose on burden of influenza infection. We did
not collect data on HIV RNA levels or CD4 T lymphocyte counts during the course of
the study. However, it was our judgment that the safety of trivalent split
non-adjuvanted influenza vaccine in the HIV population was already
well-established.<xref rid="pone.0017758-Malaspina1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0017758-Zanetti1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0017758-Ragni1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0017758-Redfield1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> CPMP criteria for immunogenicity have not been validated
in those living with HIV. However, it seemed reasonable to consider these well
accepted criteria for evaluating immunogenicity in addition to the utilization of a
lower HAI criteria (i.e. doubling of HAI titres).</p><p>Our work has demonstrated the safety of two alternate influenza vaccine strategies in
a HIV population including increased antigen dose and the use of booster dosing.
Although this study demonstrated a slight benefit with increased antigen dose
followed by booster dosing in achieving and maintaining seroprotective HAI titres in
this immune compromised population, the gain was minimal, inconsistent, and the
overall immunogenicity was poor. Other vaccine strategies, including the use of
adjuvants, are currently under evaluation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0017758.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>
