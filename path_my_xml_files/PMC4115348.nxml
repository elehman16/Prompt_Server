Due to side-effects of chemical drugs, there is growing trend toward herbal medicine. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of Dill compared to mefenamic acid on primary dysmenorrhea.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>This double-blind, randomized, clinical trial study was conducted on 75 single female students between 18 and 28 years old educating in Nursing and Midwifery School and Paramedical Faculty of Qom University of Medical Sciences of Iran in 2011. They were allocated randomly into one of the three groups: In Dill group, they took 1000 mg of Dill powder q12h for 5 days from 2 days before the beginning of menstruation for two cycles. Other groups received 250 mg mefenamic acid or 500 mg starch capsule as placebo, respectively. Dysmenorrhea severity was determined by a verbal multidimensional scoring system and a visual analog scale (VAS). Students with mild dysmenorrhea were excluded.

This provides the base of the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as inhibitors of cyclooxygenase enzymein treatment of primary dysmenorrhea.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] However, NSAIDs have different side-effects. For example, various gastrointestinal adverse effects such as nausea, diarrhea, dyspepsia, and also fatigue are reported with taking mefenamic acid.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Moreover, in some conditions such as gastrointestinal ulcers and bronchial hypersensitivity to aspirin, taking them is contraindicated.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] On the other hand, according to the results of some studies, 20-25% of women do not respond to current medicine.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] These problems lead to withdrawing of the chemical treatment and or using the gastric drugs. Consequently, they increasingly appeal to other treatments such as herbal medicine. The suppressive effects of some herbal drugs such as Dang-Qui-Shao-Yao-san, chamomile tea, <italic>Feonicurum vulgare</italic>, etc. on uterine contractions and their pain&#x02013;relief effects on dysmenorrhea have been reported in some studies.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p><italic>Anethum graveolens</italic> (Dill), from <italic>Apiaceae</italic> family, is a traditional herb that has various medical indications worldwide.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] It is cultivated in the most areas of the world and also widely in Khozestan, Khorasan, and Eastern Azerbaijan provinces of Iran.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] It is a 1 year plant with 30-100 cm length. Its fruit essence consists of carveol, d-Carvone, d-hydrocarveol, dihydrocarvone, limonene, carvacrol thymol, etc.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] its seeds have 3-3.5% essential oil and are used for treatment of stomach illnesses, food digestion, stopping hiccup, flowing of milk in nursing mothers, relieving of pain and as anticonvulsant and antivomiting.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] We found no controlled research of effect of Dill in primary dysmenorrhea. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of Dill seeds on pain severity of primary dysmenorrhea and to compare it with mefenamic acid and placebo.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>After initial approving by the vice chancellor for research of Qom University of Medical Sciences, complete explanations were given to the participants and informed consent form was taken. This double-blind, randomized study was conducted among 75 female students between 18 and 28 years old. Entry criteria were being single and educating in Nursing and Midwifery School and Paramedical Faculty of Qom University of Medical Sciences in 2011 (Qom city is almost situated in the center of Iran with about 150 km<sup>2</sup> distance from Tehran [metropolis of Iran]). In the beginning of the study, a complete history was taken and the secondary dysmenorrhea was ruled out. Patients with the history of pelvic or organic disorders, any known gastrointestinal or urogenital or hematological or other systems disorders, irregularity of menstrual cycles, taking any drug, and previous sensitivity to NSAIDs or Dill and or mild dysmenorrheal were not included.</p><p>The participants were allocated randomly into one of the following groups: In the first group, the patients were treated by Dill capsules containing 500 mg of powder of Dill seed in which two capsules orally q12h (totally 1000 mg q12h) and in the second group by 250 mg mefenamic acid capsule orally q12h and in the third group by starch as placebo (the same company) 500 mg q12h, since 2 days before the beginning of their menstruation for 5 days. All of the capsules were made by Boo Ali Research Center of Qom city and were completely similar in shape. In regarding the blinding process, the researchers and the participants were uninformed of allocating manner of each group and a third one that did not involve in analyzing and interpreting, etc., allocated the participants in groups and allotted a code number to everyone. The capsules were been delivered to the subjects 1-week before beginning the menstruation bleeding and during the study. The researchers were following the participants throughout the study in view of regular taking the capsules. The subjects were followed for two cycles (2 months) and were asked to answer to the questionnaires at the end of every cycle.</p><p>The participants filled a two part questionnaire at the beginning of study, including demographic characteristics in the first part (such as age, height, weight, etc.) and menstrual characteristics in the second part (such as menarche age, duration of menses, interval of cycles, etc.).[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] The severity of dysmenorrhea was assessed by a verbal multidimensional scoring (VMS) system and by a visual analog scale (VAS). VMS that has been used in various previous studies[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] has four grades:</p><p>Grade 0: Menstruation with no influence on daily activities or use of analgesics</p><p>Grade 1: Menstruation with mild pain but rare influence on daily activities or use of analgesics</p><p>Grade 2: Menstruation with moderate pain with influence on daily activities and perpetuity need to analgesics,</p><p>Grade 3: Menstruation with severe pain with significant limitations on daily activities and ineffective use of analgesics and vegetative symptoms as headache, nausea, vomiting, tiredness, and diarrhea.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>According to the 10-point VAS, mild dysmenorrhea was defined as score of 0-3, moderate as score of 4-7 and severe as score of 8-10.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Women with mild dysmenorrhea (score of 0-3) were excluded from this study.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] They also answered to the questionnaires at the end of the first and the 2<sup>nd</sup> months of treatment. These questionnaires had questions about changes of the menstrual cycle due to taking capsules or special events, etc.</p><p>Of 75 participants of this study, five of them did not continue the study due to fearing of its side-effects; therefore we evaluated 70 students [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. Data are presented as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation and frequencies. Severity of pain was compared within groups with paired-samples <italic>t</italic>-test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test and between groups with Mann-Whitney test and Kruskal-Wallis test in SPSS 18 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, U.S.A.). <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Patients progress through the trial: Consolidated standards of reporting trials flowchart</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JRMS-19-326-g001"/></fig><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Ethical considerations</title><p>The vice chancellor of Qom University of Medical Sciences approved the study.

Characteristics of students are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>. There was no significant difference between three groups for demographic or descriptive variables. Comparison of pain severity in the three groups before and after treatment showed that before treatment, 2.9% of participants of Group 1 (Dill) and 7.1% of Group 2 (mefenamic acid) were complaint of menstruation with severe pain with significant limitations on daily activities that was not responding to analgesics, but after treatment, this rate reached to 1.4% and 0%, respectively in this two groups [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>].</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Characteristics of the participants</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JRMS-19-326-g002"/></table-wrap><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Severity of dysmenorrhea assessed by VMS in three groups of study before and after treatment</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JRMS-19-326-g003"/></table-wrap><p>In comparison of VAS, before and after treatment, paired-sample <italic>t</italic>-test showed that in Group 1 (Dill), the subjects had lower significant pain in the 1<sup>st</sup> and the 2<sup>nd</sup> months after treatment than before it (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001).

These differences between three groups were statistically nonsignificant (<italic>P</italic> = 0.621).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec1-4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this double-blind randomized study, it was demonstrated that Dill can be as effective as mefenamic acid in decreasing the pain severity of primary dysmenorrhea. The results are in agreement with the results of Mohammadinia <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Furthermore, Our findings are similar to those of Gharib Naseri <italic>et al</italic>. that investigated the effects of 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 8 mg/kg of Dill fruit hydroalcoholic extract (DFHE) on virgin rat uterus contractions induced by KCl (60 mM) and oxytocin (10 mU/m1).[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] In their study, in the presence of calcium, DFHE increased contractions, but in the absence of calcium, the contractions induced by oxytocin was weaker than KCL. Furthermore, Garib Naseri and Heidari explored the effects of 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 mg DFHE on rat ileum contractions and found that DFHE has dose-dependently spasmolytic effect on the KCl-, acetylcholine and BaCl<sub>2</sub> -induced contractions of ileum.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Also, our study results are in agreement with those of Iravani that found that branches of thyme such as Dill can decrease the severity of dysmenorrhea due to having tannin.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</p><p>One of the main mechanisms of dysmenorrhea is increasing the production of PGs (mainly PGF2&#x003b1;) in the endometrium that resulted in myometrial contractions and primary dysmenorrhea.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Anti-PGs such as NSAIDs can inhibit cyclooxygenase two and therefore PGs synthesis and relieve primary dysmenorrhea pain.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] According to the conducted studies, Dill seeds have two main compounds include tannin and anethol that have sedative effects while increase the uterus contractions during and after child-bearing.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] Anethol that is the main compound of essential oils of many herbal plants is used in the curing of anxiety, gastrointestinal comforts, and different pains.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] Anethol in low dose, causes vasospasm through opening the voltage-dependent calcium channels but in high dose, relaxes the blood vessels.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] Gharib Naseri <italic>et al</italic>. believe that the relaxant effect of Dill on uterus contractions is due to closing the voltage-dependent calcium channels and also, indirectly, due to calcium-releasing disorders from intracellular pool.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] it is suggested that &#x003b1;- and B-adrenoceptors, opioid receptors and no production are not involved in this inhibitory effect of DFHE on contractions.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] However, our findings do not support those of some studies.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] Ishikawa <italic>et al</italic>. and Mahdavian <italic>et al</italic>. found that aqueous extract of Dill fruit decreases postpartum hemorrhage through increasing the uterus contractions.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] Furthermore, Mansouri <italic>et al</italic>. found that the extract of Dill fruit induces the labor pains.[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] one possible explanation for these discrepancy is that the current study is done on nonpregnant uterus. Another possibility is that the compositions of seed and fruit of Dill are different. Hence, the accurate determination of the mechanisms needs to separate the constituent elements.</p><p>In view of side-effects, menstrual changes as increasing in amount and duration of bleeding and gastrointestinal discomfort were nonsignificantly reported in Dill group. Mohammadinia <italic>et al</italic>. also in comparing the effect of <italic>Anethum gravolens</italic> with mefenamic acid consumption on treatment of primary dysmenorrhea in students of Iranshahr reported nausea and dizziness in 6 students that were taken Dill.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</p><p>Mahdavian <italic>et al</italic>. (2001) in an investigation of effectiveness of oral Dill extracts on postpartum hemorrhage reported no side-effects in Dill recipients.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</p><p>We did not explore in this study the interactivity of Dill capsules with other drugs especially with NSAIDs and also its effects on other signs and symptoms of primary dysmenorrhea, so further research is recommended to assess them. Furthermore, because of all the participants were single, we did no pelvic examination for rule out organic pelvic disease and secondary dysmenorrhea. Hence, we were contented only to their history (age of beginning dysmenorrhea, history of lack of related disease, etc.).</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>This project was funded by Qom University of Medical Sciences (Iran).
