Patients were eligible if they had two or more hospital admissions with advanced liver disease related to complications of ascites, gastrointestinal haemorrhage, encephalopathy, hepatorenal failure, sepsis or progressive hepatocellular carcinoma. We excluded patients with an expected survival of under 1&#x02009;month, other conditions likely to cause death within 12&#x02009;months, persistent cognitive impairment (assessed with the 4AT screening tool<sup><xref rid="bibr21-0269216318760441" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>) or those who lived over 50&#x02009;miles from the recruitment site to make qualitative interviews at home feasible. We chose not to include patients on the transplant waiting list as they were already receiving care coordination from designated liver specialists. Patients nominated their main informal carer who was also invited to participate. Their general practitioner (GP) was recruited by letter.</p></sec><sec id="section10-0269216318760441"><title>The intervention</title><p>Two liver nurses with over 10&#x02009;years of liver nursing experience shared the role and delivered the intervention for 21&#x02009;h per week. In addition to completing a Good Clinical Practice in research course, they received specific training in palliative care consisting of an advanced communication topic workshop on talking about deteriorating health and opportunities to shadow palliative care staff working in hospital, hospices and the community. They also accompanied a heart failure nurse specialist on home visits. After an initial face-to-face assessment and care coordination meeting with the patients and their informal carers, the liver nurses provided supportive care mainly by telephone for up to 6&#x02009;months (alongside the patients&#x02019; usual care). The supportive care liver nurse specialist had three defined roles:</p><list list-type="bullet" id="list5-0269216318760441"><list-item><p><italic>Act as a case manager and coordinator</italic> liaising between patients/carers, health and social care professionals or services, and voluntary agencies;</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Support patients and informal carers to live as well as possible</italic> by offering information about the illness and its management including financial and social support, providing psychological support and empowering patients/carers to seek help;</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Support care delivered by professionals</italic> in the community through providing information and advice on the best practice (including integration of disease-focused treatments with supportive and palliative care) and facilitating anticipatory care planning through the use of the Scottish electronic summary care plan (<xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="boxed-text2-0269216318760441">Box 1</xref>).

Anonymity of patient/carer/professional data was assured by assigning each patient a number at recruitment, which was used on all documentation and retained securely. Health and care resource use was monitored for the duration of the intervention period; number of planned and patient/carer-initiated contacts with the nurse, number and duration of unplanned and elective hospital admissions, reason(s) for admission, hepatology outpatient visits, primary care team contacts, use of informal and formal support agencies, place and cause of death; time from recruitment to death. All correspondence and the clinical records of interactions with the nurses were documented, anonymised and analysed. Questionnaires for patients and family carers were presented in attractive, readable booklets and approved by our PPI group. The questionnaires were chosen on the basis of extensive use for previous research in palliative care populations, ease of completion to reduce participant burden, and to provide a spectrum of complementary measures that could be considered for suitability in a large trial. They were administered by the nurse at baseline after recruitment to the study and sent by post at 3 and 6&#x02009;months. Patients completed the Palliative care Outcome Scale (POS), which is a brief measure of palliative care service outcomes;<sup><xref rid="bibr22-0269216318760441" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> the EuroQol-5D-5L, which assesses quality of life and can inform economic evaluations;<sup><xref rid="bibr23-0269216318760441" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Score (HADS), to screen for anxiety and depression which are common psychological symptoms in people with advanced illness;<sup><xref rid="bibr24-0269216318760441" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> and the McGill Quality of Life questionnaire Part B, which invites participants to identify up to three troublesome physical symptoms or problems and rate their severity.<sup><xref rid="bibr25-0269216318760441" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> Family carers completed the POS Carer Score and the Caregiver Quality of Life questionnaire to assess the impact of the intervention on the carer experiences.<sup><xref rid="bibr26-0269216318760441" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> Qualitative interviews with a purposive sample of patients representing a range of aetiologies, demographics and care arrangements, their family carers and case-linked health and care professionals were conducted, using topic guides, by a female non-clinical researcher (B.K.).

Questionnaire data were analysed using SPSS for Windows version 19 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). Descriptive statistics were used for the sample characteristics and quality-of-life outcomes. Continuous measures were summarised using the mean and standard deviation where these were normally distributed data and, if not, using the median and the interquartile range. Categorical variables were summarised by the frequency in each category. Outcomes were compared between time points using repeated-measures one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) for normally distributed data and the Friedman test otherwise. Documentation generated by the nurses for each participant was reviewed systematically for type and content of interaction and resultant actions. Emerging findings were regularly discussed with the wider research team and the PPI group.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="section13-0269216318760441"><title>Results</title><sec id="section14-0269216318760441"><title>Feasibility of the intervention and evaluation</title><p>We recruited 47 patients over 46&#x02009;weeks from gastroenterology/hepatology inpatient wards and outpatient clinics, of whom 13 died or were lost to follow-up before starting the intervention; hence, 34 (72%) went on to receive the intervention (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0269216318760441">Figure 2</xref>). Patient characteristics are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269216318760441">Table 1</xref>.

Visiting the patient&#x02019;s home for this meeting was valued as it allowed the nurses to see people&#x02019;s living arrangements and gauge the person&#x02019;s support needs at home:
<disp-quote><p>We felt we were getting more answers, whereas in the hospital you feel as if it is, &#x02018;We&#x02019;re too busy, we&#x02019;ve got other patients, you&#x02019;re not the only patient, we&#x02019;ve got this patient to see&#x02019;.

Participants considered the frequency of the planned monthly calls by the nurse to be adequate. Some felt that they could manage with fewer or no calls as long as they had access to a designated telephone number to contact the nurses if needed. The monthly calls were considered particularly valuable to socially isolated patients:
<disp-quote><p>I think psychologically knowing that [the study nurses] were there if I needed them and the fact they were going to call me in a month anyway, that&#x02019;s probably helpful in itself.

<disp-quote><p>Interviewer: So would you have found having the sort of facility that the study nurses provided, having that earlier on, would that have been helpful or did it come at the right time?</p><p>Carer 46: No. I think even earlier on, because there was lots of questions, you don&#x02019;t get told everything.</p><p>I think maybe in person would be a better option rather than a phone call, because [&#x02026;] if you were seeing that person face-to-face on a regular basis and you get to know that person then you can sort of, you tend to open up a wee bit more. (Carer 30)</p></disp-quote></p><p>Professional suggestions related to alternative ways of engaging with the nurse and additional responsibilities for the role and explicitly suggesting a shared-care model with primary care:
<disp-quote><p>If they maybe had some clinical responsibilities then knowing these patients, going and seeing them, they should be able to say, &#x02018;Right, you need to go into hospital&#x02019;, and sort all that out and in a sense bypass us. So that might be an area where it might be able to be developed. (GP 42)</p><p>We&#x02019;ve got the renal advice service and we just ping off an email [&#x02026;] and usually that is replied to within 24 hours, so we can get an answer about what to do with complicated patients, without necessarily being on hold to a registrar who doesn&#x02019;t know them so well [&#x02026;]You don&#x02019;t want delays to happen if patients really need to be in hospital, but email would be one option, some kind of direct advice line would be great.

(GP 26)</p></disp-quote></p><p>The study nurses successfully case-managed several patients who had otherwise disengaged from routine services. Their involvement also resulted in more timely, planned and person-centred hospital admissions:
<disp-quote><p>[Study nurse] made [consultant] aware, the GI team aware, so we didn&#x02019;t have to hang about A&#x00026;E for a long time. They knew and came down almost immediately.

However, the nurses&#x02019; correspondence prompted 21 GPs to create a new anticipatory care plan, while 8 updated a patient&#x02019;s existing plan.

Improvements in care coordination were evident from the study nurses&#x02019; engagement with professionals across a range of settings, their key role in facilitating more efficient hospital admissions and the informational and relational continuity of care the role afforded to patients, carers and professionals. Care planning became proactive and routine instead of opportunistic, with a marked improvement in the number and timely completion and updating of electronic summary care plans.

The intervention lasted only 6&#x02009;months and this limited our ability to fully test the validity of some of the questionnaires. Collection of community health and care service use data was more challenging than measuring hospital resource use, but new national datasets are likely to increase access to these outcome measures in future.</p><p>This is the first feasibility trial of integrating a palliative care approach within the role of a liver nurse specialist. We were able to identify and recruit patients who benefitted from early integrated supportive care, without them or the professionals involved being deterred using the term &#x02018;palliative care&#x02019;, which for many people is still associated with imminent death. A frequently cited trial providing early palliative care in oncology judged that a full RCT is feasible if at least 50% of recruited patients participated in an initial care review meeting and completed the study questionnaires.<sup><xref rid="bibr36-0269216318760441" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> Using this criterion, our feasibility trial was successful; we achieved 64% participation, with no subsequent attrition except through death.</p><p>Evaluation of palliative care in an unpredictable and complex illness trajectory like liver disease is particularly challenging. Single index measures are unlikely to capture the breadth of important outcomes for patients, family carers, professionals and healthcare organisations.<sup><xref rid="bibr37-0269216318760441" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="bibr38-0269216318760441" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> Palliative care interventions typically support multiple dimensions of need, and thus measures to assess these are indicated. It is also known in palliative care that access to a service may be appreciated, even if the service is not utilised. A wider range of measures used longitudinally over the course of the illness trajectory should be considered. We used a mixed-method evaluation which provided valuable, multi-faceted outcome data over time. In liver disease, the rapid onset of potentially life-threatening complications means that it is important not to focus too narrowly on place of death as a primary outcome.</p></sec><sec id="section22-0269216318760441"><title>Recommendations for a future RCT</title><p>We have presented a set of outcome measures and completion rates that can inform sample size calculations for a controlled trial. Future inclusion criteria should be broadened to include a first admission with complications of cirrhosis. Multiple sites should be considered to optimise recruitment and generalisability. The next trial should seek randomisation to the intervention against continuation of current best practice.</p><p>Late recruitment to the study and challenges with securing follow-up interviews due to patients&#x02019; fluctuating health indicate that a future trial operating a 6-month intervention could consider reducing interviews to two time points &#x02013; baseline and 6&#x02009;months.</p><p>The POS and the EuroQol-5D-5L are recommended as outcome measures. Supporting patients to complete these by phone, app, video call or in person should be considered to improve return rates. If carer questionnaires are to be used, such individual support may also be required. Alternatively, qualitative methods might be more appropriate to gather information on carer perspectives. Resource utilisation and health economic data and process measures such as the number of advance/anticipatory care plans or electronic summary care plans generated should also be collected. The choice of analytical strategy to compare functional outcomes in RCTs with high mortality where outcomes are &#x02018;truncated due to death&#x02019; deserves special considerations.<sup><xref rid="bibr39-0269216318760441" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> Each statistical approach relies on certain assumptions, and analysis must be mindful of the possible effects of the treatment on mortality.</p><p>The trial intervention might include a greater emphasis on educating and supporting primary care professionals to provide holistic care for people with advanced liver disease as they reported a lack of knowledge and confidence.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="section23-0269216318760441"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Further studies assessing palliative care interventions for people with end-stage liver disease are needed.<sup><xref rid="bibr41-0269216318760441" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> This study provided valuable information to inform the design of a future RCT of a specialist supportive care nurse intervention to improve the care of people with advanced liver disease.
