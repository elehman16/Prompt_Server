This can be achieved only if the length of the root canal is determined accurately.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>Working length is defined as the distance from a coronal reference point to the point at which canal preparation and filling should terminate.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] A correct working length is a critical factor for the endodontic success. Failure to determine the proper root canal working length during root canal treatment may compromise the treatment result.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] To determine the working length, a number of techniques, including tactile sensation, radiographs, and electronic apex locators are routinely used in clinics.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Conventionally, conventional radiographs used to determine the working length which provides information about the canal anatomy and surrounding tissues.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Radiographs are advantageous as the information they furnish, cannot be obtained from any other source and its value is not diminished by a critical appraisal of its limitations.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] However, the accurate determination of root canal length radiographically is hindered due to anatomical variations, interference of anatomical structures, or errors in projection.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Super imposition, anatomy interferences, distortion, shortening and elongation, interpretation variability, and lack of three-dimensional representation affect the correct interpretation of the images.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>These factors have stimulated the development of electronic root length measuring devices (apex locators), which accurately report the foramen or more precisely an area between the minor and major foramen diameter.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>Numerous electronic apex locating devices have been introduced since the 1960s. In 1962, Sunada demonstrated that the electrical resistance between the periodontal ligament and oral mucosa has a constant value that can be measured. As a result, some devices were developed for use as clinical aids in apex location. However, many devices often performed unpredictably from patient to patient.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>The ROOT ZX (J. Morita Corp., Kyoto, Japan) has a high level of precision because of the introduction of the ratio method and the subsequent development of the self-calibration. Root ZX II which works with the same principle of the original Root ZX, which has been subjected to several studies showing a high level of reliability. Blood, electrolytes or other substances do not impair its reliability.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Root ZX mini also works according to the proven ratio technique as that of Root ZX and Root ZX II. This involves measuring the impedances of two frequencies (400 Hz and 8 kHz) to provide an absolutely precise length measurement.</p><p>Creation of a steady algorithm for adapting the method for measuring the working length of the root canal depending on the canal's moisture characteristic has been implemented in the apex locator of the so-called &#x0201c;sixth generation&#x0201d;&#x02013; the adaptive type RAYPEX-6.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>I-Root (S-Denti, Seoul, Korea) I-Root was developed and upgraded based on the technology of e-Magic finderapex locator which operates on dual frequency ratio based method.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>Romiapex A-15 (Romidan Ltd, Kiryat Ono, Israel) measure the working length by calculating the mean square root values of the impedance at two different frequencies (0.5 and 8.0 kHz), measured separately. The device compares the results obtained with reference values positions. Thus, the RomiApex A-15 operate by detecting the energy of the signal, rather than its amplitude.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>Sybron Endo's Mini Apex Locator, according to the manufacturers, despite its compact size, is rugged and durable. It uses a sophisticated, multifrequency measurement system, an all-digital signal and an 80% shorter cable than other apex locators. The manufacturer claims that this all adds up to increased signal integrity, easy operation, and consistently reliable measurements.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Electronic apex locators reduce the number of radiographs required and are recommended to complement and assist radiographic methods of working length determination.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Radiographic verification of electronic working length (EWL) is essential because in some clinical situations apex locators give incorrect readings.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] To achieve the highest degree of accuracy in working length determination, a combination of several methods should be used.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>The information regarding their accuracy in root canal length determination in multirooted teeth is limited. Therefore, the purpose of this clinical study was to compare and clinically evaluate the accuracy of six apex locators with intraoral periapical (IOPA) radiograph in multirooted teeth.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>The study was conducted in the Department of Conservative Dentistry and Endodontics. Ethical clearance was obtained from the Institutional Ethical Committee. Informed consent of each patient was obtained after explaining the clinical procedure.</p><p>Ninety multirooted teeth (maxillary and mandibular molars) with irreversible, infected or necrotic pulp tissue and completely formed roots were included in the study. Patients using cardiac pace makers, who had a contributory medical history and the teeth with no apical patency, radiographic evidence of resorption and bone loss were excluded from the study.</p><p>Tooth was anesthetized and isolated with a rubber dam. Endodontic access cavity was made, and a straight-line access to the root canals was achieved. The orifices of the root canals were irrigated with sodium hypochlorite solution and excess was removed from the pulp chamber by using cotton pellets. No attempt was made to clean debris or pulp tissue remnants before introducing K file.</p><p>Following the preparation of adequate access cavity, apex locator was used to determine the EWL.</p><p>Maxillary and mandibular multirooted teeth were randomly allocated to following study Groups. Group I: Working length determined with ROOT ZX II apex locator, Group II: Working length determined with Root ZX mini apex locator, Group III: Working length determined with the RAYPEX-6apex locator. Group IV: Working length determined with I-Root apex locator. Group V: Working length determined with Romiapex-A15 apex locator. Group VI: Working length determined with Sybron Endo mini apex locator.</p><p>Electronic measurements were made with instrument size selected according to the canal and the new file with firm silicone rubber stopper for every canal was used which was advanced till the apex locator indicated the apex or apical constriction has reached. The rubber stopper was set to the reference point when there was a stable reading for at least 5 s. The values were recorded with the file in the canal. Working length radiograph was taken using bisecting angle technique. Based on the position of the file tip to the radiographic apex on the IOPA radiograph, the samples were categorized using the following scoring criteria.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>

Moreover, modern apex locators can locate not only the apical foramen but also, in contrast to radiographic methods, the apical constriction, which is an optimal endpoint for root canal preparation and filling. The accuracy of apex locators is higher when compared with that of the radiographic methods.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>Nevertheless, it has been shown that a higher accuracy can be reached when both radiographic and EWL determination is performed. A working length radiograph after EWL determination can reduce over-instrumentation and provide valuable diagnostic information. Radiographic verification of the EWL is essential because in some clinical situations apex locators give incorrect readings.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>The method used in the present study accurately simulates the clinical condition, unlike previous works in which the treated teeth were later extracted, and the position of the file tip was then exposed.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] The method used in this study enabled a straightforward examination of the new electronic apex locator with conventional IOPA radiograph.</p><p>Multirooted teeth were selected for the study because the degree of apical foramen deviation is more in posterior teeth. It has also been reported that as the curvature of the apical part of the root increases, the chances for erroneous radiographic working length also increased. Palatal and mesiobuccal roots of maxillary molars were associated with the highest incidence of inaccurate radiographic working length compared with other roots <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>A conventional IOPA radiograph was used to evaluate the accuracy as a direct measurement on the radiographs has proven to be very accurate. This direct method was advocated on the premise that distortion and calculation errors are small enough to be of no practical consequence.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] An <italic>in vitro</italic> comparison of conventional and digital images showed that digital images resulted in an overestimation of the actual file length by 2.81%&#x02013;7.58%, whereas the same value for conventional images was only 1.13%.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] A radiograph is the only universally accepted, available and meaningful method of length adequacy assessment in the clinic.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Working length radiograph was taken using bisecting angle technique as it is the most common radiographic technique and the presence of a rubber dam, rubber dam clamp, and the root canal instruments may complicate by impairing proper receptor positioning and aiming cylinder angulations with paralleling technique.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] The radiographic working length produced by both paralleling and bisecting angle technique has been compared and concluded that comparable working lengths and the slightly better performance of the former would be clinically irrelevant.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>The performance of electronic apex locators has conventionally been afforded some latitude of acceptable error in locating the apex. An error tolerance of +/-1.0 mm is deemed clinically acceptable.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] In the present study, we have determined a clinical tolerance of 0-1 mm of the radiographic apex as the acceptable range.</p><p>The <italic>in vivo</italic> accuracy of apex locators ranges from a low of 15% to a high of 93.4% and as such cannot be relied on the sole mechanism for working length location. Contemporary units have degrees of accuracy that range from 83% to 93.4%. Hence, to achieve consistent success with this approach to working length determination, the astute clinician will integrate the use of instruments with high quality, standardized diagnostic radiographs.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>In the present study, accuracy of 97.8% was obtained using Root ZX II which is in accordance with the <italic>in vitro</italic> study producing values to a precision of 97.37%.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] The accuracy of Raypex 6 is 95.6% which is in accordance with study conducted by Aydin et al. with an accuracy of 88.2%.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] The accuracy obtained with Sybron Endo Mini apex locator was 73.3% which was comparable with that of the study conducted by Vasconcelos et al. in which the accuracy was 73.5%.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] The accuracy attained with Root ZX mini was 62.2% which is in accordance with that of the study conducted by da Silva et al. with an accuracy of 56.2%.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] According to the <italic>in vitro</italic> study by Sakkir et al. there is no statistically significant difference between I-Root and Root ZX II, which correlates with the present study wherein the accuracy obtained is 93.3% which is comparable with that of Root ZX II.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] The accuracy of Romiapex A-15 was 95.6% which is in accordance with the study comparing the accuracy of Root ZX II and Romiapex A-15 by Filho et al.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</p><p>In the present study, the accuracy of Root ZX mini and Sybron Endo mini was inferior when compared to other apex locators. Determination of apical constriction, associated with complete disruption of apical constriction, the shape of root canals and their configuration varies with different apex locators. This may be the reason for inaccurate readings with respect to Root ZX mini and Sybron Endo mini apex locators. Furthermore, electroconductivity of the dentine walls, the presence of apical ramifications may also influence the accuracy of EALs.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Root canal procedures should be limited within the confines of the root canal, with the logical endpoint for preparation and obturation being the narrowest part of the canal. Therefore, it is necessary to apply a rational thought in combining radiography and electronic devices to arrive at the desired apical terminus of the endodontic preparation and achieve the highest degree of accuracy in working length determination.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of
