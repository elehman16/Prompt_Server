Etiologically, urticaria may be classified as idiopathic (cause unknown), immunological (cause - autoimmune, IgE/contact, or immune complex-related), nonimmunological (cause - physical, drug-related, or dietary), and medical condition-related (urticaria pigmentosa, cryopyrin-associated, and periodic syndromes).[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] About 30&#x02013;50% of patients categorized as idiopathic urticaria have autoantibodies to IgE or Fc&#x003b5;RI&#x003b1; subunit of high-affinity mast cell receptors; these patients are said to have autoimmune urticaria.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Clinically, these patients have a propensity to have somewhat more severe, long-standing course and are refractory to conventional treatment, needing immunosuppressive agents.</p><p>Autologous serum skin test (ASST) has been found to be a useful screening test for autoimmune urticaria with sensitivity of 65&#x02013;81% and specificity of 71&#x02013;78%.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>For the widespread problem of CU refractory to antihistamines, the use of alternative, non-steroidal therapies is suitable and preferable, especially in the long term. Therefore, alternative therapies and immunosuppressive agents have been used in the management of CU, especially autoimmune urticaria. These therapies include dapsone, sulfasalazine, colchicine, and immunosuppressive agents such as mycophenolate mofetil, cyclosporine, and methotrexate.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] There have been no randomized controlled trials of azathioprine in autoimmune urticaria; we therefore studied its use in ASST positive cases of CU.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Setting</title><p>An outpatient dermatology department of a tertiary care hospital in eastern India.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Type of study</title><p>Single blind, randomized control study.

Patients in group A were administered azathioprine (50 mg/day) supplied in unlabeled paper envelopes for a period of 8 weeks and followed up for another 28 weeks, while patients in group B were given placebo pills, also supplied in similar packages, to be taken daily for 8 weeks. In addition, all the participating patients were directed to take levocetrizine (5 mg) on as and when basis for the entire study period (36 weeks) up to a maximum of 4 tablets/day (20 mg). The sequence of events is depicted in the flow chart [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>].</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Flowchart depicting the sequence of events in the study</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IDOJ-6-185-g002"/></fig><p>Thus, every patient was followed up every 4 weeks for a period of 36 weeks for the assessment of disease as well for monitoring of side effects, if any. In addition, patients in group A underwent baseline and monthly blood counts and liver function tests during the 8 weeks that they were on azathioprine. Patients in group B were unaware of this fact because they hardly ever came face to face as the number of patients studied per day was one or two. Furthermore, since no separate corner or room was reserved for the study, it was impossible for one patient to know what happened to another patient in the trial.</p><sec id="sec2-13"><title/><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Disease assessment</title><p>Urticaria was assessed by total severity score (TSS).[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Six separate parameters of disease activity and severity were recorded on scale of 0&#x02013;18 at baseline (0 week), and then every 4 weeks for a total period of 36 weeks.

The drug has been in use for more than three decades for indications such as immunobullous disease, atopic dermatitis, and other severe skin conditions.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Azathioprine is quickly and almost completely absorbed from the digestive tract. Serum levels attain a peak approximately 2 h after administration, and the half-life is roughly 5 h when active metabolites are taken into consideration.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] The mechanism of action is not fully understood. However, it has effects on DNA replication and the immune system. Azathioprine has been seen to impair gamma globulin synthesis and impair T-lymphocyte function and T-cell components such as interleukin-2.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] These are the probable mechanisms of action of azathioprine in chronic autoimmune urticaria. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea are the most common adverse effects. However, bone marrow suppression is a concern, and monthly complete blood cell counts are indicated.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>In the current study, we administered azathioprine at 50 mg/day to all patients above 12 years of age in the treatment group. In the control group, we had administered placebo pills supplied by the hospital pharmacy.</p><p>A follow up score of 0 was considered complete remission, a score of 1&#x02013;6 marked improvement, 6&#x02013;12 moderate improvement, and 13&#x02013;18 poor/no improvement.</p><p>Statistical analysis revealed that the patients who had received azathioprine for the initial eight weeks had significantly better suppression of symptoms than did the placebo group; this was true throughout the follow-up period. Thus, azathioprine not only had immunomodulatory properties during the treatment period, but also had lasting therapeutic effect as well. There were some gastrointestinal side effects in the initial stages of study, but no incidence of hematological or biochemical disturbances.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-6"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Among the immunosuppressive agents that have so far been used for CU, azathioprine is a novel agent. There are no previous reports of case&#x02013;control blinded studies regarding the usage of the drug for CU. Azathioprine was found to be effective in ASST positive CU in this study. It was more effective than placebo when given in conjunction with nonsedative antihistamines. The incidence of adverse effects was minimal. Thiopurine s-methyltransferase levels could not be estimated due to financial constraints. Other drawbacks of the study were a relatively small sample size, and low sensitivity and specificity of ASST (65&#x02013;81% and 71&#x02013;78% respectively)., It is imperative that azathioprine be put to more trials so as to confirm the results of the present study. It is hoped that it might eventually emerge as an effective drug in recalcitrant CU.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Grattan</surname><given-names>CH</given-names></name><name><surname>Sabroe</surname><given-names>RA</given-names></name><name><surname>Greaves</surname><given-names>MW</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Chronic urticaria</article-title><source>J Am Acad Dermatol</source><year>2002</year><volume>46</volume><fpage>645</fpage><lpage>57</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">12004303</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Deacock</surname><given-names>SJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>An approach to the patient with urticaria</article-title><source>Clin Exp Immunol</source><year>2008</year><volume>153</volume><fpage>151</fpage><lpage>61</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">18713139</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Greaves</surname><given-names>MW</given-names></name><name><surname>Kaplan</surname><given-names>AP</given-names></name></person-group><person-group person-group-type="editor"><name><surname>Greaves</surname><given-names>MW</given-names></name><name><surname>Kaplan</surname><given-names>AP</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Chronic urticaria: Autoimmune chronic urticaria and idiopathic chronic urticaria</article-title><source>Urticaria and angioedema</source><year>2004</year><edition>1st ed</edition><publisher-loc>Heidelberg</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Springer</publisher-name><fpage>321</fpage><lpage>41</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bajaj</surname><given-names>AK</given-names></name><name><surname>Saraswat</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Upadhyay</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Damisetty</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Dhar</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Autologous serum therapy in chronic urticaria: Old wine in a new bottle</article-title><source>Indian J Dermatol Venereol Leprol</source><year>2008</year><volume>74</volume><fpage>109</fpage><lpage>13</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">18388366</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Elion</surname><given-names>GB</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The george hitchings and gertrude elion lecture.
