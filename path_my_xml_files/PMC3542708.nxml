Backward inhibition (BI) is considered to be one of the purest measures of task set inhibition, and impaired BI has been linked to depressive rumination. BI was contrasted with Competitor Rule Suppression (CRS), which is another phenomenon observed in task switching, yet one which involves episodic memory tagging of information that is currently conflicting rather than active inhibition. Although similar at baseline level, a randomly assigned group (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;38) who underwent an eight session mindfulness training program exhibited improved BI but not CRS compared to a waiting list group (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;38). Findings indicate that mindfulness improves the specific component of task set inhibition, which has previously been linked to reduced rumination. Implications regarding the potential role of task set inhibition in mediating between mindfulness and reduced rumination, as well as the role of mindfulness in &#x0201c;being in the present moment&#x0201d; are discussed.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>mindfulness</kwd><kwd>backward inhibition</kwd><kwd>competitor rule suppression</kwd><kwd>task switching</kwd><kwd>mental set</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="3"/><table-count count="1"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="46"/><page-count count="9"/><word-count count="7983"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>In a changing environment, the ability to inhibit thoughts and actions which are no longer relevant is crucial for our everyday functioning and well being. Impairments in such inhibition may result in perseveration, being &#x0201c;stuck&#x0201d; in a certain way of thinking, and responding inappropriately rather than adhering to the current situation demands (Mayr and Keele, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">2000</xref>). Responding to a new situation or task requires deactivation of mindsets adopted in the recent past in favor of the currently relevant mindsets (see Koch et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">2010</xref>).</p><p>In this paper we propose that mindfulness practice is a method which may promote such inhibition. Mindfulness has been defined as &#x0201c;paying attention in a particular way: on purpose, in the present moment and non-judgmentally&#x0201d; (Kabat-Zinn, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">1994</xref>, p. 4). Although various definitions and conceptualizations have been proposed for mindfulness (see Chambers et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">2009</xref>; Chiesa and Malinowski, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">2011</xref>; Chiesa and Serretti, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">2011</xref>; Grossman and Van Dam, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">2011</xref>, for discussion), there is relative agreement that mindfulness involves both self regulation of attention to the present moment, and an orientation of openness and acceptance toward it. Such attendance to the present moment seems likely to involve inhibition of past thoughts and representations (Bishop et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">2004</xref>).</p><p>Inhibition has been proposed to be one of the three cognitive processes termed &#x0201c;executive functions,&#x0201d; with the other two being mental set shifting and information updating and monitoring (Miyake et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">2000</xref>). These functions are considered to enable the exertion of cognitive control and flexible adaptation, typically in novel or otherwise highly demanding contexts. Participants undergoing mindfulness training exhibited equivalent performance to control groups in a mental set shifting paradigm (Anderson et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">2007</xref>) and in an internal switching paradigm requiring both set shifting and working memory updating (Chambers et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">2008</xref>), yet outperformed controls on a multiple perspective images task requiring participants to switch between visual perspectives (Hodgins and Adair, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">2010</xref>). Studies which have addressed the relation between mindfulness and various processes which may involve the component of inhibition have yielded an even more mixed pattern of results (see Chiesa and Serretti, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">2011</xref>). People undergoing mindfulness training have been shown to exhibit superior performance relative to control groups on the Hayling task, requiring participants to complete sentences with unrelated and nonsensical words (Heeren et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">2009</xref>), verbal fluency (Heeren et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">2009</xref>; Zeidan et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">2010</xref>), tasks requiring participants to respond to an arrow pointing to either the same or opposite direction as flanking arrows (Hodgins and Adair, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">2010</xref>, in long term meditators; Tang et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">2007</xref>), and on the Einstellung water jar task, which examines the degree to which participants are able to identify and utilize simple and obvious solutions to problems following repeated experience with a long and complex solving method (Greenberg et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">2012</xref>). Conversely, no differences were found between mindfulness practitioners and control groups on other measures which may involve inhibitory processes, such as the GoStop paradigm (Heeren et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">2009</xref>), and the continuous performance task (Cusens et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">2010</xref>), both of which require participants to withhold their response whenever a certain signal appears. Additionally, findings regarding the effect of mindfulness on Stroop interference have yielded inconsistent results (see Anderson et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">2007</xref>; Chan and Woollacott, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">2007</xref>, in long term meditators; Josefsson and Broberg, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">2011</xref>, in long term meditators; van den Hurk et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">2010</xref>, in long term meditators; Wenk-Sormaz, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">2005</xref>).</p><p>The results described above make it difficult to draw clear conclusions regarding the relation between mindfulness and inhibition. One reason for this difficulty is the clear inconsistency of findings. More importantly, however, is that most if not all of the above findings may be explained by various non-inhibitory accounts such as episodic memory retrieval, persistent activation, resolution of conflict between various possible routes, and rule guided algorithmic processing (see MacLeod et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">2003</xref>; Neill, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">2007</xref>; Koch et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">2010</xref>). For example, while the Stroop effect has been linked to cognitive control and inhibition (Roelofs, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">2003</xref>) it has also been described as <italic>the</italic> paradigmatic example for automaticity (Tzelgov, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">1997</xref>).</p><p>In this paper, we focus on the relation between mindfulness practice and two measures related to task set suppression, which are both identified within the same task switching paradigm. An important advantage of the fact that the two measures are taken from the same paradigm is that whatever differences are found between them could not be attributed to superficial differences between paradigms. Critically, while one of the measures taps active online inhibition of information that has been relevant in the past but is no longer relevant, the other measure taps (mostly) episodic tagging of <italic>currently</italic> competing information. We will hereby briefly describe each of these measures.</p><p><italic>Backward Inhibition</italic> (BI, Mayr and Keele, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">2000</xref>), also referred to as <italic>n-2 repetition cost</italic> (Koch et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">2010</xref>), can only be assessed in paradigms involving switching between three or more tasks. When switching from Task A to Task B, Task A is thought to be inhibited. In this case, Task A-related information was relevant in the past, but now it is no longer relevant since Task B became relevant instead. Therefore, switching back to task A following its recent inhibition (A&#x02192;B&#x02192;A task sequence) should be more difficult than switching to task A without its recent inhibition (e.g., following a C&#x02192;B&#x02192;A task sequence) because of the residual active inhibition of Task A. The relative difference between sequences ABA and CBA in reaction time and/or accuracy is thought to reflect the degree to which Task Set A was actively inhibited in the previous trial (Mayr and Keele, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">2000</xref>; Koch et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">2010</xref>). As mentioned above, to date, the only account of the <italic>n</italic>-2 repetition cost is based on inhibition (Koch et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">2010</xref>). Therefore, examining the influence of mindfulness practice on BI is especially revealing in this respect. Moreover, BI indexes the inhibition of things that have been relevant in the recent past, presumably making it possible to focus on the current task. Thus, aside from being a pure measure of inhibition, unlike most of the other measures that have been used thus far, the type of inhibition tapped by BI (of previously relevant information) is especially relevant to mindfulness, due to its emphasis on focusing on the present moment.</p><p>Although, to our knowledge, the relation between BI and mindfulness practice has not been examined, we posit that it is likely that the two are positively related. Our reasoning is twofold. First, like BI, mindfulness has been claimed to involve inhibition of thoughts and representations that were relevant in the past but are no longer relevant (Bishop et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">2004</xref>). Impairments in task set inhibition (i.e., using no longer relevant task sets) may be taken as a form of being &#x0201c;stuck in the past&#x0201d; rather than attending to the present moment. A second reason for this assumed relation is that both mindfulness (Ramel et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">2004</xref>; Kingston et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">2007</xref>; Chambers et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">2008</xref>; Heeren et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">2009</xref>; Michalak et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">2011</xref>; Campbell et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">2012</xref>) and BI (Whitmer and Banich, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">2007</xref>; Whitmer and Gotlib, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">2012</xref>) have been linked to reductions in depressive rumination, thereby further implying a possible link between the two phenomena.</p><p>The second measure which we examined is <italic>Competitor Rule Suppression</italic> (CRS; Meiran et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">2011b</xref>). In order to explain CRS we must first explain the concept of a competing rule. A competing rule is a rule that generates a response that competes with the correct response. Take for example an experimental trial in which the relevant task rule is Gender (requiring a male-female decision) and indicating the right key as the correct response. Any task rule (such as Hair Color) that would implicate the left key as the correct response would thus be defined as &#x0201c;competing rule.&#x0201d; Suppression, according to this postulation, is evident if the previously competing rule becomes the relevant one in the following trial. Thus, CRS is computed by comparing performance (RT and accuracy) on trials in which the current task rule was a competing task rule in the previous trial with all other trial types, in which the current task rule was not the competing one in the previous trial (including trials in which another rule was competing). A recent study by Hsieh et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">2012</xref>) demonstrated that CRS is not primarily accounted for by residual active inhibition of competing rules. Instead, it seems to mostly reflect the tagging of currently conflicting rules as rules that should not be processed when storing the processing episode in memory. When the tagged rules become relevant in the following trial, they are retrieved with the &#x0201c;do-not-process&#x0201d; tag, thereby impairing performance. Thus, BI and CRS differ in two aspects. While BI reflects <italic>residual active inhibition</italic> that took place <italic>in the previous trial</italic>, CRS reflects &#x0201c;do-not-process&#x0201d; <italic>tagging</italic> of <italic>currently competing</italic> rules. Thus, while Both BI and CRS may be seen as phenomena promoting attendance to the present moment, they do so in a different way, with the former involving active inhibition, which has previously been linked to mindfulness (e.g., Bishop et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">2004</xref>), and the latter involving episodic memory tagging of currently competing information.</p><p>The aim of the current paper was to examine whether mindfulness specifically improves inhibition of no longer relevant mindsets. If so, participants undergoing a mindfulness training program should exhibit improved BI. If mindfulness practice involves tagging of past information as irrelevant in episodic memory rather than its inhibition, participants undergoing a mindfulness training program should exhibit improved CRS but not improved BI. To examine this issue, we compared two randomly assigned groups of non-meditators: a group that underwent eight sessions of mindfulness training (&#x0201c;mindfulness&#x0201d;), and a &#x0201c;waiting list&#x0201d; group. Groups were compared on a measure of BI and CRS both before and after mindfulness training of the mindfulness group.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Participants</title><p>The participants and experimental design were those used by Greenberg et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">2012</xref>). Seventy six individuals with no former meditation experience were recruited via poster ads hung around Ben-Gurion University campus and email ads sent to all university students, offering a free mindfulness program for those participating in two experimental sessions. The program was due to start in two possible dates several months apart. Exclusion criteria included people with learning disabilities and non-native Hebrew speakers, as well as people with previous meditation background.</p><p>Following the first experimental session, participants were randomly assigned to a Mindfulness meditation group (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;38) intended to participate in the first program and a waiting list (control) group (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;38) intended to participate in the second program. No significant differences were found between groups in Age [<italic>M</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;25.45, SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.56 for meditators, <italic>M</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;26, SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.5 for controls, <italic>t</italic>(74)&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.95, <italic>ns</italic>], gender (13 male meditators, 15 male controls, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.41, Fisher&#x02019;s exact test), nor in academic abilities as measured by self reported Psychometric Entrance Test (PET) scores, the Israeli equivalent of the SAT scores [<italic>M</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;662.97, SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;62.22 for meditators, <italic>M</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;672.66, SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;57.37 for controls, <italic>t</italic>(74)&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.70, <italic>ns</italic>]. The two groups were additionally equivalent in ratings of happiness, sadness, and general mood [maximal <italic>t</italic>(73)&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.69, <italic>ns</italic>]. As measured by asking participants to rate their current degree of happiness, sadness, and general mood on a 1&#x02013;9 Likert scale. Emotion rating data were available for all but one participant later assigned to the mindfulness group. The experiment had received approval from the psychology department&#x02019;s ethics committee in Ben-Gurion University.</p></sec><sec><title>Measures</title><p>The CRS paradigms were similar to those used by Meiran et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">2011b</xref>). These paradigms have been demonstrated to produce both reliable BI and CRS effects. Two similarly structured measures were administered before and after the mindfulness group underwent the mindfulness program<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1"><sup>1</sup></xref>. The experiments were run on Pentium 4 computers with 17&#x02033; (43.18-cm) monitors. The procedures were programmed in E-Prime 2 (Psychological Software Tools, Inc., 2005).</p><sec><title>&#x0201c;Vertical Boxes&#x0201d; paradigm (pre-test)</title><p>This paradigm was used to assess equivalence between groups in BI at baseline level, in Session 1, prior to the administration of the mindfulness program. We had used a shorter and slightly modified version of the paradigm described in detail by Meiran et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">2011b</xref>). Each trial started with a presentation of a black screen for 500&#x02009;ms, which served as a response-cue interval. A vertical array of four boxes then appeared for 600&#x02009;ms, with one of four possible task related cues in its center, indicating which of four tasks is to be performed. Following a screen displaying only the array of boxes for 100&#x02009;ms, a target stimulus (in the form of either a dot or line colored in either red or green) then appeared in one of the four boxes (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The four tasks were an &#x0201c;in-out&#x0201d; task in which participants had to judge whether the target stimulus appeared in the inner two boxes (&#x0201c;in&#x0201d;) or in the outer (top or bottom) boxes (&#x0201c;out&#x0201d;), as well as tasks requiring judgment of color (red vs. green), shape (dot vs. line), and vertical location of the target (i.e., upper two boxes vs. lower two boxes). Participants had to press the &#x0201c;A&#x0201d; key (on the left) if the target was &#x0201c;in,&#x0201d; green, a dot, or &#x0201c;up,&#x0201d; and the &#x0201c;L&#x0201d; key (on the right) if the target was &#x0201c;out,&#x0201d; red, a line, or &#x0201c;down,&#x0201d; respectively for the four tasks. A 400&#x02009;Hz beep sounded in case of an error in response. Due to the randomized controlled study design, we decided not to counterbalance keys, in order to assure standardization as much as possible.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Illustration of the Vertical Boxes paradigm, based on Meiran et al.

They then performed one single-task block of 50 trials for each of the four tasks (in-out, color, shape, and vertical location). Following this block, participants performed one practice block of 64 trials in which the four tasks were randomly mixed, followed by seven experimental blocks of 64 trials. At the end of each block, participants were instructed to take a short break, stretch or walk around for a short while, and continue when ready. One modification from the paradigm used by Meiran et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">2011b</xref>) was practicing each task separately at the beginning of the experiment rather than gradually adding tasks. This ensured equal experience with each task prior to mixing the four tasks together. A second modification was a reduction in the number of experimental blocks (7 instead of 18) in order to shorten the length of the experiment. As mentioned above, keys were not counterbalanced in order to increase standardization. A final modification was in the cue for the Shape task, which was modified from a square to a circle with a horizontal line running through it. Since the targets were either a circular dot or a horizontal line, the cue was altered to better represent the targets.</p></sec><sec><title>&#x0201c;Faces&#x0201d; paradigm (post-test)</title><p>This paradigm was used to assess differences between groups in Session 2, after the mindfulness group completed the mindfulness program. This paradigm is a shorter and slightly modified version of the one described in detail by Meiran et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">2010</xref>). Modifications include practicing each task separately at the beginning of the experiment, and using 7 rather than 18 experimental blocks, for the reasons described above. The paradigm was identical in block structure to the &#x0201c;vertical boxes&#x0201d; paradigm used in the first experimental session with the exception that the cue was kept onscreen until a response was given. However, the Faces paradigm involved different stimuli, response keys, and mostly different tasks.</p><p>A 2&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;2 array of boxes appeared onscreen with one of four possible task related cues in its center, indicating which of the four tasks is to be performed. A target stimulus in the form of one of four possible faces of young adults, two blonde and two dark-haired, then appeared in one of the four boxes. The four tasks were a horizontal location task, a hair color task, a gender task, and a vertical location task (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Participants had to press the &#x0201c;V&#x0201d; key (on the lower-left side) if the face target appeared in the left column of boxes, if the hair was dark, if target was a face of a male, and if it appeared in the bottom row of boxes, and press the &#x0201c;U&#x0201d; key (on the upper-right side) if the face appeared on the right column, if it was a face of a female, the hair was blonde, and if it appeared in the top row of boxes, respectively for the four tasks. A 400&#x02009;Hz beep sounded in case of an error in response. As in the &#x0201c;vertical boxes&#x0201d; paradigm, following instructions participants performed one single-task block of 50 trials for each of the four tasks (horizontal location, hair color, gender, and vertical location), then performed a practice mixed-task block of 64 trials, followed by seven experimental similar blocks.

(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">2012</xref>). The program consisted of eight meetings, held over 6&#x02009;weeks. Seven meetings were 2&#x02009;h long, and one was a half day &#x0201c;retreat&#x0201d; which took place at the end of the fifth week. The instructor was one of the authors (KR), a trained mindfulness based meditation instructor having over 10&#x02009;years of personal meditation experience. The instructor, who was blind to the hypothesis of the experiment, guided participants through mindfulness meditation practices such as breathing meditation, body scan, open awareness meditation, walking meditation, and compassion meditation, as well as through various awareness exercises, stories, and group discussions. The program required at least 20&#x02009;min of daily home formal meditation practice.

A significant main effect was found for CRS, in which participants were overall slower on trials in which the relevant rule was the interfering rule in the previous trial [<italic>F</italic>(1, 74)&#x02009;=&#x02009;14.93, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001].

This indicates a tradeoff between speed and accuracy for both groups, in which participants were slower but more accurate in BI trials.

A <italic>t</italic>-test was conducted comparing the groups in this measure indicated that the two groups were equivalent in post error slowing [<italic>t</italic>(63)&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05, <italic>ns</italic>], and therefore did not react differently to making in error or the tone played.</p><p>In sum, with regards to CRS, both groups exhibited a reliable effect in the two experimental sessions, yet did not differ between them. With regards to BI, the waiting list group exhibited a similar BI pattern in both experimental sessions, and adopted a strategy of slower but more accurate performance on BI trials, with no indication of a reliable BI effect. In contrast, the mindfulness group exhibited a different pattern of BI results in the two experimental sessions. While their performance was similar to that of the waiting list group at baseline level (i.e., BI effect in RT with a reversed BI effect in error rates, which renders the RT-BI effects unreliable), after the program they exhibited a reliable RT-BI effect with a similar trend in error rates, without an indication of speed-accuracy tradeoff. This indicates that mindfulness meditation resulted in a clear and reliable RT-BI effect as opposed to an RT-BI effect resulting from a speed-accuracy tradeoff (rather than processing efficiency) that characterized the control group.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Mindfulness practice is said to be characterized by inhibition of information not relevant to the present moment (e.g., Bishop et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">2004</xref>), and has been shown to reduce depressive rumination (Ramel et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">2004</xref>; Kingston et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">2007</xref>; Chambers et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">2008</xref>; Heeren et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">2009</xref>; Michalak et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">2011</xref>; Campbell et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">2012</xref>). BI is considered to be one of the &#x0201c;purest&#x0201d; measures of task set inhibition (Koch et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">2010</xref>), and impairments in it have been linked to depressive rumination (Whitmer and Banich, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">2007</xref>; Whitmer and Gotlib, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">2012</xref>). Given the fact that switching between tasks is a way to operationalize switching between mindsets (Meiran, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">2010</xref>), BI indicates the ability to inhibit the mindset that had been adopted in the recent past in favor of the currently relevant mindset. We therefore examined the hypothesis that mindfulness would improve BI. Additionally, since many of the observed differences between mindfulness practitioners and controls in measures assumed to be related to inhibition (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s1">Introduction</xref>) may be explained by non-inhibitory accounts such as episodic memory retrieval (see MacLeod et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">2003</xref>; Koch et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">2010</xref>) we also examined group differences in CRS, which primarily taps the process in which competing rules are tagged in episodic memory.</p><p>The two groups exhibited similar BI trends in Session 1. In fact, both groups showed BI in RT but showed a significant reversed trend in Error Rate. Thus, there was no clear indication for a reliable BI effect in Session 1. Rather, the trend indicated a speed-accuracy tradeoff. In Session 2, the control group continued to show this trend of tradeoff. However, the mindfulness group showed a reliable BI in RT and a similar trend in errors, indicating a reliable BI effect without speed-accuracy tradeoff. Thus, we conclude that mindfulness training improves BI.</p><p>While BI results differed between groups, CRS results did not. This differential effect of the mindfulness program may shed some light as to how mindfulness may promote attendance to the present moment. Both BI and CRS may be seen as phenomena promoting attendance to the present moment, yet do so via differential mechanisms. BI seems to conduce to attending to the present moment by the active inhibition of information which was recently relevant but is no longer so. With past information inhibited, one may more easily notice and attend whatever currently arises. In contrast, CRS seems to conduce to attending to the present moment by tagging in episodic memory of information which is currently competing as &#x0201c;not to be responded to.&#x0201d; Results of the study suggest that mindfulness improves the specific component of inhibition of no longer relevant information rather than episodic memory tagging of competing information.</p><p>Such improved inhibitory ability among mindfulness practitioners seems of relevance to the use of mindfulness based interventions in treatment of various clinical conditions, due to the central role played by inhibition in many of these conditions such as obsessive compulsive disorder (Enright and Beech, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">1993</xref>), schizophrenia (Nestor and O&#x02019;Donnell, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">1998</xref>), and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (Barkley, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">1997</xref>; Nigg, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">2001</xref>). With regards to cognitive aging, BI was found to be unimpaired in old age (Mayr, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">2001</xref>). The present findings provide support to the notion that neurocognitive mechanisms involved in mindfulness would not limit its efficacy in old age. This receives additional support from findings that mindfulness is often found to be an effective intervention in the elderly (see Lindberg, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">2005</xref>; McBee, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">2008</xref>). An additional contribution of the current results involves the relation between mindfulness and rumination. Rumination has been found to be one of the major risk factors in depression, and typically consists of repeated thinking about one&#x02019;s negative symptoms, their causes, and implications (Nolen-Hoeksema, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">1991</xref>). One of primary aims of MBCT is to become aware of such negative thinking patterns, and disengage from them, thereby reducing the risk for a relapse in depression (Segal et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">2002</xref>). Albeit the currently available evidence indicating that mindfulness practice is related to reduced rumination (Ramel et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">2004</xref>; Kingston et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">2007</xref>; Chambers et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">2008</xref>; Heeren et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">2009</xref>; Michalak et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">2011</xref>; Campbell et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">2012</xref>), little if any empirical evidence exists regarding <italic>how</italic> mindfulness does so. Impairments to BI are assessed using different methods, and typically observed in shorter time periods (Mayr and Keele, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">2000</xref>) compared to rumination. Nevertheless, both BI and rumination involve perseveration of a particular mindset or way of thinking, and a difficulty in moving on from information which is no longer relevant. Both phenomena also often result in maladaptive reasoning or responding due to such difficulty in inhibition of previous mindsets (Nolen-Hoeksema, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">1991</xref>; Mayr and Keele, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">2000</xref>). Thus, despite some differences between the two phenomena, the similarities described above suggest that they may have a common base. By coupling the current finding that mindfulness improves BI with previous findings suggesting that impairments to BI are associated with trait depressive rumination (Whitmer and Banich, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">2007</xref>; Whitmer and Gotlib, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">2012</xref>), we tentatively suggest a mechanism in which mindfulness may reduce rumination via increased inhibition of no longer relevant information and task sets.</p><p>The rationale for our hypothesis that mindfulness may improve BI was largely based on the fact that inhibition of no longer relevant information may conduce to attending the present moment. One may suggest that the finding that mindfulness training improves BI may be taken as evidence to the contrary, that mindfulness decreases rather than increases present moment awareness. This is because BI entails lingering of inhibition from previous trials and, in a way, reflects some &#x0201c;carrying over&#x0201d; of the past (i.e., the carrying over of inhibition). We posit, however, that such inhibition conduces much more than it impairs attendance to the present moment, as the lack of such inhibition often results in perseveration and getting &#x0201c;stuck&#x0201d; in no longer relevant mental sets (Mayr and Keele, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">2000</xref>). An additional point which we wish mention is that since both groups were assessed prior to the mindfulness program, we cannot rule out the possibility that mindfulness improves BI only after such a pre-test, although this seems highly unlikely.</p><p>The speed-accuracy tradeoff observed in the current study was not significantly observed by Meiran et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">2010</xref>), who have used a longer version of the Faces paradigm. One may interpret such difference between studies in speed-accuracy tradeoff as potential threats to validity and or reliability of BI findings in our study. However, both studies have found significant and similar baseline BI effects in RT (roughly 27&#x02009;ms) thus providing evidence for validity in BI measurement in the current study. Moreover, Meiran et al. found no BI effect in error rates (less than 0.001 in proportion of errors, <italic>ns</italic>) meaning that approximately half of their participants exhibited the same pattern of negative BI performance in error rates as displayed by the sample in the current study. With regards to the reliability of BI measurement, the fact that both groups in the current study exhibited a qualitatively similar tradeoff at baseline level, and that this finding was repeated by the control group at Session 2 indicates that this finding in the absence of mindfulness practice is reliable. In other words, our sample was slightly different in its characteristics than that of Meiran et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">2010</xref>), yet the sample was successfully divided by the random assignment into two equivalent groups and the mindfulness intervention significantly altered the BI pattern in the experimental group.</p><p>Comparing a randomly assigned mindfulness group with a waiting list group may be taken as a limitation of the current study, as it only enables us to attribute findings to the mindfulness intervention as a whole, rather than to specific components within the intervention, as may have made possible by using an active control group. In addition, although the relation between BI and depressive rumination has been previously established (Whitmer and Banich, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">2007</xref>; Whitmer and Gotlib, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">2012</xref>), we did not measure rumination in the current study. Future studies may compare mindfulness with other intervention programs to clarify the role of specific components in mindfulness interventions, and may also extend the use of this measure in various forms of psychopathology in order to broaden our understanding of the efficacy of mindfulness practice in treatment of these conditions.</p></sec><sec><title>Conflict of Interest Statement</title><p>The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was partly supported by a research grant to the third author from the Israel Science Foundation.</p></ack><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><p><sup>1</sup>Since participants were randomly assigned to groups, participants may be examined using only a post-test.
