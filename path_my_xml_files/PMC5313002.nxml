To date, preventative gerontological studies have primarily focused on resistance-based exercises. Notably, a systematic review and meta-analysis by Gillespie et al<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> identify that participation by older adults in exercise programs reduces the incidence of serious falls. Similarly, the viability of high-intensity interval training as a method of maintaining muscular power during advancing age has been largely neglected. This is despite the emerging evidence that high-velocity exercise movements have the additional benefit of improving balance in ageing cohorts.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup></p><p>Since the landmark study of &#x000c5;strand etal<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> in 1960 in athletes, high-intensity interval training (HIIT) has become an accepted exercise modality to improve aerobic fitness which is enjoying a recent re-emergence as a practicable method to improve cardiovascular health amongst a variety of young and adult populations. HIIT is characterized by brief, intermittent bursts of vigorous exercise, interspersed by periods of rest or low-intensity recovery.<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> There is an emergent body of evidence that endorses HIIT as an effective alternative to traditional endurance training that can yield improvements in both cardio-respiratory fitness and variety of health outcomes. However, HIIT remains largely unexplored in otherwise healthy sedentary older adults,<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> encouraging a recent call for such studies in ageing cohorts.<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup></p><p>Traditionally, HIIT programs include several short efforts of high-intensity work performed each session, and with sessions performed thrice weekly. However, our research group have recently demonstrated that older men take longer to recover from a single session of HIIT than younger counterparts,<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> with men aged 60 years requiring 5 days to recover peak power output (PPO), compared with men aged 25 years requiring 3 days. This implies that standard HIIT protocols should be adapted for exercise prescription in older adults. Consequently, HIIT might effectively be achieved in older adults by reducing the frequency of weekly sessions. Reducing training volume in this manner may be a more suitable alternative to improve muscle power during sedentary (but otherwise healthy) ageing. We hereafter term this exercise low-frequency HIIT (L<sub><italic>f</italic></sub>HIIT), to distinguish this form of high-intensity intermittent exercise from the traditional 3-weekly sessions.</p><p>We have recently described the potential for HIIT to improve muscle power in ageing men.<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> Therefore, the purpose of this research article is to extend this previous work and to respond to the call in the literature<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> by investigating the effectiveness of a L<sub><italic>f</italic></sub>HIIT program on components of leg power and static balance in otherwise healthy sedentary ageing males. We hypothesized that L<sub><italic>f</italic></sub>HIIT, subsequent to conditioning exercise, would produce clinically relevant improvements in leg power in otherwise healthy sedentary ageing compared with age-matched sedentary male controls. We further hypothesized that L<sub><italic>f</italic></sub>HIIT would improve balance in the group receiving the intervention.</p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec><label>2.1</label><title>Ethical approval</title><p>Participants consisted of sedentary male volunteers (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;36) between the ages of 56 and 65 years. Inclusion criteria were that participants had not participated in any formal exercise training for a minimum of 30 years; all participants self-reported as not being involved in any regular physical activity for either recreational or work-related purposes. General medical practitioners (GPs) for each potential participant were required to provide a written letter of approval for their participant to enroll to the study. Participants were withdrawn if, in the opinion of their GP, they were not suitable to take part in strenuous physical activity. Three participants were subsequently withdrawn due to existing cardiovascular disease (n&#x0200a;<italic>=</italic>&#x0200a;2) and respiratory disorder (n&#x0200a;<italic>=</italic>&#x0200a;1). The flow of participants through the study is depicted in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>. The remaining participants completed a physical activity readiness questionnaire (PAR-Q) and provided written informed consent to participate in the study, which was approved by the University of the West of Scotland research ethics committee. After enrolment, cardiorespiratory fitness was established in an exercise physiology laboratory by indirect calorimetry using a ramp protocol on a cycle ergometer to exhaustion as described in greater detail elsewhere,<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup> where individual maximal heart rates were used to establish and confirm exercise intensity (heart rate reserve) during the study. Subsequently, participants (n&#x0200a;<italic>=</italic>&#x0200a;33) were randomly assigned, in a 2:1 ratio, into either an intervention group (INT; n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;22) or a control group (CON; n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;11). Asymmetric randomization was considered appropriate due to the potential for high attrition rates in the intervention group resulting in underpowered statistical outcomes.<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> Participant characteristics are outlined in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Flow diagram of participants randomized to either intervention (INT) or control (CON) through the 3 measurement phases of the study.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="medi-96-e6040-g002"/></fig><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><graphic xlink:href="medi-96-e6040-g003"/></table-wrap><p>Due to the unknown effect of high-intensity exercise in sedentary older men, and to account for the effects of conditioning exercise, the study required 3 distinct measurement phases (A, B, and C) separated by 2 training blocks (1 and 2).

The test employed a seated stationary start with dominant leg initiating the first down-stroke. The air braking resistance was set to level l0, and magnetic resistance set to level 1 (equating to 1045&#x0200a;W at 130&#x0200a;rpm and approximately 90&#x02013;100&#x0200a;W increases for every further 5&#x0200a;rpm increase in cadence).

A further finding was that neither standard conditioning, nor L<sub><italic>f</italic></sub>HIIT resulted in any improvement in measures of static balance that were assessed in this study. These findings have important implications for exercise prescription in older populations.</p><sec><label>4.1</label><title>Standard conditioning exercise</title><p>In the present study, general conditioning (phase A) had no effect on PPO or rPPO in INT. Previously, low to moderate intensity training has been shown to improve PPO calculated from vertical jump height in similarly aged females<sup>[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup>; however, similar data in males are lacking. Indeed, the ACSM position statement<sup>[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup> relating to exercise for older individuals neglects to consider any effects of aerobic exercise training on measures of peak muscle power. Nevertheless, the present study failed to find any effect of moderate-intensity exercise on PPO in older males. This is likely attributable to the specificity of neuromuscular and metabolic adaptations of skeletal muscle in response to chronic exercise.</p></sec><sec><label>4.2</label><title>L<sub><italic>f</italic></sub>HIIT</title><p>The most comprehensive data currently available on low volume HIIT is a recently published meta-analysis by Weston et al.<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> However, as indicated by the authors, their results deal exclusively with younger adult participants, as there are no previously published data regarding the effects of low-volume HIIT on indices of muscular power or body composition in healthy older participants. Indeed, Weston et al<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> identify that of those studies reporting PPO, the oldest cohort previously studied had a mean age of 32 years.<sup>[<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup> Correspondingly, this study represents the oldest cohort to undertake a HIIT program, to date. Weston et al<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> report the effect of low-volume HIIT on PPO in younger cohorts as being unclear, reporting a small average increase and wide CIs (1.8%&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;5%), meaning that in some cases, there was a negative effect of low-volume HIIT training interventions. This was calculated using the difference between control and intervention groups, with the small effect partly due to PPO improvements in control groups. Using the same calculation, the present study reports an overall effect on PPO that is an order of magnitude greater (26.5%) after L<sub><italic>f</italic></sub>HIIT, when comparing INT with CON, and a within-group increase of 17% for INT between phases B and C.</p><p>One potential explanation for the greater effect in the present study relates to participants&#x02019; age. Since normal ageing is associated with a progressive decline in PPO,<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> it is likely that participants in the present study had a low PPO at baseline, and consequently had a much larger scope for improvement than studies of younger participants. Although further comparison with available literature is hindered, as this is the first RCT study using older participants, it does provide the first evidence that L<sub><italic>f</italic></sub>HIIT may be an age-specific training method to increase PPO.</p><p>Similarly, there are other differences with previous investigations that merit discussion. In particular, the present study used a low-frequency and low-volume HIIT model as opposed to previous investigations that have utilized a low exercise volume per session, but have maintained the traditional frequency of 3 sessions per week. This is of particular importance as other variables within the present study are comparable with previous investigations using low-volume HIIT. These include variables such as intensity, effort duration, total effort per session, work-rest ratio, and number of efforts per session.<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> Consequently, the large improvements in PPO and rPPO in INT in the present study are even more surprising, given the use of both similarly low session volumes, and reduced training frequency (once every 5 days giving a mean frequency of 1.4 sessions/wk), which was less than half that of previous investigations. Correspondingly, the improvements in INT were in response to a total of 27&#x0200a;minutes of HIIT exercise across the 6-week period.</p><p>We have previously reported that when compared with their younger counterparts, older participants require longer recovery periods after a single bout of HIIT,<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> with PPO recovery occurring within 5 days. Consequently, it appears that in older participants, allowing full recovery between bouts may facilitate muscle adaptation to HIIT and should be considered when programming training or L<sub><italic>f</italic></sub>HIIT protocols for older participants. It is evident from the present study that reducing exercise frequency in older cohorts is not detrimental to improvements in muscle power. It seems likely that the extended recovery between bouts allows for more complete recovery and adaptation (a process that may be slower in older individuals), and can prevent accumulated fatigue that might occur should training sessions be programmed too frequently.</p><p>The vast majority of studies investigating muscle power in ageing participants have used resistance exercise, high-speed power movements (normally adapted from traditional resistance exercises), or a combination thereof. Whereas high-velocity movements are widely considered to be more effective than high-load, low-velocity resistance exercise for improving muscle power,<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> comparisons with the present study are difficult since the outcome measures used in individual studies are specific to their training intervention, with the consequence that the utility of comparing relative efficacy becomes questionable. For example, Sayers and Gibson<sup>[<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup> report an approximate 3.5-fold improvement over control subjects in PPO generated against a resistance of 40% of participants leg press 1 repetition maximum (1RM). Given the mechanical and metabolic differences between a single expression of power during a leg press versus 30&#x0200a;seconds of high-intensity cycling, it is difficult to conclude the superiority of one intervention over another.</p></sec><sec><label>4.3</label><title>Anthropometrics</title><p>During initial conditioning, INT underwent a small reduction in body fat in the absence of any change to LBM. However, after L<sub><italic>f</italic></sub>HIIT, the reduction in body fat accelerated with a concomitant increase in LBM. Increased daily energy expenditure during general conditioning is the most likely explanation for the small reduction in body fat during that phase. The effectiveness of moderate-intensity exercise to reduce body fat in sedentary individuals has been previously reported<sup>[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup> and further substantiated by the present data. The mechanism behind a reduction in body fat after L<sub><italic>f</italic></sub>HIIT is unclear. As outlined above, the total high-intensity exercise time during that phase of the study was 27&#x0200a;minutes over 6 weeks (this increases to a total of 4.5&#x0200a;hours of exercise when recovery, warm-up, and cool-down periods were included). It would appear unlikely that reductions in body fat were mediated by increased calorie expenditure. One unexplored avenue is that HIIT participants may self-select higher levels of physical activity out-with the HIIT intervention which has been demonstrated in adolescents,<sup>[<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup> but remains to be examined in adult and ageing populations. There are numerous reports of HIIT training resulting in reductions in TBM,<sup>[<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup> TBF,<sup>[<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup> and total visceral adipose tissue.<sup>[<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup> The mechanisms underpinning reductions in body fat after HIIT are poorly understood, but have been postulated as being related to improved exertional, postexercise, and resting fat oxidation,<sup>[<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup> and/or appetite suppression.<sup>[<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</sup> The relative change in TBF in the present study (8.8% between phase B and phase C) is similar to changes reported in other HIIT studies, utilizing greater frequencies than is the case here.<sup>[<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup> The present study extends these results in 2 ways. First, by demonstrating that the effect is similarly evident in previously sedentary, but otherwise healthy ageing men. And secondly, by demonstrating that the effect persists despite low weekly exercise frequency and low total exercise volume.</p><p>In contrast to its effects on fat mass, the effect of HIIT on lean body mass has not been extensively investigated. Combined endurance and HIIT training has previously been shown to increase thigh cross-sectional area over 16 weeks in middle-aged diabetic men. More recently, Gillen et al<sup>[<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</sup> demonstrated increases in FFM in the leg and gynoid regions of overweight young females after 6 weeks of low-volume HIIT performed 3 times per week. In the present study, muscle hypertrophy was not directly measured, but clearly cannot be ruled out as a contributor to increased LBM. Similarly, although not measured in this study, exercise-induced changes to male sex hormones may have indirectly influenced PPO through interactions with muscle hypertrophy/function.<sup>[<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</sup> However, the tenet for this phenomenon is not well described in the ageing male literature,<sup>[<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]</sup> and the latest evidence introduces the potential for a significant role of insulin-like growth factor in the exercise response in ageing men.<sup>[<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]</sup> Nonetheless, increases in muscle mass in this study would have the additional benefit of increasing resting metabolic rate, which may also explain the accelerated reduction in TBF after L<sub><italic>f</italic></sub>HIIT. Nevertheless, whatever the basis for increased LBM, the present study builds on previous work by demonstrating that in older cohorts, increases in LBM are possible, and can occur despite low exercise frequency and volumes.</p><p>In addition to adverse changes in muscle mass and body composition, ageing is also associated with decrements in muscle quality (defined as force production per unit of muscle).<sup>[<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]</sup> Although not investigated directly in the present study, PPO relative to FFM (rPPO<sub>FFM</sub>) may be used as a surrogate, though imperfect measure of muscle quality. In the present study, L<sub><italic>f</italic></sub>HIIT resulted in significant increases in rPPO<sub>FFM</sub> in INT. This suggests that along with the increases in FFM, L<sub><italic>f</italic></sub>HIIT may also improve muscle quality. These changes, when viewed alongside with the increases in PPO, the small decreases in TBF, the low time requirements, and the high levels of adherence, suggests L<sub><italic>f</italic></sub>HIIT may be a potent tool for improving measures predictive of future frailty in older sedentary populations. Our use of rPPO<sub>FFM</sub> as a surrogate marker for muscle quality is not without significant limitations, though our findings suggest that this is an avenue for further study. As such, the 56&#x02013;65&#x0200a;yrs cohort in this study are good candidates for high intensity training. Whereas undoubtedly aged, this demographic, frequently termed &#x0201c;the young old&#x0201d; typically have many years of minimally diminished functional capacity remaining and are less likely to have a mobility limiting disorders. In the absence of epidemiological evidence for HIIT to improve &#x0201c;lifespan,&#x0201d; or indeed, long-term health outcomes in previously sedentary ageing cohorts, this study provides preliminary evidence for L<sub><italic>f</italic></sub>HIIT to induce short-term improvements in muscle power. With careful exercise prescription, L<sub><italic>f</italic></sub>HIIT-induced improvements in muscle power could potentially be carried through into older age, thus positively impacting the exercisers&#x02019; &#x0201c;health-span.&#x0201d; With this in mind, replication of the present findings and longer-term follow-up studies in male and female cohorts are strongly encouraged.</p><p>Neither conditioning exercise nor L<sub><italic>f</italic></sub>HIIT was effective at improving indices of balance in INT. Previous investigations have reported that power training can improve balance in older participants.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]</sup> The reasons for the lack of effect of either training regimen in the present study may be due to a number of factors. Most previous studies have used functional movements using weighted vests<sup>[<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]</sup> or high-velocity movements adapted from traditional resistance training exercises.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup> In contrast, stationary cycle ergometry includes 5 points of contact with a stable ergometer, and thus requires less corrective stability than other forms of high-velocity exercise. It is possible that stationary cycle ergometry is sufficiently stable and effectively limits improvements in balance. Alternatively, others have reported no detrimental effects on balance in older participants who have maintained moderate physical activity (regular walking) after retirement.<sup>[<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]</sup> Given that the age and static balance results of the present cohort were similar to those reported by Melzer et al, it is equally possible that our participants had no significant balance impairment, and thus any training effects may be minimal. In addition, it may be that the static balance test utilized in the study was insufficiently challenging to identify improvements after the training program. Consequently, future work in similar populations may wish to employ more challenging assessments of participants balance.</p></sec><sec><label>4.4</label><title>Study limitations</title><p>The present study has some important limitations that should be noted. One concerns the proximity (11 days) of the conditioning exercise (training block 1) to the L<sub><italic>f</italic></sub>HIIT intervention (training block 2), which makes it impossible to rule out the contribution of conditioning exercise to the overall effect on INT after L<sub><italic>f</italic></sub>HIIT. However, given the randomized controlled design and the lack of difference between groups at phase B, the difference in PPO evident at phase C is almost certainly due to the L<sub><italic>f</italic></sub>HIIT intervention. As the effects of high-intensity exercise are unstudied in older cohorts, the inclusion of the conditioning exercise during phase A was deemed a prudent means of gradually introducing the previously inactive INT cohort to the rigors of high-intensity training. This decision appears justified as there was complete adherence to the L<sub><italic>f</italic></sub>HIIT after conditioning. Similarly, the ACSM has recently indicated that conditioning training should be employed before undertaking high-intensity interval training.<sup>[<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]</sup></p><p>In conclusion, the novel findings of the present study are that L<sub><italic>f</italic></sub>HIIT is both feasible and effective as a training modality to increase lower limb muscle power in sedentary ageing men. However, when performed using stationary cycle ergometry, it does not improve balance in otherwise healthy sedentary ageing males. This study provides strong supporting evidence for the inclusion of L<sub><italic>f</italic></sub>HIIT when prescribing exercise to improve lower-limb power in ageing cohorts.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: ACSM = American College of Sports Medicine, CON = control group, GP = general medical practitioner, HIIT = high-intensity interval training, HRR = heart rate reserve, INT = intervention group, L<sub><italic>f</italic></sub>HIIT = low-frequency high-intensity interval training, PAR-Q = Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire, PPO = peak power output, rPPO = relative peak power output, rPPO<sub>FFM</sub> = rPPO relative to fat free mass, &#x000a0;<disp-formula id="MU1"><graphic xlink:href="medi-96-e6040-g001.jpg" position="float"/></disp-formula> max = maximal oxygen uptake.</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>[1]</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Orr</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>de Vos</surname><given-names>NJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Singh</surname><given-names>NA</given-names></name><etal/></person-group>
