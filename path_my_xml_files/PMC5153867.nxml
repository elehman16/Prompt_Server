However, only around 10&#x000a0;% of these people access specialist care, such as face-to-face extended brief treatment in community alcohol services. This may be due to stigma, difficulty accessing services during working hours, a shortage of trained counsellors and limited provision of services in many places. Web-based alcohol treatment programmes may overcome these barriers and may better suit people who are reluctant or unable to attend face-to-face services, but there is a gap in the evidence base for the acceptability, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of these programmes compared with treatment as usual (TAU) in community alcohol services.</p><p>This study aims investigate the feasibility of all parts of a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of a psychologically informed web-based alcohol treatment programme called Healthy Living for People who use Alcohol (HeLP-Alcohol) versus TAU in community alcohol services, e.g. recruitment and retention, online data collection methods, and the use and acceptability of the intervention to participants.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A feasibility RCT delivered in north London community alcohol services, comparing HeLP-Alcohol with TAU.

The main purpose of this study is to demonstrate the feasibility of recruiting participants to the study and will test online methods for collecting baseline demographic and outcome questionnaire data, randomising participants and collecting 3-month follow-up data. The acceptability of this intervention will be measured by recruitment and retention rates, automated log-in data collection and an online service satisfaction questionnaire.

Alcohol misuse is estimated to cost the UK around &#x000a3;21 billion per year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. This includes National Health Service (NHS) costs for treating accidents, assaults resulting from alcohol intoxication, conditions such as liver disease, cardiovascular disease and cancers, and the cost of alcohol treatment services. Societal costs include those associated with absenteeism, unemployment, family breakdown, road traffic collisions and crime.</p><p>These costs are mainly due to the large number of &#x0201c;hazardous and harmful&#x0201d; drinkers who make up approximately 23&#x000a0;% of the adult population; about 7.1 million people in England [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Hazardous drinkers are those whose alcohol intake is greater than government recommended limits (14 units a week for women and 21 units for men; or 2&#x02013;3 units daily for women and 3&#x02013;4 units for men). Harmful drinkers are those drinking more than recommended limits, and experiencing alcohol-related harm, but without symptoms of physical or psychological dependence. About 3.6&#x000a0;% of the population (1.1 million) people in England are dependent on alcohol.</p><p>People drinking at hazardous or harmful levels can respond well to a tiered approach to treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Tier 1 is identification and brief advice (IBA), also known as screening and brief intervention (SBI). This may be conducted by a health professional in any setting, for example general practice or accident and emergency department (A&#x00026;E). Identification is through the use of validated questionnaires such as the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], or shortened versions of AUDIT such as AUDIT Consumption (AUDIT-C) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] or the Fast Alcohol Screening Test (FAST) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Brief advice involves a short conversation about the risks of alcohol use at the current level, advice on reducing drinking levels and sources of self-help, usually supplemented with a leaflet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Tier 2/3 treatments are provided at community alcohol drug and alcohol services, which offer more specialised treatment for people who need more than IBA, including extended brief intervention face-to-face, either individually or in groups, and complimentary therapies tailored to the individual. Tier 4 is detoxification and other treatment targeted at dependent drinkers with significant co-morbidities such as liver disease, severe mental health problems or multiple substance misuse.</p><p>IBA for hazardous and harmful drinking results in a significant and sustained reduction in alcohol consumption, which has been quantified in a meta-analysis by Kaner et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] as a mean difference of &#x02212;38&#x000a0;g of alcohol a week (CI &#x02212;53 to &#x02212;23&#x000a0;g) compared with control treatments. This translates to a reduction in average weekly intake of around four standard UK drinks (1 unit&#x02009;=&#x02009;8&#x000a0;g alcohol). IBA is also likely to be cost-saving [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Despite this, not everyone who drinks at hazardous or harmful levels will find IBA sufficient to help them reduce their drinking and will need to access Tier 2/3 services.</p><p>There are enormous challenges in meeting demand for Tier 2/3 services, and estimates suggest only 6 to 10&#x000a0;% of people with problem alcohol use are accessing specialist treatment in England [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Over the last several years commissioners of drug and alcohol services have faced a funding deficit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. This has inevitably resulted in a shortage of trained alcohol counsellors, with skills over and above the generic competencies that all primary care and A&#x00026;E health care professionals need to provide IBA. In addition, hazardous or harmful alcohol use is recognised to be a relapsing and remitting condition so patients may need to access help repeatedly. Even if services are available, people may be reluctant to attend due to perceived stigma of having alcohol problems, or they may work and so cannot attend during working hours.</p><p>Online interventions could address these challenges. Internet use is widespread: 84&#x000a0;% of households in Great Britain having access to the internet, 76&#x000a0;% of adults use the internet every day and 58&#x000a0;% use a mobile phone to do so [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Online interventions are relatively inexpensive to set up, are convenient to access and provide anonymity, which is important to people with stigmatising conditions. A recent systematic review has shown that online interventions may be effective and cost-effective in treating hazardous and harmful alcohol use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The feasibility of providing online interventions similar to Tier 2/3 community alcohol services has been demonstrated and also found to be acceptable to alcohol counsellors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. However, much of the research to date has looked at online interventions for IBA, largely in student populations. There are relatively few data demonstrating the effectiveness of extended brief intervention in adult populations of hazardous and harmful drinkers, and no data comparing face-to-face treatment with online treatment.</p><p>A fully powered Phase 3 randomised controlled trial (RCT) could address these gaps in knowledge, but there are recognised challenges with trials of web-based interventions, hence we propose to undertake a feasibility RCT first. The challenges include low engagement rates and attrition (non-use or fall-off in engagement with the intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]), which limit their effectiveness, and high dropout rates (e.g. failure to complete follow-up questionnaires) seen in online trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. There is also the potential for widening the digital divide, leading to health inequalities, as people from more deprived groups are less likely to have access to the internet and older people may have limitations in readiness and capacity to use online technologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In light of these challenges, we feel that a feasibility study is required prior to applying for funding to carry out a Phase 3 RCT designed to test the hypothesis that supported access to an online alcohol intervention which mirrors treatment in community alcohol services is as effective, and more cost-effective, than traditional face to face treatments.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Aims of the trial</title><p>The overall aim of this study is to determine the feasibility of conducting a RCT comparing supported access to a web-based Tier 2/3 treatment called Healthy Living for People who use Alcohol (HeLP-Alcohol) with usual care (face-to-face treatment in community alcohol services). The feasibility study will determine recruitment and retention rates and acceptability of the intervention; will test the online randomisation and data collection instruments at baseline and at 3&#x000a0;months; and will test methods to promote participant engagement with the intervention. We will also estimate health professional time involved in facilitating both arms of the trial. The outcomes of this feasibility study will inform a fully powered Phase 3 randomised controlled effectiveness trial and an economic evaluation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Design</title><p>This is a randomised controlled feasibility trial.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Setting</title><p>The London boroughs of Camden, Islington and Haringey have agreed to participate in the study, and we have recruited four community alcohol services to take part.

If alcohol counsellors have concerns about a client regarding child protection issues or domestic violence, they will also be excluded. Patients without prior internet experience or without home access to the internet will not be excluded, but will be offered additional training as part of their facilitated access to the web-based alcohol treatment programme.

Face-to-face treatment is only accessed by around 10&#x000a0;% of those who could benefit, for several reasons, of which the most important are lack of provision, stigma and inconvenience. We have developed a psychologically informed web-based alcohol programme which may help fill this gap in access, but its effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and equality of access compared with usual treatment in community alcohol services need to be ascertained in a fully powered RCT. The results of this feasibility RCT will provide useful evidence for commissioners of alcohol services as previous studies of web-based treatments for hazardous and harmful alcohol use have been conducted mainly online, for example, comparing websites with and without interaction or feedback [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p>Conducting a Phase 3 RCT to compare a web-based alcohol treatment programme with face-to-face community alcohol treatment is likely to face challenges, hence the need for the feasibility study. Recruitment and retention rates in the feasibility RCT will give an indication of the acceptability of the trial to patients with problem alcohol use. Other methods such as qualitative interviews may give a better idea of acceptability or otherwise, both of the trial and the intervention, and we aim to undertake a separate qualitative study with participants and alcohol counsellors in due course. However, it may not be possible to get the views of people who decline to participate in the trial as they are likely to decline to take part in a qualitative study as well. It is also not possible to determine the characteristics of those who decline to take part as we are not able to collect their demographic data if they have not consented to be in the study. However, we will have access to summary data for all clients seen by a service as the services collect this data for their own evaluations, so this may give us some indication of the characteristics of those who decline to participate compared with those who consent.</p><p>It may be that potentially eligible clients do not wish to participate in a trial where there is a chance of being randomised to a website when they may have a preference for face-to-face counselling, or they may not have easy access to a computer, or feel confident using a computer. If they mention a reason for not participating when their alcohol counsellor discusses the trial with them, then we may pick this up from the qualitative interviews with counsellors.</p><p>Alcohol counsellors themselves may not find it acceptable to recruit people to a trial where they have a 50&#x000a0;% chance of being randomised to a website. The counsellors may only ask people who they think will be computer-literate, or may not ask those who they worry might disengage with the service if they are not seen face-to-face (selection bias). There may be other reasons why counsellors do not recruit potential recruits which may come out in the interviews, including time pressures and competing priorities.</p><p>We chose community alcohol services to as a recruitment setting because we expected that our target population would present to these services in sufficient numbers. However, as we are excluding hazardous or harmful drinkers who have co-morbidities or complex problems such as other substance misuse, eligible clients may not in fact present in sufficient numbers to recruit successfully from this setting.</p><p>As previously discussed, attrition from online programmes and online trials is a common problem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. We hope to overcome this using text message, email and telephone prompts as previous studies suggests such prompts can improve engagement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. We will also collect data on other sources of help accessed during the study, participants&#x02019; satisfaction with the intervention and estimates of health professional time for each arm, which will inform the main trial.</p><p>The proposed feasibility study is therefore important in order to identify these challenges prior to designing the Phase 3 trial, to test online data collection, randomisation methods and the prompts to encourage continued use of the intervention. Data from this study will also be used to refine the sample size calculation for the Phase 3 RCT. Our hypothesis is that supported access to HeLP-Alcohol is of equal effectiveness as TAU. The RCT will be designed to have 90&#x000a0;% power to detect (at a 5&#x000a0;% significance level) a difference in mean weekly alcohol consumption of 15&#x000a0;% between intervention and TAU groups (if such a difference occurs). The assumptions are (i) standard deviation of alcohol consumption at follow-up is equal to 85&#x000a0;% of the mean and (ii) a correlation between baseline and follow-up alcohol consumption of 0.40, as found in a previous RCT of an online alcohol intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]; (iii) a follow-up rate of 75&#x000a0;% at 12&#x000a0;months, based on the experience of UKATT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]; (iv) an intra-cluster correlation of 0.02 for the effect of alcohol counsellors, also based on the UKATT trial. The standard error of the mean difference in alcohol consumption will be about 5&#x000a0;%, so an estimated zero difference would have a 95&#x000a0;% confidence interval of &#x02212;10 to +10&#x000a0;%. The definitive trial therefore requires 1665 participants.</p><p>If the definitive study shows that a web-based alcohol treatment programme is as effective as face to face treatment, then implementation of such a programme could increase patient choice, improve access to alcohol treatment for hazardous and harmful drinkers and lead to cost savings for treatment services and more widely for the NHS in treating alcohol-related health conditions, particularly for people who are reluctant or unable to attend face-to-face services.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>A&#x00026;E</term><def><p>accident and emergency</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AUDIT</term><def><p>Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AUDIT-C</term><def><p>Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test, Consumption</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CSQ-8</term><def><p>Client Satisfaction Questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CORE-10</term><def><p>Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation (10 item)</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EQ-5D</term><def><p>Euroqol 5-dimensions</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FAST</term><def><p>Fast Alcohol Screening Test</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HeLP-Alcohol</term><def><p>Healthy Living for People who use Alcohol</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IBA</term><def><p>identification and brief advice</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NHS</term><def><p>National Health Service</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NRES</term><def><p>National Research Ethics Committee</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SCQ-8</term><def><p>Situational Confidence Questionnaire (8 item)</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SBI</term><def><p>screening and brief intervention</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TAU</term><def><p>treatment as usual</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TOT-AL</term><def><p>TOTal past week ALcohol consumption</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>UK</term><def><p>United Kingdom</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WHO</term><def><p>World Health Organization</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>EM conceived of the study.
