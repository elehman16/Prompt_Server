The lowering of intraocular pressure (IOP) is the only proven method to reduce the risk of glaucoma onset and slow disease progression.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Studies have also shown an association between primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) and vascular factors, such as systemic hypertension, hypotension, vasospasm, atherosclerosis and ocular blood flow.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> While the association between systemic blood pressure and POAG is weak, ocular perfusion pressure (OPP), the difference between ocular arterial blood pressure and IOP, shows a significant correlation to the prevalence, incidence and progression of the disease.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p><p>Peak IOP is related to glaucoma progression, and previous studies have shown that IOP peaks of glaucoma patients frequently occur outside of office hours.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Different classes of glaucoma drugs have variable IOP-lowering efficacies during the nocturnal/sleep period compared with their efficacies during the diurnal/wake period.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5&#x02013;9</xref> Prostaglandin analogues, such as latanoprost and travoprost, have been shown to be effective in lowering IOP during both the diurnal and nocturnal periods.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Bimatoprost (Lumigan, Allergan, Irvine, California, USA) is a prostaglandin F<sub>2&#x003b1;</sub> analogue that also lowers IOP.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> It appears to mimic the activity of prostaglandins and reduces IOP by enhancing uveoscleral and possibly trabecular outflow via direct effect on ciliary muscle relaxation and remodelling of extracellular matrix.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Bimatoprost 0.03% has been demonstrated to be safe and highly effective in lowering IOP over the long term in glaucoma and ocular hypertension.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> The most common side effect of bimatoprost and other prostaglandin analogues is conjunctival hyperaemia, which can often lead to non-compliance or discontinuation of treatment.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p><p>Bimatoprost 0.01% is a new formulation that was developed to improve the tolerability but maintain the IOP-lowering effectiveness of bimatoprost 0.03% in lowering IOP. A recent study showed that bimatoprost 0.01% is equivalent to bimatoprost 0.03% in lowering IOP during the diurnal/wake period throughout 12&#x02005;months of treatment with less associated incidence of side effects such as conjunctival hyperaemia.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> However, the nocturnal IOP-lowering effect of bimatoprost 0.01% has not been investigated. In addition, the 24&#x02005;h effect of bimatoprost 0.01% on OPP is unknown. The present study evaluated the 24&#x02005;h effects on IOP and OPP of bimatoprost 0.01% monotherapy in a group of patients with POAG or ocular hypertension.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>This prospective study was approved by the University of California, San Diego Institutional Review Board, in accordance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, and registered as a clinical trial (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov">http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>; <italic>NCT01271686</italic>). All methods adhered to the Declaration of Helsinki for research involving human subjects. Experimental subjects were recruited consecutively from patients with diagnosed bilateral POAG or ocular hypertension at the Hamilton Glaucoma Center of the University of California, San Diego, a tertiary ophthalmic clinic, with predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. All subjects enrolled in this study were between 40 and 80&#x02005;years old with untreated IOP equal to or above 22&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg during office hours. Criteria for the diagnosis of glaucoma and ocular hypertension have been described previously.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> In brief, patients with ocular hypertension had untreated IOP over 21&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg during the most recent two or more office visits, but otherwise normal optic discs and visual fields. Patients with POAG had abnormalities in optic discs or visual fields (or both). Subjects were fully informed about this study, and informed consents were obtained.</p><p>Subjects who smoked, had previous glaucoma surgery in either eye, had a history of ocular trauma or a sleep disorder, or had an irregular sleep schedule were excluded. All subjects&#x02019; medical history was reviewed and each subject had an eye examination, including slit-lamp biomicroscopy, gonioscopy, Goldmann applanation tonometry (Haag-Streit, Mason, Ohio, USA), dilated fundoscopy, and a visual field test. Individuals with ocular inflammation, narrow iridocorneal angle, severe cardiovascular or diabetic condition, or use of a systemic &#x003b2;-blocker for treating high blood pressure were excluded. Routine systemic medications used by the subjects were documented and subjects with a change in the systemic medications during the study period would be excluded.</p><p>Subjects were either treatment na&#x000ef;ve or washed out from a prior glaucoma medication 4&#x02005;weeks prior to enrolment at the discretion of the ophthalmologist. Subjects were instructed to maintain a daily 8&#x02005;h regular sleep schedule for 1&#x02005;week before the laboratory recording, and this 8&#x02005;h period was referred to as the nocturnal/sleep period. Individual sleep periods were verified using a wrist monitor for light exposure and arm movements (Actiwatch, Mini Mitter, Sunriver, Oregon, USA) and a wake/sleep log. Subjects were asked to abstain from alcohol for 3&#x02005;days and coffee for 1&#x02005;day before the laboratory session beginning at approximately 14:00 hours. Baseline data of 24&#x02005;h IOP in a sleep laboratory were collected. Subjects were then treated with bimatoprost 0.01% in both eyes one time nightly approximately a half hour before bedtime. The bimatoprost 0.01% treatment lasted for 4&#x02005;weeks before the second 24&#x02005;h laboratory recording.</p><p>Laboratory conditions and general experimental procedures have been described previously.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> The 8&#x02005;h nocturnal/sleep period in the laboratory for each subject was adjusted to correspond to the recorded bedtime in the previous week. Clock times for the IOP measurements were also individualised. However, laboratory data were aligned as if each subject had a nocturnal/sleep period from 23:00 to 07:00 hours. The actual length of sleep in the laboratory may be less than 8&#x02005;h in some subjects. Subjects were encouraged to continue normal indoor activities in the laboratory. Food and water were available, and meal times were not regulated. During the second laboratory recording, subjects self-administered the bimatoprost 0.01% eye drops under supervision at approximately 22:30 hours.</p><p>IOP, blood pressure and heart rate were measured every 2&#x000a0;h. Experienced researchers performed the measurements in three random shifts. Their interindividual variations of IOP measurements were confirmed as insignificant (within &#x000b1;2&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg). IOP was measured using a calibrated pneumatonometer (Reichert, Depew, New York, USA). Topical 0.5% proparacaine was used as the local anaesthetic. Every plot of IOP measurement was evaluated according to commonly accepted standards.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Blood pressure and heart rate were measured immediately before the IOP measurements using an automated arm monitor (Accutorr Plus, Datascope Inc., Montvale, New Jersey, USA). The cuff was mounted over the brachial artery, level with the heart and removed after the measurement. Before bedtime, measurements were taken at 15:30, 17:30, 19:30 and 21:30 hours. Subjects were instructed to lie in bed for 5&#x000a0;min before the supine measurements and then to sit for 5&#x000a0;min before the sitting measurements. Lights in individual sleep rooms were turned off at 23:00 hours. Measurements were taken supine only at 23:30, 01:30, 03:30 and 05:30 hours. Subjects were awakened, and the measurements were taken immediately. A dim red room light of less than 10 lux was used to assist the measurements. Some sleep disturbance was unavoidable because of the nocturnal measurements, and the levels of blood pressure and IOP may be influenced by the measurement procedure. However, both laboratory sessions are affected, and effects of sleep disturbance and nocturnal measurement procedures on IOP may be insignificant.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Room lighting was restored at 07:00 hours, and subjects were awakened. Measurements were taken at 07:30, 09:30, 11:30 and 13:30&#x02009;hours. Timings of the measurements were documented using infrared camera recording.</p><p>Data of IOP from both eyes were averaged. Mean arterial blood pressure was calculated as the diastolic blood pressure plus one-third of the difference between the systolic and the diastolic blood pressures. Means of IOP, blood pressure and heart rate were calculated for the diurnal period (eight readings between 07:00 and 23:00 hours) and the nocturnal period (four readings between 23:00 &#x000a0;and 07:00 hours). Diurnal and nocturnal OPP in different body positions were calculated, using previously described formulae based on the mean blood pressure and IOP, adjusted for the height of the eye over the heart:<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Sitting OPP=95/140&#x000d7;mean blood pressure&#x02212;IOP</p></list-item><list-item><p>Supine OPP=115/130&#x000d7;mean blood pressure&#x02212;IOP</p></list-item></list><p>Statistical comparisons of study parameters were performed between the bimatoprost 0.01% treatment and the baseline using the paired t-test.

The nocturnal IOP-lowering efficacy of bimatoprost 0.01% was less than that of the diurnal period, similar to previous studies with latanoprost and travoprost.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Posture was not a factor in the modulated nocturnal IOP-lowering efficacy since IOP measurements under treatment in the supine position demonstrated greater IOP reduction during the wake period than at night. It is possible that the difference in diurnal and nocturnal efficacies is related to the pharmacokinetics of prostaglandin analogues given once a day in the evening.</p><p>Reduced OPP could enhance glaucomatous optic nerve damage. POAG patients often have their lowest blood pressures at night, and a reduction in nocturnal blood pressure may lower perfusion pressure to ocular tissues.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> The present study demonstrated that the systolic, diastolic and mean blood pressures did not significantly change over the 24&#x02005;h period with bimatoprost 0.01% treatment compared to baseline. In contrast, the diurnal and nocturnal OPP significantly increased under bimatoprost 0.01% treatment, reflecting the fact that treatment significantly decreased IOP. This increase in OPP may have favourable implications in the treatment of glaucoma. However, the study population was skewed because we only included those patients with office-hour IOP measurements of 22&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg or greater. Most patients (13 of 16) enrolled in the present study were with ocular hypertension, not with POAG. This selection bias allowed for a potentially greater reduction of IOP. Consequently, there may not be a significant effect of bimatoprost 0.01% on OPP during the diurnal or nocturnal period for glaucoma patients with IOP less than 22&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg.</p><p>Bimatoprost 0.01% was formulated with the goal of improving the safety profile and tolerability of the medication while maintaining the IOP-lowering effect of bimatoprost 0.03%. This would be achieved by lowering the concentration of bimatoprost and increasing the concentration of benzalkonium chloride (0.05&#x02013;0.2%), a commonly used preservative that increases corneal penetration and intraocular bioavailability of topically applied medications.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Whether or not the formulation used for bimatoprost 0.01% may have modified the time-dependent IOP-lowering profile of bimatoprost 0.03% cannot be answered by the present study.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23&#x02013;26</xref></p><p>In summary, bimatoprost 0.01% monotherapy results in IOP lowering both during the diurnal/wake and nocturnal/sleep periods, with the IOP-lowering effect being greater in the waking hours. Moreover, bimatoprost 0.01% significantly increases OPP over the 24&#x02005;h period.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e134" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2012-001106.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e135" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2012-001106.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> All authors made a significant contribution in designing the study, performing the experiments, evaluating the results and writing the manuscript.
