Physical exercise may increase accumulation of free radicals and induce oxidative stress <sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. During strenuous exercise, there is a dramatic increase in oxygen uptake in the skeletal muscle <sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>, and antioxidant defense system may temporarily become overwhelmed by insufficiency of endogenous antioxidants. Therefore, supplementation with antioxidants may be one intervention to reduce oxidative stress <sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>. Antioxidant is defined as any mechanism, structure and/or substance that delays, prevents or removes oxidative modifications on a target molecule <sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>.</p><p id="P6">L-carnitine (L-3-hydroxytrimethylaminobutanoate) is a naturally occurring compound that can be synthesized in mammals from the essential amino acids lysine and methionine or ingested through diet <sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>. L-carnitine is required for mitochondrial long-chain fatty acid oxidation <sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>. L-carnitine is also reported to possess antioxidant properties <sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>. The antioxidant benefits have been implicated in several forms of toxicity <sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup>. To the best of our knowledge, there is a paucity of investigation about the effect of L-carnitine as an antioxidant on exercise-induced oxidative stress and muscle damage <sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup>. Although there are lots of studies about the effects of L-carnitine supplementation on fatty acid oxidation <sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup>, and a plenty of works about its influence on some diseases <sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup>, we did not find any work on the effect of L-carnitine on exercise-induced oxidative stress as an antioxidant. In recent years, there has been strong interest in the effect of antioxidant supplementations such as vitamin C and E on exercise-induced oxidative stress. In our previous works, we observed the significant effects of vitamin C <sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup> and Methylesulfonylmethane (MSM) supplementation<sup>[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup> as antioxidants on exercise-induced oxidative stress. Because L-carnitine has been such a prevalent ergogenic substance among athletes, we decided to evaluate antioxidant properties of this supplement during heavy endurance-like exercise.</p><p id="P7">Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of 2-week L-carnitine supplementation on exercise-induced oxidative stress and muscle damage in young active healthy men.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>METHODS AND SUBJECTS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Participants</title><p id="P8">Twenty-one active healthy young men volunteered for this study.

There was no significant difference between the two groups&#x02019; running records (P group: 73&#x000b1;8.2 versus C group: 71&#x000b1;6.8 min) possibly because they had been matched on the basis of their VO<sub>2max</sub>.</p><p id="P23">In the present study, similar to our previous study <sup>[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup>, 14Km running has been able to induce oxidative stress after exercise. It can be seen in <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> that MDA- TBARS concentration as a marker of lipid peroxidation significantly increased after exercise in both groups demonstrating 14 km continuous running in our subjects has been able to begin oxidative stress. VO<sub>2max</sub> of our subjects were not so high (40-50 ml/kg/min) in this study, indicating possibly why 14 km running has been able to initiate exercise-induced oxidative stress.</p><p id="P24"> Furthermore, in our previous works, we had considered supplementation with some antioxidants such as vitamin C and MSM in similar supplementation patterns and had been able to attenuate exercise-induced oxidative stress and muscle damage markers<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>-<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup>. L-carnitine is reported to possess antioxidant properties. In the present study, it seems 2-week L-carnitine supplementation has been able to increase antioxidant capacity in C group compared with P group (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Furthermore, TAC was significantly higher in C group than P group 24h after exercise showing the possible effect of L-carnitine supplementation on exercise&#x02013;induced oxidative stress.</p><p id="P25">Assessment of MDA-TBARS changes further supports this hypothesis. MDA-TBARS as a marker of lipid peroxidation significantly increased immediately and 24h afterwards in P group and just immediately after exercise in C group (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). MDA-TBARS concentration is significantly lower in C group compared with P group 24h after exercise demonstrating possible influence of antioxidant properties of L-carnitine. It seems 2-week administration of L-carnitine as an antioxidant has been able to blunt lipid peroxidation via enhancement of antioxidant capacity.</p><p id="P26">The other finding of our study was promotion of CK and LDH as indirect markers of muscle damage. CK and LDH significantly increased immediately after, as well as 2 and 24h after exercise in both groups, (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> and <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) indicating the intensity and duration of exercise was enough to cause muscle damage in our participants. In C group, LDH was significantly higher than P group 2h after exercise. Furthermore, Both CK and LDH were lower in C group than P group 24h after exercise showing the possible effect of L-carnitine supplementation. According to <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, the pattern of alterations in MDA-TBARS is almost similar in CK and LDH. There is significant reduction in all of these markers 24h after exercise in C group compared to P group. The potential reason of this phenomenon is possibly decrease of membrane permeability and escape of constituents such as CK and LDH via inhibition of lipid peroxidation possibly stemming from antioxidant supplementation in our study <sup>[<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="s5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p id="P27">The present study demonstrates that an acute bout of exercise can induce oxidative stress in active healthy young men. Two-week daily oral supplementation with L-carnitine has some alleviating effects on lipid peroxidation and muscle damage indices in favour of increased antioxidant capacity. Nevertheless, the exact mechanism of L-carnitine in attenuating the markers of oxidative stress is not well established and further exploration is needed.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="S6"><p>We
