Platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) is one of the newer modalities and it contains fibroblast growth factor (GF), vascular endothelial GF, angiopoitin and platelet-derived GF which enhances the wound healing. Hence, we conducted a randomised controlled trial to compare the efficacy of PRF versus saline dressing in chronic venous leg ulcers.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Aim:</title><p>This study aims to compare the efficacy of autologous PRF with saline dressing in patients with chronic venous leg ulcer and to compare the mean reduction in ulcer area at the end of 4 weeks.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>Fifteen patients with chronic venous leg ulcers of &#x0003e;6 months duration having an ulcer area of 1 cm &#x000d7; 1 cm to 5 cm &#x000d7; 5 cm were taken into the study and were randomly divided into two groups. Group 1: Patients received PRF dressing. Ten millilitres of patient's blood was taken and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 15 min. A fibrin clot obtained in the middle of the tube was removed and used for dressing over the wound surface. It was repeated every week for 4 weeks.

Moist occlusive dressings with saline are known to improve wound healing. Platelet concentrates have been widely used in regenerative medicine to promote wound healing as they contain transforming growth factor (GF) F, platelet-derived GF, vascular-endothelial GF, platelet derived epidermal GF, insulin-like GF-I and basic fibroblast GF.

It forms an organised network where the platelets and leucocytes are concentrated leading to the sustained release of various GFs, resulting in wound healing. Hence, it can also be used for the treatment of venous ulcers.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>A study conducted by Margolis <italic>et al</italic>. which included 26,599 patients, concluded that patients who were treated with products derived from platelets, tend to heal faster than patients who were treated without the products derived from platelets. He also concluded that even though the ulcers that were treated with these derivatives were bigger and deeper than the other groups these showed better improvement at the end of 12 weeks.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Our study showed similar results where ulcers treated with PRF showed better and faster improvement when compared to saline dressing.</p><p>In another study, Anitua <italic>et al</italic>. showed that healing increased significantly with the help of PRF. She also concluded that it not only helps in supplying the required GFs but also by forming fibrin matrix which helps in cell migration, it also helps in neo-vascularisation.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] In this study, there was a mean reduction of ulcer size of 85.51% in the group treated with PRF at the end of 4 weeks.</p><p>In another study Mazzucco <italic>et al</italic>. concluded that healing is improved and is much faster when the wound is treated with platelet-rich gel. He stated that this also helps to reduce the hospital stay. In his study, he demonstrated that in patients who were treated with platelet-rich gel the wound healed in 3.5 weeks and the wounds which were not treated with platelet-rich gel took 6 weeks.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] In our study, 55.55% of patients treated with PRF had complete closure at the end of 4 weeks, whereas no patient treated with saline had complete closure.</p><p>In another conducted by Saldalamacchia <italic>et al</italic>., it was concluded that the use of PRF had significant effectiveness in the treatment of ulcers. He stated that the use of PRF had better reduction of area of ulcer when compared with the basic wound care without the use of PRF. He concluded that though in his study he treated the patients with PRF for a short time it showed good improvement.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Similarly, in our study, we found mean reduction of 85.51% in ulcer area at the end of 4 weeks in patients treated with PRF which is faster when compared to saline group.</p><p>A study carried out by O'Connell <italic>et al</italic>., concluded that the treatment of venous and non-venous ulcers had different outcomes. He showed that the patients who had venous ulcers and were treated with PRF membrane had a total closure of wound in 66.7% of patients. Whereas patients with ulcers of non-venous origin had total closure in only 44% of patients. Hence, he proved that PRF was very efficacious in the treatment of venous ulcers.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>In many studies, there was no significant improvement in the ulcers treated with saline dressing.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Our study showed 42.74% reduction in ulcer size when treated with saline dressing, however, this was less when compared to the 85.51% ulcer area reduction in the PRF dressing group.</p><p>Although we had good reduction in the ulcer size in the patients treated with PRF, we need to validate the results with a larger sample size.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>This procedure is simple, patient-friendly, cost-effective, painless and can be performed as an outpatient procedure. We would like to conclude that the use of PRF dressings as an adjuvant therapy in the treatment of chronic venous ulcer shows great potential to achieve complete closure of ulcers and can successfully be used as a routine procedure in the management.</p><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-6" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>R<sc>EFERENCES</sc></title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bergqvist</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Lindholm</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Nelz&#x000e9;n</surname><given-names>O</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Chronic leg ulcers: The impact of venous disease</article-title><source>J Vasc Surg</source><year>1999</year><volume>29</volume><fpage>752</fpage><lpage>5</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">10194512</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Evans</surname><given-names>CJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Fowkes</surname><given-names>FG</given-names></name><name><surname>Ruckley</surname><given-names>CV</given-names></name><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>AJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Prevalence of varicose veins and chronic venous insufficiency in men and women in the general population: Edinburgh Vein Study</article-title><source>J Epidemiol Community Health</source><year>1999</year><volume>53</volume><fpage>149</fpage><lpage>53</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">10396491</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Mayer</surname><given-names>W</given-names></name><name><surname>Jochmann</surname><given-names>W</given-names></name><name><surname>Partsch</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Varicose ulcer: Healing in conservative therapy.
