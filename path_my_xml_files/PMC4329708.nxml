CNV lesions were also classified into three subgroups according to lesion size; smaller than 2 disc areas, 2&#x02013;4 disc areas, and larger than 4 disc areas. However, lesions did not exceed 8 disc areas (including blood, scar or atrophy and neovascularization), of which at least 50% had to be active CNV.

Lens opacities were graded from 0 to 4 + using the Lens Opacities Classification System III (LOCS III) for each of the three different categories including nuclear sclerosis, posterior subcapsular opacities, and cortical cataracts.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p><p>Eligible eyes were randomly assigned to receive vertoporfin PDT plus intravitreal bevacizumab (IVB) or a combination of PDT and bevacizumab/triamcinolone (IVB/IVT). Subjects were initially allocated in a 1:1 ratio. Patients in the dual treatment group underwent standard PDT followed by intravitreal injection of 1.25 mg/0.05 ml bevacizumab (Avastin, made for F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd. Basel, Switzerland by Genentech Inc., San Francisco, USA) after 48 h. In the triple treatment group, 2 mg triamcinolone acetonide (Triamhexal, Hexal AG, Holzkirchen, Germany) was injected intravitreally in addition to the above. IVB injections were performed using a 30-gauge needle inserted through the superior temporal pars plana 3.75 mm and 3.25 mm from the limbus in phakic and pseudophakic eyes respectively. Triamcinolone acetonide (TA) was injected employing a separate syringe in the inferior temporal quadrant. Topical chloramphenicol eye drops was administered 6-hourly for 3 days following each injection. All patients were examined on the 1<sup>st</sup> day after injection particularly for signs of intraocular inflammation. IOP was re-evaluated at weeks 1 and 3; topical antiglaucoma medication was initiated in participants with IOP values of 21 mmHg or higher. Ophthalmic examinations and OCT were repeated at week 12 and then at 6-week intervals. Furthermore, FA was repeated upon the surgeon's discretion. Need for retreatment with IVB injection was first evaluated at week 12. Additional IVB injections were given in eyes with active CNV according to clinical findings (including decrease in VA and/or hemorrhage on fundus examinations), and/or fluid on OCT, and/or persistence or recurrence of dye leakage on FA. Neither PDT nor IVT injection were not repeated during the follow-up period.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Outcome Measures</title><p>The primary outcome measure was change in BCVA from baseline.

Triple therapy demonstrated a trend toward obviating the need for retreatment and lengthening the injection-free period; the difference between the two groups however did not reach a statistically significant level. In a study by Tatar et al., IVT injection contributed to enhanced levels of endostatin as an endogenous angiogenesis inhibitor but could not suppress VEGF.

Furthermore, recent studies have shown that combined use of bevacizumab may prolong the duration of choroidal hypofluorescence following PDT administration.[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] This may carry a paradoxical consequence; it may lessen the need for retreatment despite increasing the risk of atrophic changes. The reduction of the blood flow at CNV may also delay its recurrence.[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] Similar results have been reported in combination therapy with PDT and intravitreal/subtenon triamcinolone.[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref><xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref><xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]</p><p>In the study by Hatta et al.,[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] the rate of retreatment was significantly lower when choroidal hypofluorescence was induced by a combination of PDT and bevacizumab compared with PDT plus subtenon TA. In the present study, adding IVT to the study regimen did not worsen the functional results nor significantly reduce retreatment rate; all of which suggest that it did not accentuate the possible hypofluorescence induced by the combination of IVB and PDT.</p><p>In a recent prospective open-label interventional trial, Sivaprassad et al.[<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] assessed the safety and efficacy of a quadruple combination treatment for management of neovascular AMD, which included reduced fluence PDT, intravitreal ranibizumab, intravitreal dexamethasone and oral minocycline. Intravitreal injection of ranibizumab was exclusively performed as a retreatment and was administered in cases of CNV recurrence. After 12 months, vision stabilization was achieved in most cases rather than visual improvement. They applied both single-session and half fluence PDT to reduce the risks of choroidal hypoperfusion, inflammation, vascular leakage and VEGF upregulation. Dexamethasone, being more rapidly cleared from circulation than triamcinolone, was administered to lower the risk of raised IOP and cataract formation. The TA dose employed in our study did not result in significant adverse events either. Intravitreal injection of steroid was performed for only a single session in both studies. Sivaprassad et al. attributed the absence of an initial steep gradient of visual gain in their series to the use of only one intravitreal ranibizumab injection at baseline instead of repeated injections during the induction phase. The results of our study however did not support this assumption; significant functional and structural improvement was observed in both groups of our series despite a single intravitreal injection of bevacizumab at baseline. The major difference between these two studies was the method used for photodynamic therapy, standard versus reduced fluence. The mean number of ranibizumab injections was 3.4 (range: 2.6) within 1-year in Sivaprasad's study while the corresponding figures were 1.3 &#x000b1; 1.1 and 0.9 &#x000b1; 0.9 injections in the IVB and IVB/IVT groups respectively in our study.</p><p>In a retrospective analysis of triple combination therapy with IVB, posterior sub-Tenon's TA injection and low-fluence PDT in patients with neovascular AMD, significant 3- and 6-month visual improvement and CMT reduction was observed by Kovacs et al.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] At the 3-month time point, 16.7% of eyes required retreatment and the corresponding figures were 40.9% by 6 months and 61.1% by 12 months.</p><p>The results of the above-mentioned study were comparable to our findings although they applied half-fluence PDT as well. The discrepancy between the outcomes of these two studies, despite similarities of the employed methods, may originate from varieties in the presenting lesions.</p><p>Yip et al.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] followed a triple combination therapy containing single session standard PDT, 1.25 mg IVB, and 4 mg IVT; they repeated IVB injection at month 3 for residual leakage. From a total of 36 eyes, 28 (77.8%) achieved CNV resolution by a single course of triple therapy. At 6 months, 61.1% of eyes had stable or improving vision. The rate of IVT induced side-effects was relatively high; 3 eyes developed significant cataracts requiring surgery and 2 demonstrated persistent raised IOP at 6 months. In discussing the cause of retreatment frequencies in Yip's study[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] compared to our previous report,[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Kovacs[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] pointed to the possible effect of higher IVT dose in the former study. The same high dose may conversely explain the higher complication rates in the Yip's study[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] compared with our triple treatment protocol.</p><p>Mataix et al.[<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] recently performed a prospective interventional study on combined ranibizumab and PDT for treatment of AMD and considered it as an option for improving treatment efficiency. They used a single initial dose of PDT similar to our method combined with intravitreal ranibizumab and employed the same criteria as ours for retreatment. However, their retreatment method consisted of monthly intravitreal injections of ranibizumab and performing PDT every 3 months. There was a significant visual improvement after 12 months with mean gain of 7.2 letters, the mean number of PDT sessions per patient was 1.22 and that for ranibizumab injections per patient was 2.37 at 12 months. Nevertheless, we did not repeat PDT to minimize potential side-effects of this treatment modality.</p><p>Spielberg and Leys[<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] performed a prospective nonrandomized, open-label study on 27 eyes with neovascular AMD. They used a single-time reduced-fluence PDT combined with intravitreal injection of ranibizumab on the same day. Second and third intravitreal injections were also given as a mandatory regimen. Additional treatment with ranibizumab was performed as needed. There was a significant visual improvement with an average of 5.1 injections during the 1<sup>st</sup> year and 7.1 injections over 24 months. This study lacked a control group but they applied a method similar to one of our study arms and their 2-year results were comparable with our 1-year findings. In addition, they used a single-session PDT technique with reduced fluence. The other difference between these two studies was the number of mandatory injections of an anti-VEGF drug which was 3 in Spielberg's study against 1 in our trial.</p><p>In a multivariate analysis using mixed model, the simultaneous effects of various factors on BCVA and CMT were studied.[<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] The possible effects of these parameters on the alteration trends of study outcome measures were also dynamically evaluated; increasing age had a negative effect on BCVA as expected.[<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] The possible deleterious effects of PED on the outcomes of pharmacological treatments in AMD patients have also been reported.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] While there was a correlation between baseline and post-treatment BCVA in our study, the results of DENALI study showed that lower baseline BCVA was associated with higher BCVA gains.[<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] Regarding CMT changes, there was a correlation between structural and functional outcomes in our study which is consistent with previous reports.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] RAP showed a deleterious effect on CMT which is in accordance with previous studies.[<xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] The mixed model in this RCT correlated with subgroup analyses in the DENALI study.[<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]</p><p>Ophthalmic complications including sustained ocular hypertension, endophthalmitis, significant progression of lens opacity necessitating cataract surgery, RPE rupture, and subretinal hemorrhage were not observed in our series. No thromboembolic event was observed either.</p><p>When the primary outcome measure was taken into account, the <italic>post-hoc</italic> power of this RCT was above 80% before month 5. However, this figure dropped gradually up to month 12. This limitation of our clinical trial could be attributed to loss to follow-up.</p><p>In conclusion, in patients with neovascular AMD, adding a low dose intravitreal triamcinolone to the combined regimen of single session PDT and intravitreal bevacizumab does not reveal beneficial effects on BCVA and CMT. However, a trend towards extending the injection-free period may be achieved using triple therapy.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil.</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><article-title>Treatment of age-related macular degeneration with photodynamic therapy (TAP) Study Group.
