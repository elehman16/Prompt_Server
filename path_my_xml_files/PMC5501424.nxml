PD is diagnosed according to the presence of motor features (tremor, rigidity, slowed movement) caused by the loss of dopamine-producing cells in the midbrain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">Clinical management is focused on using dopaminergic replacement drugs to alleviate the cardinal motor signs. These drugs remediate motor features by increasing availability of dopamine using levodopa and/or monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and/or by mimicking the action of dopamine using second-generation dopamine agonists such as immediate- or slow-release preparations of pramipexole or ropinirole [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par18">Dopaminergic medication can also have a significant effect on cognitive function. Evidence indicates that the requisite dopaminergic state necessary to control motor signs has the potential to move a patient away from his or her optimum for certain cognitive functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The relationship between the efficiency of neuronal activity and the state of dopaminergic modulation in the <sc>l</sc>-dopa overdose hypothesis is represented by a Yerkes&#x02013;Dodson inverted U-shaped curve, with cognitive functions declining with deviation away from optimum dopamine levels, indicated by the centre of the curve. Extrapolating this model to cued recall implies that dopaminergic medication has the capacity to both improve and impair this kind of memory, depending on baseline dopamine levels in the underlying neural circuitry.</p><p id="Par19">We have recently reported a series of studies in which cued recall of recently experienced events is impaired in medicated patients with PD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Interpreting these findings in the context of the <sc>l</sc>-dopa overdose hypothesis theory implies at least two competing explanations: either dopaminergic medication is overdosing &#x02018;relatively normal&#x02019; dopamine levels in those brain areas supporting memory or dopaminergic drugs are reducing the severity of a PD-related dopamine depletion in the brain areas supporting memory.</p><p id="Par20">We explored these alternative predictions in an open-label, nonrandomized pilot of 24 patients with PD in the early (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;12) and moderate (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;12) disease stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The patients&#x02019; memory was compared to that of a group of 24 matched healthy controls. To compare the effects of medication on memory, testing took place when the patients were in a medicated or &#x02018;ON&#x02019; state, and also on a different occasion following a 24-hour washout period before the patients took their next medication, and so were in an unmedicated or &#x02018;OFF&#x02019; state. Memory was also assessed on 2 occasions in the healthy controls, who were not taking any medication, to control for practice effects. The pilot revealed three key findings:</p><p id="Par21">Firstly, compared to the healthy control performance, the PD group exhibited a cued recall deficit when tested OFF medication, indicating a PD-related memory decline.</p><p id="Par22">Secondly, the severity of the patients&#x02019; memory decline increased when the same patients were tested ON medication, suggesting that dopaminergic medication increases the severity of a PD-related decline in memory.</p><p id="Par23">Thirdly, the ON medication decline in memory was most pronounced in a subset of patients medicated with the second-generation non-ergot dopamine agonist pramipexole prolonged-release (abbreviated subsequently to pramipexole), with patients on the second-generation non-ergot dopamine agonist ropinirole modified-release (abbreviated to ropinirole) showing a less severe decline. These preliminary findings were replicated in a further open-label nonrandomized, parallel-group study of 21 patients with PD medicated with either pramipexole or ropinirole [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p id="Par24">While these were intriguing findings that had not previously been reported in either the scientific or medical literature, the study design meant that the effects of confounding variables, such as demographic and or clinical differences between the patients on either pramipexole or ropinirole, could not be ruled out.</p><p id="Par25">Thus, the aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of a crossover design to explore the effects of pramipexole and ropinirole on memory in patients with idiopathic PD without cognitive impairment.</p><p id="Par26">As the design required patients to switch from their prescribed dopamine agonist (pramipexole-to-ropinirole, or ropinirole-to-pramipexole), the primary objectives were to (a) examine the efficacy of processes and procedures used to manage symptoms during the washout period and (b) to use cued recall estimates to inform a power calculation for a definitive trial.</p><p id="Par27">The secondary objectives were to assess (i) rates of consent and missing data; (ii) acceptability of the support provided for the OFF medication sessions and whether the OFF session itself was manageable; (iii) the experience of switching between the investigational medicinal products (IMPs), i.e. ropinirole and pramipexole, assessed at the mid- and end-of-study clinic visits and in the semi-structured interview administered at the end of the trial; and (iv) barriers to participation for eligible patients and informal carer givers.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par28">The reporting of the study follows the CONSORT statement recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design</title><p id="Par29">This 24-month feasibility study was a single-centre, single-blind, randomized study of two IMPs, ropinirole and pramipexole, in male and female patients with a confirmed primary diagnosis of idiopathic PD without cognitive impairment.</p><p id="Par30">Patients were recruited on one of these agonists, and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to two treatment arms. The arms differed only in the sequence the IMPs were administered (pramipexole then ropinirole, or ropinirole then pramipexole).</p><p id="Par31">Patient-participants commenced their first trial IMP without a &#x02018;run-in&#x02019; or washout period. They were stabilized on this IMP for 6&#x000a0;weeks, and then, their memory was tested on two separate occasions in the following 2&#x000a0;weeks: in one session, the memory was tested 90&#x000a0;min after taking the IMP (ON), and on a separate occasion, the memory was assessed following 24&#x02013;48&#x000a0;h of IMP withdrawal (OFF).</p><p id="Par32">The OFF session was preceded by a withdrawal period that resulted in 93.75% (four half-lives) IMP elimination. After four half-lives, the amount of drug remaining (6.25%) is considered to be negligible regarding its therapeutic effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p id="Par33">The order of ON and OFF sessions was counterbalanced.</p><p id="Par34">A CONSORT diagram showing key stages of the study design is presented in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>CONSORT diagram showing key stages of study design</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="40814_2017_154_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>

Patients were given an opportunity to ask any questions. Consent was obtained before any study procedures took place.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Recruitment</title><p id="Par38">Recruitment commenced in April 2013. The target population was males and females aged 50&#x02013;80&#x000a0;years with idiopathic, sporadic PD as determined by the UK Parkinson&#x02019;s Disease Society Brain Bank Clinical Diagnostic Criteria, with a Hoehn&#x02013;Yahr disease severity stage of 1&#x02013;4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p id="Par39">The target number of complete datasets was 50. The sample size was determined in terms of obtaining sufficiently precise estimates (as represented by the width of a 95% confidence interval) of key parameters that would inform a power calculation for a subsequent main trial. A figure of 50 is supported by reports on sample sizes for pilots with continuous outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p id="Par40">Eligible patients were identified from the sponsor&#x02019;s (University Hospital of North Midlands NHS Trust) Department of Neurology using the PD database and clinic lists, the GPs in Staffordshire (acting as participant identification sites), the chief investigator&#x02019;s private practice, local pharmacies, advertisements in local newspapers and recruitment talks given to local PD associations.</p><p id="Par41">Patients entered the study on one of the two IMPs within the approved dosage range. The maximum dosage of each IMP, as specified in the summary of product characteristics, was pramipexole 0.52&#x02013;3.15&#x000a0;mg once daily and ropinirole 2&#x02013;12&#x000a0;mg once daily [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p><p id="Par42">Patients were maintained on the same or equivalent therapeutic dose for the stabilization periods and for the ON medication research session, using published conversion norms, unless clinical indications suggested modification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Randomization procedure</title><p id="Par43">Once the consent form had been signed, the chief investigator randomized the patient to the treatment arms.</p><p id="Par44">Third-party randomization, in a 1:1 ratio, took place during the screening clinic visit using a locked system that automated the random assignment of treatment groups to randomization numbers. The third-party randomization protocol was a web-based programme, hosted by Keele University, and was on a password-protected site.</p><p id="Par45">The patient&#x02019;s randomization code was recorded in the medical records and case report form. This information was stored on-line, was read-only and could be accessed by the chief investigator and research nurse at any point during the trial.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Level and method of blinding</title><p id="Par46">During the trial, the patients and the clinical members of the research team (chief investigator, research nurse) were not blind to the medication codes. The patients could not be blinded as they saw the physical nature of the tablets, and the chief investigator and research nurse managing the patients needed to know how to advise the patients at the beginning of each treatment phase of the trial, and when switching between the IMPs, and how to prepare for the medication withdrawal period.</p><p id="Par47">Only the research assistant administering the cued recall memory test during the ON and OFF research sessions was blind to the medication codes. The medication codes were not made available to the research assistant until each patient had completed the trial, with his/her data scored and entered into the database.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Outcomes</title><p id="Par48">The two primary outcomes were efficacy of processes and procedures used to manage symptoms during the washout period (measured in relation to adverse events) and estimates of cued recall performance (to inform the sample size calculation). The secondary outcomes were rates of consent and missing data, acceptability of the support provided for the OFF medication sessions and whether the OFF session itself was manageable, the experience of switching between IMPs (assessed at the semi-structured interview administered at the end of the trial) and barriers to participation for eligible patients and informal carer givers (semi-structured interview).</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Enrolment and study visits</title><p id="Par49">Patients completing the feasibility trial were intended to participate for a maximum period of no longer than 16&#x000a0;weeks.

Medication was resumed following completion of the session, according to criteria discussed with the chief investigator. The ON medication and OFF medication sessions for each drug should have taken place during a 7-day window, on separate days separated by at least 3&#x000a0;days. The order of the ON and OFF research sessions was determined by the randomization programme.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Washout periods</title><p id="Par59">A single washout period, between the first and second IMP, was used to eliminate a carryover effect. The elimination half-life for each drug is 8&#x02013;12&#x000a0;h for pramipexole in older patients, falling at the upper end of the range: 6&#x000a0;h for ropinirole and 3&#x000a0;h for <sc>l</sc>-dopa and monoamine oxidase B inhibitors.</p><p id="Par60">To achieve 93.75% elimination of each drug (equating to four half-lives), the following washout periods were required: pramipexole, 48&#x000a0;h (4&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;12&#x000a0;h); ropinirole, 24&#x000a0;h (4&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;6&#x000a0;h); <sc>l</sc>-dopa and monoamine oxidase B inhibitors, 12&#x000a0;h (4&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;3&#x000a0;h). At the mid-study clinic visit, patients were given the second IMP, which they took until the end-of-study visit.</p><p id="Par61">During the washout period, patients continued to take <sc>l</sc>-dopa and/or monoamine oxidase B inhibitor as usual. The half-lives of these drugs are shorter than those of the IMPs, and therefore, the washout period required for 93.75% elimination of <sc>l</sc>-dopa and monoamine oxidase inhibitor (half-life is between 2 and 3&#x000a0;h) is 12&#x000a0;h. <sc>l</sc>-dopa and monoamine oxidase inhibitors were withdrawn 12&#x000a0;h (overnight) before the OFF research session. The OFF session took place in the morning, following a washout period resulting in four half-lives of the drug being eliminated (i.e. 93.75%).</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Data security and monitoring</title><p id="Par62">A research risk assessment of the feasibility trial was carried out by the chief investigator and the regulatory research associate from the sponsor&#x02019;s research and development department, prior to the preparation of the protocol. The first risk assessment was assessed as moderate by 1 point initially (1 point over the low to moderate risk boundary), but reassessed later as low-risk, requiring minimal mitigation.</p><p id="Par63">Validation procedures included regular data entry checks performed on a minimum of 25% of complete patient data by the monitor. All source data and trial documentation were available for trial-related monitoring. The patients consented for this within the consent process.</p><p id="Par64">Patients&#x02019; contact details were disclosed to the research assistant, for the purposes of arranging the four home visits to complete the memory assessment. All patient data collected by the research assistant were identified using a unique study code. This same code was used to enter patient data into the Microsoft Excel<sup>&#x000a9;</sup> database. Copies of signed informed consent forms were placed in the patient&#x02019;s medical records and originals retained in the trial file and kept separate from the data.</p><p id="Par65">Monitoring procedures were carried out by the sponsor and were in accordance with standard operating procedures. The monitor checked the case report forms, trial master file and other trial documentation for completeness and the compliance of the trial team with the protocol and good clinical practice (GCP) standards.

The corresponding effect of ropinirole is 0.007 (95% CI &#x02212;0.070, 0.084), indicating a somewhat smaller decrement in recall.

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par87">This study presented challenges to recruitment in both design and execution, and while it was a major aim of the study to assess this, evaluation of these challenges also provided the opportunity to explore how these could be overcome for future studies in this area. The study necessitated the use of different methods and approaches to identify and recruit eligible patient-participants. This included raising awareness using promotional material in local newspapers and pharmacies and establishing links with GP surgeries (Participant Identification Centres) through the Primary Care Research Network. However, the recruitment target of 50 was not met. Consequently, estimates of key parameters are somewhat imprecise; in particular, the wide confidence interval around the estimated treatment effect between the two IMPs suggests that this effect could plausibly lie between approximately &#x02013;0.10 and 0.14; the suggested minimum clinically important effect of 0.70 lies within this range but is somewhat larger than the point estimate of approximately 0.20. The small sample size also means that the probability of detecting adverse events is reduced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p><p id="Par88">The challenges and mitigations implemented included the development of a suite of study-specific standard operating procedures, including a named standard operating procedure controller. Infrastructure to support clinical trials of medicinal products was not optimum at study start-up. The organization underwent significant changes prior to and during the study. We now have clinical studies officers in place to support study set-up, which includes early engagement with support departments and academics that lead clinical trials of medicinal products (this includes a full risk assessment by the sponsor, which is now used to support the decision regarding capability/capacity to sponsor clinical trials of medicinal products). There are also dedicated study monitor roles within the department. The barriers-to-participation study identified four main themes: concerns that changing medication may worsen their PD symptoms and also fears about side effects; trial accessibility, e.g. the information sheet was long and too technical; fear of the research process; and worries about increasing the work load of spouses/informal carers.</p><p id="Par89">Recruitment challenges are particularly relevant in older populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], and the heterogeneous nature of PD means that achieving a sufficient homogeneous patient sample requires the implementation of very effective recruitment strategies. Individuals with PD are typically elderly and disabled; therefore, participation in clinical trials often requires the assistance of a caregiver, not only with hospital visits and organizing medication but also in the decision to participate itself.</p><p id="Par90">For drug trials in particular, patients with PD have positive perceptions of placebo-controlled trials, although they are strongly in favour of receiving the active agent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Furthermore, evidence suggests a preference for trial designs that include two active agents (or an active comparator) over placebo-controlled designs and indicates that this may facilitate recruitment due to patients being less likely to experience &#x02018;lessebo&#x02019; effects (the negative expectations associated to the administration of a placebo) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].</p><p id="Par91">The challenges of conducting research in PD are illustrated by a recent on-line 5-item survey by Mathur et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Their aim was to explore patients&#x02019; barriers to participation and researchers&#x02019; challenges in conducting drug trials in PD. From an estimated sample size exceeding 10,000 people, the proportion of respondents was around 3%. A total of 33 responses were from researchers and 263 from patients. From the researcher perspective, the main concerns were related to insufficient financial and administrative support. Of greater interest to our study was the overlap with Mathur et al.&#x02019;s patient-reported barriers: fear of potential adverse consequences, misconceptions regarding clinical trial systems, and issues related to a perceived lack of communication of relevant information between the research and patient communities.</p><p id="Par92">To address the generic as well as specific recruitment problems discussed above, we recommend adoption of the the &#x02018;QuinteT Recruitment Intervention&#x02019; (QRI), which aims to understand recruitment as it happens and then develop an action plan to address identified difficulties and optimize informed consent in collaboration with the CTU and chief investigator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. The QRI uses a combination of standard and innovative qualitative research methods with some simple quantification to understand recruitment and identify sources of difficulties.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par93">Recruitment rates to the main feasibility study were disappointing. Patient and informal caregiver concerns clearly influenced this and can, at least to some extent, be mitigated by improved communication, reassurance, exposure to the research team and awareness-raising. The sponsor now has improved capability to support CTIMPs. Going forward, the sponsor together with the research team is in a position to mitigate these challenges in a subsequent main trial, particularly in collaboration with a Clinical Trials Unit. Implementing these measures, together with integration of the QRI from the outset in order to prevent difficulties developing, and optimizing recruitment from the start, rather than applying it to an ongoing RCT experiencing recruitment shortfalls where time to rectify/address recruitment difficulties may be limited, and increase confidence that realistic recruitment targets, while still challenging, could be achieved.</p><p id="Par94">Delivering safe, effective and cost-effective pharmacological management of PD is a priority. It is important to communicate effectively to the patient community the importance of drug trials in developing new treatments and to engage patients and informal caregivers in the communication and promotion of research.</p><p id="Par95">It is important to note that this feasibility study does not provide and did not seek to provide firm evidence that dopaminergic medication affects memory. Therefore, people with PD should not change their medication based on the results of this study.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>CI</term><def><p id="Par11">Confidence interval</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GCP</term><def><p id="Par12">Good clinical practice</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IMP</term><def><p id="Par13">Investigational medicinal product</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PD</term><def><p id="Par14">Parkinson&#x02019;s disease</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SD</term><def><p id="Par15">Standard deviation</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par96">This study presents independent research funded by the National Institute for Health Research&#x02014;Research for Patient Benefit (RfPB) Programme (PB-PG-0211-24101).
