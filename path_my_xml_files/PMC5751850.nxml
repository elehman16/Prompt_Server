Studies showed that the rate of occurrence of hemiplegic shoulder pain varies from 16% to 84%.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-0269215517714830" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bibr2-0269215517714830" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Generally, it occurs within two to three months after stroke.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-0269215517714830" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bibr4-0269215517714830" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Patients with hemiplegic shoulder pain are prone to withdraw from rehabilitation programmes, stay longer in the hospital, experience limitation in limb movement and experience a reduction in quality of life. The causes of hemiplegic shoulder pain are subluxation, shoulder&#x02013;hand syndrome and spasticity, muscle flaccidity around shoulder joint, joint trauma during passive activities, brachial plexus injury, adhesive capsulitis, misuse syndrome, disuse syndrome and thalamic syndrome.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-0269215517714830" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bibr6-0269215517714830" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Several therapeutic approaches are proposed for treating hemiplegic shoulder pain, such as range of motion or stretching exercises, analgesic medications, electrical stimulation, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation and local injections. But none of these therapeutic strategies has proven to be effective. The finding above indicates that the ideal management of hemiplegic shoulder pain is prevention.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-0269215517714830" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Keeping a normal limb position in the early stage following stroke could prevent reflex stiffness, which is good for preventing shoulder pain.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-0269215517714830" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="bibr9-0269215517714830" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr10-0269215517714830" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup></p><p>Therefore, some supportive devices such as arm board, braces, slings and taping are often used for position correction.<sup><xref rid="bibr11-0269215517714830" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="bibr12-0269215517714830" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr13-0269215517714830" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr14-0269215517714830" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> However, a review showed that there was insufficient evidence to conclude that supportive devices could reduce hemiplegic shoulder pain, or increase upper limb function for patients following stroke.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-0269215517714830" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> For stroke patients, muscle flaccidity around shoulder joint could lead to over-stretching of the brachial plexus, while prolonged sitting in a wheelchair with an abnormal posture would aggravate reflex stiffness mode, which would accelerate the occurrence of shoulder pain. Therefore, in our study, we designed a modified wheelchair arm-support (patent no. ZL 201420200028.5), which could support the arm while maintaining a normal posture, and expected to prevent or reduce hemiplegic shoulder pain.</p><p>The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of modified wheelchair arm-support to mitigate hemiplegic shoulder pain and reduce pain frequency in stroke patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="section10-0269215517714830"><title>Methods</title><p>This study was a prospective, single-blinded randomized controlled trial.

Both Chinese and Western medicine were performed at this hospital. Patients with upper limb disorder following stroke, irrespective of whether they suffered from shoulder pain or not, were invited to participate in the study by a physician. Patients without shoulder pain were selected to study the prophylactic effect, while patients with shoulder pain were recruited to examine the effect of the modified wheelchair arm-support. Stroke diagnosis was made by the physician, based on patient history, physical findings, and computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging findings.</p><p>Of the 155 stroke patients admitted to the study, 120 patients met the inclusion criteria. They were invited to sign the informed consent before randomization (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0269215517714830">Figure 1</xref>). Following that, a statistician who was not involved in the screening, treatment or assessment procedures generated random allocation sequence using the SPSS version 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The range of random digit was 120. Participants with random number less than 60 were included in the treatment group and the others were placed in the control group. The random number and allocation message were placed in an envelope to ensure that the randomization was performed fairly by the physicians.

Participants in the control group received all the routine services, which include the following: (1) maintaining normal limb position, in which the patient lies in supine position flat on the bed, and a pillow was placed under the shoulder to keep the arm stretched forward; followed by positioning the patient on the healthy side, a pillow was placed in front of the chest and the paralyzed arm was placed over the pillow with the assistance of the physiotherapist; furthermore, the patient lies on the disabled side, and the paralyzed arm was stretched in front of the body; the patient was instructed to sit on the bed, and a mini table was placed in front of the body and the paralyzed arm was placed on it; finally, the patient was instructed to stand or walk, and the paralyzed arm was supported by a shoulder strap. (2) Passive rehabilitation practices tailored to the individual&#x02019;s needs.

This position made the shoulder joint stretch forward, assisting the extension of the elbow joint, while maintaining the forearm in mid-position and fingers half extended. In addition, the arm-support could support the arm and prevent the arm from falling, which may protect the upper limb, as well as prevent shoulder dislocation. All the positions above may decrease the reflex stiffness of muscles and prevent shoulder pain following stroke. Participants may receive other treatment which should not affect their shoulder pain extending from one week before the start of the study to the follow-up periods.</p><p>Patients in the treatment and control groups separately received interventions at least 60&#x02009;minutes a day, for six days a week in the period of four weeks. The patients were nursed, trained and evaluated at the hospital during the four weeks of the intervention process. Generally, the hospitalization period in the rehabilitation department was four weeks, after which the patients will be discharged. The modified wheelchair arm-support was rented to the patients for eight weeks supporting home rehabilitation. During the eight-week follow-up period, the patients received intervention for at least 30&#x02009;minutes a day, three days a week, for eight weeks. The intervention, observation and evaluation period was 12&#x02009;weeks. Furthermore, the patients submit &#x0ffe5;200 (approximately US$30) for renting the wheelchair arm-support, which would be returned to the patients when the wheelchair compensator was given back. The nursing staff, relatives or care providers received appropriate training at the hospital or at home to avoid shoulder trauma during transfer. When patients were discharged from the hospital, they still received basic rehabilitation by relatives or care assistants at home, including normal limb positioning, basic Western and Chinese medicine and simple limb movements, recommended by the physician. &#x02018;The modified wheelchair arm-support&#x02019; use compliance was recorded by an assessor.</p></sec><sec id="section12-0269215517714830"><title>Outcome measures</title><p>The primary outcome was Visual Analogue Pain Scale or Numeric Pain Rating Scale, which is commonly used to measure subjective pain intensity level.

The Numeric Pain Rating Scale was used for pain measurement if the patient could communicate easily or when interviewed via telephone at follow-up. The secondary outcome measures include Upper Extremity Fugl-Meyer Assessment scale, Modified Barthel Index and Quality of Life Index. The Upper Extremity Fugl-Meyer Assessment scale (range&#x02009;=&#x02009;0&#x02013;66; 0&#x02009;=&#x02009;no function, 66&#x02009;=&#x02009;normal function) is a well-established stroke motor measurement, iteratively determining active movement at each joint of the upper extremity.<sup><xref rid="bibr21-0269215517714830" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="bibr22-0269215517714830" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr23-0269215517714830" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> The Upper Extremity Fugl-Meyer Assessment scale items are organized into scales that discern isolated movements at increasingly distal upper extremity regions.

The morbidity of hemiplegic shoulder pain in the treatment group was much lower than average,<sup><xref rid="bibr1-0269215517714830" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> which suggests that the application of modified wheelchair arm-support could prevent the occurrence of shoulder pain, following stroke. The reason may be that the modified wheelchair arm-support could prevent the upper limb from falling, which may contribute to soft tissue injury or spasticity and lead to shoulder pain.</p><p>Nadler and Pauls<sup><xref rid="bibr27-0269215517714830" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> concluded that majority of patients wearing orthosis showed modest improvement in shoulder pain, similar to the results of this study. Therefore, it could be inferred that an antigravity position of hemiplegic upper limb is effective to mitigate and prevent shoulder pain. However, the result failed to reveal the appropriate time of intervention. We have not conducted a stratification analysis of the time period as to whether earlier intervention is more effective and this needs further studies.</p><p>The goal of rehabilitation therapy for hemiplegic patients is to restore independence in limb movement and everyday activities. We selected the Upper Extremity Fugl-Meyer Assessment scale score to reflect improvements in upper limb activity and the Modified Barthel Index score to measure the independence to perform everyday activities. Both scores reflect effective upper limb rehabilitation using the modified wheelchair arm-support.</p><p>However, there is an incertitude regarding how the support device could improve mobility. There could be several factors that may influence this. One reason is that the device could keep the paralyzed upper limb in reflex inhibition pattern, which could prevent the development of inefficient movement and ensure that normal position is maintained in the paralyzed limb.<sup><xref rid="bibr28-0269215517714830" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> The normal position of paralyzed upper limb could contribute to functional recovery. Alternatively, the application of the modified wheelchair arm-support could prevent and relieve shoulder pain, which may encourage the patients to exercise proactively.</p><p>The rehabilitation in this study combined physical exercise with position correction. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the modified wheelchair arm-support could improve the limb and body activity function by itself, but it could be beneficial when combined with physical exercise in the recovery and rehabilitation progress.</p><p>We select Quality of Life Index to assess the life quality, which is the goal of rehabilitation. Sudlow and Warlow<sup><xref rid="bibr29-0269215517714830" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> concluded that hemiplegic shoulder pain is an independent determinant of subsequent quality of life. For every stroke patient, the aim of rehabilitation is not only to regain motor function of the body but also to help them return to the society. In this study, the decrease in shoulder pain improves upper limb function resulting in better daily performance using the modified wheelchair arm-support. In other words, using the modified wheelchair arm-support may contribute to quality-of-life improvements.</p><p>Previous studies rarely focused on the effect of wheelchair in preventing or reducing hemiplegic shoulder pain. The common method is to attach the forearm trough or placing a board to the wheelchair to prevent shoulder subluxation.<sup><xref rid="bibr28-0269215517714830" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> These methods have some limitations in maintaining a reflex inhibiting pattern, which could prevent the development of inefficient movement patterns and muscle spasm of the upper limb.<sup><xref rid="bibr30-0269215517714830" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup></p><p>In our study, most functional limb posture could be obtained using the modified wheelchair arm-support, including arm in external rotation, wrist in neutral position, finger half extended and thumb abduction. Veneman et al.<sup><xref rid="bibr31-0269215517714830" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> designed a novel wheelchair posture support device to assure correct sitting posture for post-acute stroke patients and found it could reduce shoulder pain and the number of repositioning manoeuvres. The device was designed with trunk support and a table to support the hemiplegic upper limb, which has similar therapeutic effect as our compensator device. Both studies demonstrate that upper limb support proves to be beneficial for hemiplegic patients with shoulder pain.</p><p>We include patients with Brunnstrom scale range from I to II in our study, which means that we excluded hemiplegic patients with shoulder pain caused by spasticity. Therefore, the effects of the modified wheelchair arm-support on hemiplegic shoulder pain were suitable for patients with flaccid hemiplegia. The effects of the equipment on spastic hemiplegia need further exploration.</p><p>There are some limitations in this study. First, since the device was too large to conceal, the study has to be designed to be a single-blind trial, which could lead to some observational bias. Second, the rehabilitation practices and medical treatments were kept consistent as far as possible, but there are still some individual differences based on the patients&#x02019; needs, which may produce some interference to the results. Third, the follow-up assessment was conducted by an independent assessor via telephone to collect physical examination results&#x02019; information rather than face-to-face interview, which may result in measurement errors. Fourth, no stratified analysis of the time and complications was performed, so we cannot estimate the best intervention time point and which type of complications would benefit the most using the modified wheelchair arm-support. Fifth, shoulder pain was measured by two types of scales, which could lead to a measurement bias. Therefore, future studies should focus on testing the effect of modified wheelchair arm-support on different kinds of shoulder complications or different time periods after stroke. A multicentre, multilevel, long-term study is needed to confirm these results.</p><p>It is concluded that using the modified wheelchair arm-support could mitigate hemiplegic shoulder pain, as well as reduce the incidence of pain in stroke patients. It may also improve upper limb motor function, daily activities&#x02019; performance and quality of life compared to using an ordinary wheelchair. This could be an effective therapy for all patients with hemiplegic shoulder pain.</p><boxed-text id="boxed-text1-0269215517714830" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Clinical Messages</title></caption><list list-type="bullet" id="list3-0269215517714830"><list-item><p>The application of modified wheelchair arm-support can mitigate hemiplegic shoulder pain as well as reduce the incidence of shoulder pain better than ordinary wheelchair for stroke patients.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The application of modified wheelchair arm-support could also improve the upper limb motor function, daily activities and quality of life for stroke patients.</p></list-item></list></boxed-text></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank all the professors and coworkers for all the help they have given.
