Traditional gait laboratories being relatively limited in space provide insufficient path length, while treadmill (TM) walking compromises natural gait by imposing speed variables. Self-paced (SP) walking can be realized on TM using feedback-controlled belt speed. We compared over ground walking vs. SP TM in two self-selected gait speed experiments: without visual flow, and while subjects were immersed in a virtual reality (VR) environment inducing natural visual flow.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Young healthy subjects walked 96 meters at self-selected comfortable speed, first over ground and then on the SP TM without (n=15), and with VR visual flow (n=11). Gait speed was compared across conditions for four 10 m long segments (7.5 &#x02013; 17.5, 30.5 &#x02013; 40.5, 55.5 &#x02013; 65.5 and 78.5-88.5 m).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>During over ground walking mean (&#x000b1; SD) gait speed was equal for both experimental groups (1.50 &#x000b1; 0.13 m/s). Without visual flow, gait speed over SP TM was smaller in the first and second epochs as compared to over ground (first: 1.15 &#x000b1;0.18 vs. second: 1.53 &#x000b1; 0.13 m/s; p&#x0003c;0.05), and was comparable in the third and fourth (1.45 &#x000b1; 0.19 vs. 1.49 &#x000b1; 0.15 m/s; p&#x0003e;0.3). With visual flow, gait speed became comparable to that of over ground performance already in the first epoch (1.43 &#x000b1; 0.22 m/s; p&#x0003e;0.17). Curve fitting analyses estimated that steady state velocity in SP TM walking is reached after shorter distanced passed with visual flow (24.6 &#x000b1; 14.7 m) versus without (36.5 &#x000b1; 18.7 m, not statistically significant; p=0.097). Steady state velocity was estimated to be higher in the presence of visual flow (1.61 &#x000b1; 0.17 m/s) versus its absence (1.42 &#x000b1; 1.19 m/s; p&#x0003c;0.05).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The SP TM walking is a reliable method for recording typical self-selected gait speed, provided that sufficient distance is first passed for reaching steady state. Seemingly, in the presence of VR visual flow, steady state of gait speed is reached faster.

Gait laboratories which are based on stationary motion capture cameras array, are relatively limited in terms of path lengths and subsequently enable the sampling of an only limited number of continuous strides. Important walking aspects such as gait variability, which require larger number of consecutive strides, cannot be reliably evaluated in these laboratories. On the other hand, gait analysis systems which are based on mobile wearable sensors e.g., forces sensitive insoles, enable the recording of sufficient number of gait cycles, but fall short of providing spatial information, e.g., joint angles, since it is impractical to cover large spaces with motion capture cameras.</p><p>Treadmills (TMs) for gait analysis, require small space (i.e., a room to host the TM), and if these TMs are monitored by a motion capture cameras array, a complete set of gait parameters can be obtained with no duration restrictions for the experiments, i.e. without limitation of the number of gait cycles.</p><p>The main concern is the observed discrepancy between gait patterns generated by walking on TMs which dictate constant walking velocities, versus those obtained during functional over ground walking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. It was suggested that TM walking is different from over ground walking since the TM belt provides ongoing proprioceptive sensory cueing, and since it lacks normal visual flow; while the subject is practically maintaining his/her place in space [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Thus, paradoxically, any chosen fixed gait speed on a TM, including the self-selected comfortable walking speed, is not reflecting accurately over ground walking.</p><p>Recently, a solution to the paradox has been proposed suggesting that self-paced (SP) walking can be realized on TM with the use feedback-controlled speed which adjusts the TM speed to the user [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Most recent studies have compared comprehensively SP TM walking with fixed speed TM walking; using body markers setups and motion capture systems. The results showed that, basically, gait patterns were comparable between SP and fixed speed TM walking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. However, to the best of our knowledge, explicit comparison with over ground walking performance was not evaluated.</p><p>Self- selected gait speed is an important measure in the evaluation of human locomotion and even serves as a target in new diagnostic methodologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. For example, slower gait is observed amongst elderly subjects versus younger ones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] or amongst those with neurological [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] or psychiatric disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], or mixed medical conditions such as depression and Parkinson&#x02019;s disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>Several functional tests were established to evaluate the subjectively preferred gait speed by human subjects. One of the most popular tests, extensively used for rehabilitation assessment is the 10 meter walking test (10MWT; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] review: [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]).</p><p>Our objective was to compare the self-selected gait speed as evaluated by the over ground 10MWT, to the self-selected gait speed when the subject walks on a SP TM in two experiments. In SP TM EXPERIMENT A the subjects were not exposed to any visual flow (looking at a fixation point), and SP TM EXPERIMENT B used a large scale virtual reality (VR) system that provides realistic visual flow.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participants</title><p>Young healthy adults volunteered to participate in the study. They were included if they reported that they were healthy and free of any clinically significant co-morbidities likely to affect gait, e.g., acute illness, diabetes mellitus, rheumatic or orthopedic diseases, dementia, depression, history of stroke, significant head trauma or brain surgery in the past. The experimental protocol was approved by the Ethical Committee of Human Studies at the Sheba Medical Center. All subjects provided written informed consent according to the Declaration of Helsinki prior to study entry. A total of 26 subjects were recruited, 15 participated in EXPERIMENT A, and additional 11 in EXPERIMENT B. There was no participation overlap between the experiments.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Apparatus- Experiment A</title><p>A split-belt instrumented TM (R-Mill, ForceLink, The Netherlands) placed in a VR facility (V-Gait, Motek Medical, the Netherlands) was used with the tied belts mode solely. Motion capture system (Vicon, Oxford, UK) covers the space occupied by the TM, thus capturing kinematic data from the walking subject from an array of passive markers attached to the subject&#x02019;s body. Sampling rate was 120&#x000a0;Hz. The VR capabilities of the V-gait were not used, i.e., no visual scenery was presented.</p><p>In this study, TM speed was determined in a self-paced mode, i.e., a built-in controller algorithm regulates belts&#x02019; speed. The algorithm, which is described in length elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] generates a control feedback to the TM motor as a function of the instantaneous position and speed of the subject:<disp-formula id="Equ1"><label>1</label><alternatives><tex-math id="M1">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

There are several variations for performing the 10MWT. The most common in use is when the subjects are instructed to walk at a comfortable, normal pace for 10&#x000a0;m. Only the middle 6&#x000a0;m segment, however, is timed to eliminate the effects of acceleration and deceleration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Since our pilot experiments with SP TM walking suggested that many more than 2 meters are needed to stabilize the gait speed by the subjects, (see <xref rid="Sec13" ref-type="sec">Results</xref>), in the present study, each of the subjects performed four consecutive trials of the 10MWT in continuum.</p><p>The subjects were asked to walk continuously back and forth (without stopping) between the edges of a 24&#x000a0;m long corridor (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>; starting from point A walking towards point B) in their own comfortable self-selected pace until they will be asked to stop.

Yet, the findings also underline that walking on a SP TM is not fully identical to over ground walking in terms of gait speed development mostly because the required walking distance to reach a steady state level of gait speed is longer when using SP TM. During over ground walking, 2&#x02013;3 strides, i.e., ~2 meters are needed to reach a steady constant gait speed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], whereas in SP TM few dozens of meters are required. This finding is of importance since it shows that the use of SP TM for research of SP walking is reliable within the above-mentioned limitation of distance.</p><sec id="Sec22"><title>The role of visual flow in self-paced TM walking</title><p>In the present study, the differential effect of the visual flow while walking on SP TM was demonstrated: 1) It is estimated that steady state walking is achieved earlier when visual flow is present; 2) Seemingly, higher values of gait speed and higher acceleration values were seen in the presence of visual flow. Effects of virtual visual scenery on gait were mainly studied with TMs in which the speed was fixed (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]). We compared our results to studies which used self-paced walking (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Observably, the direction of the flow and its expansion rate influence walking speed. Backward moving pattern of the visual flow (i.e., a visual flow pattern corresponding to forward locomotion) reduced free walking speed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] while a forward moving pattern of the flow (i.e., a flow pattern corresponding to backward locomotion), either did not change free walking speed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] or increased it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The heterogeneity of the visual flow methodologies used in these studies (e.g. moving hallway, projection on the floor) does not enable the comparison of their results to ours' which were obtained in an advanced VR setting.</p><p>It may be argued, however, that the observation of faster preferred walking speed in the presence of visual flow (as compared to its absence) is in disagreement with the findings of Mohler et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] who reported that higher rates of visual flow in a VR environment elicited significantly lower preferred walking speeds, and also with the findings of Lamontagne et al., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] who reported a negative linear slope between visual flow rate and preferred gait speed while waking in VR induced by head hamlet.</p><p>We propose that the latter findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and ours&#x02019; are not mutually exclusive. While others described the effect of visual flow rate manipulation on gait speed, we compared gait with or without visual flow where the flow rate was natural and generated by the subject&#x02019;s walking pace. We suggest that the very presence of simulated natural visual flow facilitates engagement into walking on the TM, as compared to the no visual flow condition, where no visual feedback on rate is provided in response to walking. Therefore it may be concluded that gait speed control, in the presence of visual flow simulated by VR, shows greater similarity to that generated by natural over ground walking. A plausible explanation for this effect is that gait speed control is based on a perception of speed of self-motion that arises from a combination of body-based and visual sensing.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Practical implications</title><p>The present findings together with recent studies that compared SP TM gait performance to that obtained with fixed speed TM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] underscore the benefits of using SP TM:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Ability to acquire full spatial- temporal data on gait with no limitations on the &#x02018;distance&#x02019; walked, in well simulated over ground walking;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Ability to acquire relatively longer terms effects (with time duration depending on the subject&#x02019;s fitness) of experimental conditions, such as visual diversions, additional cognitive engagement while walking (so called &#x02018;dual tasking&#x02019;).

However, when being tested in the gait analyses laboratories, subjects do not always perform the same &#x02018;self-selected&#x02019; walking speed as the one sampled during the over ground walking. E.g., when choosing the speed of a treadmill with a dictated gait speed control the subjects often choose different speed. With the use of SP TM it will be no longer needed to establish the over ground walking speed, since all the experimental conditions can be presented in the same set up. The potential long recording times of spontaneous natural walking, will also allow obtaining temporal gait variability outcomes such as stride to stride time variability, swing time asymmetry and indices of bilateral coordination of gait [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p></list-item></list></p><p>Technological advancements are rapidly entering the field of rehabilitation. Among these are different types of treadmills, and the use of VR systems by which subjects are exposed to multimodal stimulations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The present study confirms that after short acclimatization to walking in self-paced mode, i.e., few minutes, gait performance is similar to over ground walking in terms of self-selected gait speed on SP TM,. On the other hand, in most over ground gait speed evaluations, no acclimatization is needed and the subjects are practically tested instantly.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Limitations</title><p>In this study we only focused on gait speed. However, one of the main concerns when assessing gait on TMs, is related to gait variability measures. Hence, further studies comparing gait variability between over ground walking and SP TMs are mandatory.</p><p>There are several factors that were not controlled for in the present study. For example, the visual scenery in EXPERIMENT B was not identical to the corridor scenery, in which, the subjects performed the four consecutive 10MWT trials. Similarly, we did not introduce virtual visual scenery using a relatively small flat screen. Instead, the CAREN high end system (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) that provides high degree of immersion, a relatively rare system, was used. Further exploration of the role of visual flow in particular with respect to its ability to facilitate rehabilitation procedures is required.</p><p>These limitations are inherent to the fact that the SP TMs are usually a part of modern systems that have many control variables. The number of degrees of freedom for designing experimental protocols that utilize the modern technologies, such as advanced instrumented TMs and VR systems, is very high. This raises the necessity of a certain of coordinative effort among researchers using these types of systems, in order to be able to standardize, compare, and reproduce scientific results obtained from different research groups.</p><p>Thus, at first stage, we propose to establish a common data set of normative data of gait speed values obtained from SP TM, and to establish a standardized testing protocol that will include SP TM parameters, duration of testing and more. For example, it remains to be determined whether the distance needed to reach constant gait speed SP TM is age-dependent and whether age-related norms can be established.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec25" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Self-selected gait speed generated when walking on SP TM is comparable in magnitude to the gait speed values generated during over ground walking, but reaching a constant gait velocity takes longer on the SP TM as compared to over ground walking. The presence of virtual visual flow facilitates the process. This study supports that SP TMs are advantageous tools to study gait: they present flexible experimental duration, abilities to record full body spatial &#x02013; temporal gait parameters via motion capture systems, and they mimic realistic walking with the use of added visual flow by VR systems (i.e., more ecologic). Since this methodology is relatively new, it is advisable that the community will join forces for standardizing the use of SP TMs, e.g., by unifying protocols or gathering normative data.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-list><def-item><term>10MWT</term><def><p>10 meter walking test</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ANOVA</term><def><p>Analysis of variance</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GS</term><def><p>Ground speed</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GS-CV</term><def><p>Gait speed variability</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OGS</term><def><p>Over ground speed</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SP</term><def><p>Self-paced</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TM</term><def><p>Treadmill</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TM</term><def><p>Treadmill</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TMS</term><def><p>Treadmill speed</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VR</term><def><p>Virtual reality</p></def></def-item></def-list></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>MP led the conception and the design of the experiments, participated in data collection and in data analysis and wrote the manuscript.
