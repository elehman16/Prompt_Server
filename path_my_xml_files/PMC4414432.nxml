The evidence shows the importance of the role of nutrition in the prevention and postponement of disability in elderly people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Currently, the prevalence of malnutrition in the community of people aged over 65 is 5.8% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], although a recent study in our cohort showed that 34.5% of community-dwelling 85&#x000a0;year -olds was at nutritional risk according to the Mini-Nutritional Assessment (MNA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Malnutrition is a well known significant source of morbidity and mortality for older adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Usually, the reasons for poor nutritional status in older people are multifaceted. So, social, physiological and psychological changes associated with aging are determining factors in nutritional intake in the elderly and have been described as risk factors for malnutrition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>In the literature, the effectiveness of nutrition interventions in older people has received growing attention. A recent Cochrane review on food supplements showed that nutritional supplementation produced a small weight gain in older people with no evidence of the potential benefits for an improvement in functional status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Positive results were observed in studies enrolling a selected part of the population who were at high malnutrition risk (for example participants who have experienced recent hospitalization or institutionalized individuals). Most of them have utilized nutritional supplements as the main intervention strategy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], but few have used other approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>Only a few randomized clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] have used a comprehensive geriatric assessment with a multifaceted risk evaluation of malnutrition followed by targeting interventions at an individual&#x02019;s risk factors. This is an attractive strategy as it could reduce several components of malnutrition risk and would be expected to lead to greater reductions in malnutrition than would the strategy of dealing with risk factors in isolation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Nevertheless, despite the positive results of these studies, areas remain unexamined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Additional data from long-term multifaceted and individual nutrition interventions trials for older people in the community were still required. Given the heterogeneity of the elderly population in terms of health status, it was hypothesized that individualized interventions and multifaceted risk assessment would be particularly effective in this group. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to consider whether a multifactorial and multidisciplinary intervention model might improve the nutritional status including those with cognitive impairment and co-morbidities in community-dwelling people over 85&#x000a0;years of age. Furthermore, a second objective was to examine whether nutritional strategy could affect clinical, functional and analytical outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>This study was a randomized single-blind, parallel-group, clinical trial (registration number NCT01141166) of a multifactorial malnutrition intervention in community-dwelling elderly people conducted from January 2009 to December 2010. The design of the study and baseline data has been published in detail elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The institutional Ethics Committee of the Jordi Gol Institute for Primary Care Research approved the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Settings and participants</title><p>All community-dwelling inhabitants born in 1924 and registered at one of seven primary healthcare centres in Baix Llobregat (Barcelona, Spain) were contacted. The combined population served by these healthcare teams includes approximately 210,000 inhabitants of a total of 800,000 inhabitants of the Baix Llobregat area (17% being people older than 65). The seven voluntary health care centers involved in other elderly assessments were in the same geographical area and they had similar data regarding immigration percentage (11%) or population served (70%).</p><p>The only exclusion criterion was institutionalization (24&#x000a0;hours of professional care available). We did not use exclusion criteria for diseases or cognitive impairment. Research assistants contacted potential participants (by telephone or letter), and those who had no exclusion criteria were asked to participate. All subjects who agreed to participate signed informed consent forms before the study started. People unable to give informed consent were included if they had a relative caregiver who gave informed consent. There were no differences among respondents and non-responders in terms of gender, health care center, or physician in charge.</p><p>Data collection was performed of all subjects according to medical records and interviews in primary care services or at home if the subjects were not ambulatory (the caregiver was interviewed, when the elderly person was unable to participate due to compromised health and/or cognitive ability). It was done by a health assistant (medical doctor, or nurse member of health centre), at baseline, and at 12 and 24&#x000a0;months of follow-up.</p><p>Gerontology assessment included socio-demographic data such as gender, marital status, education level, presence of caregiver and whether they lived alone. The evaluation of co-morbidity placed special emphasis on diagnosed hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, ischemic cardiomyopathy, heart failure, stroke diagnosis, atrial fibrillation, dementia, Parkinson&#x02019;s disease, and previous diagnosis of anaemia. We used the Charlson Index to assess global co-morbidity, which has a minimum score of 0 for a healthy individual and a maximum score of 37 for high co-morbidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In addition chronic drug prescription was recorded by extensively reviewing prescriptions according to data from medical records and confirmed in personal interviews.</p><p>The assessment included sensory status (near vision measured by the Jaeger test and hearing ability measured by the whisper test) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Functional capacity for basic activities of daily living (ADL) was measured by the Barthel Index (BI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], which has an ordinal scale from 0 to 100 points (from total dependence in all activities to full independence). We used the Lawton Index (LI) to evaluate the ability to carry out instrumental activities. This index ranges from 0 to 8 points (total dependence to independence) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Nutritional status was evaluated by the MNA, which has a maximum score of 30 points .The MNA consists of 18 brief questions divided into four parts (anthropometric measurements, global assessment, diet information, and subjective assessment). The score (maximum 30 points) allows the following classification: satisfactory nutritional status (&#x0003e;24 points), nutritional risk (23.5 to 17 points) and malnutrition (&#x0003c;17 points) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. All participants received a systematic assessment of cognitive impairment and identification of a caregiver. Cognitive status was assessed by the Spanish version of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MEC), which has a maximum score of 35. Scores below 24 reflect cognitive impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The social assessment was carried out using the Gijon Social-Familial Evaluation Scale, with a maximum score of 24 points. Scores between 10 and 14 indicate social risk and scores above 15, social problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Quality of life was assessed using the Life Quality Test (EuroQol-5D) with a Visual Analogical Scale (EQ-VAS) of subjective health, which has test scores ranging from 0 and 100 (where 0 is the worst state of health the patient feels and 100 the best) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The numbers of falls are defined as an unexpected event in which the participants come to rest on the ground, floor, or lower level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Hospital admissions and emergency hospital visits in the previous year were also recorded. Health assistants gave participants a self-report: a falls and hospitalizations monthly calendar that was similar to those used in other research trials. A blood sample was collected from each patient after the baseline interview and at 24&#x000a0;months. Blood tests performed included haemoglobin, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol (HDLc) with low baseline HDLc as &#x0003c;1.0/1.2&#x000a0;mmol/l in men/women, albumin (usual range 35.0-53.0&#x000a0;g/L), ferritin (usual range 21.8-274.7&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/L), and calcium (usual range 2.2-2.5&#x000a0;mmol/L).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Randomization</title><p>Once the baseline questionnaire had been administered, subjects were randomized to the intervention or control group using a computer-generated randomization table.

The intervention was aimed at malnutrition risk factors, and consists of a treatment plan that used a specific algorithm and was multifaceted for both the patients and their primary care provider&#x02019;s. Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Algorithm of targeted risk factors and intervention. The algorithm was applied only to the treatment group identifying nine content areas of potentially modifiable malnutrition risk factors, such as psychotropic and cardiovascular drug use, auditory and vision acuity, balance and gait disorders, nutritional risk, disability, cognitive impairment, social risk and home safety. A health assistant (medical doctor or health center nurse) blinded to treatment assessment, performed one visit each year for two years to intervention participants within 2&#x000a0;weeks after the baseline interview and gave recommendations according to the algorithm.</p><p>Participants were advised to contact their primary physician within 1&#x000a0;month to review these results, recommendations, and referrals. The family physician of each participant was mailed after the examination to discuss referrals to medical specialists, medication changes, and follow-up.</p><p>The algorithm in the intervention participants evaluated chronic prescription. Special emphasis was placed on the importance of the number of drugs, the progressive discontinuation of benzodiazepines and the use of vitamin supplementation. Subjects were referred to an ophthalmologist when the corrected monocular worst near vision was less than 0.5/1 decimals on the Jaeger chart (&#x0003c;5 Jaeger). If there was any visual field impairment, the patient was also invited to have home modifications to improve visibility using lighting modifications. Participants received nutritional advice on dietary matters and referral to physical therapists for assessment. Information was also reinforced with printed sheets of standard dietary recommendations for the elderly.</p><p>The algorithm generated recommendations also for corrected auditory impairment, gait disorders, functional or cognitive decline, home environment barriers and social risk and referral to other medical specialists was initiated when deemed necessary (e.g., referral to a specialist for participants with new cognition impairment or to a cardiologist for participants with new or uncontrolled arrhythmias).</p><p>After the initial program session, a health assistant involved in the research intervention assessed its adherence and interim results with a follow-up visit or telephone call every 3&#x000a0;months during the first and second year. The researchers listed any actions that participants reported that they had self-initiated during and after the first session, as well as actions and recommendations that were discussed during the home visit. The additional purpose was to answer questions and to encourage adherence to nutritional advice, physical therapy and exercise, and to other recommendations.</p><p>During the second year, two specific interventions were offered: nutritional and rehabilitation assessment. Subjects at nutritional risk (MNA &#x02264; 23.5/30) received three one-hour individual meetings with a dietician (reference hospital) who developed a plan for individualized nutrition. The content of the meeting included food diary analysis, advice on dietary adaptation to address the most common nutritional problems, recommendations regarding basic cooking techniques, adaptation of textures, or nutritional supplements for patients in need of extra calories. At the end of the sessions, participants received printed information for use at home. On participants with cognitive impairment, the role that played the caregiver was important. They received general information about nutrition, nutritional needs of patients with dementia (recommendations to enrich the diet, improve the texture of food) or other problems related with nutrition in order to assure adherence to the recommendations to the recommendations given. Subjects with one or more falls and no cognition impairment (MEC&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;19/35) and ambulation preserved received, over 6&#x000a0;months, four 90-minute sessions with a physiotherapist coordinated by a specialist in Rehabilitation (reference hospital).</p><p>To standardize the procedure, the intervention research team received specific training in multidisciplinary geriatric assessment, from a geriatric specialist with experience in educating health professionals for 2-hour sessions a week for 3&#x000a0;months.</p><p>The control participants received usual health care which includes a comprehensive general medical consultation when they had a health complaint, limited by a short physician consultation time (7&#x000a0;minutes).</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Follow-up</title><p>The primary outcome measure was to assess the effectiveness of nutritional intervention in nutritional status evaluated by the MNA. Secondary outcomes evaluated were the changes over time of diagnosis of anaemia, functional status, analytical parameters and the number of such incidences (hospital admissions and emergency hospital visits). Nutritional status and secondary outcomes were ascertained during the annual assessment and self-reports using the monthly calendar (verified by the health assistant annual assessment) or also by medical record data. The health assistant conducted the 24-month follow-up assessment. In the case of loss of follow-up because of death, the date of death was documented.</p><p>Adherence to recommendations was also monitored, using quarterly visits or telephone calls made by the health assistant. A recommendation was adhered to if at least 70% of the session&#x02019;s program was completed at any time in the 24-month period. To corroborate adherence information, the reports were verified using the primary care medical records (providers computerized agendas, recorded chronic prescription).</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>For the sample size estimation 30% of prevalence of malnutrition and an expected reduction of 15% was assumed (Relative Risk&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.5). Assuming 0.10 alpha error and beta error of 0.20 in a unilateral test, the necessary sample size was estimated as 164 individuals both in the control and intervention group. A 50% of replacement was assumed (5% rejecting participation in the study at baseline, 19% of mortality, 6% of drop-out and 20% to compensate for contamination between groups). For the sample size the estimation GRANMO 5.1 was used.</p><p>Categorical variables are shown as frequencies and percentages, while continuous variables are presented as means and standard deviations or as medians and interquartile range, depending on normality assumptions (assessed by normal probability plots). In the bivariate analysis for baseline characteristics either the Chi-square or Fisher&#x02019;s exact test was used to compare categorical variables between the control and intervention group. The Student&#x02019;s t-test or the Mann&#x02013;Whitney test, depending on the normality of the variable, was applied to compare continuous variables. As in other studies, we defined two groups: those who were well nourished (MNA&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;24) and those at risk of being undernourished, which included people at risk of malnutrition (MNA 23.3&#x02013;17) and those who were malnourished (MNA &#x0003c; 17) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>The primary outcome for malnutrition was analyzed as the evolution of the values of MNA for all follow-up periods adjusting linear mixed models, comparing the control and intervention group. For all models the interaction of the intervention group and time period variable (baseline, 12&#x000a0;months and 24&#x000a0;months) was adjusted in order to take into account differences in MNA evolution between groups. Other models with baseline characteristics of the participants were adjusted. Secondary outcomes were compared between groups as mean differences for continuous variables and incidence for categorical ones on anaemia, functional, analytical and healthcare utilization for the evolution from baseline to 24-month follow-up.</p><p>All analyses were carried out by intention to treat. The significance level was set at 0.05.

One explanation may be that the MNA instrument measures more factors (global and subjective assessment, diet information) than just weight and is therefore more sensitive to changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>Another reason for the limited effectiveness of this program is the capacity of our national health care system. The education support training of general practitioners is a key to learning about the importance of good care for the health of the elderly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Despite the intervention research team receiving a specific training in multidisciplinary geriatric assessment, the program made referrals to medical specialists through general practitioners who were not trained to address malnutrition intervention. One strategy in the future may be more specific interventions from providers to improve nutritional status, and greater integration of health care services may be required above all to assess, treat and support the elderly.</p><p>The third explanation is a lower level of education and subjective health perceptions in the intervention group at baseline. These findings contrast with those described by Kaplan et al. which identified goal setting, motivation, interaction with health care providers and self -reported health perceptions as some of the effective features of nutrition education interventions among older adult participants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Therefore, new nutrition interventions, should take into account community-dwelling older adults with less active participation and lower educational attainment to increase motivation and encourage proactive attitudes.</p><p>The fourth reason could be that subjects who left the study were often sicker and frailer than those who remained with more co-morbidity and poly-pharmacy. Since the drop-out was higher in the controls than in the intervention arm, then if the sickest and most frail were more often lost from the control group compared to the intervention arm, the remaining controls would have a tendency to be healthier than the intervention group, so the control subjects may be less likely to have developed malnutrition and other adverse events than the intervention group, due to differential rates of loss of the highest at-risk participants.</p><p>Another important reason to take into account could be the contamination effect of the control group. Some of the health professionals at the centers involved in the trial had patients in both the intervention and the control group in their practices. The study design did not permit them to know the group allocation of their patients, but when participants came in asking for a medication review or for referral to certain kinds of specialist consultation, practitioners could guess to which arm of the study they belonged. Also there could have been communication among participants. However, this probably would have had a negligible effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p>Nutritional intervention has been used by other groups and in other conditions; so many studies evaluated and reported a correlation between risk of malnutrition and cognitive impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Our results showed that the cognitive impairment status was the stronger factor that determines the evolution of the MNA values. Furthermore, the NutriAlz study lowered the risk for malnutrition significantly in elderly people aged 79 and older with dementia living at home with a program managed by a physician and their main caregiver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. That suggests the importance of assessing of the difficulties of family caregivers, since some studies showed that the prevalence of poor nutritional status was also found in the family caregiver of elderly people with dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Probably nutritional status aggravation is strongly linked to the behavioral disorders of caregivers. The evolution of patients suffering from Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease is associated with worsening functional capacities with a progressive loss of functional skills in daily living activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Thus, older people with dementia living at home may experience difficulties in managing their budget, shopping, preparing adequate meals, and recognizing their need to eat. So for the improvement of those disorders to be part of every future longitudinal research applied to the nutritional status it is also important to investigate the role of caregiver.</p><p>Functional decline is often multifactorial in older adults and multifactorial intervention strategies might assist in the prevention or postponement of disability. Previous research showed that lower functional status in old nursing home residents may respond better to protein intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], and subjects at a high risk of malnutrition improved in functional dimensions mobility and usual activities in a descriptive part of the EuroQol-5D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. However, recent reviews do not show positive effects on disability level in the frailest community &#x02013;dwelling elderly despite an observed effect on total energy intake and weight gain through extra protein and energy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Our study found no evidence of improvement in function status. Moreover, the control group showed fewer declines in functional status in carrying out instrumental activities at 24&#x000a0;months than the intervention group. One explanation could be that malnutrition in older years is a slow progressive process- in our study the remaining controls had a tendency to be healthier than the intervention group and instrumental activities changed earlier than the basic activities of daily living. Moreover, home delivered meal programs in old people at risk of malnutrition can impact positively on their ability to perform activities of daily living [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. One strategy in the future may be to improve the relationship between heath care and community service networks.</p><p>The MNA scores have been found to be significantly correlated to nutritional parameters in frail older persons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. In our study there was no significant difference between the groups regarding changes in anaemia, serum albumin, and ferritin. Iron deficiency is a common cause of anemia being found in older persons with malnutrition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. The same results were shown in an individualized nutritional treatment for 6&#x000a0;months after discharge from acute hospitalization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], although, unlike what happens in hospitals, in our results the intervention group showed a tendency of lower declines of haemoglobin levels, fewer incidences of diagnosis of anaemia according to medical records and higher deposits of ferritin compared with patients in the control group, in our study a trend of an increase in iron reflected probability improved for diet quality and increase caloric intake compared with the baseline. Probably their baseline and added medical conditions and not only nutritional status influenced the analytical parameters as observed in other studies at community-dwelling older people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].</p><p>Health care use during the study period was compared between the groups. In the literature the decrease in costs of hospitalization related by nutritional status is not proved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], despite reducing the incidence of hospital admissions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], and neither is the decrease of length of hospital stay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. In our study the incidence of hospital admissions was unchanged in the two groups, and there was a trend of a decrease in hospital emergency visits although these differences did not reach statistical significance. The utilization of health care is influenced by different circumstances which are independent of nutritional treatment, so for future studies, larger sample sizes are warranted in order to evaluate the full impact of this model of nutritional intervention.</p><p>The strengths of this study are the external generalizability and applicability of the results due to the inclusion of all of oldest-old residents of similar aged registered in the national health care system in one area, regardless of their somatic and cognitive comorbidities.Among the main constraints that should be taken into account, there is a lack of evaluation of the psychological aspects such as depression. Another limitation was that the dietary energy and protein intake were not calculated at the baseline and follow-up, we accepted that MNA score is more representative of the real situation in primary health care, whilst another limitation concerns the high loss of follow-up in this study as in other similar studies, but it resulted in a number of participants that is similar to the median sample of other trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec11" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion the present study shows that individually multifaceted multidisciplinary interventions have not consistently shown evidence of their benefit in long-term nutritional status in a cohort of not selected elderly people living at home but, this study highlighted the positive effect on nutritional status in old people at risk of malnutrition. While the impacts of nutritional intervention as well as the best intervention model are still debatable in well-nourished community dwelling participants, there are studies showing that more intense nutritional counseling, specific nutrition intervention, including tailored diet strategies, and nutritional supplement improves dietary intake as well as positive outcomes in the nutritional status or nutrition-related outcomes in elderly at risk of malnutrition or undernutrition living in the community. Future longitudinal studies should emphasize preventive measures in the oldest old people living in a community-dwelling with good nutritional status to prevent undernutrition and specific dietary primary health care programs by medical practice and dietician in patients at risk of malnutrition or malnourished living at the community, and target groups are needed to identify the best treatment model, including new training protocols, new strategies regarding primary care providers, community programs and an investigation of the role of caregiver to improve the assessment of home risk in the most elderly.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec12"><title>Additional file</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12877_2015_33_MOESM1_ESM.docx" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>
