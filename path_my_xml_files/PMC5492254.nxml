student learning is a long-standing
goal in undergraduate science education. However, the extent to which
students working on problems in small groups versus individually results
in improved learning among undergraduate science students has not
been evaluated in a randomized controlled trial. We have performed
such a trial with 80 students in an undergraduate biochemistry class,
in which students were randomized to either learning in groups or
learning individually. All students participated in the same class,
which consisted of a lecture with periodic breaks for students to
solve problems using an audience response system. Students in the
individual learning condition answered these questions on their own,
but students in the group-based learning condition answered these
questions in an assigned group of four students. At the end of the
class, all students then took the same exam as individuals. The exam
had two types of questions&#x02014;<italic>recall</italic> questions,
in which students had to simply recall information provided to them,
and <italic>predict</italic> questions, in which students had to apply
their new knowledge to a new context. Students in the individual and
group-based learning conditions performed similarly well on recall
questions. However, students who had been in the group-based learning
condition performed significantly better as individuals on the <italic>predict</italic> questions. This suggests that learning in groups
may be more effective than individual learning for undergraduate science
students, particularly for applying their knowledge to new contexts;
this highlights the potential need for pedagogical approaches in undergraduate
science courses that incorporate learning in groups.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="short"><p>A randomized

In the most common
pedagogical approach, students prepare for class on their own, for
example, by reading a section of a textbook followed by listening
to an instructor lecture on the assigned material during class. This
traditional approach to learning is not effective for many students.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref></sup> In recent years, several new approaches to science
education have emerged, including online learning.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref></sup> Moreover,
active learning and scientific teaching strategies have been explored
and found to improve student performance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup> For example,
we and others have reported that having students individually solve
problems during class promotes better learning.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup> Similarly,
interactive teaching is associated with improved student learning
in physics classes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> Thus, a number of
studies suggest that interactive, problem-based learning is an effective
pedagogical strategy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup></p><p>Despite the
importance of these previous studies, they did not
evaluate sufficiently the impact of individual versus group-based
learning. There are a number of reasons that have been proposed to
support the hypothesis that when students work in small groups they
learn more effectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></sup> First, in such
groups, students have the opportunity to explain to each other gaps
in background knowledge necessary to understand and apply class material;
indeed, it has been postulated that the benefit of learning in groups
is due to both better engagement with the course material and with
other learners.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup> Second, each student may retain
and process different aspects of the class material and the preparation
material, and they can share these different perspectives in a small
group environment. Third, it has been proposed that novices may be
more effective at teaching novices, as experts can be far removed
from the initial challenges in learning information-dense material.
Fourth, working in groups may encourage students to persist in solving
difficult problems beyond the point when they might give up as individuals.
Finally, it has been proposed that learning in groups is based in
the constructivist theory of learning, in that errors and inconsistencies
in learners&#x02019; current knowledge and schema are identified and
corrected through peer discussions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup></p><p>On the
other hand, there are also reasons to think that some students
might not learn as well in a group environment compared how they learn
as individuals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref></sup> First, some students
may prefer to learn individually and might feel uncomfortable in the
learning environment in groups. Second, lower performing students
might not be given the opportunity to learn when in a group environment,
with higher performing students taking charge of the work for the
group. Finally, teams may be dysfunctional, and plagued by fighting
and disagreement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref></sup></p><p>Thus, there are
reasons to think that group-based learning might
be either more effective or less effective for students compared to
learning as individuals. A number of studies have examined empirically
the effect of group-based learning in a variety of settings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup> One specific format of learning in groups, referred to as &#x0201c;team-based
learning&#x0201d;, has been extensively studied and practiced in a
number of educational settings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></sup> However, few studies have employed
randomization to directly evaluate the impact of group work in improving
learning. For example, one study found that in an undergraduate microbial
physiology course, final exam scores improved in the years in which
team projects were assigned;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref></sup> however,
this study design did not rule out a variety of other explanations
for the year-to-year differences in final exam scores. Other studies
evaluated the change in knowledge scores before and after employing
team-based learning,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref></sup> but the impact of team-based learning versus other
course factors was not examined, potentially obscuring the impact
of this educational method. Other studies have given students the
choice of selecting a team-based learning section of a course during
medical school in Austria,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref></sup> or compared
different courses with and without team-based learning;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref></sup> however, while students in the team-based learning
course had a trend toward higher final exam scores compared to students
in a nonteam-based-learning course, student motivation and ability
could not be disentangled from the team-based learning approach, since
no randomization was used. Another study allowed students to volunteer
for a small group learning environment and offered additional points
toward their course grade as an incentive, which would result in a
nonrandom distribution of students in the different learning environments,
and different grade distributions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref></sup> Only
one study of team-based learning used randomization of students: Thomas
and Bowen compared the highly structured &#x0201c;team-based learning&#x0201d;
approach with another small group learning approach in an ambulatory
medicine course.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref></sup> They assigned each of
112 students to one of these two learning preferences and then switched
the learning approaches for the second half of the study; they found
that exam scores were higher in the team-based learning section, but
it was not clear if the same exam was used in both courses,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></sup> potentially raising doubt about the impact of
team-based learning. This course was also in the medical setting rather
than in an undergraduate science course.</p><p>A recent review of
active learning methodologies discussed the
evidence supporting another type of small group learning, called &#x0201c;peer-led
team learning&#x0201d;,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref></sup> and suggested that this approach
can lead to gains in student performance, retention, and attitudes,
as well as higher order thinking.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref></sup> However,
while supportive of the notion that group learning improves a variety
of student outcomes, these cited studies have many of the same limitations
noted above. For example, two studies in general chemistry courses,
as well as another study in an organic chemistry course, examined
the impact of peer-led guided inquiry, but did not use randomization,
raising the possibility that other variables explain the results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref></sup> Another study compared students in a traditional organic chemistry
course from 1992 to 1994 with those who were in a peer-led team learning
environment from 1996 to 1999; while students in the latter courses
earned more exam points, the many differences between these groups,
including the changing admissions criteria over time noted by the
authors, complicates any clear-cut conclusions about the impact of
team learning.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref></sup></p><p>Indeed, a review on the
evidence supporting team-based learning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></sup> noted, <italic>&#x0201c;Establishing the efficacy
of TBL (Team-Based Learning) is limited in all of the studies because
of the lack of true experimental studies.&#x0201d;</italic> The author
further states, <italic>&#x0201c;Most of the studies about TBL are
descriptive, rather than experimental. When comparisons are used,
random assignment is rare. Planning true experiments is difficult
in education. However, prospective studies in which students are assigned
to TBL and non-TBL sections are needed to demonstrate efficacy of
TBL.&#x0201d;</italic> A more recent review of the 67 published peer-reviewed
studies evaluating the effectiveness of peer-led team learning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref></sup> did not identify any studies that used a randomized
controlled trial to objectively assess the impact of team-based approaches
on student learning.</p><p>Thus, even for the specific approach termed
&#x0201c;team-based
learning&#x0201d;, which has been extensively studied and implemented,
randomized controlled trials to evaluate efficacy are lacking. While
studies reported to date provide useful information about team learning
in a variety of subjects, they cannot definitively determine the impact
of team-based learning compared to individual learning among the same
pool of students, with the same educational material, exam, and instructor,
isolating the variable of interest&#x02014;group versus individual
learning; thus, randomized controlled trials would add to the literature
on the effects of learning in groups. We sought to test experimentally
the impact of learning in small groups versus individual learning
in an undergraduate biochemistry course using such a randomized controlled
trial. We did not examine the structured learning format known as
&#x0201c;team-based learning&#x0201d;, but instead examined the more
general question of how well students learn when they answer questions
in small groups of four students, versus answering these questions
as individuals.</p></sec><sec id="sec1.1"><title>A Randomized Controlled Trial to Evaluate
Learning in Groups</title><p>The 166 students enrolled in Biochemistry
I: Structure and Metabolism,
an undergraduate biochemistry course at Columbia University, were
invited to participate in a randomized controlled trial in the fall
of 2015 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>).
A total of 80 students enrolled in the study. Students were randomized
1:1 to one of two arms&#x02014;learning in groups (<italic>n</italic> = 40) or individual learning (<italic>n</italic> = 40). The students
were stratified for randomization by prior exam performance (lower
quarter vs upper three-quarters), to ensure equal representation of
these differently performing students in each study arm. In a previous
study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></sup> we stratified biochemistry students
at Columbia in a blended learning randomized controlled trial based
on gender and prior exam performance. We found that gender had no
effect on performance in the class or in the study, whereas prior
exam performance was correlated with study performance. Therefore,
in the current study presented in this manuscript, we did not stratify
based on gender, only on prior exam performance.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Results of randomized
controlled trial of team-based learning versus
individual learning. (A) 80 students were recruited into the study,
and randomized to learning in a small group or individually. The mean
scores (&#x000b1; SEM) on <italic>predict</italic> and <italic>recall</italic> questions are shown for the two groups, along with the significance
(Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic> test) and effect size (calculated
as difference in means between groups divided by pooled standard deviation,
using Cohen&#x02019;s <italic>d</italic>). In addition, students were
asked how satisfied they were with the learning environment, and there
was no significant difference between the study groups. (B) Students
who indicated that they prefer to learn in teams had no significant
difference in exam scores compared to students who indicated that
they prefer to learn as individuals (<italic>P</italic> value calculated

using Hedges&#x02019; <italic>g</italic>, due to the different group

a high prior course grade was significantly higher than for students
with a low prior course grade, indicating that performance on these

there may be unknown covariates
of study performance that were not equally distributed between the
study groups, despite the randomization. To test explicitly for two
such possibilities, we compared the distribution of learning preferences
between the two groups. We found that the team-learning group had
8 students who stated that they prefer learning on their own versus
32 students who stated that they prefer learning in a group; in the
individual learning group, the corresponding numbers were 10 and 30
(<italic>p</italic> = 0.59). Thus, stated learning preference, although
not explicitly considered in the randomization process, was not significantly
different between the groups.</p><p>Similarly, we analyzed the distribution
of male and female students
in the two study groups, even though gender was not explicitly considered
in the randomization process. We found that the team learning group
had 11 men and 29 women, whereas the individual learning group had
13 men and 27 women (<italic>p</italic> = 0.63). Thus, gender differences
are not likely to explain performance differences between the two
groups.</p><p>Despite these analyses, caution is needed in assessing
the impact
of randomized controlled trials, as useful as they can be. We cannot
control for all possible covariates with study performance, and it
is possible, although statistically unlikely, that some unknown covariate
varied substantially between the study groups.</p><p>One week prior
to class, all enrolled students were sent a link
to a video providing an introduction to the material to be discussed
in class, based on our prior finding that video preparation increases
student satisfaction and attendance, compared to textbook preparation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></sup> In class, students were then directed to one
particular side of the classroom, as per their randomization assignment;
students on one side of the classroom were instructed to solve problems
and answer questions as individuals, whereas students on the other
side of classroom were instructed to work in assigned groups of four
students. During class, the instructor presented a lecture, stopping
periodically to ask students to solve a problem or answer a question,
and to submit their answers using an audience response system (Learning
Catalytics, Pearson). During the audience response portion of the
class (i.e., while students were answering questions), the instructor
scanned the room to ensure that the students in the group learning
environment worked in groups and that the students in the individual
learning group worked as individuals. In addition, four teaching assistants
and the study coordinator walked around the room, monitoring the students,
to ensure that each student worked in the manner in which they had
been instructed to do so. There were no reports of students working
in a manner other than as they had been instructed to.</p><p>At the
end of the class, all students took a 15-question, 20 min
exam as individuals to test their understanding of the class material.
There were two types of questions purposefully included on the exam&#x02014;8
recall questions that simply asked the students to recall information
presented to them in class, and 7 predict questions that asked students
to apply the knowledge they gained in class to a new context that
had not been explicitly described to them during class. The recall
questions were defined as recall questions if the answer to the question
was provided during the class prior to asking the question&#x02014;these
questions simply tested the ability of students to remember the information
that was provided during class. The predict questions were defined
on the basis that the answer to the question was not explicitly provided
during class&#x02014;for these questions, students had to deduce the
answers by applying the knowledge they obtained during class.</p></sec><sec id="sec1.2"><title>Students
Who Learned in Teams Performed Better As Individuals
on <italic>Predict</italic> Questions</title><p>We examined the performance
of students in the two study arms on
the two types of exam questions to determine the effects of individual
vs team learning on student performance. We found that students who
worked in groups during class had a higher subsequent score as individuals
on <italic>predict</italic> questions than students who worked individually
during class (82 &#x000b1; 3% vs 74 &#x000b1; 3%, <italic>p</italic> = 0.036, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>). In contrast, there
was no significant difference in the performance of students working
individually versus in teams on simple <italic>recall</italic> questions
(83 &#x000b1; 2% vs 87 &#x000b1; 2%, <italic>p</italic> = 0.29, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>), demonstrating
that working in teams did not affect recall of class material. This
suggests that the benefit of working in groups is not related to recalling
aspects of the class material that individual students may have missed.</p></sec><sec id="sec1.3"><title>Students Learning Preferences Do Not Alter the Benefit of Learning
in Teams</title><p>We recognized that students have varied preferences
regarding their
learning environment, and that some students may prefer to learn as
individuals, whereas others may prefer to learn in groups. To determine
the preferences of each student in the study, we asked all of the
students in the study whether they preferred to learn as individuals
or in teams. We found that 62/80 students indicated that they prefer
to learn in teams, whereas 18 students indicated that they prefer
to learn as individuals. We then analyzed whether student learning
preference (team vs individual) correlated with performance on the
study exam. We found that students with these different preferences
had identical overall performance (82%, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>) on the study exam. Consistent with this
observation, these different learning preferences (team vs individual)
did not impact the relationship seen between learning condition and
performance on the <italic>recall</italic> or <italic>predict</italic> type of questions. That is, the 32 students who indicated that they
prefer to learn in teams and who were in the team learning condition
indeed performed better than the 30 students who indicated that they
prefer to learn in teams, but who were randomized to the individual
learning conditions, on <italic>predict</italic> questions (82 &#x000b1;
3% vs 74 &#x000b1; 3%, <italic>p</italic> = 0.03). Additionally, there
was no significant difference in the performance of these two groups
on <italic>recall</italic> questions (84 &#x000b1; 2% vs 86 &#x000b1; 3%,
ns). Interestingly, even the 18 students who indicated that they prefer
to learn as individuals had a trend toward a higher score on the <italic>predict</italic> questions (84 &#x000b1; 7% vs 75 &#x000b1; 6%, <italic>p</italic> = 0.17), but not on the recall questions (81 &#x000b1; 7%
vs 88 &#x000b1; 2%, ns) only for those randomized to the group learning
condition.</p><p>We also evaluated the satisfaction of students with
their learning
environment, asking them to rate their satisfaction on a scale of
1 to 5, with 5 being fully satisfied and 1 being unsatisfied. There
was no difference in the satisfaction of students in the team learning
and individual learning environments (4.2 &#x000b1; 0.2 vs 4.0 &#x000b1;
0.1, ns). Moreover, we found no significant difference in the satisfaction
of students who reported that they prefer to learn in teams or as
individuals (4.1 &#x000b1; 0.1 vs 4.2 &#x000b1; 0.2, ns). When we analyzed
the satisfaction of students based on learning preference (team vs
individual), we also found no significant difference in satisfaction
in the team and individual learning environment; that is, students
who indicated that they prefer learning in teams reported themselves
to be equally satisfied in the team learning environment and the individual
learning environment (4.1 &#x000b1; 0.2 vs 4.1 &#x000b1; 0.1). Similarly,
students who indicated that they prefer to learn as individuals actually
had a trend toward higher satisfaction in the team-learning environment,
although it did not reach statistical significance due to the small
number of students in this category (4.4 &#x000b1; 0.3 vs 4.0 &#x000b1;
0.2, <italic>p</italic> = 0.28). Thus, students&#x02019; reported learning
preference did not predict either their actual performance or satisfaction
with their learning environment. This is something to be aware of
when determining whether to use a team-learning environment for students&#x02014;their
stated preferences may not predict either their satisfaction or performance.</p><p>We then analyzed the performance of students (15/80) who rated
their satisfaction as being only moderate or low (&#x02264;3); we wondered
if this group of students would show less benefit of working in teams.
On the contrary, we found indications of the same benefit of group-based
work in this group of students. Among this group of students, those
who worked in teams had a trend toward better performance than those
who worked as individuals (81 &#x000b1; 6% vs 69 &#x000b1; 10%, <italic>p</italic> = 0.31) on <italic>predict</italic> questions, but not
on <italic>recall</italic> questions (85 &#x000b1; 5% vs 88 &#x000b1; 5%).
Therefore, even less satisfied students may perform better in teams
on <italic>predict</italic> questions.</p><p>To test whether the study
measured the same performance characteristics
found in the rest of the course, we compared the study exam performance
for students with a higher prior course exam performance (top 76%
of students) versus a lower one (bottom 24%). Indeed, we found that
prior course performance (high vs low) correlated with the performance
on the <italic>predict</italic> questions in the study exam: the median
score for students in the high prior exam group (81%) was significantly
(<italic>p</italic> = 0.004) greater than the median score for students
in the low prior exam group (68%) on these questions, suggesting that
the students exerted their typical effort and exhibited similar performance
characteristics, despite the fact that participation was voluntary
(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>). Interestingly,
performance on the <italic>recall</italic> questions in the study
was not correlated with prior exam performance, as both students with
high and low prior exam scores had a median score of 85% on these
recall questions in the study. This could indicate that predict questions
on exams throughout the course are primarily responsible for the gap
in test scores between the high and low performers. Therefore, group-based
learning, which has been found here to increase scores of predict
questions specifically, could play an even more significant role in
the classroom.</p><p>We should note that while we quantitatively assessed
the satisfaction
of the students, we did not do a qualitative assessment through interviews
to explore the students&#x02019; experiences working in teams. We believe
that in this study, the quantitative assessment stands alone, but
a qualitative assessment would be a valuable avenue to explore in
the future, similar to other efforts that have been performed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref></sup></p><p>We also examined the validity of the study exam instrument.
First,
as noted above, we compared the performance of students on the study
exam to their prior performance in the course and found a statistically
significant correlation for predict questions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>): students who had a high prior course grade
(top 3/4 of class) had a median score on the study exam of 81 &#x000b1;
2%, while students who had a low prior course grade (bottom 1/4 of
class) had a median score on the study exam of 68 &#x000b1; 5%. The predict
questions were correlated with prior course performance and suggest
that they measured the attributes needed for success in this biochemistry
course. The recall questions were not correlated with prior exam performance
(<italic>p</italic> = 0.67). This is likely because this course requires
students to make predictions and apply their knowledge on exams, rather
than simply recalling information provided during class; thus, we
would not expect recall performance to correlate with course performance
for this course, although the results could be different for other
courses in which grades are based on memorization and recall.</p><p>To analyze further the reliability of the study exam in terms of
predict vs recall questions, we analyzed the performance of the two
study groups on each question, as shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>. We found that the students randomized to
group learning performed better on every predict question, but on
only one recall question. This suggests that the questions were properly
categorized and consistently reported on the effect of the group vs
individual learning environment in the study.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Performance of study
groups in each exam question. The recall questions
are shaded white and the predict questions are shaded gray, while
the questions on which the students in the group learning environment

powered to detect differences on every question, the results show
the consistent nature of the study questions and student performance.
The fraction of students in each group who provided the correct answer
is listed for each question. The discrimination index is shown for
each question and was calculated by subtracting the number of correct
responses provided by the lowest scoring 22 students (&#x0223c;27%
of 80 students) from the number of correct responses provided by the
highest scoring 22 students on the exam, divided by 22. The point-biserial
correlation is shown for each question. <italic>P</italic> values
were calculated using the <italic>Z</italic> test, comparing the fraction
of students who provided the correct answer in group learning vs individual
learning.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="oc-2017-00133p_0002" id="gr2" position="float"/></fig><p>We also examined whether the two
study groups had a similar capacity
to learn the study topic. Prior exam performance in the course is
the best indicator we have of the knowledge and performance capability
of the students in two groups. For this reason, as noted above, we
stratified the students in the randomization process based on prior
exam performance in the course, which explicitly controlled for their
varying levels of knowledge and performance related to undergraduate
biochemistry.</p><p>However, we recognized that students could have
different background
knowledge related to the specific biochemistry topic covered during
the study (amino acid metabolism), but not in the rest of the course.
To test for this, we analyzed the performance of students prior to
the study on the same biochemistry topic, amino acid metabolism, in
an earlier part in the course. In this earlier part of the course,
we had administered three tests to the students related to amino acid
metabolism, which serve as a prestudy performance measure. First,
we assigned students a video to watch on amino acid metabolism, and
then had them answer questions at home individually based on the video
content, to test the extent to which they mastered the video content
prior to attending class. We found that the students who would later
be randomized to the group learning condition in our study had an
identical performance to the students who would later be randomized
to the individual learning condition (both groups had a mean 95% on
this quiz, <italic>p</italic> = 1.0); this suggests that these two
groups, after randomization, had similar knowledge and capacity to
learn amino acid metabolism from this video.</p><p>Second, we analyzed
the ability of these students to work in teams.
During the prior part of the course on amino acid metabolism, we had
the students work in teams and answer questions about amino acid metabolism
as a team. We found that in this environment, the students who would
later be randomized to the team learning condition in the study had
a mean score of 91%, whereas the students who would later be randomized
to the individual learning condition had a mean score of 96%, but
this difference was not statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> = 0.10). This suggests that the two groups from the study had a
similar capacity to work in teams (if anything, those who would be
in the individual learning group actually performed slightly higher
in teams, although this was not statistically significant).</p><p>Third, in this prior portion of the course, we asked the students
questions as individuals during class about amino acid metabolism
to assess how well they were mastering the content during class. We
found that the group that would later be randomized to the team learning
condition had a mean score of 97.6% in class and the group that would
later be randomized to the individual learning condition had a mean
score of 97.3%; these were not significantly different (<italic>p</italic> = 0.79).</p><p>We also examined the reliability and validity of
the exam instrument
used in the study. Reliability refers to the extent to which an assessment
will produce a similar result upon repeated use. Unfortunately, we
have no means of establishing the reliability of the study instrument
upon repeated use by the same students, because it was not possible
to have the same students take the study exam a second time. We note
that this could be an interesting aspect of future study designs.
Validity refers to the extent to which as assessment measures the
intended characteristics of those who take the assessment. Kibble<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup> has noted five domains for establishing validity,
involving exam content, response process, internal structure, relationship
to other variables, and consequences of testing.</p><p>The study exam
content related to amino acid metabolism, the subject
of the lecture and preparatory video provided to the students. One
advantage of performing this randomized controlled trial on a single
topic is that it is less likely that there would be mismatch between
distribution of exam content and the content of the class material,
since the topics are closely aligned. Indeed, due to the focused nature
of the content, we were able to ensure that every &#x0201c;recall&#x0201d;
question asked information that was explicitly described in the lecture,
and that every &#x0201c;predict&#x0201d; question related to the content
of the lecture, but was not explicitly described during the lecture.</p><p>To avoid the possibility of human error or subjectivity in grading
the student exams, we used multiple-choice questions that were computer
graded through the Columbia Learning Management System. This increased
the likelihood that the scores were a valid reflection of the answers
the students intended to provide.</p><p>To assess whether the different
questions individually measured
the same properties and were therefore consistent, we examined the
performance of the two study groups on each question (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>). We calculated the difficulty
of each question for each group (fraction of correct responses, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>). The students who
worked in groups performed better on predict questions, supporting
the consistency of the questions. We calculated Cronbach&#x02019;s
&#x003b1;, as a measure of internal consistency of the study exam questions,
and found it to be 0.60. While this is on the low end for measuring
a single construct, the study exam measured understanding of several
different aspects of amino acid metabolism and so would not necessarily
have a high correlation among responses to all test questions; nonetheless,
future replication studies would be of value, focusing on measuring
a single construct with high &#x003b1;.</p><p>We also calculated the
discrimination index for each question (the
difference between the top 22 (27% of 80) scoring students and bottom
22 (27% of 80) scoring students to each question, divided by 22) to
determine which questions differentiated the top scoring students
from the lowest performing students on this exam. We found a range
of discrimination indices for both recall and predict questions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>). We also calculated
the point-biserial correlation for each question, to determine the
extent to which performance on each question correlated with each
student&#x02019;s overall exam performance. Again, we found a range
of correlations for both the recall and predict questions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>). Together, these
data suggest that the study exam had a reasonable degree of internal
validity, although improvements are certainly possible in the future.</p><p>In terms of correlating with other variables, as noted above, there
was a significant correlation between prior course performance and
performance on the study exam, indicating that the study exam was
measuring similar characteristics of the students as the prior course
exams. Since our goal was to evaluate the effect of learning in a
group versus individually, but not the ability of the exam to evaluate
future trajectories of the students, we did not evaluate other consequences
of the study or the exam. However, such analyses could be designed
into future studies to examine the long-term impact of learning in
groups.</p><p>Thus, this analysis suggests that the students in the
two groups
of this study had similar knowledge, capacity to learn the topic of
the study, and ability to work in teams on this topic, and that the
study instrument had a degree of internal consistency and validity.
As a result, we can have reasonable confidence in the conclusion that
the students assigned to the group learning condition performed better
on <italic>predict</italic> questions.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Discussion</title><p>We
found that learning in groups significantly improved the subsequent
performance of students as individuals, irrespective of the satisfaction
or stated learning preference of the students. There are a variety
of reasons to suspect that students might learn more or less effectively
in a group environment compared to how they learn as individuals.
We approached this question empirically, by executing a randomized
controlled trial to compare how well students learned a new topic
in biochemistry in small groups versus as individuals. All other aspects
of their learning environment were identical, so that we could isolate
the impact of this variable on learning. A limitation of this study
is that it was only performed on a particular set of students on a
single topic in biochemistry, and that future studies will need to
examine whether the findings are transferable to other topics. However,
we also note that there is nothing intrinsic to the topic of biochemistry
or amino acid metabolism in particular that would lend itself to group-based
learning.</p><p>We suggest that it would be helpful to look in the
future at other
student characteristics and to know whether team learning is particularly
effective for underrepresented groups in science. This was not feasible
for this study for several reasons. First, we did not have ready access
to other characteristics of the students (e.g., GPA, race, major,
or first generation status). Second, with the relatively modest number
of students available to study in the course, it is likely not feasible
to subdivide the students by multiple characteristics, as the power
would be reduced beyond the point that significant differences could
be identified&#x02014;to do that, we would need a significantly larger
study, which would either need to be performed in a very large introductory
science course with a high participation rate in the study, or by
combining students from multiple different courses. We believe that
this would be valuable for a future larger study.</p><p>We found that
students&#x02019; reported learning preference did
not predict either their actual performance or satisfaction with their
learning environment. We emphasize that this is something to consider
when assessing the role of a group-learning environment for students&#x02014;as
their preferences may not predict either their satisfaction or performance.
In general, it is important to remember that satisfaction and preferences
are valuable to assess, but do not equate with learning. In this study,
we compared a lower level cognitive skill (recall questions) with
a higher order cognitive skill (predict questions). It would be valuable
to expand upon this comparison for higher and lower cognitive activities
more generally in the future.</p><p>Overall, we found that students
who worked in small groups during
class ultimately performed better as individuals, compared to students
who worked individually to answer queries in class. Of note, even
large introductory science courses can make use of group learning
environments&#x02014;an undergraduate analytical chemistry course instructor
reported that group-based problem solving was possible in a large
course.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref></sup> Moreover, a number of studies
have shown increased student satisfaction with group learning compared
to traditional lecture-based learning.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref></sup></p><p>Interestingly,
the benefit of group learning on exam performance
in our study only applied to questions that asked students to make
new predictions based on their newly acquired knowledge&#x02014;students
working in small groups did not perform better at simple recall of
material presented in class. This suggests that the benefit of working
in small groups is not due to enabling students to remind each other
of aspects of the class that they might individually have missed hearing,
due to a lack of attention or focus. Instead, the benefit of learning
in small groups appears to enable students to understand the class
material at a deeper level, so they can apply it to new contexts.
We suspect that this effect of learning in small groups may be due
to (i) persistence to work on problems in a team caused by the social
stigma associated with giving up prematurely and the social benefit
of seeing a problem through to completion with peers, (ii) the ability
of students to provide background context to each other that each
individual student may be missing to fully grasp the presented material
in class, or (iii) providing students an opportunity to discuss the
topics in an interactive forum that offers a further outlet for students
who learn best by speaking and reciting information, rather than just
listening to a presentation. Alternatively, the benefit of learning
in small groups may be due to a combination of these factors, as well
as additional factors that we have not considered. Future studies
may shed increased light on the mechanisms governing the benefit of
learning in small groups, as well as how general this effect may be
in other student populations. In summary, these results suggest that
instructors should consider adopting and evaluating the impact of
group work on student learning in diverse contexts.</p></sec></body><back><notes id="NOTES-d121e597-autogenerated" notes-type="COI-statement"><p>The authors declare no
