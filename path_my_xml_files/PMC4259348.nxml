Compared to continuous moderate-intensity exercise (CMI), the affective response to continuous vigorous-intensity exercise (CVI) has consistently been shown to be more aversive. The affective response, and overall tolerability to high-intensity interval training (HIT), is less studied. To date, there has yet to be a comparison between HIT, CVI, and CMI. The purpose of this study was to compare the tolerability and affective responses during HIT to CVI and CMI. This study utilized a repeated measures, randomized, counter-balanced design. Forty-four participants visited the laboratory on four occasions. Baseline fitness testing was conducted to establish peak power output in Watts (Wpeak). Three subsequent visits involved a single bout of a) HIT, corresponding to 1-minute at &#x0223c;100% Wpeak and 1-minute at &#x0223c;20% Wpeak for 20 minutes, b) CMI, corresponding to &#x0223c;40% Wpeak for 40 minutes, and c) CVI, corresponding to &#x0223c;80% Wpeak for 20 minutes. The order of the sessions was randomized. Affective responses were measured before, during and after each session. Task self-efficacy, intentions, enjoyment and preference were measured after sessions. Participants reported greater enjoyment of HIT as compared to CMI and CVI, with over 50% of participants reporting a preference to engage in HIT as opposed to either CMI or CVI. HIT was considered more pleasurable than CVI after exercise, but less pleasurable than CMI at these times. Despite this participants reported being just as confident to engage in HIT as they were CMI, but less confident to engage in CVI. This study highlights the utility of HIT in inactive individuals, and suggests that it may be a viable alternative to traditionally prescribed continuous modalities of exercise for promoting self-efficacy and enjoyment of exercise.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This research was funded by an internal UBC grant (Hampton Research Fund).

A single bout of exercise can lead to improved emotional well-being, including reduced anxiety <xref rid="pone.0114541-Tate1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, decreased mild depression <xref rid="pone.0114541-Morgan1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, and increased energy and vigor <xref rid="pone.0114541-OConnor1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> when assessed post-exercise. Despite being aware of the numerous benefits associated with exercise <xref rid="pone.0114541-Warburton2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> the vast majority of Canadians (up to 85%) fail to adhere to the recommended 150 minutes of exercise each week <xref rid="pone.0114541-Colley1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. One possible explanation provided for the high rates of inactivity is that people choose not to engage in behaviours they find aversive.

Placed in the context of exercise adherence, hedonic theory suggests that how one <italic>feels during exercise</italic>, or one's <italic>affective response to exercise</italic>, may predict their future exercise intentions and exercise behaviour <xref rid="pone.0114541-Ekkekakis1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p><sec id="s1a"><title>Exercise Intensity &#x02013; Affect Relationship</title><p>Research examining the affective response during exercise in inactive and overweight adults has identified a negative relationship between exercise intensity and affect, such that as the intensity of the exercise performed increases above the ventilatory threshold, the affective response to the exercise becomes more negative <xref rid="pone.0114541-Blanchard1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0114541-Parfitt1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Specifically, continuous bouts of vigorous-intensity exercise, such as cycling at &#x0223c;80% of VO<sub>2</sub>max for 30 minutes, provokes greater psychological distress <xref rid="pone.0114541-Blanchard1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, less enjoyment <xref rid="pone.0114541-Brewer1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0114541-Kilpatrick1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, and higher feelings of displeasure <xref rid="pone.0114541-Hall1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> as compared to moderate-intensity cycling at &#x0223c;50% of VO<sub>2</sub>max. In 2003, Ekkekakis proposed the dual-mode theory as an explanation for the dramatic decline in pleasure experienced when individuals exercise above and beyond ventilatory threshold <xref rid="pone.0114541-Ekkekakis3" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. According to dual-mode theory, affect experienced during exercise is influenced, in part, by the metabolic cost associated with the intensity at which the exercise is performed. This proposed relationship has provided impetus for modification of exercise guidelines <xref rid="pone.0114541-Physical1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0114541-Garber1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, which recommend moderate-intensity activities, such as walking for 30 minutes 5 days per week, over vigorous-intensity activities (e.g., running for 20 minutes 3 days per week) for inactive individuals. In conflict with this recommendation is the research revealing that the most commonly cited barrier to exercise is lack of time <xref rid="pone.0114541-Trost1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Indeed, regardless of age, ethnicity, sex, or health status, people report that a lack of time is the primary reason for their failure to exercise on a regular basis <xref rid="pone.0114541-Trost1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Clearly, there is a need for innovative exercise strategies that promote health benefits with <italic><underline>minimal time commitment required</underline></italic>, and that <italic><underline>are not perceived as aversive</underline></italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>Low-volume High-Intensity Interval Training (HIT): A Potential Alternative</title><p>HIT, which involves relatively brief bursts of vigorous exercise separated by periods of recovery, has been touted as a time-efficient, novel alternative to continuous exercise. Accumulating evidence indicates that HIT induces similar health-enhancing adaptations when compared to continuous exercise, despite a substantially lower time commitment <xref rid="pone.0114541-Gibala1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. While the timesaving advantage of HIT suggests it may be a promising option for increasing physical activity rates, the effectiveness of this modality of exercise is tied to the intensity at which the intervals are performed. This may be of concern, given the aforementioned research suggesting an aversive affective response to exercise performed above ventilatory threshold. As such, HIT will only be a viable alternative to more time-consuming traditional modes of continuous exercise <italic>if</italic> it is perceived to be enjoyable and pleasurable. Bartlett and colleagues <xref rid="pone.0114541-Bartlett1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> demonstrated that retrospective perceived enjoyment of an exercise bout consisting of 6&#x000d7;3-minute intervals at 90% VO<sub>2</sub>max was greater than the retrospective perceived enjoyment of running continuously at 70% VO<sub>2</sub>max for 50 minutes. The vast majority of literature examining the relationship between exercise intensity and in-task affect have compared vigorous-intensity <italic><underline>continuous</underline></italic> exercise to more moderate levels of <italic><underline>continuous</underline></italic> exercise. We are aware of only two recent exceptions to this. Tritter and colleagues <xref rid="pone.0114541-Tritter1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> examined the moderating effects of efficacious statements (e.g., &#x0201c;You're doing an amazing job!&#x0201d;) on affect in university students performing 4&#x000d7;30-second <italic>maximal</italic> sprints. Oliveira and colleagues <xref rid="pone.0114541-Oliveira1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> assessed in-task affect of very high-intensity intervals in comparison to an energy-matched continuous vigorous-intensity condition, and reported that affect was lower in their HIT condition. Implications of Oliveira's findings must be taken with caution, however, as their HIT protocol was so challenging that 53% of their sample failed to complete it. Recently, a low-volume more &#x0201c;practical&#x0201d; model of HIT has been developed, which involves 10&#x000d7;1-minute vigorous intensity bouts separated by 1-min recovery periods <xref rid="pone.0114541-Little1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0114541-Little2" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Inactive individuals who are overweight <xref rid="pone.0114541-Hood1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> and with type 2 diabetes <xref rid="pone.0114541-Little2" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> can complete this form of HIT and it is effective for improving their cardiometabolic health. However, the low-volume, &#x0201c;practical&#x0201d; model of HIT remains untested for its tolerability in comparison to the traditional continuous bouts of exercise. The recovery periods built into low-volume, practical HIT, and the reduced total exercise time, may make this type of vigorous exercise more pleasurable, or less aversive, than continuous vigorous-intensity exercise.</p></sec><sec id="s1c"><title>Feasibility of HIT in Sedentary Adults</title><p>The feasibility and perceived enjoyment of HIT was tested in a pilot study of 8 inactive adults with type 2 diabetes <xref rid="pone.0114541-Little2" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. After completing HIT involving 10&#x000d7;1-minute cycling intervals at &#x0223c;90% VO<sub>2</sub>max separated by 1-minute recovery, participants were asked about their perceived enjoyment for HIT, as well as for hypothetical bouts of 30 minutes of continuous moderate-intensity exercise and 60 minutes of continuous moderate-intensity exercise, such as brisk walking or cycling. Interestingly, sedentary adults rated HIT as more enjoyable than engaging in either 30 or 60 minutes continuous moderate-intensity exercise (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;.01). This preliminary investigation provided impetus for the present study, as it demonstrated that a) inactive adults are receptive to HIT; b) they are physically capable of engaging in HIT; and c) the negative relationship between affect and exercise intensity may not hold when the vigorous-intensity exercise is performed in brief bursts interspersed with periods of recovery. Additional studies have reported that HIT is feasible and attainable in overweight adults <xref rid="pone.0114541-Trapp1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0114541-Heydari1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> with favourable improvements in health outcomes.</p><p>It is not known whether the nature of HIT (short bursts of vigorous activity) will be perceived as aversive, as has been shown for continuous vigorous-intensity exercise. It is possible that the recovery periods built into HIT could decrease time commitment, decrease monotony, and provide opportunities to experience emotional responses such as a sense of pride and accomplishment after completing each interval, which in turn may alter the intensity-affect relationship and make it more enjoyable than continuous vigorous-intensity exercise. To make fair comparisons between HIT, continuous vigorous- and continuous moderate-intensity exercise, the in-task affective response between all conditions should be compared in a within-subject design. The affective response and tolerability to HIT have yet to be empirically compared to these continuous modalities. The primary objective of this study was to compare the affective response during HIT to continuous vigorous- and moderate-intensity exercise. Based on the most recent reports of post-exercise affect involving HIT, and the aforementioned potential advantages of engaging in a time-efficient workout that offers variety and surmountable challenges, it was hypothesized that in-task and post-exercise affect following HIT would be greater in comparison to continuous vigorous-intensity (CVI) exercise, but comparable to continuous moderate-intensity (CMI) exercise. The secondary objective was to assess the tolerability of HIT as compared to CVI and CMI in inactive adults by examining efficacy, intentions, enjoyment, and preference of each modality. It was hypothesized that preference, enjoyment, as well as self-efficacy and intentions for engaging in future bouts of each exercise modality would be higher in HIT as compared to CVI, but equal to CMI.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Method</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>Ethical approval was obtained from the University of British Columbia's Clinical Research Ethics Board (#H11-00759).

On the first visit participants read and signed an informed consent form, completed the PAR-Q to ensure exercise safety, and the Godin Leisure-time Exercise Questionnaire (LTEQ; <xref rid="pone.0114541-Godin1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>) was administered to ensure eligibility. In addition, participant's height and weight were taken to determine body mass index. Participants then performed a baseline fitness test to assess peak power output in Watts (Wpeak) in order to ascertain individualized training intensities. Participants performed the maximal fitness test on an electronically braked cycle ergometer (Velotron DynaFit Pro, Seattle, WA, USA) using a ramp protocol. Participants completed a 3-minute warm up, after which the test began at 50 Watts. Workload was increased by 1 Watt every 3 seconds until volitional exhaustion. Wpeak was defined as the highest workload achieved. VO<sub>2</sub>peak was estimated according to Storer and colleagues <xref rid="pone.0114541-Storer1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Participants' heart rate was recorded throughout the test (Polar FT7, Finland).</p><p>Using a randomized, counter-balanced cross-over design participants made three subsequent visits to the laboratory, spaced one week apart, to perform single bouts of 1) continuous moderate-intensity exercise (CMI); 2) continuous vigorous-intensity exercise (CVI); and 3) high-intensity interval training (HIT). All exercise trials were conducted on the cycle ergometer using a standardized warm up and cool down of 3 minutes at a self-selected light intensity (determined in the first trial and held constant for all visits). The CMI trial consisted of riding at an intensity of &#x0223c;40% Wpeak for 40 minutes (eliciting a HR of &#x0223c;69&#x000b1;9% HRmax). The CVI trial involved riding for 20 minutes at an intensity of &#x0223c;80% Wpeak (eliciting a HR of &#x0223c;89&#x000b1;7% HRmax). The HIT trial involved riding for 20 minutes, alternating between 1-minute intervals at &#x0223c;100% Wpeak (eliciting a HR of &#x0223c;90&#x000b1;7% HRmax) and 1 minute recovery periods at &#x0223c;20% Wpeak. CMI and CVI trials were matched for external work, while CVI and HIT were matched for time. Because one of the potential attractive features of HIT is that the exercise is low-volume in nature, it was not possible to match work across all three conditions in the current study design. Participants were informed that they could stop any of the exercise trials at any time. Following the cool-down participants were asked to remain in the laboratory for 20 minutes. Participants completed psychological measures prior to exercise, during the exercise trials, immediately post-exercise and at 20-minutes post-exercise.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Measures</title><sec id="s2d1"><title>Exercise Intensity</title><p>Intensity of each exercise bout was monitored in two ways. The 10-point <bold>Category-Ratio 10 Scale</bold> (CR-10; <xref rid="pone.0114541-Borg1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, also commonly referred to as the Rating of Perceived Exertion) was used to assess participants' perceived effort during exercise. The CR-10 is a 10-point scale ranging from 0 to 10 with anchors ranging from &#x0201c;No exertion at all&#x0201d; (0) to &#x0201c;Maximal exertion&#x0201d; (10). Participants were asked to rate their exertion before (pre-exercise), immediately post and 20-minutes post-exercise. In addition participants were asked to rate their exertion at 2.5%, 7.5%, 42.5%, 47.5%, 92.5% and 97.5% of exercise completed. These time points were chosen to incorporate both interval and recovery periods during the HIT protocol and were standardized across trials.

Participants are prompted at the beginning of each exercise visit with the following instructions: &#x0201c;While participating in exercise, it is common to experience changes in mood. Some individuals find exercise pleasurable, whereas others find it to be unpleasant. Additionally, feeling may fluctuate across time. That is, one might feel good and bad a number of times during exercise. When asked please tell me how you feel at that current moment using the scale below&#x0201d;. The feeling scale is scored on an 11-point bipolar scale ranging from -5 to +5. Seven anchors are provided ranging from, &#x0201c;Very Good&#x0201d; (+5) to &#x0201c;Very Bad&#x0201d; (&#x02212;5). The FS was administered at pre, immediately post and 20-minutes post-exercise.

This 20-item measure asks participants to rate a series of adjectives describing their arousal to assess the bipolar dimensions of two subscales, namely energetic arousal (e.g., active, energetic, sleepy and drowsy) and tension arousal (e.g., jittery, intense, placid and calm). Responses are scored on a 4-point rating scale using the anchors, &#x0201c;Definitely feel&#x0201d; (4), &#x0201c;Feel slightly&#x0201d; (3), &#x0201c;Cannot decide&#x0201d; (2), &#x0201c;Definitely do not feel&#x0201d; (1). Five items of the energetic arousal subscale, and three items of the tension arousal subscale, respectively; are reverse scored. Items are then summed and averaged for each subscale.

There is little data on the affective response to high-intensity exercise when performed in an intermittent fashion, and none that we are aware of that has empirically tested the affective response to HIT to more traditional continuous forms of moderate- and vigorous-intensity exercise. To our knowledge, this is the first study of its kind to examine affective responses to three different exercise intensities before, during and after exercise. The secondary purpose was to assess the tolerability of HIT as compared to CMI and CVI.</p><p>The findings of the current study provide some support for our hypothesis that there would be more pleasant affective responses to the HIT trial as compared to the CVI trial. Specifically, HIT was considered more pleasurable than CVI when assessed using the activation-deactivation adjective checklist, and there was a tendency for more pleasant in-task affect as assessed by the feeling scale nearing the end of the workout (92.5% completed) in HIT as compared to CVI at <italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.03 and an effect size of 1.4. This suggests that there is an underlying effect deserving of further investigation. Taken together, these findings are intriguing given that participants were working at a higher intensity during the HIT trial (100% vs. 80% of Wpeak in CVI). The affective responses to HIT and CVI observed in the present study counter findings with a previous study examining the affective response to HIT <xref rid="pone.0114541-Oliveira1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Oliveira and colleagues <xref rid="pone.0114541-Oliveira1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> recently compared affect between HIT and energy-matched continuous vigorous-intensity exercise and found that in-task affect was more positive in their continuous vigorous-intensity condition. These equivocal findings may be a result of methodological differences. Eight of their 15 participants could not complete their HIT protocol due to difficulty level, whereas in the current study the purpose was to assess a low-volume practical model of HIT. We tested a 1&#x02236;1 ratio of work to rest, lasting 60 seconds each, whereas Oliveira and colleagues <xref rid="pone.0114541-Oliveira1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> utilized 2-minute work intervals with less than 60 seconds of recovery between each. The fact that their participants reported considerably less pleasure than our participants in HIT conditions is therefore not unexpected. We chose our low-volume HIT protocol based on past research showing that this exercise strategy is attainable and effective in inactive individuals who are overweight/obese <xref rid="pone.0114541-Little3" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref> and with type 2 diabetes <xref rid="pone.0114541-Little2" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0114541-Gillen1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>.</p><p>In contrast to our hypothesis that affect scores would be similar between HIT and CMI, HIT was reported to be less pleasurable than CMI both during and after exercise in our sample. The greater decrease in positive affect seen during and after HIT as compared to CMI is likely due to the greater intensity at which individuals are working, as predicted by the exercise intensity &#x02013; affect relationship <xref rid="pone.0114541-Ekkekakis3" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. However, there appears to be a unique aspect to HIT, such that a) affect responses during exercise are not as negative as those seen in CVI; and b) there is an apparent positive rebound effect 20-minutes post HIT that is not seen in CVI. It is important to note that in all exercise trials, in-task affect significantly decreased, such that in all trials participants reported less positive affect over time. Interestingly, during the low intensity (recovery) intervals incorporated into HIT, participants perceived that they were working at a substantially lower intensity than during the high-intensity intervals (i.e., recovering and having time to recharge) despite their heart rates remaining elevated.</p><p>Despite differences in affect between the HIT and CMI trials, participants reported feeling just as confident in their ability to perform HIT as they did CMI, while confidence was substantially lower for completing CVI exercise. This finding is in line with our hypothesis and demonstrates that HIT consists of specific characteristics conducive with bolstering self-efficacy that are not seen when working vigorously in a continuous manner. It is possible that the intermittent nature of the high intensity intervals enables participants to experience a number of successive positive accomplishments that are not available during continuous vigorous exercise. Specifically, due to the &#x02018;on-off&#x02019; nature of HIT participants may believe they are capable of pushing harder for a perceivably short period of time (i.e., 1-minute) before getting a break, while during CVI participants are asked to push hard continuously for 20 minutes. As such, HIT breaks down the exercise sessions into short, surmountable bursts, potentially allowing for multiple successful experiences, which in turn could serve to increase self-efficacy beliefs. Given that individuals are inherently drawn to engage in behaviours that they feel confident they can carry out <xref rid="pone.0114541-Bandura1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, it is not surprising that participants in the current study reported being more likely to set future intentions to engage in HIT or CMI but that future intentions for CVI were low, as predicted.</p><p>In regards to the tolerability of HIT, findings were consistent with predictions. Specifically, participants reported greater enjoyment of HIT and CMI compared to CVI as measured through PACES, enjoyment of the specific exercise modality, and anticipated exercise modality enjoyment. As far as we are aware this is the first study to examine exercise enjoyment across HIT, CMI and CVI collectively. Interestingly, PACES results are in line with Barlett and colleagues (2011), who found participants enjoyed HIT more than continuous moderate-intensity type exercise, although the differences between HIT and CMI in our study did not reach statistical significance (<italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.08). Building on this, the current PACES data revealed that participants did not rate CMI exercise as any more enjoyable than CVI exercise.</p><p>Finally, and most strikingly, participants displayed a greater preference for HIT over both CVI and CMI exercise despite less pleasant affective responses in HIT as compared to CMI. Specifically, 24 individuals reported a preference to engage in HIT, as compared to only 4 and 13 individuals who preferred to engage in CVI and CMI, respectively. It is possible that this preference for HIT stems from individuals' perceived confidence to perform HIT, coupled with greater enjoyment of the exercise and the reduced time commitment required.</p><p>Considered globally, these findings support the evidence that CVI can lead to negative psychological responses <xref rid="pone.0114541-Blanchard1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0114541-Kilpatrick1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0114541-Hall1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. However, HIT does not appear to elicit such prominent negative psychological responses as those seen during and after CVI. It is plausible that the intermittent nature of HIT evokes a series of breaks from negative affective responses. Over and above decreasing monotony of continuous exercise, intervals may serve to cause a &#x0201c;rebound effect&#x0201d; with affect, such that during recovery intervals participants feel considerably more pleasure. The work intervals may be serving to repeatedly bolster confidence within a single exercise session, as well as increase enjoyment through the continual perceived switch between &#x02018;on-off&#x02019; work. Consequently, participants have the ability to push themselves out of their &#x02018;comfort&#x02019; zone for a known, and perceivably manageable, period of time with the knowledge of an approaching period of recovery before performing the same behaviour again. This enables participants to tackle each interval individually rather than the constant strain required during CVI exercise.</p><p>As mentioned previously, differences in study findings may be a result of methodological differences. For example, in their HIT protocol Bartlett and colleagues <xref rid="pone.0114541-Bartlett1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> utilized a 3-minute high intensity interval at 90% of VO<sub>2</sub>peak, with a 3-minute rest interval at 50% of VO<sub>2</sub>peak, while their CMI condition ran for 50 minutes at 70% of VO<sub>2</sub>peak. Oliveira and colleagues <xref rid="pone.0114541-Oliveira1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> employed high intensity intervals at 100% of VO<sub>2</sub>peak lasting 2 minutes, with recovery at 0% VO<sub>2</sub>peak lasting &#x0223c;57 seconds &#x02013; less than half of the time of their work intervals. Previous research has demonstrated the utility of the repeated 1-minute on&#x02236;off (&#x0223c;100% VO<sub>2</sub>peak;&#x0223c;20% VO<sub>2</sub>peak) HIT protocol we used in our study in achieving positive physiological adaptations <xref rid="pone.0114541-Little3" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0114541-Little4" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Thus, the HIT protocol employed in the present study appears to be highly enjoyed, was preferred by a majority of inactive adults, and may have greater applicability compared to these previous HIT studies.</p><p>The findings of the current study suggest that HIT may be a viable alternative to continuous moderate-intensity exercise prescriptions for samples similar to the inactive individuals studied in this study, however individual differences on affective responses or preferences may exist and future research needs to explore long-term adherence of HIT in relation to CMI. These study findings support dual-mode theory in that the more vigorous-intensity exercise (CVI and HIT) resulted in less positive affect, but suggest that there are marked differences between continuous vigorous-intensity exercise and intermittent vigorous exercise. As such, not all exercise performed at or above ventilatory threshold should be treated equally. In addition, tolerability and perceptions of various forms of HIT should be explored in other populations (e.g., individuals with chronic disease) in order to establish potential differences in affective responses and tolerability of intensity level.</p><p>Overall, this study provides preliminary findings demonstrating that HIT leads to less displeasure compared to CVI, and less pleasure compared to CMI in a sample of inactive adults. Despite this, participants report HIT as more enjoyable and the preferred exercise modality compared to CVI and comparable to CMI. As such, this study highlights the potential utility of HIT for use within the general population and its comparable, and in some cases beneficial, impact on various psychological constructs in comparison to traditionally prescribed continuous-moderate intensity exercise.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0114541-Warburton1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
