In fact, the animals which ovarian function is lost show the increased body weight and fat weight, and much insulin resistance, but it has been reported that if their estrogen are treated, these phenomenon are improved [<xref rid="b4-jenb-18-1-119" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>-<xref rid="b7-jenb-18-1-119" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In particular, it has been suggested that the reduction of hormones due to the loss of ovarian function is the important factor that allows the visceral obesity to occur while reporting that in the case of the group that the ovaries are removed, the weight of abdominal white adipose (WAT :white adipose tissue) was more significantly increased in comparison with the group of normal person [<xref rid="b8-jenb-18-1-119" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b9-jenb-18-1-119" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, because many studies [<xref rid="b2-jenb-18-1-119" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>-<xref rid="b7-jenb-18-1-119" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] reported up to now have been run parallel with the high fat dietary along with the removal of ovary, it is considered that cannot exclude the high fat dietary effect in the process improving obesity. Thus, Nicole <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="b10-jenb-18-1-119" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], have reported that the study on ovariectomized animal is important to clearly determine the mechanism of metabolic imbalance induced due to just the reduction of hormone by separating with the obese animals induced by the high fat dietary.</p><p>Visceral obesity has been well known as major risk factor of metabolic diseases featuring the chronic low-grade inflammation [<xref rid="b11-jenb-18-1-119" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="b12-jenb-18-1-119" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The inflammatory response in adipose tissue is caused when immune cells are migrated to the damaged tissue, which is the expression of the cell adhesion molecule that conducts an important role in the migration process of these cells. Also, it has been reported that the expression of cell adhesion molecules, the chemokine that induces chemotaxis, and various inflammation-related receptors are associated complexly [<xref rid="b13-jenb-18-1-119" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="b14-jenb-18-1-119" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Recently, it has been reported that the monocyte infiltrated into adipose tissue is differentiated into macrophages, and it plays an important role in the deterioration of the inflammatory conditions in the adipose tissue by increasing the secretion of the cytokine and chemokines [<xref rid="b9-jenb-18-1-119" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="b10-jenb-18-1-119" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Thus, studying the treatment method that suppresses the macrophage infiltrate owing to the loss of ovarian function, or that interrupts the path of inflammatory signal, it may say that the possibility to prevent the metabolic disease is large.</p><p>Regular physical activity depending on its intensity and duration induces the change of the function of macrophages and the level of immunity. It has been reported that the function of the mouse peritoneal macrophages with even a one-time moderate intensity exercise is increased [<xref rid="b15-jenb-18-1-119" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="b16-jenb-18-1-119" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and long-term swimming exercise increases the phagocytic in the peritoneal macrophage of animal model. In another study, it has been known that the moderate intensity exercise allows to reduce the inflammatory cytokines on adipose tissue of obese patient and animal, and it reduces the expression of F4/80 mRNA used as a marker of macrophage, but it has been reported that the specific mechanisms are not clear [<xref rid="b18-jenb-18-1-119" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="b19-jenb-18-1-119" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>In particular, while reporting that the woman in the menopause gives positive change in weight control and body fat amount by the low intensity exercise such as walking at least 30 minutes every day, and while reporting that influences also on blood lipid by activating fat metabolism, and it was suggested that the side effect of regular physical activity is smaller and the tendency of increase of body weight is relieved in comparison with hormone therapy or dietary therapy, and the risk factors of cardiovascular disease can be reduced [<xref rid="b20-jenb-18-1-119" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="b21-jenb-18-1-119" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>In another study, Tjonna <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="b22-jenb-18-1-119" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], have reported that as the results that conduct the low-intensity exercise and moderate intensity exercise targeting the patient with metabolic syndrome, both intensity exercises showed equal effect in the weight reduction of body weight and body fat, but the increase of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and insulin sensitivity appears only in moderate intensity exercise [<xref rid="b23-jenb-18-1-119" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and Drenth <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="b23-jenb-18-1-119" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], have reported that the medium strength exercise reduces the expression of inflammatory cytokines or there was no change, and high-intensity exercise increases rather the expression of the inflammatory cytokines [<xref rid="b25-jenb-18-1-119" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Thus, the regular exercise is actively recommended as a tool for the prevention of metabolic disease by improving positively the body weight and body fat of an obese, but the conclusions conflicted each other are being drawn depending on the exercise intensity or duration.</p><p>Thus, in this study, the authors intended to investigate each exercise effect for the infiltration of macrophages and the inflammatory response in adipose tissue, after conducting low intensity exercise and moderate intensity exercise for 16 weeks by using the ovariectomized animal models.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><sec><title>Animals care</title><p>The experimental animals were used by parceling out 24 female Sprague-Dawley rats of 6 weeks from the Central Lab.

The breeding environment of the experimental animal was the condition of the mean temperature of 22 &#x000b1; 2&#x02103;, the humidity of 50 &#x000b1; 5%, and the circulation of day/night was maintained in the cycle of 12 hours (06:00 18:00 daytime), and feed and water were enough supplied until the end time of the experiment. The classification of groups were classified into total four groups such as sham-operated control (SC), Ovariectomized control (OC), Ovariectomized low-intensity exercise (OL) and Ovariectomized moderate-intensity exercise (OM), and six rats per group were assigned. The body weight of each group were measured and recorded once a week, and the handling of the experimental animals received approval by submitting a proposal to Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (No, CNU-00203), and bred and handled in accordance with the handling regulation of Animal Experimentation Committee in Chungnam National University.</p></sec><sec><title>Exercise protocol</title><p>For the exercise type of ovariectomized animals, the aerobic exercise using the treadmill was selected.

In this study, the authors have investigated the effect of the low intensity exercise and moderate intensity exercise of 16 weeks on the morphological changes such as the body weight and adipose tissue weight by using the ovariectomized animal model, and attempted to utilize as a tool for the improvement of obesity by investigating the effect of each exercise treatment on the infiltration of macrophages and the regulation of inflammatory conditions in the visceral fat very relevant to the metabolic disease.</p><p>In this research result, the body weight and adipose tissue weight of the ovariectomized OVX group was significantly increased in comparison with the SC group without removing the ovary. However, after the exercise treatment of 16 weeks was completed, the body weight and adipose tissue weight showed the positive effect in the OM group that conducted the moderate intensity exercise in comparison with OC group, and the body weight showed the positive effect in OL group that conducted the low intensity exercise. These research results are consistent with the previous studies that the moderate intensity exercise allowed to effectively reduce the body weight and fat weight by increasing the energy consumption [<xref rid="b18-jenb-18-1-119" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="b19-jenb-18-1-119" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], and it is suggesting that the moderate intensity exercise can suppress the obesity induced in the menopause.</p><p>Recently, in the studies reported, the researchers have reported that the macrophage increased in adipose tissue is the risk factors aggravating inflammation situation [<xref rid="b9-jenb-18-1-119" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="b10-jenb-18-1-119" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], and Kanda <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="b26-jenb-18-1-119" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and Weisberg <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="b27-jenb-18-1-119" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] have reported that when the macrophage infiltration was blocked to the obese rats induced by the high fat dietary, the expression of inflammatory cytokines was significantly suppressed. In this study, the authors attempted to verify whether the low intensity exercise or the moderate intensity exercise can suppress the infiltration of F4/80 known as the marker of macrophage by using the ovariectomized animal model.</p><p>It could be confirmed that after the exercise treatment period of 16 weeks is completed, the infiltration of F480 in the ovariectomized OC group was significantly increased in comparison with SC group without removing the ovary. On the contrary to this, the OM group which is the moderate intensity exercise group effectively inhibited the infiltration of F480 compared to OC group. Because these results are also consistent with the result that Kawanishi <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="b28-jenb-18-1-119" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] have reported that the moderate intensity treadmill training had significantly reduced F480mRNA, it is considered that the results have suggested that the moderate intensity exercise has the function to positively suppress the infiltration of macrophages occurred due to a hormonal imbalance. It has been reported that the infiltration of macrophages in adipose tissue is controlled by the adipose tissue weight and the volume of lipid metabolism [<xref rid="b29-jenb-18-1-119" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Thus, it is considered that the moderate intensity exercise used in this study effectively suppresses the infiltration of macrophages along with the reduction of body weight and adipose tissue by positively inducing the lipid metabolism in the adipose tissue of ovariectomized animal.</p><p>Moreover, the reason that there is the difference between the previous studies [<xref rid="b2-jenb-18-1-119" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>-<xref rid="b7-jenb-18-1-119" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and the results of this study is that cannot exclude the dietary effect because most previous studies using the ovariectomized animals had reported antiobesity effect when run parallel with the high fat dietary. However, it is the fact that in the ovariectomized animal model used in this study, the metabolic imbalance that appears due to fully decrease of estrogen was observed. In addition, in the previous studies, the authors have investigated the F480 known as a macrophage marker in mRNA level, but in this study, the researchers have verified the protein expression of F480, which is the result that the moderate intensity treadmill exercise demonstrated the sub-mechanism to effectively inhibit the macrophages infiltration along with the reduction of the adipose tissue of the ovariectomized animal.</p><p>However, the OL group that has performed the low intensity exercise did not effectively inhibit the expression of F480. In the case of menopausal women, the body weight and abdominal obesity are increased due to the reduction of energy consumption, and it has been reported that there was associated with the reduction of estrogen [<xref rid="b30-jenb-18-1-119" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], and also it has suggested that the exercise intensity and period play a important role for the expression of estrogen receptor &#x003b1; while reporting that the moderate intensity exercise can increase the expression of estrogen receptor &#x003b1;(ER&#x003b1;) in the liver of an ovariectomized animal [<xref rid="b31-jenb-18-1-119" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Therefore, it is considered that in the case of the low intensity exercise used in this study, if the arbitration period was set to long-term, or the exercise that energy consumption was high was selected, the improvement effect in also the low intensity exercise group would be able to be obtained.</p><p>In the course of an inflammatory response, the cell adhesion molecules of largely ICAM-1, and VCAM-1 are being typically studied, and Bruun <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="b18-jenb-18-1-119" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] have suggested that moderate intensity exercise is a useful tool as the treatment method for the improvement of cardiovascular diseases by effectively reducing inflammatory cytokines and stricture molecules in the blood of cardiovascular patients. However, Davis <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="b32-jenb-18-1-119" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] have reported that ICAM-1 and E-selectin were significantly increased in vascular endothelial cells of the patients with coronary artery disease, but there is no significant difference for the expression of VCAM-1, and they have suggested that ICAM-1 is closely related to the movement and infiltration of each inflammatory cells. In this study, it was confirmed that the expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 Mrna were significantly increased in OC group in comparison with SC group. In addition, the moderate intensity exercise of 16 weeks allowed to significantly inhibit the expression of ICAM-1&#x0acfc; VCAM-1 mRNA, and the low intensity exercise groups were not represented the difference between the ovariectomized control group. Because the expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 appear differently depending on the environmental situation [<xref rid="b33-jenb-18-1-119" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], it is considered that in future, the function research of the stricture molecule according to the exercise intensity should be attempted the studies applying various exercise treatment.</p><p>It has been known that the free fatty acid released in excessive in the blood induces the expression of the inflammatory cytokine of TNF- &#x003b1; or IL-6 by revitalizing the inflammatory receptors TLR4 in adipose tissue [<xref rid="b33-jenb-18-1-119" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. However, it has been reported that the exercise of moderate intensity plays a positive role also for the reduction of inflammatory cytokines along with the decrease of body weight and fat weight by enhancing the decomposition ability of fat metabolism [<xref rid="b15-jenb-18-1-119" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>-<xref rid="b19-jenb-18-1-119" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>In addition, it was confirmed that in the results of this study, the expression of TLR4, TNF-&#x003b1; and MCP-1 in the adipose tissue of the ovariectomized control group was significantly increased in comparison with SC group. However, it was confirmed that the moderate intensity exercise has effectively suppressed the expression of inflammatory cytokine.</p><p>Recently, several studies have reported that the inflammation and metabolic diseases have improved in the adipose tissue of obese mice which inflammation receptor was broken [<xref rid="b34-jenb-18-1-119" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>-<xref rid="b36-jenb-18-1-119" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. These findings have reported that TNF-&#x003b1; in the sub-mechanism of TLR4 in adipose tissue is the important regulators of the inflammatory gene expression, so the study on the treatment method that blocked the signal of TLR4 will be useful to improve and to prevent the metabolic diseases. Therefore, it is considered that the reduction of TNF-&#x003b1;mRNA expression shown in this research result have been possibly controlled by significant inhibition of TLR4. But in this study, the concentration of free fatty acids known that activates TLR4, was not measured. In future research, if the positive change in the tissue along with the concentration change of lipid in serum is proved, it is judged that the importance of exercise will be established more firmly.</p><p>Taken together this research result, it was confirmed that the moderate intensity exercise of 16 weeks has positively improved the obesity induced in the ovariectomized animal model. In addition, it was identified that the moderate intensity exercise can control the activity reduction of inflammatory receptor and the expression of inflammatory genes by inhibiting the expression of the infiltration of macrophages and the stricture molecules in the visceral fat. However, the aerobic exercise of low intensity did not effectively improve the metabolic imbalance occurred by obesity. It is considered that in order to investigate the effect of low intensity exercise, in future, researchers should carefully consider the exercise period and frequency.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea Grant funded by the Korean Government (NRF-2012S1A5A2A01019962).</p><p>All experiments
