This was a prospective multicenter randomized controlled study, in which 625 women who would undergo pelvic surgery for gynecologic diseases were stratified into three risk groups and then randomized into four groups to receive graduated compression stockings (GCS) alone (group A), GCS&#x02009;+&#x02009;low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) (group B), GCS&#x02009;+&#x02009;intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) (group C), and GCS&#x02009;+&#x02009;IPC&#x02009;+&#x02009;LMWH (group C), respectively. The overall incidence of DVT was 5.1%. Group A had the highest incidence of DVT (8.8%), followed by group C&#x000a0;(5.2%), group B (3.8%), and group D&#x000a0;(2.6%). There was a significant difference in the incidence of DVT between groups A and D. The incidence of DVT was significantly lower in LMWH-treated patients (group B&#x02009;+&#x02009;group D) than in non-LMWH-treated patients (group A&#x02009;+&#x02009;group C). In conclusion, combination prophylaxis, especially LMWH-containing strategies, is better than monoprophylaxis in reducing VTE after gynecologic surgery. Risk-stratified prophylactic strategies should be implemented in patients undergoing gynecologic surgery, with LMWH-containing strategies being recommended for high-risk and very-high-risk patients.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Venous thromboembolism (VTE), manifesting mainly as deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), is a common serious complication of gynecologic surgery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Epidemiological studies from our team and other groups show that the incidence of DVT following gynecologic surgery ranges from 6.2% to 37.9%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Although the true incidence of PE in patients after gynecologic surgery is currently unknown, it has been reported that 0.3&#x02013;4.4% of patients undergoing thromboembolic prophylaxis after gynecologic oncology surgery developed PE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. PE is the leading cause of mortality following gynecologic surgery, with a mortality rate as high as 40%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Since the majority of patients with fatal PE often die within 30&#x02009;min following the appearance of symptoms, there is no chance of thrombolytic therapy or surgery. Therefore, the prevention of VTE is of particular importance.</p><p id="Par3">Many interventions and strategies are currently available to reduce the risk of VTE, such as preoperative pharmacologic prophylaxis and mechanical prophylaxis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Heparin, including unfractioned heparin and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), is the most commonly used pharmacologic agent for the prophylaxis of VTE. Many clinical trials indicate that heparin is a reliable method to decrease VTE in postoperative patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. However, high-dose heparin is associated with a risk of perioperative bleeding, while low-dose heparin was found to be inefficient in high-risk patients with gynecologic cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Mechanical prophylaxis, including passive methods such as graduated compression stockings (GCS) and active methods such as intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC), can avoid the risk of bleeding associated with heparin usage; however, these methods are insufficient in reducing VTE in high-risk patients or in critically ill patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Thus, more intense prophylactic strategies are required for high-risk patients.</p><p id="Par4">Compared with either pharmacologic or mechanical prophylaxis alone, dual prophylaxis has biological plausibility in further reducing postoperative VTE in high-risk patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. A systematical review indicates that dual prophylaxis is superior to monoprophylaxis in reducing postoperative VTE, even in high-risk patients with gynecologic cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. The American College of Chest Physicians has recommended dual prophylaxis for patients at high risk for postoperative VTE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Consistent with these, in patients after gynecologic surgery for malignancies, the efficacy of mechanical prophylaxis in reducing postoperative VTE can be improved significantly when a pharmacologic prophylactic method was added<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Our previous study also showed that the combination of two mechanical prophylactic methods (GCS&#x02009;+&#x02009;IPC) was better than mechanical prophylaxis alone (GCS) in preventing VTE in high-risk patients after gynecologic surgery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Combination prophylactic strategies have been recommended by some researchers for patients at very high risk for VTE after gynecologic surgery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Despite many previous studies on dual prophylaxis for postoperative VTE prevention, the data obtained from gynecologic patients are still limited and there are currently very few large prospective randomized controlled studies. Furthermore, previous studies rarely stratified the risk of VTE among patients to identify the optimal strategy for patients at different levels of risk for VTE after gynecologic surgery. In this prospective multicenter randomized controlled study, we compared the efficacy and safety of GCS alone, GCS&#x02009;+&#x02009;LMWH, GCS&#x02009;+&#x02009;IPC, and GCS&#x02009;+&#x02009;IPC&#x02009;+&#x02009;LMWH in preventing VTE among patients who were stratified to have different levels of risk for VTE after gynecologic surgery.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Patients</title><p id="Par6">This multicenter randomized controlled trial was sponsored by Beijing Chaoyang Hospital of Capital Medical University and performed from June 2011 to December 2015 at five tertiary referral centers, including Beijing Chaoyang Hospital of Capital Medical University, Beijing Anzhen Hospital of Capital Medical University, The PLA General Hospital, Peking University People&#x02019;s Hospital, and Beijing Tongren Hospital of Capital Medical University.

Although the use of GCS for the entire day was advocated in many previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, this is associated with an increased risk of pressure ulcer and rarely limb necrosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Furthermore, improperly fitted stockings may act as a tourniquet to result in venous stasis and increase the risk of VTE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>.

For these reasons, we allowed our patients to put GCS off before bedtime once they can move their lower limbs (usually 2&#x02009;hours after surgery), and put on again on the next morning. This greatly increased patients&#x02019; comfort and improved their compliance.

Due to the combined use of dalteparin with GCS and/or IPC, dalteparin was given later (12&#x02009;h vs. 2&#x02013;6&#x02009;h postoperatively) at a lower dose (5000 U, once daily) in the present study compared to conventional administrations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. These modifications may explain why no major bleeding events occurred in this study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Combination prophylaxis, especially LMWH-containing strategies, is better than monoprophylaxis</title><p id="Par43">Many randomized trials performed in other fields such as urology and general surgery have demonstrated that combination prophylactic strategy is superior to either pharmacologic or mechanical prophylaxis alone in reducing the incidence of postoperative VTE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Despite few trials on gynecologic patients, combination prophylaxis strategy has also been recommended by some researchers for this group of patients, especially those who have a high risk for VTE, such as gynecologic oncology patients after a major surgery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. In agreement with previous findings, this study indicated that combination strategies including GCS&#x02009;+&#x02009;IPC (5.2%), GCS&#x02009;+&#x02009;LMWH (3.8%), and GCS&#x02009;+&#x02009;IPC&#x02009;+&#x02009;LMWH (2.6%) were better than GCS alone (8.8%) in reducing the incidence of VTE in patients after gynecologic surgery. Thus, our study provides several additional options for combination prophylaxis of postoperative VTE in gynecologic patients.</p><p id="Par44">A remarkable finding of this study is that LMWH-containing strategies are significantly better than non-LMWH-containing ones in the prophylaxis of postoperative VTE in gynecologic patients. Compared to the combination of two mechanical methods (GCS&#x02009;+&#x02009;IPC), the strategy combining both mechanical and pharmacologic prophylaxis (GCS&#x02009;+&#x02009;LMWH or GCS&#x02009;+&#x02009;IPC&#x02009;+&#x02009;LMWH) exhibited better efficacy. LMWH has been demonstrated to be reliable in decreasing VTE in postoperative patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>; however, high-dose LMWH may cause perioperative bleeding while low-dose LMWH has insufficient efficacy in high-risk patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. The combination of mechanical prophylaxis with LMWH optimized for dosage and timing (<italic>e.g</italic>., 12&#x02009;h postoperatively in this study) may overcome these problems. In fact, although LMWH-containing strategies were associated with significantly more bleeding events, all of them were mild and manageable.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Different prophylactic strategies should be implemented in patients at different levels of risk for VTE</title><p id="Par45">Many risk factors for VTE have currently been identified<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Based on these risk factors, individual risk assessment can be performed to guide the degree of prophylaxis. This study showed that the incidence of both DVT and PE increased with the risk level even in patients receiving the same intervention, further suggesting the importance of risk stratification to guide the administration of different interventions to patients at different levels of risk. Since the majority of DVT and PE cases were present in the high-risk and very-high-risk groups, the emphasis of prophylaxis should be placed on this group of patients.</p><p id="Par46">An ideal prophylaxis regimen should be tailed to the patient&#x02019;s thromboembolic risk, thus allowing clinicians to maximize the benefits and minimize the harms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Although all four strategies were effective in the moderate-risk patients, their efficacy still differed. Based on their efficacy, GCS&#x02009;+&#x02009;LMWH and GCS&#x02009;+&#x02009;IPC are recommended for this group of patients although all four strategies are acceptable. When patients are not suitable for the use of anticoagulants, GCS&#x02009;+&#x02009;IPC is recommended to avoid the risk of increased bleeding. For high-risk patients, both LMWH-containing strategies resulted in an acceptable incidence of DVT. From a health-economics point of view, GCS&#x02009;+&#x02009;LMWH is recommended. GCS&#x02009;+&#x02009;IPC&#x02009;+&#x02009;LMWH was associated with the lowest incidence of DVT in the very-high-risk group. Therefore, this strategy is recommended for very-high-risk patients. Of note, GCS alone are not recommended for both high-risk and very-high-risk patients due to its poor preventive effects, which is consistent with the previous finding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Limitations</title><p id="Par47">Despite some promising results, there are several limitations to our study. First, the relatively small number of high-risk and very-high-risk patients was underpowered to show statistical differences between groups. In fact, although GCS&#x02009;+&#x02009;LMWH and GCS&#x02009;+&#x02009;IPC exhibited better efficacy than GCS alone in high-risk and very-high-risk patients, no significant difference was observed. Second, 6 of 32 patients with DVT did not undergo CTPA, and this might have resulted in the underestimation of the incidence of PE. Finally, the patients without DVT were followed for 4 weeks in this study; however, it has been reported that DVT may develop 7&#x02013;12 weeks after surgery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Future studies with larger sample size and longer follow-up periods are needed to carefully address these issues.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec26" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par48">To conclude, this study shows that combination prophylaxis, especially LMWH-containing strategies, is superior to monoprophylaxis in reducing the incidence of VTE after gynecologic surgery. Given the incidence of both DVT and PE increases with the risk level even in patients receiving interventions, risk-stratified prophylactic strategies should be implemented in patients undergoing gynecologic surgery, with LMWH-containing strategies being recommended for high-risk and very-high-risk patients.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher's note:</bold> Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the staff at Departments of Gynecology, Ultrasound, and Imaging, Beijing Chaoyang Hospital of Capital Medical University for their technical assistance.
