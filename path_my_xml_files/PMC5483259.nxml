No pattern emerged of action taken for recurrent events; patients continued taking cobimetinib combined with vemurafenib, therapy was interrupted, or therapy was withdrawn (four patients).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par31">This article describes clinical characteristics of serous retinopathy in patients treated with cobimetinib combined with vemurafenib in the coBRIM study. Because all patients were prospectively screened for visual disturbances throughout the study, per protocol, most events were diagnosed early in the course of treatment, and most patients had no or mild symptoms at diagnosis.</p><p id="Par32">The clinical relevance of surveillance ophthalmic examinations is unclear. Most patients with serous retinopathy had no symptoms, did not require drug discontinuation or dose alteration, and did not experience greater severity of the condition over time. Patients with mildly symptomatic (grade 2) serous retinopathy had dose reduction, resulting in resolution in the majority. For all but one patient (rhegmatogenous retinal detachment) with grade &#x02265;3 serous retinopathy, dose interruption or withdrawal led to improvement without surgery. Few patients experienced recurrence despite continuing or restarting cobimetinib. All recurrent serous retinopathy events were either asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic, and half resolved by the time of data cutoff.</p><p id="Par33">Based on the limited scientific literature available, characteristics of serous retinopathy observed with cobimetinib were similar to those of retinal changes observed with other MEK inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], suggesting that this is a class effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Symptomatic ocular toxicity, most commonly blurred vision, has been reported in 0&#x02013;17% of patients treated with single-agent MEK inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], whereas blurred vision and chorioretinopathy were reported in 0&#x02013;2% and 1% of patients, respectively, treated with the combination of trametinib and dabrafenib [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Higher incidences of ocular toxicity have been observed in trials incorporating prospective screening, but the reported events are frequently asymptomatic. Prospective screening identified retinopathy in 59% of patients treated with binimetinib, alone or in combination with RAF265 or encorafenib, with symptomatic events reported in 25% of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], and 26% of patients treated with cobimetinib combined with vemurafenib in the current study, with symptomatic (grade&#x000a0;&#x02265;&#x000a0;2) events in 12% of patients. Given the lack of prospective screening for retinopathy in other trials, incidence cannot be compared across MEK inhibitors. Because of a lack of randomized trials and differences in the description and reporting of ocular toxicity across trials, it is unclear whether the combination of a BRAF inhibitor with a MEK inhibitor alters the incidence of ocular toxicities compared with MEK inhibitor monotherapy. However, in one small study, addition of the pan-RAF inhibitor RAF265 or the selective BRAF inhibitor encorafenib to the MEK inhibitor binimetinib did not appear to influence the incidence of retinopathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Furthermore, anecdotal data with binimetinib suggest a temporal relationship between ocular toxicity and dose administration/blood binimetinib levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Further research is necessary to determine whether a similar relationship exists for other MEK inhibitors.</p><p id="Par34">Although the MAPK pathway seems to play an important role in maintenance, protection, and repair of the retina, pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying MEK inhibitor-induced retinopathy are not well understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The retinal pigment epithelium forms the outer component of the blood&#x02013;retina barrier and controls solute and fluid permeability, a function critical for maintenance of the specialized environment of the neural retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]; fluid accumulation between these layers can result in retinal detachment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. There is evidence that MAPK signaling regulates density of fluid transport channels (aquaporins) between retinal pigment epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Thus, MEK inhibition may alter permeability of the retinal pigment epithelium, allowing accumulation of subretinal fluid. Further study is needed to test this hypothesis.</p><p id="Par35">In other retinal diseases, the long-term presence of subretinal fluid can lead to photoreceptor death and permanent vision loss; therefore, persistent events may warrant treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Understanding of the pathogenesis of classic central serous chorioretinopathy emphasizes the role of the choroid, which seems to be extremely permeable in this disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. However, chorioretinal abnormalities are not observed in MEK inhibitor-associated serous retinopathy, in which pathophysiology seems to result instead from altered permeability of the retinal pigment epithelium. Therefore, treatments that might promote subretinal fluid resolution in classic central serous chorioretinopathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] may not be useful for subretinal fluid resolution in MEK inhibitor-associated serous retinopathy. It is reassuring that almost all cases of MEK inhibitor-associated serous retinopathy in the coBRIM study ultimately resolved either spontaneously or through dose modification.</p><p id="Par36">In our experience, management of cobimetinib-associated serous retinopathy necessitates close collaboration with an ophthalmologist, and early involvement should be considered because most events occur within 1&#x000a0;month of treatment initiation. However, prospective screening is probably not warranted because surveillance ophthalmologic examination typically identifies asymptomatic serous retinopathy. Ophthalmologic examination should be performed periodically during cobimetinib treatment and as necessary for new or worsening visual disturbances. Temporarily withholding or reducing the dose of cobimetinib should be considered upon diagnosis of serous retinopathy.</p><p id="Par37">There are several limitations to our results. First, reliance on AE reporting rather than ophthalmic (OCT) confirmation might have resulted in underreporting of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases. Second, ophthalmic images were not prospectively centrally reviewed. Third, visual acuity was not measured in a standardized fashion across sites. Despite these limitations, the large difference in rates of serous retinopathy between the cobimetinib combined with vemurafenib arm and the vemurafenib arm make it unlikely that results were caused by study limitations rather than the real effects of MEK inhibition with cobimetinib.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par38">This report provides context around the guidance for the management of serous retinopathy in patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with a <italic>BRAF</italic> V600E or V600K mutation receiving cobimetinib in combination with vemurafenib.

<sup>V600</sup>-mutated melanoma. Although retinopathy was generally asymptomatic or mild and although most affected patients could safely continue to receive cobimetinib, dose interruption and dose reduction should be considered. Patients receiving cobimetinib should undergo ophthalmologic examination at regular intervals and whenever they experience symptoms suggestive of serous retinopathy. Additional examination may be warranted if symptoms persist.
