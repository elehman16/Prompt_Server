We created the content for a mobile phone text message BI service to reduce harmful drinking among patients admitted to hospital following an injury who screen positive for hazardous alcohol use. The aim of this study was to pre-test and refine the text message content using a robust contextualisation process ahead of its formal evaluation in a randomised controlled trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Pre-testing was conducted in two phases. First, in-depth interviews were conducted with 14 trauma inpatients (16&#x02013;60 years) at Auckland City Hospital and five key informants. Participants were interviewed face-to-face using a semi-structured interview guide. Topics explored included: opinions on text message ideas and wording, which messages did or did not work well and why, interactivity of the intervention, cultural relevance of messages, and tone of the content. In a second phase, consultation was undertaken with M&#x00101;ori (New Zealand&#x02019;s indigenous population) and Pacific groups to explore the relevance and appropriateness of the text message content for M&#x00101;ori and Pacific audiences.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Factors identified as important for ensuring the text message content was engaging, relevant, and useful for recipients were: reducing the complexity of message content and structure; increasing the interactive functionality of the text message programme; ensuring an empowering tone to text messages; and optimising the appropriateness and relevance of text messages for M&#x00101;ori and Pacific people. The final version of the intervention (named &#x02018;YourCall<sup>&#x02122;</sup>&#x02019;) had three pathways for people to choose between: 1) text messages in English with Te Reo (M&#x00101;ori language) words of welcome and encouragement, 2) text messages in Te Reo M&#x00101;ori, and 3) text messages in English (with an option to receive a greeting in Samoan, Tongan, Cook Island M&#x00101;ori, Niuean, Tokelauan, Tuvaluan, or Fijian).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>We have developed a text message intervention underpinned by established BI evidence and behaviour change theory and refined based on feedback and consultation. The next step is evaluation of the intervention in a randomised-controlled trial.</p></sec></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Injury is the largest contributor to New Zealand&#x02019;s alcohol-related burden of disease, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and alcohol is considered the leading risk factor for injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. One in three New Zealanders who consume alcohol have reported being harmed by their own drinking in the past year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Factors associated with a higher risk of alcohol-related harm were being male, younger age, M&#x00101;ori ethnicity (New Zealand&#x02019;s indigenous population), or living in a very deprived area of New Zealand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>Screening and BI is an important component of a comprehensive public health strategy to reduce hazardous alcohol use and prevent alcohol-related harm. A large body of evidence has established the effectiveness of screening and BI in a wide range of health-care settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. For injured patients attended to in trauma care settings, BI can reduce subsequent alcohol intake and alcohol-related harms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In a systematic review of BI studies for injury patients, Nilsen and colleagues concluded that, although it was difficult to provide evidence on the results of BI due to heterogeneity of studies, 11 of the 12 studies that compared pre- and post-BI results observed a significant effect of BI on at least some of the outcomes of interest (alcohol intake, risky drinking practices, alcohol-related negative consequences, and injury frequency) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>In New Zealand, however, screening and BI is infrequently implemented in trauma care settings. A retrospective analysis of trauma registry data (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1970) and hospital records (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;120) of adults aged &#x02265;18&#x000a0;years with unintentional injury admitted to Auckland City Hospital, a tertiary-level metropolitan trauma centre, reported that none of the&#x000a0;120 records reviewed had documentation indicating a structured questionnaire-based alcohol screening had been conducted and just one patient was recorded as having received a brief alcohol intervention. This was despite 23&#x000a0;% of patient records containing documentation indicating problem drinking and/or evidence of alcohol consumption prior to injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Similar findings of low uptake are also reported in the United States despite the recommendation that screening and BI is incorporated as a routine component of trauma care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. A USA national survey of Emergency Department (ED) directors at Level I and Level II trauma centres found that, of the 46&#x000a0;% who responded to the survey, only 15&#x000a0;% reported having formal screening and intervention policies in their ED [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Previous research has indicated a range of barriers to implementation, including lack of resources and training of health professionals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>The use of mobile (cellular) phones as the mode of BI delivery could address some of these barriers. Communicating via text message is cost-effective, highly scalable, and has the potential to reduce inequities in access to health promotion messages and services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Because of the high uptake of mobile phones globally, the reach of mobile health (mHealth) interventions could be extensive. Mobile phone uptake is high among M&#x00101;ori and Pacific peoples in New Zealand. In the New Zealand 2013 Census, access to mobile phones within households was 86&#x000a0;% for M&#x00101;ori, 85&#x000a0;% for Pacific Peoples, and 87&#x000a0;% for the total population. In contrast access to telephone and the Internet were lower for M&#x00101;ori (72&#x000a0;and 67&#x000a0;%) and Pacific Peoples (77 and 65&#x000a0;%) than the total population (87&#x000a0;and 82&#x000a0;%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>Text messages, which are by definition short in length, could be a particularly appropriate mechanism for delivering BI for hazardous drinking, as suggested by three small feasibility studies published previously. Suffoletto &#x00026; colleagues (2011) demonstrated the potential of a BI via text message to reduce harmful drinking in a randomised controlled trial among 45 hazardous drinkers aged 18 to 24&#x000a0;years seen in three urban EDs in Western Pennsylvania, USA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In a randomised controlled feasibility study in Dundee, UK, Crombie &#x00026; colleagues found that a text message BI could engage participants, disadvantaged men aged 25 to 44&#x000a0;years who were recruited through primary care and community outreach, and had the potential to modify their binge-drinking behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In a qualitative study of 30 trauma inpatients aged &#x02265;16&#x000a0;years in Auckland, New Zealand, Kool et al. found that the majority of participants supported the idea of a text message intervention for hazardous drinking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. This study found that receptiveness to messages would be increased if messages were non-judgemental and supportive, evidence-based, informative (e.g. information on the consequences of drinking and providing practical advice), and culturally relevant for M&#x00101;ori. Participants in this feasibility study noted the importance of ensuring the messages were not delivered too frequently and the need to be mindful of avoiding a sense of invasion of privacy and confidentiality.</p><p>More recently, Suffoletto &#x00026; colleagues (2014) have reported the findings of a large 3-arm randomised controlled clinical trial of a 12-week text message alcohol intervention for ED patients aged 18 to 25&#x000a0;years, carried out at four urban hospitals in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Patients reporting hazardous alcohol consumption on screening were eligible to participate and were randomised to one of three groups: text message intervention involving assessments and feedback (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;384), text message assessments only (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;196), no text messages (control, <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;185). At 3-months follow-up, the intervention group showed small reductions from baseline in self-reported binge-drinking days (intervention group: &#x02212;0.51; 95&#x000a0;% Confidence Interval (CI) &#x02212;0.10,&#x02212;0.95, cf. assessment group: 0.90; 95&#x000a0;% CI 0.23, 1.6, and control group: 0.41; 95&#x000a0;% CI &#x02212;0.20,1.0) and the number of drinks consumed per drinking day (intervention group: &#x02212;0.31; 95&#x000a0;% CI &#x02212;0.07, &#x02212;0.55, cf. assessment group: 0.10; 95&#x000a0;% CI &#x02212;0.27, 0.47 and control group: 0.39; 95&#x000a0;% CI 0.06, 0.72).</p><p>Whilst there is a large body of literature pertaining to alcohol BIs in trauma care settings, there are just the four studies outlined above which explore mHealth alcohol BIs, with just Kool et al. being specifically focussed on the trauma inpatient setting, and none which focus on developing and testing content which is culturally appropriate for an indigenous population. Building on the information noted by Kool et al. as the foundation, our research group formulated the concept of a proactive, automated mobile phone text message BI service aimed at reducing hazardous drinking and alcohol-related harm among adults admitted to hospital following an injury and who screen positive for alcohol misuse. Our plan was to tailor the text message content to suit different demographic groups (e.g. age, gender, and M&#x00101;ori and Pacific ethnic groups), and design the delivery of the BI to be resource-efficient, accessible to youth and socio-economically disadvantaged groups, and scalable nationwide.</p><p>We assembled an Intervention Development Team (the authors of this paper) to oversee and guide the development of the text message intervention. The team was comprised of experts in mobile phone health technology, drug and alcohol clinical services, clinical and health psychology, public health, youth health, and M&#x00101;ori, Pacific, and Asian health. The group discussed and developed the intervention concept, created the initial text message content, reviewed findings from pre-testing, and made decisions about refinements of text message content and structure.</p><p>This aim of this study was to pre-test the text message BI content so that the content could be improved and refined to enhance its acceptability and potential effectiveness in the local context. It was intended that the effectiveness of the refined intervention in reducing harmful drinking would subsequently be evaluated in a randomised-controlled trial.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Our methodologic approach is described in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and was informed by Whittaker and colleagues&#x02019; model for developing and evaluating mHealth interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. This model describes a process in which the intervention created is based on theory and evidence, the target audience is involved to ensure the intervention is engaging and useful, and there is a focus on implementation from the outset.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Process for text message intervention content development</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12889_2015_2130_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p>The initial text message content was created based on the BI model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and the Stages of Change behaviour change theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] which underpins the model. BI has three key steps: 1) giving feedback and information about a person&#x02019;s current behaviour (in this case, hazardous alcohol use), 2) listening and discussing the issue, and 3) giving advice, discussing options, and helping with goal-setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The Development Team wanted to mimic the underlying key BI elements as far as possible, whilst being mindful of the limitation that text messaging lacks the face-to-face interpersonal component of conventional BI. Using Microsoft Excel, we mapped the key elements of BI (as described by Babor &#x00026; Higgins-Biddle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]) and recommendations for its use in a trauma setting (the American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]) against a variety of behaviour change techniques and crafted short messages for each of the key elements (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Readability testing showed the content of these messages had a Flesch-Reading Ease score of 66.6 and Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level score of 6.6.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Original text message content</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Message number</th><th>Week of programme</th><th>Day of programme</th><th>Text message</th><th>Brief Intervention element</th><th>Behaviour change techniques</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center">1</td><td align="center">1</td><td align="center">1</td><td>Thanks 4 joining the study.

The pre-testing was conducted in two phases: 1) interviews with trauma inpatients and key informants and 2) consultation with M&#x00101;ori and Pacific groups.</p><p>A purposive sampling approach was taken to ensure a mix of ethnicity groups, age groups and gender among the trauma inpatients interviewed and to ensure the views of key stakeholders were heard. The aim of the sampling strategy was to select a range of patients and key informants in order to gain insights and understanding about their perceptions regarding the content, accessibility of the messages and structure of the intervention. This study was not designed to select a statistically representative sample in order to make empirical generalisations representative of all trauma inpatients.</p><p>In the first phase of pre-testing we aimed to recruit 15 adult trauma inpatients (five M&#x00101;ori patients, five Pacific patients, and five patients of other ethnicities) and five key informants from the following organisations: Auckland City Trauma Service (clinical service), Alcohol HealthWatch (non-governmental agency), Accident Compensation Corporation (injury-related social insurance agency), Auckland Council (regional authority), and National Hauora Coalition (primary health organisation).</p><p>Trauma inpatient participant selection and in-depth individual interviews were carried out over a four week period during May 2012 at Auckland City Hospital. Patients could be included if they were aged 16 to 60&#x000a0;years, had been admitted to hospital with an injury and were under the care of the Trauma Service, used a mobile phone, were alcohol users, and could complete an interview in English. Patients were excluded if they had a cognitive deficit, a serious psychiatric disorder, or were pregnant. Potential participants were identified prospectively by daily review of the Trauma Service admission register followed by discussion with the trauma co-ordinator and/or ward staff, and then were approached in person by an interviewer and invited to take part. Three interviewers in total conducted individual face-to-face interviews, which ranged from 30 to 60&#x000a0;min in length. Interviews with M&#x00101;ori participants were conducted by a M&#x00101;ori researcher, and interviews with Pacific participants were conducted by a researcher who identified with Cook Island and European ethnicities. The third interviewer was New Zealand European.</p><p>All potential participants (inpatients and key informants) were provided a Participant Information Sheet and those taking part in the study gave their written informed consent. Interviews were semi-structured, with an interview guide used as an outline and prompt (Appendix <xref rid="Sec14" ref-type="sec">1</xref>). The questions and guide were developed by the lead authors (SS and MS), in consultation with the Development Team. Topics explored during the interviews included: opinions on text message ideas and wording (a paper-based text message prototype was provided), which messages worked well and why, which messages didn&#x02019;t work well and why, interactivity of intervention, cultural relevance of messages, and tone of messages. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed by a commercial transcription service.</p><p>In addition to the interview, a short survey to capture basic demographic details and the participant&#x02019;s Alcohol Use Disorder Test (AUDIT)-C score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] was administered. Ethnicity data was collected by using the standard ethnicity question from the New Zealand Census, as recommended by the New Zealand Ministry of Health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Trauma inpatient participants received a $20 shopping voucher as a token of appreciation for taking part in the study.</p><p>The interview transcriptions were analysed at two levels: 1) by each text message, to analyse feedback and suggestions related to the content of each message, and 2) for cross-cutting themes that emerged related to content and structure of the text message intervention. A General Inductive approach was used for the second level data analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Analyses were conducted using NVivo 9 qualitative analysis software. Interview transcripts were entered into NVivo and the raw text was examined in detail. Coding was applied to the text to indicate feedback on specific messages (level one analysis) and to indicate categories or themes (level two analysis). Within each category, the text was searched for a range of viewpoints and quotations were selected to show this range, as well as the core meaning of a theme.</p><p>Based on the findings from this small qualitative research study, the content and structure of the intervention were refined by the Intervention Development Team. Subsequently, a second phase of consultation was undertaken with M&#x00101;ori drug and alcohol counsellors (Te &#x00100;tea Marin&#x0014d;), Pacific drug and alcohol counsellors (Tupu), Pacific staff at the University of Auckland, and M&#x00101;ori researchers, to enhance the relevance, appropriateness and acceptability of the text message intervention content to M&#x00101;ori and Pacific communities.</p><p>Ethical approval for the qualitative research component was obtained from the Northern X Regional Ethics Committee (NTX/11/EXP/307), the Auckland District Health Board, and the Waitemata District Health Board.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Nineteen trauma inpatients were approached, 14 were interviewed, and five declined or were not eligible due to not being drinkers. Participants ranged in age from 17 to 50&#x000a0;years and the majority were male (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Four participants identified as New Zealand M&#x00101;ori. One of these participants also identified as Cook Island M&#x00101;ori and another as Niuean. Three participants identified as Samoan, five were European, and two were Asian (Chinese and Filipino). AUDIT-C scores ranged from 0 to 9 with a median of 5. Nine participants were categorised as having a pattern of drinking considered hazardous (AUDIT-C score &#x02265;3 for women and &#x02265;4 for men).

A commonly-expressed issue was specific words not being easily understood or relevant to people. For example, the use of the word &#x02018;hazardous&#x02019; in message two (<italic>&#x02018;The survey showed your alcohol drinking is hazardous compared with other people. We recommend you think about cutting down&#x02019;</italic>) was not felt to be appropriate by the majority of participants:<disp-quote><p><italic>&#x0201c;Hazardous is a bit of a big word for some folks isn&#x02019;t it. Usually hazardous you think of bombs and explosions.&#x0201d; (Male, New Zealand European inpatient, non-hazardous drinker)</italic></p></disp-quote></p><p>However, one participant liked the direct nature of this message:<disp-quote><p><italic>&#x0201c;I think that&#x02019;s really good because then it kind of makes people think maybe I&#x02019;m hurting other people or hurting myself.&#x0201d; (Female, Filipino inpatient, hazardous drinker)</italic></p></disp-quote></p><p>The information-laden content (summarising low risk drinking guidelines and the definition of a &#x02018;standard&#x02019; drink) of text message three positioned at this early stage of the intervention was generally perceived to be negative and off-putting:<disp-quote><p><italic>&#x0201c;Well there&#x02019;s quite a bit of information there, most people probably turn it off at that point. Well the problem with text messages you know, texts are usually some social thing,.&#x02026;&#x0201d; (Male, New Zealand European inpatient, non-hazardous drinker)</italic></p></disp-quote></p><p>One respondent aged in his early 20s indicated that this kind of message would be meaningless for him and his friends: <italic>&#x0201c;I think people our age would laugh. I don&#x02019;t think they&#x02019;d take any notice of it to be honest, &#x02026; So you don&#x02019;t drink just to drink, you drink to get drunk, that sounds really bad but that&#x02019;s how it is.&#x0201d; (Male, Samoan inpatient, hazardous drinker)</italic></p><p>In addition, we were advised by a key informant that the use of the words &#x02018;recommended drinking limits&#x02019; was not a helpful approach.<disp-quote><p><italic>&#x0201c;So a limit&#x02019;s actually meaningless. What language &#x02026;we&#x02019;re trying to find ways of sharing I suppose, is the risk, levels of risk and low risk, you know beyond two standard drinks you are at higher risk. So it&#x02019;s not about trying to set a limit &#x02026;you know it&#x02019;s like a speed limit, people treat it as a target, they think I can drive 100&#x02026; in actual fact they should be thinking about the conditions and is it wet and perhaps I should be driving you know 80 today on this road&#x02026;So we&#x02019;re trying to get people away from the idea of limits.&#x0201d; (Key informant)</italic></p></disp-quote></p><p>Many participants noted that instead of receiving this information message during the first week of the text message intervention, they would rather receive a message that was linking them into existing services and advice. In the prototype, such a message (number 12) was planned for the fourth week. This was perceived to be too late in the intervention, particularly for people who might feel anxious after receiving the message or who might want to take prompt action and seek help based on information provided early in the intervention process. Many participants liked the idea of having a website link in addition to a free-call number for the Alcohol Helpline.</p><p>A key element of BI is motivating and encouraging people to change their behaviour. Behaviour change techniques include providing information on consequences, using persuasive communication, discussing motivators for change, and thinking about the pros and cons of drinking alcohol. We incorporated some of these ideas in text message number four, with the aim of encouraging people to contemplate their drinking, the effects of drinking, and stimulate readiness to change. In general, participants liked this text message. They were interested in thinking about pros and cons and the effects of alcohol, and in many cases displayed a lack of knowledge about alcohol and its effects on the body.<disp-quote><p><italic>&#x0201c;&#x02026; I like that it actually gives you something you can do on your own, how it&#x02019;s like suggest that you make a list of pros and cons.

If you did a list yourself for or against, you know, pros and cons, &#x02026;you know there&#x02019;s more negative stuff to it than there is positive.&#x0201d; (Male, New Zealand European inpatient, hazardous drinker)</italic></p></disp-quote></p><p>It was clear that there were a wide range of motivators and it would be very difficult to create one message that would appeal to people of different age, gender, and ethnicity groups. However, many participants talked about the effect of alcohol consumption not just on themselves, but on their family/wh&#x00101;nau and friends, suggesting an important motivator in our communities.<disp-quote><p><italic>&#x0201c;&#x02026;You have got to find what&#x02019;s going to motivate each individual person in a way, and it&#x02019;s going to vary, person to person&#x02026;so that&#x02019;s the tricky part isn&#x02019;t it and I can imagine some people at this point will just turn off, you know the negative sort of message about the cancer, weight gain, that sounds bad and better go and have a drink.&#x0201d; (Male, New Zealand European inpatient, non-hazardous drinker)</italic></p><p><italic>&#x0201c;&#x02026; is it something more about &#x02026;, the effect of too much drinking on your friends and family or something.&#x0201d; (Male, New Zealand European inpatient, non-hazardous drinker)</italic></p><p><italic>&#x0201c;Family, there&#x02019;s always a family issue, it&#x02019;s stressing when someone ends up here [i.e. in hospital].&#x0201d; (Male, M&#x00101;ori/Niuean inpatient, hazardous drinker)</italic></p></disp-quote></p><p>Following on from the &#x02018;motivator&#x02019; text message, text message number five (at the beginning of week two of the text message intervention) was proposed to be a question evaluating a person&#x02019;s readiness to change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The intervention would branch at this point, with those responding &#x02018;Yes&#x02019; receiving text message relevant to making changes, and with those responding &#x02018;No&#x02019; receiving supporting messages providing information and encouraging contemplation about drinking alcohol. Many participants didn&#x02019;t like this message, as highlighted in these next quotes. These feelings may be due to participants not being comfortable committing to a goal which has been assigned by others, is framed in a way that is not desirable to the participant, and is not linked with any specific contexts or strategies (<italic>i.e.</italic> implementation intentions) that might help with goal striving [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].<disp-quote><p><italic>&#x0201c;Me personally I wouldn&#x02019;t like that one because I&#x02019;ve only just started on this, haven&#x02019;t really had much time to think about things.

This name was seen to be positive, inspiring, and represented a challenge or &#x02018;call to action&#x02019;.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Final version of text message intervention</title><p>The final version of the text message intervention had three main language-based text message pathways for people to choose between: 1) text messages in English with Te Reo M&#x00101;ori words of welcome and encouragement, 2) text messages in Te Reo M&#x00101;ori, and 3) text messages in English (with an option to receive a greeting in Samoan, Tongan, Cook Island M&#x00101;ori, Niuean, Tokelauan, Tuvaluan, or Fijian).</p><p>The finalised structure of the text message intervention was less complex compared with the original prototype.

The first text message in &#x02018;Week Two&#x02019; contained an empathetic, yet clear recommendation to cut down on drinking. This was followed during the rest of &#x02018;Week Two and Three&#x02019; by six messages focussed on providing information and tips/strategies about reducing alcohol consumption. The final three text messages in &#x02018;Week Four&#x02019; contained supportive and encouraging content with the key messages re-iterated. Overall, the readability of the revised content was improved (Flesch-Reading Ease score 76.4 and Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level score 5.2).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This paper describes the development of appropriate (or therapeutic) content for a text message BI service aimed at reducing hazardous drinking and alcohol-related harm among trauma inpatients. Following conceptualisation and creation of initial text message content based on the BI model and behaviour change theory, the text message content was pre-tested with trauma inpatients, key informants, and M&#x00101;ori and Pacific groups, familiar with the setting and context for the proposed intervention. We identified four key themes that were important to ensuring the text messages were engaging, relevant, and useful for potential recipients: 1) reducing the complexity of message content and structure; 2) increasing the interactive functionality of the text message programme; 3) ensuring an empowering tone to text messages; and 4) optimising the appropriateness and relevance of text messages for M&#x00101;ori and Pacific people. Consultation on the latter theme with M&#x00101;ori and Pacific groups helped us to further improve the text messages. The final version of the &#x02018;YourCall&#x02019; intervention had three pathways for people to choose between: 1) text messages in English with Te Reo M&#x00101;ori words of welcome and encouragement, 2) text messages in Te Reo M&#x00101;ori, and 3) text messages in English (with an option to receive a greeting in Samoan, Tongan, Cook Island M&#x00101;ori, Niuean, Tokelauan, Tuvaluan, or Fijian).</p><p>Our development approach and refinement of the resulting text message intervention have a number of strengths. The intervention is underpinned by established BI theory and evidence and the content development process was guided by a group of people purposively selected for their expertise in topic areas relevant to this intervention (<italic>i.e.</italic> drug and alcohol clinical services, mobile phone health technology, clinical and health psychology, youth health, and M&#x00101;ori, Pacific and Asian health). The pre-testing conducted with the target audience, key informants, and M&#x00101;ori and Pacific groups provides confidence that the text message content is engaging, relevant, and culturally-appropriate. The involvement of M&#x00101;ori and Pacific researchers was critical for being able to carry out the pre-testing in an effective and appropriate way. The resulting intervention is a proactive programme of 16 brief text messages delivered over a four week period, utilising an &#x02018;every-day&#x02019; technology that is already integrated into people&#x02019;s lives.</p><p>There are also some limitations with this research. Pre-testing the text message prototype with trauma inpatients involved a small number of participants (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;14). Seven M&#x00101;ori and Pacific patients were interviewed, rather than the intended number of ten, as fewer than expected M&#x00101;ori and Pacific patients presented during the recruitment period. Although participants were selected purposively, more males (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;11) than females (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;3) were interviewed. This may reflect the fact that more injury inpatients are male [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In addition, although all participants drank alcohol (one of the inclusion criteria), five of 14 participants had AUDIT-C scores indicating non-hazardous drinking. Inclusion of these participants enabled us to explore the viewpoints of a wide range of alcohol users. Furthermore, individuals with non-hazardous usual drinking patterns could also incur injuries in the context of a drinking episode. Although a small number of inpatients were interviewed, this was supplemented by interviews with key informants and consultation with M&#x00101;ori and Pacific groups, including drug and alcohol counsellors. By the end of this process, we were confident we had explored and addressed a wide range of issues. More particularly, we had also reached a point where we were not gaining any new or different opinions or gleaning any significant new pieces of information, consistent with data saturation, a key attribute of rigour in a qualitative research study. While the study was not designed to yield empiric findings that are generalizable to all trauma patients, it provided rich insights regarding diverse perspectives relevant to our research objectives.</p><p>The initial feedback on the text messages from the target audience involved showing them proposed messages on paper. This is likely to be quite a different experience from receiving the messages at random times within the context of their busy and complex daily lives. However we have found this to be an important first step in the development process with members of the target audience. The development process continues to be built upon and refined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. The full participant experience of the programme (and the individual messages) within the &#x02018;free living&#x02019; context can only be tested in a formal evaluation.</p><p>An important challenge when determining the extent to which the development of an intervention should be guided by user preferences is the possibility that content that is more consistent with preferences of users may not necessarily equate to more effective interventions. Indeed, a degree of challenge to what participants consider appealing may be necessary to prompt a realistic appraisal of the risks and harms associated with their drinking. Consequently, while we use the findings of this study to ensure that the content of the messages are clear, unambiguous and accessible, we rely on the overarching principles of BIs in this field to define the specific content. The result is a low-intensity &#x02018;brief&#x02019; mHealth intervention consistent with the concept of BI. Evaluating the extent to which the intervention is effective is the intended aim of a formal randomised controlled trial in progress.</p><p>The text message intervention is designed to be automated and unidirectional, which aids the ability to provide a cost-effective and scalable service. A limitation of this is the relative lack of personalisation and interactive functionality. This was reflected in feedback from respondents who expressed the positive attributes of being able to interact with the service provider, e.g. texting back and forth with someone, although others indicated some value in a less personalised approach which provided a greater level of assurance regarding privacy. A recent mHealth qualitative study by Ranney et al. (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;20) found that adolescent females (presenting in ED and at high-risk for violence and depressive symptoms) understood that text messages might be automated, but that they should be individually tailored with some two-way communication. Participants said that both automated and as-needed messages (<italic>i.e.</italic> messages that could be requested) would be useful [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Another approach is that of Renner and colleagues&#x02019; who have explored the idea of people creating their own text messages, which are then delivered at times stipulated by the recipient based on their own drinking habits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. While the YourCall text-message intervention did not have formal interactive features due to resource constraints, we included text messages which provide respondents with the free-phone number for the New Zealand Alcohol &#x00026; Drug Helpline.</p><p>This research demonstrates a robust methodology for developing a text message intervention, based on components of Whittaker and colleagues&#x02019; model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Our research has built on previous feasibility work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] to progress the concept of a brief text message intervention for hazardous alcohol use from a hypothetical idea to a fully-developed intervention. A key component of this process is the involvement of the target audience and other stakeholders to provide feedback on the prototype.</p><p>An important focus of this research was the creation of culturally-appropriate text messages, to assist with engagement. In New Zealand, where M&#x00101;ori and Pacific peoples experience inequities in the burden of alcohol-related injury outcomes and other alcohol-related harms, it is critical that interventions are developed which are relevant for the diverse realities of M&#x00101;ori and Pacific peoples and are implemented via channels (such as mobile phone) which have the potential to reduce inequalities in access to healthcare services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec13" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We have developed a text message intervention underpinned by established BI evidence and behaviour change theory to reduce harmful drinking among patients admitted following an injury who screen positive for hazardous alcohol use. While text messages remove the interpersonal component of BI, they can be viewed as an approach that distils BI to its core information elements. We employed a formative research process involving feedback from the target audience, service providers, and other key stakeholders to contextualise the content of the intervention and enhance its acceptability and appropriateness for the intervention setting. The next important step is evaluating the effectiveness of the intervention, the objective of a randomised-controlled trial currently in progress.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec14"><title>Appendix 1: Summary of interviewer guide</title><p>The content of this document was developed by the research team as a guide for the interviewers.
