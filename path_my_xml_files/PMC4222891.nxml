Barriers to help-seeking include shame, feared loss of autonomy and negative attitudes towards healthcare providers. The use of mobile devices and apps continues to rise amongst young people, thus presenting opportunities to utilize these aids in overcoming help-seeking barriers. Apps have been shown to assist in several health-related areas, including weight loss and smoking cessation, although no apps have as yet been evaluated for suicide prevention. Moreover, there is a lack of research that scientifically evaluates suicide prevention interventions within Indigenous communities.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>In this study, a recently developed self-help app will be evaluated in a randomized controlled trial. The intervention is based on acceptance and commitment therapy and mindfulness-based cognitive behavioural therapy. It is aimed at participants who have suicidal thoughts but who are not actively suicidal. In total, 150 participants will be randomly allocated to the intervention-condition (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;75) or to the wait-list control condition (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;75). Questionnaires will be completed at baseline, post-test and 6&#x000a0;weeks follow-up. The primary outcome measure is a reduction in frequency and intensity of suicidal thoughts. Secondary outcome measures are the reduction of depression, anxiety and impulsivity.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This study is the first to evaluate the effectiveness of a self-help app for suicidal thoughts amongst young Indigenous people.

The suicide rate for Indigenous people has increased dramatically over the past 30&#x000a0;years despite decreases in that for the general population. Overall, the suicide rate for Indigenous populations is twice that for non-Indigenous people with Indigenous youth being most at risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Compared with their non-Indigenous counterparts, Indigenous youth aged 15 to 24 have four times the risk of suicide, with those aged 25 to 34 having almost three times the risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>Help-seeking amongst Indigenous populations is considerably lower than in the general community. Only 14% of Indigenous people who had a diagnosable mental illness at the time of suicide sought prior mental health treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Lack of anonymity is problematic where individuals are part of a closely interwoven community and health workers are known to the help-seeking individual. Shame, stigma and the need to maintain esteem within the community are major barriers to help-seeking, as are cost (service or transport), service availability and service suitability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>Anonymous support may overcome some of these obstacles, and although the internet has gone some way to addressing help-seeking barriers in some communities, portable devices and apps may provide a more accessible means of support. The use of portable mobile devices (including smartphones and tablets) is increasing rapidly amongst youth. In mid-2012 more than 1.4 million apps were available on the market, some of which aimed to help people with their mental health and wellbeing or aid in the prevention of suicide. However, most have not been evaluated to determine their effectiveness.</p><p>Thirty-four per cent of people experiencing suicidal ideation go on to make a plan, and 29% attempt suicide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. This suggests that suicide prevention efforts need to be aimed at those with suicidal ideation. There is evidence that cognitive behavioural therapy, dialectical behaviour therapy and other cognitive interventions (that is, schema focused and problem solving therapies) are effective in reducing self-harm and suicidal behaviours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy has also shown promising results in reducing suicidal ideation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>The current intervention uses acceptance and commitment therapy, the &#x02018;third wave&#x02019; of cognitive behavioural therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Although acceptance and commitment therapy is rigorously behavioural and based on scientific validity of human cognition, it also addresses issues of spirituality, values and self, components that have been identified as crucial to successful indigenous suicide prevention strategies. The goal of acceptance and commitment therapy is to assist individuals to cease struggling against their internal experiences, such as thoughts, feelings, memories and sensations, and help them move in valued directions by implementing effective behavioural changes. Acceptance and commitment therapy has been found to be efficacious in a number of mental health domains, including depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. It has demonstrated effect sizes similar to that of traditional cognitive behavioural therapy and superior effects to control conditions for a range of mental and physical health disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>Emerging evidence suggests that online intervention to prevent suicide is feasible and effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. An international systematic review of suicide prevention for Indigenous populations identified only three studies based in Australia, none of which were controlled trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Given the prevalence of suicide amongst this community, there is an urgent need for feasible, acceptable interventions with evidence of effectiveness.</p><p>This pilot study has several aims including: assessing whether the app can reduce suicidal thinking, psychological distress or impulsivity; evaluating the acceptability of the app to young Indigenous people; assessing the feasibility of the recruitment, screening and randomization methods; examining uptake and adherence to the app; and evaluating the safety, security and clinical support protocols.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><sec><title>Design</title><p>This study is a randomized controlled trial comparing a self-help app intervention with a wait-list control condition. The intervention is aimed at persons with suicidal thoughts but without active suicidal intent. Participants in the control condition will have access to the intervention after the experimental group has finished (that is, after six weeks). Assessments will take place at baseline, immediately after intervention completion, and 6&#x000a0;weeks follow-up. This study was approved by the University of New South Wales Human Research Ethics Committee (protocol no. HC13025) the Western Australian Aboriginal Health Ethics Committee (protocol no. 486), and the Kimberley Aboriginal Health Planning Forum (protocol no. 2013&#x02013;006).</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size</title><p>A maximum of 150 participants will be recruited for the study. Power analysis for the primary outcome measure indicates that 98 participants are needed for a medium effect size. We anticipate that some participants will be lost to follow-up, lose their tablets or incur damage to them, thus the data that we obtain at the end of the trial is likely to come from fewer than the 150 registered participants.</p></sec><sec><title>Eligibility criteria and screening</title><p>Eligibility to take part in the pilot is determined in a stepwise screening process. To be eligible, participants must be: aged 18 to 30; able to attend two or three face-to-face sessions in Armidale, Sydney or Broome; consent to be asked questions of a personal nature; not have been diagnosed with a psychotic disorder such as schizophrenia; have had suicidal thoughts in the past two weeks; not be severely suicidal; and be willing to make contact with the Suicide Call Back Service.</p><p>Participants who meet the inclusion criteria will be administered the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Participants are excluded from the study if they answer, &#x02018;Not at all&#x02019;, to item 9 on the PHQ-9, which asks participants to categorize how frequently they have had &#x02018;Thoughts that you would be better off dead or of hurting yourself in some way&#x02019;, over the previous fortnight.</p><p>Individuals are then asked several suicide intent questions. Those who indicate immediate intent to take their life and have a plan to do so are excluded from the study and receive Applied Suicide Intervention Skills Training. If their intent to suicide is reduced at the end of this intervention, they are given referral information to the Suicide Call Back Service. Alternatively, if the participant still expresses intent to suicide, their local acute care team will be called, and their contact details will also be given to a clinical psychologist for follow-up within 72&#x000a0;hours. Eligible participants who have indicated distress (by scoring &#x0003e;19 on the PHQ-9 or &#x0003e;29 on the K10) will still be admitted to the study, but will be referred to support services.</p></sec><sec><title>Inclusion procedure</title><p>Participants will be screened over the phone and those eligible will be given a time for their induction session. Participants in remote locations may opt to have the tablet couriered and to have their induction over the telephone. During induction, participants will read a participant information statement, sign a consent form and safety agreement, be administered baseline measures and complete a follow-up contact form so that the researchers can make contact with them or their closest contact for post-test and follow-up measures. Individuals in the intervention group will be provided with a tablet and basic training on how to use the app, as well as assistance in setting up their security access. Those in the wait-list control group will be asked to return to the same location after 7&#x000a0;weeks, at which point they will be given a tablet and basic app training.

Participants are able to track their progress through a personalized dashboard. To cater for participants with low literacy levels, all text is accompanied by voice recordings. Although not intended as a crisis intervention tool, the app displays emergency contact information for several 24&#x000a0;hour helplines.</p><sec><title>Module 1</title><p>Participants identify thoughts they may be experiencing and group them based on the frequency at which they occur. This is done by &#x02018;swiping&#x02019; the thought down the screen into a basket. The thought that bothers them the most is then selected, and accompanying feelings and behaviours are identified, followed by psychoeducation, highlighting the links between thoughts, feelings and behaviours. Finally, participants are given strategies to help them defuse from their thoughts.</p></sec><sec><title>Module 2</title><p>Participants are taught to regulate their emotions through several strategies: mindfulness, which encourages participants to maintain non-judgemental contact with their psychological and environmental experiences as they occur; acceptance, which presents participants with an alternative to experiential avoidance and helps them to be aware of their internal experiences without the need to control them; and self-soothing activities that participants can engage in, including those that fall within social (for example, calling a friend), active (for example, going for a walk) and cultural (for example, spending time in nature) categories.</p></sec><sec><title>Module 3</title><p>Participants are taught to identify values that they would like to stand for, and asked to set small, achievable goals to help them live by these values. Rather than being end goals in themselves, values are characteristics that an individual cultivates. Examples include compassion, kindness and courage. At the end of this module, participants are given an action plan, based on their answers to the differing activities throughout the app.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec><title>Data collection</title><p>Use of the app (that is, login and logout times, activities completed, time spent in each section, answers to self-assessment questions) will be tracked within the device, and downloaded to secure servers whenever internet connectivity is established. The app will require a security pin for access and any data stored on the device will be encrypted and hidden within the app coding. Answers to self-assessment questions will be coded so that they are unintelligible to anyone not connected with the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Assessments</title><p>Baseline questionnaires will consist of items relating to demographics, help-seeking, psychological distress, depression, suicidality and impulsivity (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Measures will also be administered immediately after participants complete the interventions, and at 6&#x000a0;weeks follow-up. The Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9) is the depression scale of the Patient Health Questionnaire, and consists of nine items, each scoring from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day). Participants are asked to rate how problematic the items have been for them over the previous fortnight. Overall scores range from 0 to 27 with 0 to 4 representing no or minimal depression, 5 to 9 representing mild depression, 10 to 14 moderate depression, 15 to 19 moderately severe depression, and 20 to 27 severe depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Overview of measures</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" border="1"><colgroup><col align="left"/><col align="left"/><col align="left"/><col align="center"/><col align="left"/><col align="left"/><col align="left"/><col align="left"/></colgroup><thead valign="top"><tr><th align="left"><bold>Variable</bold></th><th align="left"><bold>Test measure</bold></th><th align="left"><bold>Screener</bold></th><th align="center"><bold>Brief assessment</bold></th><th align="left"><bold>Baseline</bold></th><th align="left"><bold>Within app</bold></th><th align="left"><bold>Post-test</bold></th><th align="left"><bold>Follow-up</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody valign="top"><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Screener, part 1<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Questions<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">X<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Psychological distress<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">K10<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">X<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">X<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">X<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">X<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Depression<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PHQ-9<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">X<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">X<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">X<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">X<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">X<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Suicide intent<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">5 questions<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">X<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Demographics<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Questions<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">X<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Mental health service utilization<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Client Service Receipt Inventory<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">X<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Impulsivity<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BIS-11<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">X<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">X<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">X<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Suicidal ideation<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">DSI-SS<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">X<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">X<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">X<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Suicidal ideation and plan</td><td align="left">2 questions</td><td align="left">&#x000a0;</td><td align="center">&#x000a0;</td><td align="left">&#x000a0;</td><td align="left">X</td><td align="left">&#x000a0;</td><td align="left">&#x000a0;</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>BIS-11, Barratt Impulsivity Scale;

Dropout from the study can introduce a selection bias and therefore be a threat to validity. To minimize this, participants will be asked for additional contact details so that even if the intervention is not completed, follow-up assessments may still be collected. Further, each participant will be contacted via email or text message three weeks into the intervention or wait-list period for a brief assessment. A reminder to continue with the app will be provided at this point.</p><p>A further limitation is that none of the measures provides a psychiatric diagnosis. The intent is to keep the measures to a minimum in order to increase retention, as the research participants may find too many measures a barrier to participation. Some participants are also likely to have low literacy skills. Long, complex measures would be a significant problem for these participants. To overcome literacy problems, participants have the option of face-to-face or telephone assistance to complete the measures. Moreover, the app targets suicidal ideation irrespective of diagnosis and, as such, a measure of suicidality is a more appropriate primary outcome measure.</p><p>Researching suicide prevention is difficult; perhaps even more so within Indigenous communities. Because of this, little is known about what works with this population. While suicide rates have dropped amongst the general population over the last two decades, they remain stubbornly high in the Indigenous community [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. This study will make a significant and unique contribution to our knowledge about suicide prevention and treating suicidal ideation.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial status</title><p>Currently recruiting.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>BIS-11: Barratt Impulsivity Scale; DSI-SS: Depressive Symptom Inventory &#x02013; Suicidality Subscale; K10: Kessler Psychological Distress Scale; PHQ-9: Patient Health Questionnaire 9.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>HC obtained funding for this study.

Samsung Australia very kindly donated 150 Galaxy tablets for the study. Thoughtworks have programmed the app at considerably reduced cost. The Young and Well Cooperative Research Centre (YAW-CRC) has provided a PhD scholarship to examine the effectiveness of the app through this pilot. This study has been designed and will be carried out with the help of an Indigenous reference group and expert panel members. This group consists of Indigenous suicide prevention peer educators, multimedia professionals, professionals on suicide, depression, web-based interventions or clinical psychology in general.
