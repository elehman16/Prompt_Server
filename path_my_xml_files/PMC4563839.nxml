Despite improved STEMI patient care, mortality remains high, contributing significantly to the ischemic heart disease burden. This may partly be related to ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). Remote ischemic conditioning (RIC), through short cycles of ischemia-reperfusion applied to a limb, has been shown to reduce IRI in various clinical settings. Our primary hypothesis is that RIC will reduce adverse events related to STEMI when applied as adjunctive therapy to primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>&#x0201c;Remote ischemic conditioning in ST-elevation myocardial infarction as adjuvant to primary angioplasty&#x0201d; (RIC-STEMI) is an ongoing prospective, single-center, open-label, randomized controlled trial to assess whether RIC as an adjunctive therapy during primary PCI in patients presenting with STEMI can improve clinical outcomes. After enrollment, participants are randomized according to a computer-generated randomization schedule, in a ratio of 1:1 to RIC or no intervention, in blocks of four individuals. RIC is begun at least 10&#x000a0;min before the estimated time of the first balloon inflation and its duration is 30&#x000a0;min. Ischemia is induced by three cycles of inflation of a blood pressure cuff placed on the left lower limb to 200&#x000a0;mmHg and then deflation to 0&#x000a0;mmHg for another 5&#x000a0;min. Primary endpoint is a combined endpoint of death from cardiac cause or hospitalization for heart failure (HF) on follow-up (including device implantation: implantable cardioverter defibrillator, cardiac resynchronization and left ventricular assist device). Secondary endpoints are myocardial infarction (MI) size (estimated by the 48&#x000a0;h area under the curve of serum troponin I levels), development of Q-wave MI, left ventricular function (assessed by echocardiography within the first 3&#x000a0;days after admission), contrast-induced nephropathy, in-hospital mortality, all-cause mortality and, finally, major adverse cardiovascular events. Patients will have a minimum follow-up period of 12&#x000a0;months. From 11 March 2013 to 31 December 2014, 324 patients have been enrolled and randomized. We expect to complete enrollment of the 494 patients deemed necessary within 3&#x000a0;years.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02313961?term=remote+conditioning&#x00026;rank=8">NCT02313961</ext-link>; registered on 8 December 2014.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13063-015-0937-1) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Ischemic heart disease is the leading cause of mortality worldwide, accounting for over 7 million deaths per year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) accounts for nearly one third of acute coronary syndromes. The widespread use of timely reperfusion, particularly with primary percutaneous coronary intervention, has resulted in a significant reduction in the acute STEMI mortality, reaching approximately 5 % in recent years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. However, this reduction of the in-hospital mortality also led to an increase in the incidence of chronic heart failure (HF) because many patients with severely depressed left ventricular function, who would have died in the acute STEMI phase in the past, now survive at the cost of severe HF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. As a result, 6-month mortality associated with STEMI remains unacceptably high, approximately 12 %, with an even higher mortality rate in higher risk patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Consequently, attention is no longer solely aimed at reducing the acute mortality associated with STEMI but also to limit the downstream consequence of postinfarction HF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is believed to account for up to 40-50 % of infarct size and may be a target to prevent evolution to heart failure after STEMI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Several pharmacological alternatives have been attempted to prevent IRI in promising animal experiments; nevertheless, clinical translation has been disappointing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. On the opposite side, ischemic conditioning (IC) by short cycles of ischemia-reperfusion applied before, during or after a major ischemic event has clearly been shown to attenuate IRI in various clinical scenarios. Moreover, even so-called remote IC (RIC), which are repeated bouts of limb ischemia, are cardioprotective, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In 2010, B&#x000f8;tker et al. showed improved myocardial salvage index as assessed by single photon emission computed tomography 30&#x000a0;days after PCI in patients randomly assigned to receive concomitant RIC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], whereas Rentoukas <italic>et al</italic>. found higher proportions of ST-segment resolution with adjunctive RIC compared with PCI alone. However, significant reductions in troponin I peaks only reached statistical significance in a subgroup undergoing both RIC and morphine therapy combined with PCI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. More recently, Sloth et al. evaluated the long-term effect of RIC on the population initially analyzed by B&#x000f8;tker et al. (166 patients underwent PCI with adjunctive RIC and 167 patients simply underwent PCI). The authors showed improved long-term prognosis for patients that underwent adjunctive RIC as regards the composite endpoint of adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events: all-cause mortality, MI, readmission for HF, and ischaemic stroke/transient ischaemic attack [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. However, although very promising, their results are inconclusive with regard to cardiovascular mortality and HF development, since the study was not powered to show differences in these clinical events. Large-scale studies addressing major adverse cardiovascular events are warranted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>The primary objective of our trial is to test the hypothesis that RIC will reduce adverse events related to STEMI, mainly by preventing evolution to post-infarction HF.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/Design</title><p>The trial protocol was developed in accordance with the SPIRIT (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials) guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] (Appendix <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Overview of the study design</p><p>RIC-STEMI is an ongoing prospective, single-center, open-label, randomized controlled trial to assess whether RIC as an adjunctive therapy during primary PCI in patients presenting with STEMI can improve clinical outcomes as assessed by a cardiac-caused death or hospitalization for heart failure (HF) for a minimum follow-up period of 12&#x000a0;months. According to IRI pathophysiology, RIC is expected to reduce infarct size and, consequently, post-infarction heart failure and the adverse events associated to it. In contrast, RIC is not expected to have any major effect on further ischemic and thrombotic events; therefore, other major cardiovascular events (MACE) such as new-onset MI, stroke and need for redo revascularization, either by coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or PCI, are not part of the primary endpoints.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Setting and participants</title><p>All PCI eligible patients presenting with putative STEMI at our institution are screened for enrollment.

Because more than 95 % of our patients are catheterized using the radial artery, the left lower limb was chosen in order to not interfere with this approach. RIC is begun approximately 10&#x000a0;min before the estimated time of the first balloon inflation and its duration is 30&#x000a0;min. As reperfusion must be achieved as early as possible, RIC may be completed during and even after the angioplasty. Ischemia is induced by three cycles of inflation of the blood pressure cuff to 200&#x000a0;mmHg and then deflation to 0&#x000a0;mmHg for another 5&#x000a0;min (Appendix <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Apart from temporary moderate pain in the treated thigh, RIC has been shown to be innocuous. All patients receive the standard of care therapy according to institutional guidelines, namely treatment with 250&#x000a0;mg aspirin intravenously, a P2Y<sub>12</sub> inhibitor orally and 5000&#x000a0;IU unfractioned heparin intravenously before PCI. The choice of balloons, stent types and PCI procedure, as well as the use of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors, is left to the discretion of the attending physician.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Study endpoints</title><p>RIC is expected to reduce myocardial damage associated with IRI, preventing postinfarction heart failure.</p><p>The primary endpoint is a combined outcome of death from cardiac cause or hospitalization for HF on follow-up (including device implantation: implantable cardioverter defibrillator, cardiac resynchronization and left ventricular assist device).

Considering an accrual period of 36&#x000a0;months, a minimum follow-up period of 12&#x000a0;months (maximum follow-up of 48&#x000a0;months), overall primary combined endpoint incidence of 14 % (data from our institution) and a treatment effect of 40 % (arbitrarily set as clinically relevant), we estimate we will need to enroll 224 patients per group (total of 448).
