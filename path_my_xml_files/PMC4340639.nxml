Process evaluations play an important role in improving the science of randomised controlled trials. We recently reported the results of the Action 3:30 cluster randomised feasibility trial illustrating higher levels of moderate to vigorous intensity PA among boys but not girls. The aim of this paper is to report the process evaluation results including intervention fidelity, implementation, context and how intervention components and trial design could be improved before proceeding to a definitive RCT.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Children&#x02019;s session enjoyment was assessed every two weeks. Reasons for non-attendance were provided by questionnaire at the end of the intervention. Post intervention interviews were held with participating teaching assistants (TAs) and school key contacts (KCs), and focus groups were conducted with children in all 10 intervention schools. Interviews and focus groups examined how recruitment and session attendance might be improved and established which elements of the programme that were and were not well received.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Data indicated good intervention fidelity with TA&#x02019;s adopting enjoyment-focussed teaching styles and the sessions improving children&#x02019;s skills and self-esteem. Several positive aspects of implementation were identified, including high session variety, the opportunity to work in teams, the child-led sessions and the engaging leader style. In terms of context there was evidence that TA&#x02019;s faced difficulties managing challenging behaviour and that further training in this area was needed. TAs and KCs felt that recruitment could be improved by providing taster sessions during PE lessons and clarifying the days that the clubs would run at the point of recruitment. The programme could be improved to enhance interest for girls, by including training for managing disruptive behaviour and making some activities more age-group appropriate.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Action 3.30 showed promise but could be improved by ensuring age appropriate activities, providing more appeal to girls and improving recruitment through taster sessions and early establishment of days of the week it is to be offered on.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN58502739">ISRCTN58502739.</ext-link></p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12889-015-1501-3) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Physical activity</kwd><kwd>Intervention process evaluation</kwd><kwd>Interview</kwd><kwd>Focus group</kwd><kwd>Children</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Regular physical activity is associated with improved psychological well-being and lower levels of cardio-metabolic risk factors including elevated insulin, lipoproteins and blood pressure among children and adolescents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. A number of studies have shown that large proportions of children and adolescents do not engage in the current recommendation of an hour of moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity (MVPA) per day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Physical activity levels also decline with age, with a recent meta-analysis reporting an average decline of 7% per year during adolescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The end of primary (elementary) school is therefore an important period in which children&#x02019;s physical activity behaviours are established. Systematic reviews of physical activity interventions for children have identified that interventions typically yielded small or no improvements in levels of MVPA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. There is therefore a need to find new, more effective physical activity interventions.</p><p>The majority of physical activity interventions for children and adolescents have been delivered at school during the key contact time of the established curriculum (e.g., changes to physical education delivery) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. A possible reason for the failure of these interventions is the difficulty of using curriculum time for activities that are not aligned with core educational aspirations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The time allocated to PE in the UK curriculum is also limited to around 2&#x000a0;hours per week and therefore there is limited time within which to help less active children to develop the skills and confidence to be active. As such, extra-curricular interventions which harness the infrastructure of the school (buildings, location, key target audience), but do not impinge on educational time may provide a unique opportunity to facilitate physical activity behaviour change among children and young people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Teaching assistants (TA) work in the classroom setting and help teachers to support children with tasks such as reading, writing, and maths in both large groups and on a one&#x02013;to-one basis, and are a group that could be trained to deliver physical activity sessions for children. A 2009 systematic review of extra-curricular interventions identified 13 papers reporting the results from 11 different studies of which only one had included objective assessments of children&#x02019;s physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. None of the studies were conducted in the United Kingdom [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and none included Teaching Assistants. A separate 2009 review highlighted the current methodological weakness of evaluations of after-school interventions and highlighted a need for more well-controlled trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Thus, there is a need to robustly examine the viability and effectiveness of extra-curricular physical activity interventions in UK schools.</p><p>Process evaluations are integral elements of complex behaviour change interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] which scrutinise intervention delivery, receipt and implementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. A key goal of a process evaluation is to provide insight into whether an intervention &#x0201c;<italic>does</italic>&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;<italic>does not&#x0201d; work</italic>, that is, whether the intervention in itself is ineffective or whether the lack of effect is due to poor intervention implementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Key features of a process evaluation are the dose delivered, the reach (or number of people who receive the intervention), fidelity (extent to which the intervention was delivered as planned), implementation (how well the programme was implemented) and context which provides critical information on the environment in which the programme was delivered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Process evaluations are also very helpful during the development and piloting of interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Process evaluations can capture information on how the intervention may work in a trial setting as well as gather feedback from participants, intervention deliverers and key stakeholders on how the intervention content could be improved to maximise the potential for behaviour change. Information that can enhance the running of a trial such as feedback on maximising recruitment, increasing adherence and maximising attendance can also be obtained and used to refine, and improve the trial design prior to conducting a larger, fully powered randomised controlled trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>We have recently reported the results of the Action 3:30 feasibility trial, which was conducted in 20 primary schools (10 intervention and 10 control schools) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and focussed on increasing the physical activity levels of Year 5 and 6 pupils (9&#x02013;11 years of age). The 10 intervention schools received the Action 3:30 intervention, which consisted of a 5-day training programme for two TAs per school, who subsequently co-delivered a 40-session after-school physical activity programme (2 &#x000d7; 60&#x000a0;minute sessions per week, for 20&#x000a0;weeks). Up to 30 Year 5/6 children in each school opted to join the study and agreed to attend the Action 3:30 club if their school was randomised to the intervention group. The 40-sessions included adaptations of traditional team sports, small-sided games, and a session in which the children led the activities. Children attending the Action 3:30 clubs received a hand-out after every four sessions (i.e. every 2&#x000a0;weeks) of activities that had been taught during the sessions that they could practice at home.</p><p>The strategies that underpinned the delivery were based on the self-determination theory (SDT) principles of building confidence, autonomy and a sense of belonging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Specifically, the sessions were designed to increase the children&#x02019;s interest in and enjoyment of physical activity and enjoyment was designed to have been facilitated by the TAs adopting a friendly, engaging communication style, in order to boost the children&#x02019;s skills, confidence, and self-esteem. Due to space constraints, the degree to which the intervention was delivered in a way that was consistent with SDT will be presented in a separate paper and a link to the publication posted on the project website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bristol.ac.uk/sps/researchprojectpages/action330/">http://www.bristol.ac.uk/sps/researchprojectpages/action330/</ext-link>).</p><p>The feasibility trial analysis suggested that boys in intervention schools obtained 8.6 more minutes of MVPA on weekdays than boys in the control group at the end of the program, but this was not sustained four months after the programme had ended [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. There was no evidence of an effect on MVPA among girls. In terms of dose delivered, all 40 sessions were delivered in five of the 10 schools, with 3 schools running 39 sessions, one 38 and one 29 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Analyses showed that the mean attendance across the sessions in the 10 intervention schools was 53%, with considerable between-school variability; one school achieved a mean attendance of 86% with all enrolled pupils attending at least half of all sessions, whereas two schools had a mean attendance of 39% and 36% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Thus, the intervention had a reasonable level of reach and a high dose of the intervention was delivered but more work is needed to increase levels of attendance. While these results add to the evidence base for the potential of extra-curricular interventions, they do not provide information on intervention fidelity, implementation, context or why the intervention appeared to be more effective for boys than girls, and how it could be improved to facilitate the desired behaviour change. Thus, the aim of this paper is to report on the results of the process evaluation of the Action 3:30 intervention, with a particular focus on how the intervention was delivered, investigating why the intervention results differed by sex, and ways in which the intervention could be improved before proceeding to a fully-powered trial.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The process evaluation included qualitative and quantitative components. The quantitative data were collected during the intervention period and focussed on intervention fidelity and dose. The qualitative data were collected at the end of the 20-week intervention and consisted of interviews with the TAs who delivered the intervention, interviews with school contacts in both intervention and control schools who facilitated the logistics of the study taking place in their school, and focus groups with intervention participants (children) in all intervention schools. In the sections below we provide an overview of these data including participants, data sources and data interpretation. The study was approved by an ethics committee at the University of Bristol, with written informed consent obtained for all adult participants. As the children were in Years 5 or 6 (9&#x02013;11 years of age) written informed parental consent was obtained.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Quantitative data</title><p>Participants in intervention schools were asked to complete a perceived enjoyment questionnaire every two weeks. The questionnaire consisted of a single item referring to their enjoyment of that day&#x02019;s session (&#x0201c;Please circle the number that shows how much you enjoyed Action 3:30 today&#x0201d;). Children responded using a 5-point Likert- type scale ranging from 1 (&#x0201d;Not at all&#x0201d;) to 5 (&#x0201d;A lot&#x0201d;). The mean score at each time was computed for each school as well as an overall mean per week across the schools. A multi-level model, using school, pupil, and occasion as the levels, was used to estimate the proportion of variability in the enjoyment ratings given by each pupil on each occasion that was attributable to each level in the model. Results from this model are interpreted as the amount of variation within pupils, between pupils, and between schools.</p><p>To understand whether participation in Action 3:30 was accompanied by a reduction in other after-school activities involving physical activity, children in intervention schools were asked on five occasions (weeks 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20) to report in open-response format what they did on each day that week <italic>after-school but before tea-time</italic> (or dinner time) (&#x0201c;Please tell us what organised activities (or clubs) you do at the moment after school but before tea time.&#x0201d; Responses for each day at each of the five time points were subsequently coded into six categories: 1) Organised team sports; 2) Unstructured activities; 3) Structured PA classes; 4) Structured youth clubs; 5) Structured sedentary activities; and 6) Independent sedentary activities. The six activities were subsequently collapsed into three categories (active events, youth clubs, and sedentary events). For each activity type a total was computed for individual participants by summing the number reported each day. Finally, at the end of the intervention period all participants in intervention schools who had missed at least one club session were asked to indicate how much they agreed with 13 reasons for non-attendance (e.g., <italic>When I signed up I thought it would be different</italic>). The content of the thirteen items was informed by conversations held between project staff, school staff and pupils on reasons why children did not attend. Responses were scored from 1 (Not true for me) to 5 (Very true for me). An average rating for each reason was computed. This was subsequently collapsed into three categories by combining responses of &#x02018;Not true for me&#x02019; with &#x02018;Not really true for me&#x02019;, and &#x02018;Often true for me&#x02019; with &#x02018;Sometimes true for me&#x02019;.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Qualitative data</title><p>The two TAs in each of the ten intervention schools were invited to participate in a semi-structured interview and 18 (16 female) of the 20 agreed to take part. Interviews were conducted by a researcher with qualitative research experience but no other involvement in the project. A topic guide was designed to explore the following: views on the training received, general opinions towards the intervention, participant attendance, the perceived impact of the intervention on participants, possible improvements, and the impact of the study on the TAs themselves. The interviewer also pursued any emergent issues that were not on the original interview guides and these topics were then added to all subsequent interviews in an iterative process.</p><p>Key contacts (KCs) were the member of school staff in each of the 20 schools who had responsibility for liaising with the research team about the trial (either intervention or control). Typically, KCs were a head of year or the physical education coordinator within the school. All 20 KCs were invited to take part in a semi-structured interviewed and 12 (6 intervention, 6 control) agreed to participate. The KC interview guide covered the following topics: reasons for the school participating in the study, positives and negatives of the study, the perceived impact of the intervention on participants and the TAs involved, attendance, and possible improvements.</p><p>A focus group was conducted in each intervention school (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;10) with six children who were enrolled in the study per focus group. To ensure that data were collected from a range of participants, the focus group participants were purposively sampled to recruit a boy and a girl from each third of attendance per school (i.e. a total of 3 boys and 3 girls per school). An additional boy and girl were randomly selected from each attendance group as reserves in case of any absences on the day of the focus group. The focus group was semi-structured and the guide included the following topics: why children enrolled, activities that were/were not enjoyed, the impact of the intervention on their physical activity and interest in physical activity, and their opinions regarding the Action 3:30 Leaders.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Qualitative data analysis</title><p>Interviews and focus groups were recorded using an encrypted dictaphone and transcribed verbatim. All transcripts were read and re-read by multiple members of the research team and an initial coding frame constructed by four authors (BD, KB, SJS and RJ). Interviews and child focus groups were imported into NVivo (Version 10, QSR, Southport, UK) and coded as individual case nodes. A thematic framework approach was used for data analysis in which the initial coding framework was applied to the three data sources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Researcher triangulation was employed in which themes were identified by one author and verified by two additional authors. Themes were then developed by combining similar codes and were compared between the different sources of data to provide a rich account of the intervention within and between schools and informants. A framework matrix was then created to enable themes to be compared across different sources of data (i.e., children, TAs and key contacts). Reporting of the qualitative data is consistent with RATS guidance.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>Quantitative findings</title><p>Figures&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a and b shows the mean enjoyment levels per school per session by gender. The data indicate that overall the enjoyment levels were between 3.5 and 4.5, with the majority of sessions between 3.5 and 4.0. The gender-specific graphs indicate similar patterns for boys and girls with a slight downward trend and considerable variability within and between schools. Further, analysis using a multi-level model suggested that less than 1% of the variation in enjoyment scores was between schools, 17% was between pupils, and 82% was within pupils. Thus, most of the variation is unexplained, but probably due to factors such as the content of a particular session and children&#x02019;s enjoyment differed across sessions.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>

Specifically, the children, KCs and TAs liked many elements of the Action 3:30 clubs. Specific elements of the intervention that were well-received included enjoyment of the sessions, the opportunity to build teamwork, the range of choice across all activities (particularly the child-led sessions), and the engaging, empowering TA leadership style. These positive elements of the sessions were perceived to have led to increases in the motor skill-level, the confidence and self-esteem of many of the children, and particularly children who were not previously active. Thus, the data presented in this paper have shown that it is possible to train TAs to deliver enjoyable and effective physical activity programmes after school.</p><p>The exit questionnaire data showed that there was a small reduction in attendance at other types of clubs among the intervention group over the period that the programme was running, and that a key reason why the children did not attend Action 3:30 clubs was that they had another after-school commitment. These findings suggest that to some extent the children who attend extra-curricular physical activity programmes will switch from one programme to another, and as a result any intervention effect that might be obtained from new interventions such as Action 3:30 is likely to be attenuated. There was also some evidence that the clubs were more difficult to lead when there were lower levels of attendance, suggesting that attendance might have adversely affected programme delivery. However, we previously reported that the boys who attended the Action 3:30 clubs were obtaining 8.6 more minutes of MVPA per day than the control group at the end of the intervention period. Thus, it is possible to use extra-curricular provision to increase activity; however, the programmes have to be superior to existing provision. Our findings are therefore consistent with previous research that has identified extra-curricular interventions as a relatively under-explored approach to increasing children&#x02019;s physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. However, revisions to the Action 3:30 programme are needed to maximise the potential benefit for all children, including children who may be switching from another after-school programme.</p><p>The focus group data showed that the children particularly appreciated having choice and a sense of ownership over the activities they were taught during the sessions. The quantitative data also showed children enjoyed the sessions although it is important to note that the enjoyment ratings were only completed by children attending the sessions and it seems likely that children who did not enjoy the programme would be less likely to attend. Less than 1% of the variation in enjoyment ratings was attributable to between-school differences suggesting that sessions were delivered consistently in different schools, and session leaders were comparable across schools. The Action 3:30 intervention therefore holds promise as an intervention approach.</p><p>Recruitment could have been improved by allowing potential participants to attend taster sessions, perhaps during physical education lessons as part of the recruitment process. This finding is consistent with our recent experience in which we have found that running dance taster sessions is an important route to successful recruitment of girls into an extra-curricular dance intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Moreover, attendance is likely to have been enhanced by identifying at the point of recruitment, the days of the week when potential sessions would run, and agreeing attendance commitments with the children. Each of these three ideas would be consistent with standard processes for extra-curricular physical activity programmes in schools, and therefore use of these approaches would enhance the external validity of the programme. Implementing these processes into the scope of a trial is, however, more difficult. To facilitate randomisation after baseline data have been collected, it is usually necessary to conduct the recruitment process several months prior to the intervention beginning. Thus, to facilitate the research design, schools need to agree to hold time slots in their extra-curricular timetable, identify potential staff to attend sessions and to facilitate a fair test of the intervention by specifically not offering an alternative programme if their school is assigned to the control arm. All of these options are possible but they require considerable buy-in to the research process that would need to be handled sensitively within the school setting.</p><p>The three key stakeholders (participants, TAs and KCs) provided suggestions for general improvements to the Action 3:30 clubs and these are summarised in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. The most significant suggestions were to increase the motivation and interest of girls, and to lower the age group to Years 4 and 5 as opposed to Years 5 and 6. The age appropriateness of the programme was highlighted in both the qualitative findings and the reasons children gave for non-attendance. The mean value for the item &#x0201c;the activities were too easy&#x0201d; was relatively high thereby suggesting that age appropriateness affected both attendance and perhaps also enjoyment and participation. The suggestion to change the programme content to increase its appeal to girls is consistent with the previously published data from this project which has shown that the intervention led to an 8.6&#x000a0;minute increase in the PA of the boys but no effect on PA of the girls. A body of work has shown that boys are generally more active than girls and that there is a steeper decline in the activity levels of girls as compared to boys as they approach adolescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. A number of studies have specifically focussed on increasing the activity levels of girls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] but consistent with most child-focussed interventions, the effect of these studies has been limited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Thus, it is not clear whether sex-specific programmes or combined programmes are likely to be of greatest benefit. Conversations between the project team and local school staff suggest that it would be logistically challenging to provide separate programmes for boys and girls in UK primary schools. Identifying ways to develop extra-curricular physical activity programmes that appeal to both boys and girls is a challenge that needs to be met. Thus, we feel that the critical revisions that are required are to improve the appeal of sessions to girls and change the focus to Year 4 and 5 pupils.</p><p>The three key stakeholders suggested that the session content could be improved by reducing the number of activities per session, using videos to model session plans and finding ways to engage the children more in the activities (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). There were also suggestions that the training would benefit from a renewed focus on how to manage disruptive behaviour and how to adapt the individual sessions to the needs of each particular group. This finding is consistent with our previous work in developing an after-school dance intervention for secondary school aged girls, in which we found that behaviour management is a critical issue, as disruptive students can make delivery of the sessions hard, and negatively affect the atmosphere within the sessions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The children also suggested that the programme could be improved by engaging the children themselves in the behaviour management process, setting up agreed conduct codes and ground rules and encouraging the TAs to join in with the sessions. These are all changes that could be incorporated into a revision of the Action 3:30 programme</p><p>The findings presented in this paper show that the intervention holds promise and that several key components of the intervention such as session enjoyment, choice over the activities, leadership style and developing the skill and self-esteem of participants may well function as mediators of the intervention in a larger, cluster randomised controlled trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. (As noted above, these issues will be addressed in a separate paper which focuses on the SDT aspects of the study). The data also suggest that results may differ for boys and girls. Including assessments of each of these constructs in a future trial would therefore be helpful in understanding intervention effectiveness. The use of process evaluations to inform revisions to complex interventions is consistent with the MRC framework for complex interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. A number of studies have reported process evaluations of physical activity based cluster randomized controlled trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] or the use of process evaluations to refine and improve PA interventions through an iterative process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. There has, however, been a relative lack of published studies that have reported on the process evaluations of feasibility trials of physical activity interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. As such, the data presented in this paper provide a unique and valuable example of how a process evaluation can be incorporated into feasibility trials and used to inform the refinement of key intervention components before proceeding to a full trial.</p><sec id="Sec10"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>The major strength of this study is the availability of quantitative and qualitative data from all of the key stakeholders in the intervention. These various sources of information have enabled us to increase our understanding of how the intervention was received and perhaps, more importantly, how it could be improved. The major limitation of the study is that the data reflect the views of stakeholders who received a particular intervention in the Southwest of England, limiting the potential to extrapolate to other extra-curricular interventions in other contexts.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The Action 3:30 intervention holds considerable promise with the data reported in this paper showing that many children enjoyed the intervention, that the session content was well received by the children and school staff, and that the programme was perceived to have positive effects on the self-esteem and physical activity skill level of many children. The programme could be improved by making the sessions more appealing to girls and focussing on Year 4 and 5 children. In terms of trial design, recruitment into the trial could have been improved by providing taster sessions of Action 3:30 sessions during PE lessons and clarifying the days in which the clubs would run at the point of recruitment.</p><sec id="Sec12"><title>Availability of supplementary data</title><p>Anonymised versions of the data from the Action 3:30 project have been deposited in the University of Bristol Research Data Repository (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://data.bris.ac.uk/data/">http://data.bris.ac.uk/data/</ext-link>) and will be made available to external collaborators from September 2016.</p></sec></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec13"><title>Additional file</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12889_2015_1501_MOESM1_ESM.docx" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1: Table S1.</label><caption><p>Pupils&#x02019; self-reported reasons for non-attendance at Action 3:30 club sessions*.</p></caption></media></p></sec></app></app-group><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>The study was conceived and funding secured by RJ, KRF, AAM, JP, SJS, and JLT.
