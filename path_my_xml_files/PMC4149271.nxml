Clinical trials have demonstrated the effectiveness of a range of interventions and initiatives in improving outcomes for people experiencing these common but disabling problems. However many people with high levels of mental distress are disadvantaged, either because care is not available to them in the right place and time, or because when they do access care, their interaction with care-givers deters help-seeking, or diverts it into forms that do not address their needs. Various interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], collaborative care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], self-management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], and social and community initiatives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] have shown preliminary evidence of effectiveness in trials in improving outcomes for people experiencing depression and anxiety who may not readily access timely or appropriately targeted care.</p><p>Developing interventions to widen access to mental health care is a policy priority in the UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. As part of a larger funded programme grant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], detailed reviews of groups known to experience poor access were synthesized to inform the development of a wellbeing intervention (summarised in methods). The reviews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] emphasised both heterogeneity and commonalities in access issues within and across under-represented groups. The emerging evidence-base accordingly emphasises delivery adaptations (practitioner skills, characteristics and flexible patient centred approaches) over cultural adaptation of underlying principles of therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. While evidence-based culturally adapted treatments have been available for some time, US experience suggests they remain &#x02018;largely unused in usual care settings&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Designing specific interventions for different under-represented groups through a common framework may improve the subsequent uptake in services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>Engaging hard-to-reach groups and providing practitioners with the support to address wider systemic barriers required adjunct primary care and community engagement interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. These community [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] interventions, engaged the public, NGOs and health professionals in developing and disseminating materials addressing health literacy and cultural competence and provided information and feedback to allow for tailoring and publicising the psychosocial interventions. Success in improving access to care is nevertheless predicated on improving the availability of acceptable and effective therapies.</p><p>Ethnic minority groups and older people were selected from the eight exemplar groups included in the review phase for development of and testing of the intervention model in phase two. As part of the design for evaluation of the wider programme, the psychosocial intervention (reported here) and enhanced primary care engagement was active in four different localities, with an active community engagement component in just two [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The localities determined the focus, with South Asian communities predominating in one locality, and Somali communities in the other, the two older peoples sites were predominantly White British. All localities were socio-economically deprived areas in the North West of England. Sampling was inclusive, thus Elders sites could recruit both white British and ethnic minority elders to the elders intervention, and ethnic minority sites may recruit elders to the ethnic minority intervention.</p><p>Women of South Asian family origin in the UK have a high prevalence of depression and self-harm, often in the context of severe and persistent social difficulties, which only become apparent when they are in a crisis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Depression is common in older people, particularly those with chronic physical illness, but tends to be under-diagnosed and inadequately managed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>While there are many differences commonalities include the impact of chronicity, social isolation, stigma and a lack of identification with routine biomedical understandings of mental health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. A marked difference between groups included meeting the language needs of some minority patients, however deep rooted communication issues such as differential mental health models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], perceived candidacy for treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and recursivity in cultural expectations of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] exist in both groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>The programme had two distinct phases</title><p>Phase 1 aimed to:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Determine the content and delivery method, of an intervention protocol targeting older and ethnic minority people</p></list-item><list-item><p>Develop and deliver a training package for mental health workers to effectively deliver the intervention protocol.</p></list-item></list></p><p>Phase 2 aimed to:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Test the intervention protocol by estimating key parameters for a definitive trial including:</p></list-item></list><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>&#x025cb; referral and recruitment rates</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x025cb; uptake and delivery of the intervention</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x025cb; outcomes in patients receiving the intervention compared to those in usual care</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x025cb; acceptability of the intervention from user and provider perspectives</p></list-item></list></p><p>Our aim was to develop and evaluate an, acceptable and culturally sensitive psychosocial intervention for older people, and people from ethnic minority communities. While the samples involved are relatively small they support the feasibility of developing psychosocial interventions to improve access for hard to reach groups driven by a set of common theoretical underpinnings and common mechanisms and practices to support tailoring of interventions to the particularities of local communities.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Phase 1: Developing the intervention</title><p>We summarise our methods of developing the intervention in Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. We drew on six sources of evidence: a systematic review of access studies, a meta-synthesis of data on patient perspectives, dialogues with local stakeholders, a review of grey literature from statutory and voluntary service providers, secondary analysis of patient transcripts from previous qualitative studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and interviews with service users and carers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The research team held a one-day workshop to synthesise the key findings of the 6 sources of evidence. We drew up a matrix of results, with each row of the matrix detailing one of the key intervention design issues that we wished to address, and the columns referring to the results from each individual data set [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. This matrix was used to derive the key principles to be incorporated into the intervention. These included:<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>

South Asian and Somali service user and 3rd sector groups were conducted either through interpreters or by a researcher who spoke Urdu, Hindi and Punjabi. The key findings of the focus groups incorporated into the interventions were: labelling the intervention &#x02018;wellbeing&#x02019; rather than &#x02018;mental health&#x02019;; providing choice of both individual and group interventions; providing home visits for the older person); allowing self-referral; the intervention should be socially orientated, and empower people with skills and tools that they could use in their daily life.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>The wellbeing intervention</title><p>The wellbeing intervention focussed on brief cognitive behavioural strategies aimed at decreasing anxiety and depression and social isolation.

Once the goals had been identified, the participant chose up to three ways to obtain support to achieve them: individual sessions with their wellbeing facilitator; group sessions with other participants; or direction (&#x02018;signposting&#x02019;) to appropriate public or voluntary services in their locality (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>

Where the participant was prescribed antidepressant or anxiolytic medication, the wellbeing facilitator would encourage guideline-concordant medication use, in liaison with the GP.

The core procedures (assessment, allocation, intervention and follow-up) were identical in both trials, but the populations varied. We recruited older adults and ethnic minority participants (South Asians and Somalis) in two Primary Care Trusts in the Northwest of England. Core inclusion criteria for both elders and ethnic minority participants included being registered with one of 16 primary care practices in the two Primary Care Trusts and scoring 10 or more on the PHQ-9 and/or the GAD-7 (threshold for moderate depression and anxiety respectively). Specific inclusion criteria for ethnic minority participants were to be aged 18 or over and to self-identify as being of Somali or South Asian heritage. Elders specific inclusion criteria was for participants to be aged 50 and over. Core Exclusion Criteria for both groups were that participants were not currently deemed to be at significant risk to themselves, or others and did not have significant learning disabilities or cognitive impairment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Recruitment</title><p>Was through multiple methods, including referrals from GPs, other health professionals, the voluntary sector, or self-referral. Information was made available in relevant languages (Arabic, Bengali, English, Somali, Sylheti and Urdu) and in suitable locations in the community (e.g. surgeries, pharmacies, community centres, libraries, grocery stores and religious centres including churches and mosques). The study was also actively publicised through regular newsletters and open community meetings.

A topic guide derived from existing literature and research aims was agreed through discussion within the research team (all researchers with qualitative methodology expertise) which explored key areas including experience of, barriers to and enablers of the wellbeing intervention. This guide provided prompts for use within the interviews, but also allowed for a dialogue to occur within the interview, so allowing the participant's voice to be heard. The researchers conducting the South Asian community interviews spoke both Urdu and Punjabi. Interviews in Bangla and Sylheti were jointly conducted with a Bangladeshi community mental health worker who assisted with the translation. The researchers had participated in training in qualitative methods and were supported and debriefed by experienced qualitative methodologists.</p><p>Interviews were audio recorded and lasted between 45 and 60&#x000a0;minutes.

The intervention was generally acceptable to patients, and there was evidence of adherence among those who attended. The majority of patients preferred one-to-one sessions, though the options for group work and signposting were valued.</p><p>Evidence from our preliminary analyses of outcomes indicated that patients offered the wellbeing intervention showed greater improvement than those offered usual care. In both groups, our measure of depression outcomes (PHQ9) demonstrated change of clinically significant magnitude. The magnitude of difference was comparable to other psychosocial interventions in primary care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and will be helpful in estimating sample size for a future definitive trial. It is noteworthy that neither group demonstrated large benefits in anxiety symptoms, despite the intervention being designed to improve both anxiety and depression. There was preliminary evidence that the intervention impacted on wider function and quality of life in both groups, although the results must be viewed with caution due to the limited sample size. Although similarities and differences in outcomes between the two groups also exist, interpretation of these patterns should also be cautious, as the measures have generally been not been developed for, or extensively validated with ethnic minority populations. There is a danger that such scales fail to assess the constructs used in different groups around mental health and distress.</p><p>The trial tested a &#x02018;complex intervention&#x02019; which was designed to reflect the multiple challenges faced by these groups (including chronicity of problems, social isolation, stigma, and different explanatory models), and to try and balance the expressed needs of the client group, and the skills and knowledge of the research team. There is an argument that achieving all this in the context of a time limited primary care intervention is over ambitious, and that greater focus would be preferable. An additional issue with the evaluation of multicomponent &#x02018;complex interventions&#x02019; is that the core mechanisms of effect are difficult to identify. The qualitative work reported here is an attempt to highlight patient experience as a guide to what aspects are most and least effective, but accurate identification remains a significant methodological challenge.</p><p>Despite considerable effort on the part of the research team, our recruitment rates were lower than anticipated. Recruitment to primary care trials in the United Kingdom is routinely problematic and particularly difficult in trials of mental health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Therefore, determining recruitment rates and the most effective recruitment strategies are critical steps in the development of a definitive trial. However, available evidence to support recruitment strategies is sparse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>].</p><p>In other mental health trials we have found that successful recruitment has been achieved by mass screening lists of registered primary care patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], which results in large numbers of recruits, although the overall response rate tends to be low. While it might be possible to adopt this strategy for older people, who do tend to register in primary care, our knowledge of the barriers to recruitment identified in earlier stages of the AMP project made such an approach problematic. Mass screening would also be less likely to reach under-served members of ethnic minority communities, who may not have registered as patients with primary care teams or if they have, may not be readily identifiable from practice lists. Therefore, the current recruitment rates should be seen in a context where one of the most effective strategies was not available.</p><p>Some groups were particularly affected by low recruitment. Although South Asian males were referred none were randomised, although it is not clear whether this reflects attitudes to the intervention, or to the research. The trial in the Somali locality recruited only one eligible patient. Low recruitment in this group may have reflected the overall study design (outside the trial reported here), since the community engagement interventions were not active here [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. That community engagement would be more important in ethnic minority recruitment, and less so in older peoples recruitment, is anticipated by the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], We address these issues in more detail elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The additional complexities of pre and post migration stressors experienced by the Somali community as a less established community, seeking asylum in the UK arguably add to the difficulties of recruitment and of designing acceptable and accessible interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. This correspondingly limits any potential transferability of our current findings to wider ethnic minority groups.</p><p>There is an argument that the recruitment problems in part reflected the decision to develop an intervention for two different groups. Despite the potential advantages in terms of cost and wider implementation, this may have lessened the acceptability of the intervention in each constituent group.</p><p>Cultural issues were important. On the one hand, it is important to ensure that wellbeing facilitators are seen as culturally appropriate by the local communities: this applies as much to older indigenous populations as to particular ethnic minority groups. On the other hand, our experiences may support an argument for reducing the cultural specificity of wellbeing interventions. There is a trade-off between specificity and potential sample size (most evident for the Somali community). Reducing specificity would also limit the risk of a particular community seeing itself as stigmatised, rather than prioritised, by the offer of an intervention. However it is also clear that for the South Asian participants cultural specificity was valued and seen as important. Different strategies may therefore be needed to engage particular communities.</p><p>It should be noted that attrition rates at the first follow up were not unusually high, despite the difficulties engaging these groups and others living in deprived localities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Minimising attrition is essential to ensuring that baseline comparability provided through randomisation is maintained, and that sample size achieved at recruitment is not significantly reduced in the main analysis. The study suggests that although there is still work to be done in encouraging these groups into trials, their experience once recruited does not lead to particular problems of retention.</p></sec><sec id="Sec42" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The intervention does show preliminary evidence of effectiveness in people who do engage, although clearly major problems remain in terms of encouraging higher rates of recruitment to ensure those benefits have sufficient reach into population in need. The alternative of developing specialist teams to deliver targeted interventions may provide greater benefits in areas with sufficient need [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. However, developing our understandings of how existing local services can better tailor mental health treatment is a necessary first step in developing services that are responsive to the needs of our increasingly diverse communities.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-list><def-item><term>CBT</term><def><p>Cognitive-behavioural therapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TAU</term><def><p>Treatment as usual</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CORE-OM</term><def><p>Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PHQ-9</term><def><p>Patient Health Questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NHS</term><def><p>National Health Service</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GAD-7</term><def><p>Generalised Anxiety Disorder Assessment &#x02013; 7-item scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EQ-5D</term><def><p>European Quality of Life &#x02013; 5 Dimensions</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GP</term><def><p>General practitioner</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WSAS</term><def><p>Work and Social Adjustment Scale</p></def></def-item></def-list></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare no competing interests.
