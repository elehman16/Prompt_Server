It is estimated to be the third cause of death and fifth rank in burden by 2020.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Large numbers of patients are frequently hospitalized due to COPD and its complications. COPD patients die from coronary artery disease (CAD), lung cancer, and stroke. Overall, these factors account for 80% of deaths from COPD.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>A consequence of COPD, pulmonary hypertension (PH), commonly presents as shortness of breath and fatigue.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] It is a serious complication among COPD patients that can lead to poor prognosis.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] PH is caused by an increase in pulmonary vascular resistance and is determined by continuous increase in pulmonary arterial blood pressure, especially mean pulmonary arterial pressure &#x0003e;25 mmHg at rest or 30 mmHg during activity.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Several factors are involved in occurrence of PH in patients with COPD including chronic alveolar hypoxia and inflammatory responses.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Studies show that in COPD patients, in particular those with PH, survival is reduced in comparison with those without PH.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] It is unclear to what extent early diagnosis and treatment of PH can contribute to the survival of patients with COPD. Evidently, statins can reduce symptoms and improve quality of life in these patients.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] There are many treatment options for PH in COPD, but each has its own limitations.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Since inflammation is considered as an underlying cause of COPD associated with PH, anti-inflammatory properties of statins may theoretically play a beneficial role in these patients.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Several observational studies and randomized clinical trials have studied the effect of statins on reducing PH.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Statins have some antiproliferative, antithrombotic, and anti-inflammatory properties that make them an effective option for the treatment of PH.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] In this study, we preferred to use atorvastatin as a treatment option, because it is well-known and more accessible drug in our country in comparison with other drugs in this class. Due to the effectiveness of 6-month treatment with statins on ability of patients reported by Lee <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and also chronic inflammation of the airways in COPD patients, effectiveness of statins in the short term will be less reliable. Hence, to observe the more effective impacts, treatment period considers to be 6 months. Given the conflicting results in different observational studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs), we aimed to study the effects of statins on pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) in patients with COPD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>This double-blind, randomized trial was conducted on 42 known cases of COPD with systolic pulmonary arterial pressure of &#x0003e; 25 mmHg, who attended Vali-Asr Hospital, Birjand, East of Iran in 2014. Afterward, each patient was assigned into either of two groups using block randomization method. Twenty-one patients were treated with atorvastatin (40 mg/day) and 21 patients without receiving atorvastatin. The control and atorvastatin groups who completed the study included 18 and 16 patients, respectively. Patients were excluded from the study because of death, refuse to continue treatment, or migration. Patients and the outcome assessor were blind until the study was completed. None of the patients were under specific treatment for PH (e.g., prostanoids, statins, endothelin antagonists, and phosphodiesterase) or under domestic O<sub>2</sub> therapy. The methods of this study were reviewed and approved by Birjand University of Medical Sciences Ethics Committee and followed Consort 2010 checklist.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>All the patients participated voluntarily after they had been fully informed of the therapies and after they had provided written informed consent. The trial was registered at the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials with the registration number of IRCT2016042527594N1 where the full-trial protocol is accessible. Inclusion criteria included no previous use of statins, absence of liver disease, and presence of diagnostic criteria for COPD based on the American Thoracic Society (forced expiratory volume 1 s [FEV<sub>1</sub>] &#x0003c;80% and FEV<sub>1</sub>/forced vital capacity &#x0003c;70%).[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] The patients would be excluded for the following reasons: discontinuation of statin therapy during the study, having advanced heart disease, the advent of statin therapy complications, and long-term use of systemic corticosteroids. The collected data involved age, sex (male/female), total cholesterol (TC) (mg/dL), triglycerides (TGs) (mg/dL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (mg/dL), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (mg/dL).</p><p>Echocardiograms were performed in Vali-Asr Hospital by VIVID 10 echocardiography equipment (MEDISON, Korea). Pulmonary pressure was also anticipated by Doppler echocardiography with peak pressure gradient of tricuspid regurgitation. Both groups were tested with echocardiography to measure systolic pulmonary pressure before atorvastatin was taken, and their systolic PAP was recorded at baseline. The case group received 40 mg of statins/day for 6 months (24 weeks) to observe long-term effects[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] whereas the control group received routine treatment for COPD, the usual therapy for airway disease. At the end of the study, the patients were evaluated by echocardiography again. Lipid profile was measured again at the end of 6<sup>th</sup> month from the study onset.</p><p>Statistical analysis was done using SPSS software (Version 16; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).

Statins are drugs that have recently become more prevalent. In addition, there has been a special attention in pleiotropic effects of statins in recent years.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] One of the applications recently considered for statins related to patients with primary or secondary PH. The beneficial effects of statins on pulmonary arterial pressure in animals have been shown recently.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>However, the results of the first randomized clinical trial about the impact of statins on PH were not very promising.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Carlin <italic>et al</italic>.'s study on animal models concerning the influence of pharmaceutical forms of statins on PAP showed that some form of statins such as fluvastatin can be effective in reducing PAP. Thus, they suggested that some forms of statins may be more effective in reducing PAP than others.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] A study on the effects of atorvastatin at a dose of 10 mg daily for 6 months on 220 patients with PH or chronic thromboembolic PH in China showed that statins had no significant effect on PAP.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Another study on the impact of statins on the PAP showed that prescribing simvastatin ranged between 20 and 80 mg/daily can reduce right ventricular systolic pressure and lead to improvement in 6-min walking test.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] The authors emphasized on the safety of simvastatin in patients with PH and stated that the rate of disease progression appeared to be attenuated. A study conducted by Zeng <italic>et al</italic>. also demonstrated that simvastatin treatment beginning at 20 mg/daily for 2 months, then increasing to 40 mg/daily for another 4 months, decreased PAP in patients with PH.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p><p>On the other hand, in a clinical trial in those treated with simvastatin 80 mg daily for 6 months, the short-term effect of simvastatin showed a reduction in right ventricular pressure. However, this effect did not sustain after 6 months.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>PH is a common complication of COPD characterized by reduced life expectancy, poor prognosis, and high health-care costs.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] In recent years, a new theory holds that the main contributor to PH is endothelial dysfunction and inflammatory mechanisms.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Statins can be useful given their anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antithrombogenic properties and the improvement they incur in endothelial cell function in patients with PH, which is caused by COPD.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] A few studies have been performed on the effects of statins in reducing PAP in patients with COPD. In an RCT study by Lee <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] on the effects of statins on PAP in patients with COPD, it was found that 40 mg/day pravastatin for 6 months can be significantly effective in reducing PAP and improving physical abilities. Nonetheless, Moosavi <italic>et al</italic>. showed that atorvastatin's effect was not statistically significant in reducing pulmonary arterial systolic pressure in patients with COPD and recommended further study concerning the relation between PAP and atorvastatin.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] The effects of statins in reducing PAP in different studies appear to depend largely on the dose used. It is believed that when the atorvastatin dose increases from 40 to 80 mg, its anti-inflammatory effects appear.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] We found a beneficial effect of atorvastatin at a dose of 40 mg on pulmonary arterial pressure. This may be the minimum effective dose to reduce pulmonary arterial pressure in patients with COPD.</p><p>Another beneficial effect in relation to the use of atorvastatin included decreased LDL level and increased HDL level. All these benefits without significant side effects were observed in our patients. Moreover, the beneficial effects of statins on blood lipid profile are well known. The beneficial effects of statins on blood lipid profile in patients with COPD is important since CAD in patients with COPD is more prevalent and it is the second most common cause of death in these patients after respiratory failure.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] A series of studies and a meta-analysis of articles related to the effects of statins in patients with COPD showed that statins were associated with a significant reduction in myocardial infarction risk.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] During 6-month follow-up, the major side effects that forced us to discontinue atorvastatin were not observed.</p><p>A dose of 40 mg of atorvastatin/day for 6 months may have beneficial effects in reducing PAP and improving blood lipid profile in patients with COPD. Further studies are needed to overcome the limitations of the present study and to find long-term effects of statins on PAPs in COPD patients.</p><p>The limitations of the present study were lack of large sample size, lack of direct measurement of the systolic and diastolic PA pressures, and also the lack of precise care on drug use by patients.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>A<sc>UTHORS'</sc> C<sc>ONTRIBUTION</sc></title><p>Anahita Arian, Sayyed Gholamreza Mortazavi Moghadam and Toba Kazemi contributed on idea, design, sample collection, patient management and writing the manuscript.
