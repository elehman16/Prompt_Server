Forty EGC patients with T2DM, aged 20&#x02013;80 years, who were expected to undergo curative distal gastrectomy were randomized 1:1 to RY(n = 20) or BI(n = 20). Diabetes medication status, biochemical and hormonal data including blood glucose, HbA1c, insulin, C-peptide, HOMA-IR, ghrelin, leptin, GLP-1, PYY, and GIP were evaluated for 12 months after surgery. Although pre- and postoperative 12-month fasting and postprandial glucose levels did not show a significant difference, HbA1c, C-peptide, and HOMA-IR levels were significantly improved at 12 months after surgery in both BI and RY groups. Sixty percent of RY patients and 20% of BI patients decreased their medication satisfying FBS&#x0003c;126 mg/dL and HbA1c&#x0003c;6.5% and 5% of BI patients stopped their medication satisfying the criteria of FBS&#x0003c;126 mg/dL and HbA1c&#x0003c;6.0%. The improvement patterns were more sustainable with less fluctuation in RY than in BI. On hormonal analysis, ghrelin and leptin levels were decreased and PYY and GIP levels were increased at 12 months after surgery in both groups without significant difference according to the reconstruction type and diabetic improvement status except ghrelin. In gastric cancer surgery, RY reconstruction showed better and more durable diabetes control compared to BI during the first year after surgery. Gastric cancer surgery led to decreased ghrelin and leptin and increased PYY and GIP, which might have a role in improving insulin resistance and glucose homeostasis.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors receivd no specific funding for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="3"/><table-count count="2"/><page-count count="15"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Diabetes mellitus (DM) is one of the most important health problems worldwide. Because DM is a multi-factorial chronic, progressive disease with a gradual increase in insulin resistance and beta cell failure, intensification of medical treatment is often required. [<xref rid="pone.0188904.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Although the prevalence of DM in gastric cancer patients has not been reported, it may be similar to that in the general population, and the negative effect of DM on quality of life is also applicable to gastric cancer patients. Considering the increasing proportion of EGC and improved survival, simultaneous diabetes control in addition to cure of cancer has become more important.</p><p>After gastric cancer surgery, most patients experience reduced food intake, weight loss, and intestinal malabsorption, and some of them show improvement in metabolic diseases such as hyperglycemia, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertension. Although the purpose of metabolic surgery and gastric cancer surgery is different, there is a clinical and technical connection between the two procedures. Therefore, in our previous study, we highlighted the positive effect of conventional gastrectomy on diabetes control in patients with type 2 DM (T2DM) and EGC. [<xref rid="pone.0188904.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] In Korea, the main reconstruction method after distal gastrectomy for gastric cancer surgery is gastroduodenostomy (Billroth I reconstruction [BI]). When it is difficult to perform BI because of the tumor location or resection extent, gastrojejunostomy (Billroth II reconstruction [BII]) or Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy (RY) is performed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0188904.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). We previously investigated the short-term effect of BI and BII as routine gastric cancer surgeries on T2DM, and found that BII, which involves bypass of the short segment of proximal small bowel, did not provide significant additional benefits in terms of glucose metabolism compared to BI reconstruction. [<xref rid="pone.0188904.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Considering the antidiabetic effect of RY gastric bypass used in bariatric and metabolic surgery, RY reconstruction in gastric cancer surgery may provide better glucose metabolism than BI and BII. [<xref rid="pone.0188904.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Therefore, in the present study, we attempted to investigate the impact of RY in distal gastrectomy, which can provide a longer bypass length of the proximal jejunum than BI and BII. Such an evaluation will allow the surgeons to select a favorable reconstruction type after gastrectomy in gastric cancer patients with diabetes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Study design and participants</title><p>This study was a prospective randomized study performed at Yonsei University Hospital from July 2011 to May 2014. Study participants were patients diagnosed with early gastric cancer and T2DM. It was possible to perform distal gastrectomy in all of the patients and they were taking diabetes medication before the diagnosis of gastric cancer. Patients were eligible for this study if they were between 20 and 80 years of age and were expected to undergo curative distal gastrectomy for distal gastric adenocarcinoma. Patients with the following conditions were excluded: (a) other malignancies; (b) preoperative chemotherapy; (c) other endocrine disorders such as thyroid or adrenal disease; (d) moderate to severe cardiovascular, pulmonary or renal disease; (e) active infection; and (f) Vulnerable patients (pregnant women, children, cognitively impaired persons, etc.). If patients were plan to receive postoperative chemotherapy or suffered from immediate postoperative complications requiring reoperation, they were also excluded from analysis. This study was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board of Severance Hospital, Yonsei University College of Medicine (IRB File No. 4-2011-0109), and written informed consent was obtained from all patients prior to operation.

Because our previous study showed that the duration of DM was a significant predictive factor that was associated with postoperative diabetes control, diabetic duration, &#x0003e; 5 years vs &#x02264; 5 years, was used as a stratification factor. Neither patients nor investigators were masked to treatment assignment.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Surgical procedures</title><p>In RY reconstruction, [<xref rid="pone.0188904.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] the duodenum was transected 1&#x02013;2 cm distal to the pyloric ring using a linear stapler and gastric resection was done using two linear staplers. For reconstruction, the jejunum was divided at 25 cm distal to the ligament of Treitz and a hole was made on the joining end of the stapling line and the greater curvature of the stomach using ultrasonic shears. The transected distal jejunum was brought up using the antecolic method, and a hole was made 7 cm distal to the jejunal transection line. A gastrojejunostomy was made using a linear stapler, and the common entry hole was also closed with a linear stapler. To perform the jejunojejunostomy, a hole was made on the anti-mesenteric border of the jejunum 30 cm distal to the gastrojejunostomy and another hole was made on the anti-mesenteric end of the stapling line of the proximal jejunum previously transected. Each arm of the endoscopic linear stapler was inserted into the proximal and distal jejunum, and a side-to-side anastomosis was performed.</p><p>In Billroth I reconstruction, [<xref rid="pone.0188904.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] duodenal resection was performed immediately below the pyloric ring intracorporeally using an endoscopic linear stapler. After gastric resection with two linear staplers, a 45 mm endoscopic linear stapler was inserted through the left lower port and each jaw of the stapler was gently inserted in each gastric and duodenal hole. Following approximation of the posterior walls of the gastric remnant and the duodenum, the jaws of the stapler were closed and fired to create an anastomosis. The common entry hole was closed with two linear staplers. Other surgical processes except for reconstruction were similar to those described here for the RY group. Generally, D1+&#x003b2; or D2 lymph node dissection was performed according to the guidelines of the Japanese Gastric Cancer Association, [<xref rid="pone.0188904.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and all surgery was performed by laparoscopic approach, and truncal vagotomy was conducted in all cases.</p><p>During the admission period, all of the patients received nutrition education for adapting gastrectomy status, and they were educated to restrict high-carbohydrate, high-fat diet, and drinks with sugar. In the out-patient clinic, patients&#x02019; gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dyspepsia including symptoms related dumping syndrome were asked and checked.</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Study outcome evaluation</title><p>To evaluate the effect of Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy (RY group) compared to Billroth-I reconstruction (BI group) after distal gastrectomy in improving T2DM, clinical and biochemical data were collected during the preoperative period and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after gastrectomy. The clinical characteristics of the enrolled patients, including age, sex, body mass index (BMI), comorbidities, diabetes duration, diabetes medication, and perioperative outcomes, such as the extent of lymph node dissection, blood loss during surgery, length of hospital stay, and postoperative complications were recorded.

Patients visited the hospital preoperatively, and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after surgery for physical examination, laboratory tests, imaging, and/or endoscopy. The variables for evaluating the status of glucose control included body weight, body mass index, biochemical data including fasting glucose (FBS) and postprandial 2 hour glucose (PP2), insulin, and C-peptide, HbA1c, homeostasis model assessment-estimated insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and changes in the diabetes medication status.

In this randomized controlled trial of BI vs. RY in distal gastric adenocarcinoma, RY reconstruction showed a significantly higher incidence of diabetes improvement and a more durable reduction in insulin resistance compared to BI. During the 12-month follow-up, gut hormones including ghrelin, leptin, GIP, and PYY showed significant changes but relatively similar changing patterns in both groups except ghrelin; the levels of ghrelin was decreased in both group but the amount of change was larget in RY group than BI reconstruction. Gastric cancer surgeons have paid attention to the anti-diabetic effect of gastric cancer surgery, because there is similarity between bariatric surgery and gastric cancer surgery and improvement of T2DM after bariatric surgery have been reported even for patients with less obese (BMI &#x02264; 30 kg/m2) regardless of the amount of weight loss.[<xref rid="pone.0188904.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0188904.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Several studies showed that gastric cancer patients with T2DM experienced DM improvement after gastric cancer surgery in connection with weight loss, gastric resection and reconstruction. [<xref rid="pone.0188904.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0188904.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0188904.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] While some retrospective studies reported that the reconstruction methods including duodenal bypass such as BII and RY were more effective in producing DM improvement than BI, [<xref rid="pone.0188904.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0188904.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0188904.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] our retrospective study of prospectively collected data showed that the pattern of biochemical data was similar in BI and BII reconstruction. [<xref rid="pone.0188904.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Because we presumed that incomplete bypass of the short segment of proximal small bowel (BII) did not provide significant additional benefits in terms of glucose metabolism, it can be hypothesized that RY reconstruction bypassing the duodenum and the proximal jejunum would have a better effect on diabetes control than BI reconstruction. [<xref rid="pone.0188904.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188904.g002">Fig 2</xref>, fasting and postprandial serum glucose levels and HbA1c were decreased at 3 to 6 months after surgery, but then they increased until 12 months. Although the postoperative 12-month HbA1c level was significantly lower than the preoperative level, the preoperative and postoperative 12-month fasting and postprandial glucose levels showed no significant difference between both groups. These findings may be related to the increased calorie intake, weight regain and general condition recovery that occur by 3 months after gastrectomy. However, fasting serum insulin, C-peptide, and HOMA-IR levels dropped at 12 months after surgery in both groups. Interestingly, the levels constantly decreased in the RY group without any fluctuation, but they showed fluctuation at 6 months in the BI group, which suggests that RY is more effective for achieving a reduction in insulin resistance than BI.</p><p>We checked the levels of several gut hormones to evaluate the hormonal changes after surgery according to the reconstruction method and the degree of DM improvement. In our study, ghrelin showed interesting changes. Ghrelin is mainly produced in the stomach and the proximal small intestine, which contributes to the positive energy balance and weight gain by enhancing the appetite and adiposity. [<xref rid="pone.0188904.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Ghrelin suppression was reported to reduce fasting glucose and insulin levels, and to improve glucose tolerance. [<xref rid="pone.0188904.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0188904.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] In our study, ghrelin level was decreased significantly at 6 days after gastrectomy in both BI and RY groups, but the decreased level was continuously maintained in the RY group, while it fluctuated and increased in the BI group and this difference was statistically significant. This pattern was similar to the changing patterns of insulin, C-peptide, and HOMA-IR, which suggests that RY has a more durable influence on ghrelin secretion and improvement of insulin resistance than BI. When we divided patients into two groups according to diabetic improvement status, preoperative ghrelin level was significantly lower and it decreased continuously with little fluctuation after surgery in the improved/remission group compared to the stationary group. Preoperative low ghrelin level and its maintenance after RY bypass appear to have an important role for diabetic control.</p><p>The postoperative 12- month leptin level was significantly lower than the preoperative level in both BI and RY groups. Considering that the leptin level corresponds closely with total body fat content, weight loss that develops after gastrectomy is connected with the decreased leptin level. GLP-1 is secreted in the terminal ileum and the postprandial GLP-1 level is increased after bariatric surgery. [<xref rid="pone.0188904.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] In our study, we did not check the postprandial GLP-1 level but only the fasting GLP-1 level, which did not show a significant difference between the preoperative and postoperative values in both RY and BI groups. PYY is also secreted from the distal gastrointestinal tract, which increases in response to food intake and reach a peak at 1&#x02013;2 hours after food intake, contributing to postprandial satiety and body weight loss. [<xref rid="pone.0188904.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] It has been reported that PYY levels were markedly increased after bariatric surgery. [<xref rid="pone.0188904.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0188904.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] In our study, PYY levels were increased significantly after surgery in both BI and RY groups, and it was significantly higher in the RY than in the BI at postoperative 9 months (P = 0.012) even though there was no difference at other follow-up points. The postoperative changing pattern of PYY was similar in DM improvement/remission group and stationary group. GIP is mainly secreted in the duodenum and upper jejunum, and its secretion is induced by food intake. As an incretin hormone, GIP stimulates insulin secretion in &#x003b2;-cells, inhibits gastric acid secretion, suppress lipolysis in adipose tissue, induces appetite and reduces energy expenditure in the brain. [<xref rid="pone.0188904.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] In our study, GIP levels were rapidly increased at 6 days after surgery, but there was no difference between the preoperative level and the postoperative 12-month level and between the BI and RY groups. Considering that the postoperative GIP levels were higher than the preoperative levels, GIP secretion seems to be stimulated by gastric cancer surgery. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0188904.s004">S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0188904.s005">S4</xref> Tables, the preoperative lower GIP level was related to a better outcome of DM and the lower baseline GIP levels may indicate that the islet cell function is less impaired.</p><p>This study has several limitations. The small sample size of this study lead underpowered results with large variance in some variables and made it difficult to interpret the changes of hormones such as ghrelin, leptin, GLP-1, GIP, and PYY which were similar in the RY and BI groups. Also, statistical adjustment for multiplicity was not conducted. Thus it was difficult to clarify the difference in hormone secretion according to the diabetic improvement status and the mechanism of diabetic control, consequently the results need to be interpreted with caution of potential misleading. In addition, there were limitations to suitable interpretation due to the lack of postprandial hormonal levels, and short follow-up duration. Diet habit of each patient could affect to the result but it was neglected in this study, even all of the patients received nutrition education and randomization would minimize its&#x02019; influence. The duration of DM which was the only stratification factor was decided the time when the patient was diagnosed the DM that could be a lead time bias. To evaluate the exact mechanism of improvement of DM according to reconstruction methods in gastric cancer patients with T2DM with overcoming those limitations, we are going to conduct next clinical trial that includes a larger number of patients and performs the postprandial hormonal assay with longer follow-up periods.</p><p>In our study, the RY group showed a higher incidence of diabetes improvement (60%), which was a more durable improvement in insulin resistance, than the BI group (25%). Moreover, biochemical markers reflecting insulin resistance such as HbA1c, insulin, C-peptide, and HOMA-IR showed more durable improvement in RY compared to BI. These results suggest that RY reconstruction can be a favorable option for gastric cancer patients with DM and the modification of bypass length of the proximal small bowel would provide a better outcome for diabetes control. In other studies, RY reconstruction or longer modification of the RY limb in gastric cancer surgery showed a better outcome in diabetes improvement than the other reconstruction methods. [<xref rid="pone.0188904.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0188904.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Even though female was also related to higher incidence of diabetic improvement, RY reconstruction showed better effect on diabetic control than female sex after factor adjustment in multivariate logistic regression. Because of small number of patients, it was difficult to find out the independent predictive factors for diabetic control.</p><p>In conclusion, gastric cancer surgery led to a significant improvement in T2DM during the first year after surgery and RY reconstruction had a better impact on diabetes control than BI. After gastric cancer surgery, ghrelin and leptin levels were decreased and PYY and GIP levels were increased, which may have a role in improving insulin resistance. However, the impact of each reconstruction type on gut hormone secretion remains to be determined.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec022"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0188904.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Diagrams of each reconstruction type.</title><p>A) Billroth I, B) Billroth II, C) Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy.
