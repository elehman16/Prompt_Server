Eligible patients were CMV seropositive, HLA A*0201-positive, 18&#x02013;75 years, receiving HCT from matched related or unrelated donors. Patients were reassessed on day 28 post-HCT for eligibility, and 36 patients were randomised either to the vaccine (VA) or observation arm (OA), in blocks stratified by CMV donor serostatus. CMVPepVax was administered subcutaneously on days 28 and 56. CMVPepVax is a chimeric peptide composed of a cytotoxic CD8 T-cell epitope from CMV-pp65, and a tetanus T-helper epitope. It is formulated with the adjuvant PF03512676 (Pfizer Inc) a Toll-like receptor 9 agonist, which augments cellular immunity. The primary outcome was safety; secondary outcomes included immunogenicity, prevention of CMV reactivation, and clinical outcomes. Statistical analyses included all 36 randomized patients and were performed as per protocol.

As a result, HCT recipients are highly susceptible to opportunistic infections. Despite preemptive antiviral therapy, cytomegalovirus (CMV) remains the leading infectious complication in HCT recipients.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> CMV reactivation primarily occurs within the first 100 days post-HCT, in more than one third of CMV-seropositive patients, the group at highest risk for CMV reactivation.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Due to early CMV reactivation post-HCT and enhanced risk of severe end-organ disease, CMV positive serology, either of the donor or the recipient remains associated with higher non-relapse mortality and poorer overall survival.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Current antiviral therapy effectively limits viremia, however its use is associated with systemic and organ toxicity, which besides adding to the cost of HCT, creates delays in immune reconstitution, increases fungal/bacterial infections, breakthrough gastrointestinal CMV disease, and risk of late-onset CMV disease.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup></p><p id="P7">Immunotherapy based on infusion of limited numbers of CMV specific T cells was found to promote restoration of durable, functional antiviral immunity, which effectively bridges the early post-HCT period of high susceptibility to uncontrolled CMV viremia.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> In particular, adoptive therapy of HLA restricted CMV pp65 T cells resulted in successful treatment of CMV infection not responding to antivirals.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> The pp65 tegument protein is among the most frequently recognized CMV antigen in CMV seropositive healthy adults.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> A recent investigation has also shown the feasibility of generating pp65-specific T cells from CMV na&#x000ef;ve donors for effective immunoprophylaxis.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Despite the success of pp65 cell infusion approaches, there are hurdles for employing adoptive T-cell therapy for general use.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Exploiting natural immune response mechanisms by therapeutic vaccination during the periods of greatest risk post-HCT is a feasible approach to control CMV infection.

According to COH standard of care (SOC), HCT is permitted in patients with &#x02265; 60% Karnofsky performance status, and &#x0003e;3 months estimated survival. All participants signed an IRB approved, written informed consent, and were eligible if they were CMV seropositive, HLA A*0201, 18&#x02013;75 years old, willing to be monitored at least for 6 months, and having either a related or unrelated donor with 8/8 or 7/8 (A,B,C,DRB1) high resolution HLA donor allele matching. During the study period of 10/2012 to 11/2014, a little over 2/3<sup>rd</sup> of HCT patients were CMV seropositive. At our institution 34% of these were HLA A*0201 positive, and candidates for the current CMVPepVax. We identified 130 patients from this target population (555 HCT patients &#x000d7; 0.69 CMV seropositive &#x000d7; 0.34 HLA A*0201= 130 patients) for further screening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Further eligibility restrictions were applied for the sake of safety and to facilitate follow-up in this first trial of CMVPepVax in HCT recipients. Of 130 patients, 68 were deemed ineligible due to the following: age (n=2), diagnosis (aplastic anemia, myeloma (n=4), current/recent CMV infection (n=2), cord blood (n=1), history of autoimmune disease (n=5), hepatitis B, C, or HIV infection (n=2), HLA mismatch (prior to the protocol amendment to allow 7/8 match after 7 months of accrual; n=8), not in complete remission (CR)/beyond second CR (n=26), medical/psychosocial comorbidities that the treating physician did not agree with the trial (n=18). Sixteen patients were considered eligible but self-declined or the study was not offered to them due to staff limitations, which prevented the single research nurse responsible for all HCT protocols from approaching all potential patients. Use of myeloablative, reduced intensity, and non-myeloablative conditioning regimens were permitted pre-transplant. Conditioning regimen selection followed COH standard treatment/practice guidelines. Fully ablative regimens included fractionated total body irradiation (TBI: 1200cGy) plus etoposide (60 mg/kg) or cyclophosphamide (100 mg/kg). Reduced intensity regimens were nearly ablative as they included melphalan (100&#x02013;140 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) in combination with fludarabine (125 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) or clorafabine (30&#x02013;40 mg/m<sup>2</sup>), resulting in &#x0003e;90% donor T cell engraftment by day 30 in most of our patients.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Rituximab was allowed in cases of B cell lymphoma.

Thus, patients in both arms were under full IST coverage during the first 100 days post-HCT. There was no difference in the incidence of acute or chronic GVHD between arms, furthermore IST was also similar between them. In detail, median prednisone daily dose over the first 56 days (data collected as specified per protocol) was 382&#x000b7;5 mg (interquantile range [IQR]=0&#x02013;776&#x000b7;2) for the OA, and 535 mg for the VA (IQR=192&#x000b7;5&#x02013;820); median tacrolimus daily dose was 62&#x000b7;5 mg (IQR=57&#x000b7;25&#x02013;76&#x000b7;5) for the OA, and 93&#x000b7;5 mg for the VA (IQR=64&#x02013;115&#x000b7;2); median sirolimus daily dose was 95 mg (IQR=60&#x02013;148&#x000b7;2) for the OA, and 164 mg for the VA (IQR=116&#x02013;228&#x000b7;8). Additionally, at day 100 and 180 median prednisone daily dose was 0 (IQR=0&#x02013;10) and 3&#x000b7;75 mg (IQR=0&#x02013;10), respectively for the OA; and 2&#x000b7;5 (IQR=0&#x02013;10) and 0 mg (IQR=0&#x02013;8&#x000b7;75), respectively for the VA.

No patients received T-cell depleting agents (e.g. antithymocyte globulin) or an ex-vivo T-cell-depleted graft. The donor T cell median around day 30 post-HCT was 97&#x000b7;9% (range 86&#x000b7;4&#x02013;100%) in the OA group, and 97&#x000b7;8% (range 73&#x000b7;8&#x02013;100%) in the VA group. Thus impact of residual host T cells was negligible. Supportive care, including prophylactic antibiotics, antifungal therapy, total parenteral nutrition, hematopoietic growth factors, immune globulin replacement, and treatment of mucositis and neutropenic fever was administered in accordance with institutional standard practice guidelines. All patients received herpes simplex virus/varicella zoster virus prophylaxis using standard-dose acyclovir. Preemptive management of CMV infection was allowed, but any planned use of prophylactic anti-CMV antivirals or CMV immunoglobulin was prohibited. Additional exclusion criteria included receiving T-cell depleted HCT, aplastic anemia, acute leukemia not in remission, receipt of a live-attenuated vaccine within 30 days post-HCT, previous therapy for CMV viremia, congenital or acquired immune deficiencies, autoimmune disease, HIV, hepatitis C and active hepatitis B positivity (surface antigen negative).

Proportional hazard (Cox) models were fit to estimate hazard ratios, with significance levels based on log-rank tests, and checked for qualitative agreement with likelihood ratio tests. Similar methods were used to compare relative hazard of other events across arms. The main evaluation of immunogenicity omitted patients with CMV reactivation (6 on OA, 1 on VA), in an attempt to distinguish the effect of vaccination from that of exposure to replicating CMV.

Six enrolled patients (6/18; 13%) did not meet eligibility criteria for randomisation into the study at day 28; one patient received steroids &#x0003e;1 mg/kg/day; two patients had grade III aGVHD; three patients had ongoing grade &#x02265;3 AE. Additionally, three patients withdrew, and one patient died early post-HCT before day 28 randomisation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>).

Randomisation was stratified by donor serostatus (recipients were all CMV seropositive), which led to a close balance between the two study arms (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). All patients received peripheral blood stem cell grafts. Twenty-three recipients (64%; 23/36) had reduced-intensity conditioning, which was comparably distributed between OA and VA, and the remainder had a fully ablative regimen. Patient demographic, clinical characteristics and primary hematologic diagnosis were similarly distributed across arms. As for type of transplant, VA had more matched unrelated (MUD) HCT recipients (11 of 18) than did OA (6 of 18).

None of the VA patients required dose reduction; none discontinued the vaccination regimen for drug related toxicity. No vaccine treatment-related deaths were recorded. Follow-up for AEs was targeted for the period from first vaccination (day 28) to day 100 post-HCT, with onset of the recorded AEs ranging from day 23 to 103.

This was a phase 1b trial, thus the study was not designed to assess treatment efficacy, but unexpectedly we got significance values not inferior to those of phase 2 oncology trials, which are commonly designed around one-sided type I error rates of 0&#x000b7;10.<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup></p><p id="P40">The assay detection limit for CMV viremia at our institution was 500 gc/ml: subclinical undetected reactivation could have happened and boosted preexisting immunity in the HCT recipients. However, the current study was randomized, thus there was an equal chance of subclinical reactivation occurring in both arms. It has been reported that early CMV reactivation, CMV viral load, and subsequent marrow suppression, lymphopenia, and CMV specific T-cell immunodeficiency induced by antivirals are predictors of late CMV disease and death post-HCT.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> A recent study has described CMV reactivation as detrimental to the integrity and heterogeneity of the reconstituting T-cell repertoire in MUD HCT recipients. Results from that investigation suggested that preventing CMV reactivation can profoundly improve immune reconstitution post-HCT.<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup></p><p id="P41">The prolonged hematologic relapse free status, observed in the VA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>) is of interest, but its interpretation requires caution and can be best validated by expanding the accrual to a larger population of HCT recipients, in a placebo controlled phase 2 trial. Although many factors influence the outcome of allogeneic HCT, disease type and disease status at the time of transplantation are the strongest determinants of post-HCT survival. The DRI was developed and has been successfully applied to stratify disease risk across histologies and allogeneic HCT regimens.<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> Importantly, in our HCT population the DRI was balanced between arms, even if the 36 patients were heterogeneous in terms of underlying disease (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Though a complete post-HCT longitudinal analysis was not performed (which is a limitation of our study), IST duration did not differ between the two arms, during the post-HCT period observed per protocol (see Results). Thus, it seems unlikely that differences in clinical course or IST duration among patients have influenced the clinical outcomes, though the current study cannot completely exclude this possibility.</p><p id="P42">Stimulation of TLR9-expressing cells through the PF03512676 adjuvant may increase levels of NK cells, the first lymphocytes to reconstitute post-HCT, which can limit herpes virus infection, increase graft versus leukemia effect, and limit GVHD.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> Recently, a population of highly cytotoxic NKG2C<sup>+</sup> NK cells has been linked to CMV reactivation and may have a role in protecting against relapse post-HCT.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> CMVPepVax might sustain an immunologic milieu similar to that cultivated by CMV reactivation, enhancing relapse protective innate immunity, but without CMV-associated morbidity.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> NK and NKG2C<sup>+</sup> cells were not evaluated in this study, but will be part of a phase 2 evaluation of CMVPepVax. This phase 2 multicenter, placebo controlled trial (NCT02396134@<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov">www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.), with a follow up to 365 days post-HCT is currently accruing patients. If beneficial clinical outcomes are confirmed, CMVPepVax would provide a safe and effective immune-stimulating therapeutic for the care of CMV seropositive recipients early post-HCT, when they are at enhanced risk for CMV reactivation, and subsequent antiviral therapies associated with significant adverse event profiles.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>1</label><media xlink:href="NIHMS796160-supplement-1.pdf" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d37e959" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="FN2"><p id="P43" content-type="publisher-disclaimer">This is a PDF file of an unedited manuscript that has been accepted for publication.

id="S16"><title>Evidence before this study</title><p id="P62">We have performed a systematic search on Pub Med and on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">http://clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link> for randomised clinical trials published in English up to May 1, 2015, evaluating a CMV vaccine in recipients of HCT. Additionally, we searched the abstracts of major oncology and herpes virus conferences. We identified one phase 2 and one phase 3 trial in CMV seropositive HCT recipients. Both trials used the same compound, formerly known as TransVax, and recently renamed ASP0113 (Astellas Pharma Inc, Tokyo, Japan).<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> ASP0113 is a bivalent product containing two plasmids which encode CMV gB and pp65, and is formulated with poloxamer CRL1005 and the cationic surfactant benzalkonium chloride. Mechanistically, the presence of gB protein aims at inducing the production of anti-CMV antibodies, while pp65 would be responsible to induce T-cell mediated responses. The randomised, multicenter, placebo-controlled phase 2 clinical trial was conducted in the USA. Time-to-first episode of viremia was longer in subjects receiving ASP0113, and rates of CMV viremia were lower in the ASP0113 group when measured by a central laboratory. However, ASP0113 failed to show significant reduction in CMV viremia requiring antiviral therapy, and significant increases in pp65 and gB immune responses, using protocol specific analyses. ASP0113 is undergoing an international, randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study aiming at enrolling 500 CMV seropositive subjects. The main objective of the phase 3 study is to determine if 1-year post-allograft overall mortality is positively affected in patients given ASP0113. The safety of ASP0113 in HCT recipients is also being evaluated.</p></sec><sec id="S17"><title>Added value of this study</title><p id="P63">CMVPepVax is composed of a cytotoxic pp65 CD8 T-cell peptide epitope, a tetanus T-helper cell peptide epitope, and an innate immunity stimulating adjuvant. CMVPepVax achieves control of CMV viremia, without the need for costly and potentially toxic antivirals, in HLA A*0201 CMV seropositive recipients of HCT. Our findings add value to the existing evidence that immunosuppressed HCT recipients may respond to vaccination early post-HCT, when they are at enhanced risk for CMV reactivation.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> To our knowledge CMVPepVax data provide the first proof of concept for a CMV vaccine in HCT setting to show vaccine induced increase in pp65<sub>495&#x02013;503</sub>-specific CD8 T cells, protection from CMV reactivation, and reduced usage of antivirals. Our data confirm previous findings suggesting that humoral immunity is not required for CMV viremia control post-HCT.<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Thus, addition of gB, as in the ASP0113 vaccine is likely unnecessary in the HCT setting, though prior CMV vaccines used in the setting of solid organ transplant have shown a correlation between humoral immunity (anti-gB) and suppression of CMV viremia.<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> CMVPepVax unexpected clinical outcomes of reduced relapse and increased survival in the VA compare to the OA are also to our knowledge the first proof of concept that an immune therapeutic, stimulating both innate and adaptive arms of the immune response can increase relapse free survival, by achieving clinical benefits for a wide spectrum of major post-HCT complications.</p></sec><sec id="S18"><title>Implications of all the available evidence</title><p id="P64">Developing a protective CMV vaccine, which may also decrease relapse and increase survival will favorably impact HCT clinical practice, and increase HCT curative potential. Clinical outcomes from the CMVPepVax recently opened phase 2 multicenter, placebo controlled trial, combined with those of the ongoing phase 3 ASP0113 clinical trial will provide a definitive characterization of the properties of these promising candidate vaccines for the HCT setting.</p></sec></boxed-text></floats-group></article>
