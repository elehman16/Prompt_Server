However, scientific evidence that specific microbes can be used to benefit animal health and performance is limited. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of administering a live culture of <italic>Faecalibacterium prausnitzii</italic> to newborn dairy calves on subsequent growth, health, and fecal microbiome. Initially, a safety trial was conducted using 30 newborn bull calves to assess potential adverse effects of the oral and rectal administration of <italic>F</italic>. <italic>prausnitzii</italic> to neonatal calves. No adverse reactions, such as increased body temperature or heart and respiratory rates, were observed after the administration of the treatments. All calves survived the experimental period, and there was no difference in fecal consistency score, attitude, appetite or dehydration between the treatment groups. The rectal route was not an efficient practice while the oral route ensures that the full dose is administered to the treated calves. Subsequently, a randomized field trial was completed in a commercial farm with preweaned calves. A total of 554 Holstein heifers were assigned to one of two treatment groups: treated calves (FPTRT) and non-treated calves (control). Treated calves received two oral doses of <italic>F</italic>. <italic>prausnitzii</italic>, one at treatment assignment (1<sup>st</sup> week) and another one week later. The FPTRT group presented significantly lower incidence of severe diarrhea (3.1%) compared with the control group (6.8%). Treated calves also had lower mortality rate associated with severe diarrhea (1.5%) compared to control calves (4.4%). Furthermore, FPTRT calves gained significantly more weight, 4.4 kg over the preweaning period, than controls calves. The relative abundance of <italic>F</italic>. <italic>prausnitzii</italic> in the fecal microbiota was significantly higher in the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> weeks of life of FPTRT calves than of the control calves, as revealed by sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. Our findings showed that oral administration of <italic>F</italic>. <italic>prausnitzii</italic> improves gastrointestinal health and growth of preweaned calves, supporting its use as a potential probiotic.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was funded by Merck Animal Health.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) surveyed morbidity and mortality rates in preweaned heifers from heifer-raising operations in 2006 [<xref rid="pone.0145485.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Digestive disorders (i.e. diarrhea and bloat) affected 23.9% of the population; the overall mortality rate was 7.8% and 56.5% of the deaths were caused by digestive problems, mainly diarrhea [<xref rid="pone.0145485.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The high incidence of diarrhea is a persistent problem. Four years after the 2006 survey, the USDA reported that 25.3% of preweaned calves had diarrhea; the overall mortality rate decreased to 4.2% and digestive problems were responsible for one third of the deaths. [<xref rid="pone.0145485.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The treatment of diarrhea with antibiotics, supportive care and labor is expensive, thus development of new strategies to prevent diarrhea will maximize overall productivity, animal welfare and profitability.</p><p>Historically, sub-therapeutic doses of antibiotics have been used as growth promoters and disease prophylaxis in livestock animals. The World Health Organization global report on surveillance of antimicrobial resistance cited <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus</italic> as examples of bacteria that exhibit high rates of resistance in all regions surveilled [<xref rid="pone.0145485.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Due to the emergence of antibiotic resistant microbes, the use of antibiotics as growth promoters is now banned in the European Union and is limited in the United States. Effective in the spring of 2015, the Food and Drug Administration published new directives for the use of antimicrobials in the feed of livestock in the United States, creating a new category of products called veterinary feed directive drugs (VFD drugs). Under this directive, a VFD drug intended for use in or on animal feed must be used under the professional supervision of a licensed veterinarian [<xref rid="pone.0145485.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The use of probiotics is a potential alternative to the use of antimicrobials in livestock feed.</p><p>
<italic>Faecalibacterium prausnitzii</italic> belongs to the phylum <italic>Firmicutes</italic> and is an obligate anaerobic, Gram-positive, rod-shaped, butyrate producing microorganism [<xref rid="pone.0145485.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145485.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] that is abundant in the feces of several animal species [<xref rid="pone.0145485.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0145485.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In humans, high levels of <italic>F</italic>. <italic>prausnitzii</italic> were associated with obesity [<xref rid="pone.0145485.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], while a low abundance of <italic>F</italic>. <italic>prausnitzii</italic> was linked to Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD, i.e. Crohn&#x02019;s disease [<xref rid="pone.0145485.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145485.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and ulcerative colitis [<xref rid="pone.0145485.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]). <italic>F</italic>. <italic>prausnitzii</italic> has anti-inflammatory properties, which have been demonstrated <italic>in vitro</italic> with cultured cells and <italic>in vivo</italic> with trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis in mice models [<xref rid="pone.0145485.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145485.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0145485.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. <italic>F</italic>. <italic>prausnitzii</italic> induces the production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 and reduces the secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-12 [<xref rid="pone.0145485.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Furthermore, <italic>F</italic>. <italic>prausnitzii</italic> and its supernatant decreased the severity of colitis in IBD mice models [<xref rid="pone.0145485.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145485.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Additionally, the butyrate produced by <italic>F</italic>. <italic>prausnitzii</italic> is both an energy source to enterocytes and act as an anti-inflammatory agent [<xref rid="pone.0145485.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>In preweaned Holstein calves, higher relative abundance of <italic>F</italic>. <italic>prausnitzii</italic> in the first week of life was associated with enhanced weight gain and reduced incidence of diarrhea [<xref rid="pone.0145485.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. A recent study conducted by our research group isolated 203 <italic>F</italic>. <italic>prausnitzii</italic> isolates from the feces of calves and piglets [<xref rid="pone.0145485.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].

Thirty bull calves were obtained from a commercial dairy farm that milked 2,800 Holstein cows near Ithaca, New York, USA. Immediately after birth, calves were removed from the maternity pens and were placed in dry sawdust bedded pens. Four liters of pooled, non-pasteurized colostrum from primiparous cows was administered to calves by esophageal feeder. The primary researcher, which is a veterinarian, used an authorized van with individual transportation cages to transport the newborn calves to the College of Veterinary Medicine facility, where they were housed individually in 2.2 x 1.5 meters concrete stalls bedded with pine shavings. Calves were kept in the same stall during the 14 days of the research trial. Non-pasteurized whole milk was fed twice daily at approximately 10% of the body weight and water was available <italic>ad libitum</italic>. Stalls were kept clean and environmental enrichment utensils were used to minimize animal stress. No animal suffering was anticipated as a result of the trial, therefore analgesics and anesthetics were not administered. All animals were sold alive after the trial.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Study design and data collection</title><p>A randomized clinical trial design was used. Thirty calves were randomly allocated into one of four treatment groups as follows: oral control (n = 5) calves received 80 mL of a placebo solution orally; oral treatment (n = 10) calves received 80 mL of live culture of <italic>F</italic>. <italic>prausnitzii</italic> orally; rectal control (n = 5) calves received 80 mL a placebo solution rectally; and rectal treatment (n = 10) calves received 80 mL of live culture of <italic>F</italic>. <italic>prausnitzii</italic> rectally. Control groups received a placebo containing the growth medium without the bacterial culture. Oral treatments were administered through an esophageal tube and rectal treatments were given with a 6 cm drench tube attached to a syringe. Treatments were administered on the second day of life in order to avoid interactions between colostrum&#x02019;s immune cells and the bacteria administered. Due to the <italic>F</italic>. <italic>prausnitzii</italic> sensitivity to low pH [<xref rid="pone.0145485.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], the treatments were administered 1 hour after milk feeding, when the abomasal pH increases approximately from 2 to 6 [<xref rid="pone.0145485.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Calf health was assessed twice daily by the primary researcher for the following parameters; fecal consistency (0 = well-formed; 1 = semi-formed; 2 = loose or watery feces not containing blood; and 3 = loose or watery feces containing blood), dehydration (0 = euhydrated; 1 = skin tented 2 to 6s; 2 = skin tented 6 to 10s; and 3 = skin tented &#x02265; 10s), attitude (0 = alert; 1 = depressed; and 2 = non responsive) and appetite (0 = normal; 1 = consumed &#x000bd; bottle; 2 = consumed 1/4 bottle; and 3 = forced fed). The effect of treatment on fecal consistency, dehydration, attitude and appetite scores was assessed using ordinal logistic regression models fitted in JMP Pro 11 (SAS Institute Inc., NC, USA). The independent variables offered to the model were treatment group, age in days, and interaction terms between treatment and age.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Randomized field trial</title><sec id="sec009"><title>Farm and management</title><p>The study was conducted from November 2014 to April 2015 at a commercial dairy farm. Immediately after birth, female calves were removed from the maternity pens, weighed, and placed in dry sawdust bedded pens. Four liters of pooled non-pasteurized colostrum from primiparous cows was administered to calves by esophageal tubing and calves had their umbilicus dipped in 7% iodine solution.</p><p>Newborn calves were transported twice daily from the maternity area to the calf barn. Calves were housed in a green-house barn divided into 30 identical pens with positive ventilation. Pens were separated by steel gates and calves were moved by birth order into each pen until maximum capacity was reached (20 calves/pen). Calves remained in the same pen until weaning.</p><p>Calves were fed <italic>ad libitum</italic> acidified non-saleable milk using a fully automated system with 6 nipples per pen. Acidification was performed in a sealed stainless-steel tank where cold milk (5&#x000b0;C) was mixed with organic acid under constant homogenization until a pH of 4.5 was reached. Acidified milk was directed to a smaller stainless-steel tank, warmed, and distributed to the pens. Acidified milk was offered to the calves from day one to 56 of life. All calves were weaned by reducing the daily milk availability starting on day 42 until complete absence of acidified milk at 57 days of life. Water and solid feed (calf starter mix) were offered <italic>ad libitum</italic> to all calves.</p><p>Health-related events (e.g. otitis, pneumonia and severe diarrhea) were recorded and treated as needed by farm employees. One dose of the macrolide antibiotic Zuprevo (Merck Animal Health, Summit, NJ) was given by the farm to all female calves at eight to 14 days of age as a metaphylactic for bovine respiratory disease. All calves were disbudded by heat cauterization at approximately four weeks of age.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Study design and data collection</title><p>The treatment administered was a live microorganism and cross-contamination between calves in the same group was possible. Therefore, all calves in the same pen were assigned to the same treatment group (oral treatment with <italic>F</italic>. <italic>prausnitzii</italic> (FPTRT) or control, at 5 &#x000b1; 2 days of life). The first group was randomly selected, and the subsequent groups were alternated between control and FPTRT, resulting in the same number of calves for each treatment group per week.</p><p>The rumen microbiota gradually changes from aerobic to anaerobic during the calves&#x02019; first weeks of life [<xref rid="pone.0145485.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0145485.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], therefore we chose to treat calves in the field trial with two 40 ml doses of <italic>F</italic>. <italic>prausnitzii</italic> culture, one dose at treatment assignment (1<sup>st</sup> week of life) and a second dose one week later, instead of only administering one 80 ml dose on the second day of life, to increase the chances of its colonization in the large intestine. The control calves did not receive a placebo treatment or sodium bicarbonate.</p><p>In a group feeding system it was not possible to determine the time each calf was fed and to account for the increase of the abomasal pH, as in the safety trial. Additionally, the milk fed in the commercial farm was acidified and, as mentioned previously, <italic>F</italic>. <italic>prausnitzii</italic> is highly sensitive to low pHs. Therefore, we administered 130 mL of sodium bicarbonate (90 mg/mL) orally to FPTRT calves to buffer the low pH of the abomasum before administering the culture. Sodium bicarbonate at 0.6% was used previously to increase the pH of fermented waste milk to 6.0 in a study evaluating feeding value of fermented waste milk [<xref rid="pone.0145485.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In that study, calves received one of the four milk treatments (fresh milk, fresh waste milk, fermented waste milk or fermented waste milk with sodium bicarbonate) for 42 days and weight gain was not significantly different between groups. We estimated the dose of sodium bicarbonate considering the milk present in the abomasum and did not expect effects of the two administrations of bicarbonate, other than the neutralization of the abomasal pH prior to <italic>F</italic>. <italic>prausnitzii</italic> administration.</p><p>A total of 554 Holstein heifers were enrolled in the field trial, with 296 allocated to the control group and 258 to the FPTRT group. A subset of 35 calves/treatment was selected randomly for collection of fecal DNA through rectal swabs and evaluation of fecal microbiome. From these 70 calves, 45 calves (n = 22, control; n = 23, FPTRT) were selected randomly for evaluation of serum &#x003b2;-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA) concentrations. Blood samples were collected from the jugular vein and fecal samples were collected using rectal swabs on the 1<sup>st</sup> (enrollment), 3<sup>rd</sup>, 5<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> weeks of life. Blood samples were centrifuged at 3000 x g for 10 minutes, after which serum was obtained. Serum and swabs were stored at -20&#x000b0;C until assayed. Fecal consistency scores were recorded weekly using a four level scoring system, as described in the safety trial. Calves were weighed using a Waypig 15 digital scale (Vittetoe Inc., Keota, IA, USA) at birth and again at weaning (56 &#x000b1; 3 days of life; n = 141 for the control group and n = 146 for FPTRT group). Weight gain was calculated by subtracting the birth weight from the weight at weaning. The weight gain was divided by the age in days at the second weight (56 &#x000b1; 3 days) to obtain the average daily gain (ADG). Due to equipment constraints, weights of a subset of calves (303) were obtained. Severe diarrhea and death events records were acquired from the farm&#x02019;s software (Dairy-Comp 305; Valley Ag Software, Tulare, CA, USA). Severe diarrhea was defined as dehydrated calves with loose or watery feces that were treated by the farm employees with oral electrolytes or intravenous fluids. Farm employees were blind to the treatment groups.</p><p>The treatment performed was not expected to be associated with decreased health and performance. Animals housed on commercial dairy farms may become ill for a variety of reasons and ensuing mortality is inevitable. When animals are diagnosed with a disease, treatment is attempted and, if animals are too sick to respond to treatment, euthanasia may be performed. As researchers, performing research with privately owned animals, we cannot interfere with farm protocols. Additionally, we do not have information if the animal died with or without euthanasia since our researcher was not involved in this decision and action.

The PCR conditions for the 16S rRNA gene consisted of an initial denaturing step of 94&#x000b0;C for 3 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94&#x000b0;C for 45 s, 50&#x000b0;C for 1 min, and 72&#x000b0;C for 90 s, and a final elongation step of 72&#x000b0;C for 10 min. Blank controls, in which no DNA was added to the reaction, were performed for quality assurance. Replicate amplicons were pooled and visualized by electrophoresis through 1.2% (wt/vol) agarose gels stained with 0.5 mg/mL ethidium bromide. Amplicons were purified with a PCR DNA extraction kit (IBI Scientific, Peosta, IA, USA) and the purified 16S rRNA amplicons were quantified using the Qubit dsDNA BR assay kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and a Qubit fluorometer (Life Technologies).</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Sequence library analysis and statistical analysis</title><p>Amplicon DNA aliquots were standardized to the same concentration and then pooled.

This research demonstrates <italic>F</italic>. <italic>prausnitzii</italic> as a novel approach to enhance gastrointestinal health and weight gain in dairy calves.</p><p>The anti-inflammatory properties of <italic>F</italic>. <italic>prausnitzii</italic> and the production of butyrate are factors potentially contributing to the positive results observed in treated calves. The anti-inflammatory capacity of <italic>F</italic>. <italic>prausnitzii</italic> and its supernatant has previously been demonstrated both <italic>in vitro</italic> with cultured cells and <italic>in vivo</italic> using TNBS-induced colitis mice models [<xref rid="pone.0145485.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145485.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145485.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Both bacterium and its supernatant induced the production of IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine, while decreasing the secretion of IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-12, which are pro-inflammatory cytokines [<xref rid="pone.0145485.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Sokol et al. (2008) also reported that <italic>F</italic>. <italic>prausnitzii</italic> metabolites inhibit the activation of NF-kB and the IL-8 secretion. Additionally, a protective effect of <italic>F</italic>. <italic>prausnitzii</italic> on the intestinal barrier has been suggested [<xref rid="pone.0145485.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145485.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. We hypothesize that the administration of <italic>F</italic>. <italic>prausnitzii</italic> and its colonization in the lower GIT (cecum and colon), could attenuate the symptoms caused by infectious diarrhea in young calves or possibly prevent new infections from arising. Calf diarrhea plays a key role in the preweaned period. Reducing scours incidence could positively affect animal health and welfare, decrease labor, cost of raising heifers and antibiotic use.</p><p>As already stated, butyrate has several known beneficial effects in the intestines. It is a major energy source to colonocytes, it stimulates cell proliferation, differentiation and maturation, and improves colonic barrier function [<xref rid="pone.0145485.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145485.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In ruminants, butyrate has been associated with rumen development, having a mitotic effect on ruminal papillae [<xref rid="pone.0145485.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], gut maturation [<xref rid="pone.0145485.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and increased weight gain in calves [<xref rid="pone.0145485.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Considering this, the ability of <italic>F</italic>. <italic>prausnitzii</italic> to produce butyrate could contribute to positive effects observed during colonization of <italic>F</italic>. <italic>prausnitzii</italic> in the large intestines.</p><p>Gastrointestinal epithelial cells use a large amount of the energy and nutrients provided by the diet and the microbial fermentation for absorption, transport of nutrients, and tissue maintenance [<xref rid="pone.0145485.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Dysbiosis and inflammation increase the energy expended by the enterocytes and also impair the intestinal barrier function, increasing the permeability to toxic substances (leaky gut) [<xref rid="pone.0145485.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0145485.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Therefore, the enhanced growth observed in calves with higher <italic>F</italic>. <italic>prausnitzii</italic> prevalence could be partially explained by the reduced inflammation (decreased secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and increased production of anti-inflammatory cytokines) and improved integrity of the intestinal barrier. Healthier calves could potentially have an increased appetite or have the same feed intake but extra energy available for weight gain due to less energy required for maintenance of a healthier gut.</p><p>A higher ratio of <italic>Firmicutes</italic> to <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> has been correlated with obesity in mice and humans [<xref rid="pone.0145485.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145485.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Although this ratio was not significantly different between our study groups, it was higher for FPTRT calves compared to control calves. <italic>F</italic>. <italic>prausnitzii</italic> belongs to the phylum <italic>Firmicutes</italic> and has a higher capacity for producing energy than other commensal bacteria. Balamurugan et al. (2010) compared the fecal microbiota of obese and non-obese Indian children using real-time PCR and found significantly higher levels of <italic>F</italic>. <italic>prausnitzii</italic> in the feces of the obese. Oikonomou et al. (2013) was the first to associate greater abundance of <italic>F</italic>. <italic>prausnitzii</italic> with higher weight gain and lower incidence of diarrhea in preweaned calves. Similarly, its relative abundance was increased in FPTRT calves, which gained more weight than controls. Obesity should be avoided in humans and animals, since it can lead to several health disorders (i.e. diabetes mellitus and systemic hypertension). However, increased growth rate is desirable in young production animals. As an example, preweaned dairy heifers are expected to yield more milk in their 1<sup>st</sup> lactation when they are purposely fed to exceed the nutrient requirements and have a greater ADG [<xref rid="pone.0145485.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145485.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Hence, the administration of <italic>F</italic>. <italic>prausnitzii</italic> can be considered as a natural way to improve performance in preweaned heifers.</p><p>Calves that presented a high prevalence of <italic>F</italic>. <italic>prausnitzii</italic> on their 1<sup>st</sup> week of life (HighFP) and that received the additional <italic>F</italic>. <italic>prausnitzii</italic> culture gained significantly more weight compared to HighFP control calves. The <italic>F</italic>. <italic>prausnitzii</italic> isolates used for the probiotic cocktail were selected based on their high production of butyrate, better growth performance and resistance to low pH and bile salts. Treated calves were potentially colonized by more beneficial isolates present in the probiotic cocktail, irrespective of the higher relative abundance of the <italic>F</italic>. <italic>prausnitzii</italic> in their fecal microbiota. Another hypothesis is that HighFP have a gut environment more prone to the colonization of these new isolates administered.</p><p>The incidence of severe diarrhea was lower in the FPTRT group, as demonstrated through the survival analysis. Conversely, the mean fecal consistency score was not significantly different between FPTRT calves and control calves. Fecal consistency score alone cannot be a reliable indicator of disease, and diarrhea can be nutritional or infectious. We hypothesize that FPTRT calves were having loose feces due to a large consumption of milk. We do not have milk consumption data in the current study; however, this was similarly reported by Hill et al., 2010, in a study comparing different milk replacer programs. They observed greater average fecal consistency score from calves receiving a higher dry matter amount per day [<xref rid="pone.0145485.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].</p><p>Short chain fatty acids, mainly butyrate, are converted to BHBA in the rumen epithelium and are metabolized in the liver [<xref rid="pone.0145485.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145485.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. We first speculated that calves in the FPTRT group would have higher prevalence of <italic>F</italic>. <italic>prausnitzii</italic> and hence have more butyrate, leading to greater serum BHBA concentration than control calves. However, if there was a higher production of butyrate by the <italic>F</italic>. <italic>prausnitzii</italic> in the FPTRT group, it would be in the large intestines [<xref rid="pone.0145485.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], where most of the butyrate produced by the microbiota is consumed by the enterocytes and by other bacterial species. This might be one of the reasons that we did not detect differences in the serum BHBA concentration between the two groups. The rise on the BHBA concentration with age reported here is known to be correlated with the increase in starter intake and greater production of VFA by the rumen [<xref rid="pone.0145485.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145485.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145485.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>].</p><p>A limited number of longitudinal studies have focused on weekly changes in fecal microbial diversity in calves during the preweaning period [<xref rid="pone.0145485.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145485.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. In the field trial, <italic>Firmicutes</italic> was the most prevalent phylum, followed by <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> and <italic>Proteobacteria</italic>. Our results are in agreement with Oikonomou et al. (2013) that studied weekly changes in the fecal microbiota of Holstein heifers. Klein-J&#x000f6;bstl et al. (2014) collected fecal samples from six Simmental calves across six time points ranging from birth until one week after weaning [<xref rid="pone.0145485.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Calves were housed individually and were fed saleable pasteurized whole milk. They reported the same three phyla as the most prevalent, <italic>Firmicutes</italic>, <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> and <italic>Proteobacteria</italic>, but in different ratios. <italic>Firmicutes</italic> was also the major phylum present in the in the fecal microbiota of one to four week old dairy calves fed non-pasteurized waste milk [<xref rid="pone.0145485.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. This cross-sectional study collected samples from 15 calves from each age group, which does not account for the individual variation over time. In addition, the increase in the Shannon index with age observed in the field trial is in agreement with the three studies cited above [<xref rid="pone.0145485.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145485.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145485.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] and demonstrate that the calves&#x02019; gut microbiota was increasing in diversity over time due to the consumption of solid feed.</p><p>The use of sterile cotton tipped swabs to collect fecal samples from the rectum requires less handling of animals and permits sampling of microbes encountered in the rectal mucosa and in the fecal material. A study by Malmuthuge et al. (2014) evaluated the taxonomic discrimination of commensal bacteria among the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) of preweaned calves by collecting tissue and content samples from the rumen, jejunum, ileum, cecum, and colon from 8 calves. The amplified 16S rRNA products were pooled by GIT segment and sequenced. They observed that <italic>F</italic>. <italic>prausnitzii</italic> was predominant in the mucosa-associated community from the cecum and colon of preweaned calves&#x02019; samples. Therefore, we considered the rectal swab as a better method for fecal sample collection, especially for targeting <italic>F</italic>. <italic>prausnitzii</italic>.</p><p>In conclusion, our studies demonstrated that <italic>F</italic>. <italic>prausnitzii</italic> administration to newborn calves is safe and proved the concept that this commensal bacterium is a promising probiotic for newborn calves. Further research is needed to evaluate <italic>in vivo</italic> mechanisms of action and interactions between this microbe, the gut microbiota and the host.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec019"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0145485.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Distribution of scores of fecal consistency.</title><p>Safety trial.
