The aim was to explore the clinical efficacy of oral ganciclovir (GCV) in the prevention of recurrent HSK.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Methods:</title><p>A multicenter, prospective, randomized, single-blind, and controlled clinical trial was conducted from April 2010 to June 2013. One hundred seventy-three patients (173 eyes involved) who were diagnosed as recurrent HSK definitely, including stromal keratitis and corneal endotheliitis, were divided into three groups randomly: negative control (placebo) group was topically administered with 0.15% GCV ophthalmic gel, 4 times per day and 0.1% fluorometholone eye drops, 3 times per day until resolution of HSK; positive control acyclovir (ACV) group was topically adopted the same ophthalmic gel and eye drops and additionally received oral ACV 400 mg 5 times a day for 10 weeks and followed by 400 mg 2 times per day for 6 months; test GCV group was topically adopted the same treatment as negative control group and additionally received oral GCV 1000 mg 3 times per day for 8 weeks. The symptoms and signs were evaluated before and after the therapy 1<sup>st</sup> week, 2<sup>nd</sup> week and then followed up every 2 weeks until recovery.

The inflammation induced by keratocyte-mediated immune response results in corneal neovascularization, edema, tissue damage, corneal opacity and ultimately causes blindness.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</p><p>In addition, a study has showed that half of HSK impacts the morphology and function of corneal endothelial cells; after recovery, the reduction of the density of endothelial cells in the affected eye increases faster, and the recurrence of HSK is more likely to cause irreversible damage in the corneal endothelial cells.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] ACV is an effective measure for HSK. However, evidence has showed that drug resistance of HSV-1 to ACV is an important factor for increased recurrent HSK.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] Corneal blindness caused by HSK has been the biggest cause for keratoplasty.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] The recurrence of HSK after keratoplasty substantially increases the risk of immunological rejection, which reduces the success possibility of keratoplasty. Therefore, how to effectively prevent and treat recurrent HSK is of great concern for the healthcare providers in the field of ophthalmology.</p><p>GCV selectively inhibits replication of HSV through multiple processes and makes the host immune system prevent the virus from invasion, thereby repairing damaged tissue or mitigating the condition to prevent the development of clinical symptoms. The concentration of active ingredient (GCV triphosphate) in infected cells is 100 times more than that in normal cells, so it can effectively treat HSK. GCV is activated at least 5 times faster than ACV. Moreover, GCV activity in infected cells is at least 60 times stronger than ACV, and maintains at an active concentration for a long time. Few clinical studies reported drug resistance associated with GCV. It is also sensitive to mutant strains induced by other drugs such as foscarnet sodium, ACV and bromethylene deoxyuridine.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] GCV has become one of the drugs that have the broadest spectrum and most powerful antiviral effect for DNA-containing virus.</p><p>This study aimed at assessing clinical significance of GCV in the prevention and treatment of recurrent stromal keratitis and endotheliitis. Patients included in the study had recurrent HSK presented by stromal keratitis and endotheliitis. They had substantial visual impairment and had high risk for recurrence, so oral antiviral drugs to reduce the recurrence rate of HSK was of protective significance.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]</p><p>In this study, no statistically significant difference was observed in the course between the placebo group and the ACV group, showing that oral ACV had no benefit for the treatment of HSK, which was consistent with previous studies.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] However, it was noteworthy that the course in the GCV group (oral GCV plus tropical application to the eye) was significantly shorter compared with the placebo group and the ACV group, suggesting that short-term oral GCV was of great significance in the treatment of recurrent stromal keratitis and endotheliitis, and might shorten the course of the disease.</p><p>The recurrence rate in the ACV group (26.7%) was significantly lower than that in the placebo group (47.3%), indicated that long-term low-dose oral ACV had effect in the prevention of recurrent HSK. This result was consistent with previous studies.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] The recurrence rate of the GCV group was lower than that of the placebo, but similar to that of the ACV group, indicating that GCV had clinical potential in the prevention of recurrent HSK, almost the same as ACV.</p><p>According to the survival curve analysis, the cumulative proportions surviving at time substantially decreased in three groups within 12-month follow-up, and slowly and steadily decreased in the subsequent follow-up, suggesting that the recurrence of HSK peaked at the first 12-month follow-up, which was consistent with previous study.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] The GCV group had a higher cumulative proportion than the placebo group, but no significant difference from the ACV group, which was consistent with the comparison of recurrence rate. However, the ACV group had a higher cumulative proportion than the placebo group, but with no statistical significance, which might be associated with long follow-up, poor compliance and high dropout rate in the study, due to consideration of time distribution and missing data in the survival curve analysis.</p><p>The dropout rate was similar between the GCV group and the ACV group, which was higher than the placebo group, showing that patients with oral systemic drugs should be subjected to better compliance, besides, education and communication to patients was necessary to release their concerns toward therapy. The adverse reactions occurred in individual cases in both GCV group and ACV group, indicating that attention should be attached to the safety during clinical service.</p><p>Above all, this study suggested that short-term high-dose oral GCV could shorten the course of recurrent stromal keratitis and endotheliitis. It also substantially reduced the recurrence rate of HSK, which was similar to long-term low doses of ACV.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="edited-by"><p><bold>Edited by:</bold> Xin Chen</p></fn><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil.</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>R<sc>EFERENCES</sc></title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Farooq</surname><given-names>AV</given-names></name><name><surname>Shukla</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Herpes simplex epithelial and stromal keratitis: An epidemiologic update</article-title><source>Surv Ophthalmol</source><year>2012</year><volume>57</volume><fpage>448</fpage><lpage>62</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">22542912</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="webpage"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Biser</surname><given-names>SA</given-names></name><name><surname>Perry</surname><given-names>HD</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Corneal and Anterior Segment Diseases &#x02013; Herpes Simplex Keratitis.
