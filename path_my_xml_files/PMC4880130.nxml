Whereas RYGB and other bariatric surgeries reduce appetite, patients after RYGB also have reduced food reward responses (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). A reduction in food preference or appetitive behaviors for energy-dense sweet/fatty foods is reported after RYGB but not laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (BAND), in which an inflatable band is put around the proximal stomach, or the similar vertical banded gastroplasty (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Appetitive reward for chocolate sweets but not vegetables is reduced after RYGB as measured by the effort expended to obtain food during a progressive ratio task (PRT) (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Behaviors seen in rodent RYGB models are consistent with such clinical findings (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p><p>The exact mechanisms behind these beneficial changes in food reward remain unclear because RYGB combines several manipulations, including the following: 1) reduced gastric pouch size, 2) gastric vagus nerve manipulation, 3) exclusion of food from the stomach and proximal small bowel, 4) disrupted bile flow with increased plasma bile acids, 5) altered gut microbiota, 6) aversive postprandial effects (dumping syndrome), and 7) enhanced postprandial plasma concentrations of satiety gut hormones including peptide YY (PYY), glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19), related to earlier delivery of food to the midgut and disrupted bile flow (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Postprandial plasma PYY and GLP-1 concentrations are substantially higher after RYGB than BAND surgery (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).</p><p>We hypothesized that satiety gut hormones attenuate appetitive and anticipatory food reward responses after RYGB in humans and therefore that the acute suppression of these hormones by sc administration of the somatostatin analog octreotide would increase food reward in patients after RYGB.</p><p>In functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies, changes in blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal reveal that activation in key brain reward areas including amygdala, caudate, nucleus accumbens, anterior insula, and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is lower after RYGB, when evaluating food pictures, compared with BMI-matched patients after BAND, despite both surgical groups having similarly low hunger ratings (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). This lower anticipatory fMRI reward response to food after RYGB was accompanied by lower high-energy food picture appeal ratings (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Longitudinal reductions in high-energy food hedonics and reward responses using fMRI have also been reported after compared to before RYGB surgery (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p><p>Although PYY and GLP-1 additively increase satiety to reduce caloric intake (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), direct evidence for their importance in the reduced food intake after RYGB remains unproven. Antagonism of GLP-1 increases food intake and body weight after RYGB in rodents but no more than in sham-operated animals (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), whereas genetic disruption of GLP-1 release or GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) in rodent models of bariatric surgery does not attenuate weight loss (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Antagonism of PYY has not consistently increased food intake and body weight in RYGB rodent models (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), but knockout of <italic>Pyy</italic> increased food intake and attenuated weight loss after RYGB in mice (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Nevertheless, a broader intervention through acute suppression of several plasma gut hormones including PYY and GLP-1 secretion by administration of the somatostatin analog octreotide does increase food intake in both rats (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) and humans (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) after RYGB. Chronic sc administration of octreotide for dumping syndrome after RYGB also leads to weight gain (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>).</p><p>Additional roles for these satiety gut hormones have recently been postulated for the changes in food reward after RYGB (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). PYY modulates resting activity in brain reward systems (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), and PYY and GLP-1 are additive in reducing BOLD signal in response to food pictures in the amygdala, caudate, putamen, nucleus accumbens, anterior insula, and OFC in nonobese subjects (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Furthermore, the reduction in brain responses to food pictures with a GLP-1R agonist in nonobese and obese subjects is blocked by coadministration of a GLP-1R antagonist (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). In animal studies GLP-1R agonists reduce food intake and reward-based eating behavior, for example, reducing the effort expended to obtain sucrose in rats using a PRT, through the nucleus accumbens and mesolimbic pathways (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>).</p><p>Despite these observations, no mechanistic study has yet directly established which specific anatomical or physiological perturbation after RYGB in humans reduces food reward. The objectives of this study included the following: 1) investigate the effect of satiety gut hormone suppression, using acute administration of octreotide, on food hedonic-reward responses in subjects after RYGB, using established behavioral and functional neuroimaging methodologies, and 2) compare these responses with those of subjects without enhanced postprandial gut hormone secretion, namely obese unoperated controls or patients after BAND surgery.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Progressive ratio task</title><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title><p>Eleven patients who had previously undergone RYGB surgery were recruited from the obesity clinic at St Columcille's Hospital (Dublin, Ireland) with 10 unoperated nonobese weight-stable volunteers as age- and gender-matched controls.

This appears to be a consequence of higher postprandial plasma gut hormone concentrations, particularly for GLP-1, in patients after RYGB than BAND at the saline visit.</p><p>The coadministration of exogenous insulin avoided the potential confound of significantly lower postprandial serum insulin concentrations after octreotide in both the RYGB and BAND groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B).

The magnitude of change in the breakpoint for chocolate sweets in the PRT have been correlated with the degree of weight loss after RYGB (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), and the breakpoint for different foods correlate with habitual dietary intake and energy intake in test meals (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). The BOLD signal in brain reward regions, including the nucleus accumbens, caudate, amygdala, and insula, to anticipatory food cues correlate with pleasantness ratings of ingested food after bariatric surgery (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), and predict food intake at test meals (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>) and weight loss during lifestyle modification (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). The caudate and nucleus accumbens are involved in habitual and goal- and reward-directed behavior. The anterior insula incorporates the primary taste cortex and together with the amygdala, which predominantly responds to emotions but also receives gustatory and other multimodal sensory inputs, form part of a brain network that regulates stimulus-response association and motivation to rewards such as food.</p><p>By suppressing postprandial release of gut hormones such as GLP-1 and PYY, octreotide administration has an advantage over specific antagonists in attenuating the additive effects of several satiety gut hormones to reduce reward-related eating behavior (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). A novel finding in both our studies was that octreotide reduced elevated postprandial plasma FGF19 in patients after RYGB. This could be via a direct effect on somatostatin receptors on enterocytes or perhaps mediated indirectly through changes in other gut hormone pathways. FGF19 has a central anorexigenic action in rodents (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>) in addition to roles in regulation of liver, lipid, and glucose metabolism (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Indeed, weight loss after vertical sleeve gastrectomy in rodents is dependent on intact signaling at the farsenoid-X receptor that mediates the stimulation of FGF19 secretion by enterocytes in response to bile acids (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). In our fMRI study, although increased reward system BOLD signal with octreotide correlated with the suppression of PYY in the combined bariatric surgical groups, with a similar trend for GLP-1, this was not seen for FGF19, suggesting a more prominent role for PYY/GLP-1 in mediating these changes. Nevertheless, a potential role for FGF19 in reward-related eating behavior would be worthy of further study.</p><p>Whereas octreotide-induced hypoinsulinemia could contribute to the increased breakpoint in the PRT study and enhanced food reward (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>), increases in hedonic-brain responses to food in the fMRI study were still seen despite its prevention by coadministration of exogenous insulin. However, this is a potential limitation in the interpretation of the PRT study. Furthermore, the relative hyperglycemia seen after octreotide in both studies would, if anything, be expected to attenuate rather than enhance such reward responses (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>).</p><p>Activation of brain somatostatin 2 receptors stimulates feeding in rodents, raising the possibility of a direct brain effect of octreotide (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). However, the increase in PRT breakpoint for the sweet chocolate reward with octreotide in the RYGB group was not seen in the control nonobese group, suggesting a lack of nonspecific or direct central effects of the somatostatin analog. Similarly, the increase in food appeal and reward system BOLD signal with octreotide in the RYGB group was not seen in the matched BAND group. However, no significant difference was seen between the response to octreotide in direct comparisons between the RYGB and BAND groups. This is likely related to the small number of subjects studied and stringent statistics used but also due to the fact that octreotide does still have an effect to reduce postprandial PYY and GLP-1 secretion in patients after BAND. The attenuation of these satiety gut hormones with octreotide was lower in the BAND than RYGB groups, related to higher postprandial concentrations after RYGB. Together with the correlation results in the combined surgical groups, these findings suggest that gut hormones may have a concentration-dependent attenuating effect on the reward system BOLD signal after bariatric surgery.</p><p>A limitation of our study is the small number and power, especially in the exploratory fMRI study, meaning that the findings are in need of confirmation in larger studies. This may also have resulted in false-positive as well as false-negative errors, for example, in the analysis of the interaction with food energy density and lack of significance in the BAND group in the fMRI study. However, n = 9 in the BAND group had a power of 0.74&#x02013;0.88 to detect similar differences in the BOLD signal with octreotide as seen in the RYGB group (see Supplemental Methods). Furthermore, we found a similar direction of effect of octreotide to increase food reward using three different measures (PRT breakpoint, food appeal, and BOLD signal in brain reward system during food evaluation) in two separate cohorts of patients after RYGB. We did not include an unoperated obese control group in either study, which would also have been of interest, particularly for the PRT study in which obesity may influence the breakpoint (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). However, the use of a BAND control group in the fMRI study, as an extension of our previous study (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), matched for BMI and weight loss, provided an ideal control for weight loss from a surgical intervention but without an exaggerated satiety gut hormone response. Additionally, our study investigated only the acute but not the chronic effects of satiety gut hormone suppression on food reward, and therefore, firm conclusions on their role in food intake and choice and long-term weight loss cannot be made.</p><p>In conclusion, acute suppression of the enhanced postprandial responses of satiety plasma gut hormones, such as PYY, GLP-1, and FGF19, increased both appetitive food reward in a PRT, and brain-hedonic responses to anticipatory food reward using fMRI, after RYGB. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that enhanced satiety gut hormone responses after RYGB, resulting from anatomical alteration of the upper gastrointestinal tract, contribute to the reduction in brain-hedonic responses to food after RYGB. This gives new insights into the increasingly recognized impact of gut hormones on reward-based eating behavior.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group content-type="abbreviations"><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations:
