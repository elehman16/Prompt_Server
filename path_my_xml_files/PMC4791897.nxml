Complications including myocardial infarction develop aggressively in young diabetes patients. The United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) showed that early glucose-lowering therapy for young adults with newly diagnosed Type 2 diabetes was associated with a decreased risk of microvascular complications, myocardial infarction, and death from any cause.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Therefore, it is critical to have treatment options for young adults with newly diagnosed hyperglycemia that optimize diabetes control and reduce complications.</p><p>Despite the availability of various guidelines and new pharmacotherapies globally, the management of patients with prediabetes and diabetes remains less than satisfactory. Lifestyle changes, including regular exercise and diet, are essential and the 2015 diabetes management algorithm by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) proposes metformin plus lifestyle modification as the first line of therapy in newly diagnosed diabetes patients with an entry glycosylated hemoglobin [hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)] level of &#x0003c;7.5%.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] However, maintaining an adequate and consistent lifestyle is not achievable in a majority of the patients. Additionally, metformin, while being effective, has gastrointestinal side effects in nearly 30% of the patients[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and other available pharmacological options are associated with side effects and classwide-effect safety warnings. Achieving glycemic control in patients with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes mainly depends on the patient's adherence to the treatment plan. Nonadherence to metformin, resulting in primary treatment failure, has been reported in approximately 39.7% of the patients.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Concern of adverse effects and inherent psychological barriers against being on a &#x0201c;drug for life&#x0201d; are among the major reasons for low adherence. Therefore, efforts should be directed to individualize therapy based on ethnic/cultural beliefs and traditions. The 2015 position statement by AACE calls for an HbA1c target of &#x02264;6.5% (in patients with no risk of hypoglycemia and no concurrent serious illness), which should be optimally achieved in a safe manner without the risk of hypoglycemia and weight gain.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>Availability of a food-derived formulation that could safely and effectively lower HbA1c could be culturally more acceptable because of being perceived as a &#x0201c;softer&#x0201d; therapeutic option and therefore, could lead to significant public health benefits. However, while there are many dietary supplements, which claim glucose-lowering efficacy, none are backed with the rigor of randomized, double-blind clinical trial evidence. The aim of this study, therefore, was to evaluate the glucose-lowering efficacy and safety of PreCrea<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, a proprietary nutritional supplement in patients with newly diagnosed hyperglycemia in India, where diabetes is endemic. PreCrea<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> contains Ivy gourd fruit extract (<italic>Coccinia cordifolia</italic> or <italic>Coccinia indica</italic>) powder, <italic>Gymnema sylvestre</italic> leaf extract powder, fenugreek (<italic>Trigonella foenum-graecum</italic>), chromium picolinate, and biotin [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>]. PreCrea<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> is available in many countries including the USA. The study was performed as part of the evaluation series on safety and efficacy of nutritional supplements (ESSENS),[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] which aims to critically evaluate the efficacy of nutritional supplements and includes further evaluation of longer term adoption and adherence rates and clinical outcomes as compared to prescription drugs.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>PreCrea<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> and placebo composition details</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="NAJMS-8-106-g001"/></table-wrap></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study design</title><p>This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted at six primary care diabetes centers across India (Total Diabetes Hormone Institute, Indore, Madhya Pradesh, India; DiaCare &#x02014; Diabetes Care and Hormone Clinics 1 and 2, Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India; Diabetes Care Centre, Jaipur, Rajasthan, India; Bhatia Hospital, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India; Inamdar Multispecialty Hospital, Pune, Maharashtra, India; St. Johns Medical College, Department of Endocrinology, Bangalore, Karnataka, India).

More importantly, despite a substantial HbA1c-lowering effect, PreCrea<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> was not associated with any AE of hypoglycemia or weight gain.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-11"><title>Clinical relevance of the findings</title><p>Lowering of HbA1c to 7% or below (ADA glycemic target for HbA1c) reduces/delays the development of microvascular complications and if implemented soon after the detection of hyperglycemia, is associated with long-term reduction in the number and intensity of microvascular diseases.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Studies in various Western countries have shown that the prevalence of inadequate glycemic control (HbA1c &#x0003e; 7%) in the United Kingdom is 76% and in the United States is 50%.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Diabetes management goals set by the Brazilian Diabetes Society are achieved in 46% of the patients with respect to HbA1c levels and in 24% with respect to the body mass index.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] On the other hand, in a cross-sectional study from 12 countries in Asia, 54% of those surveyed did not have a recorded value of HbA1c. The study measured HbA1c independently, and 55% were found to have values higher than 8%.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Studies in Thailand[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and Pakistan[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] reported that only 26.3% and 31.4% of the patients showed HbA1c &#x0003c; 7%, respectively. The limited studies available on diabetes care in India indicate that 50 to 60% of patients with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes do not achieve their glycemic target.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>In our study, approximately 35.6% of the patients in the PreCrea<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> group achieved their glycemic target with 12 weeks of treatment. The percentage of patients with HbA1c &#x0003e; 9% in the PreCrea<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> group decreased significantly from 22.2% to 4.4% at the end of week 12.</p><p>The current guidelines from the ADA and AACE recommend early initiation of metformin as a first-line drug for monotherapy and in combination therapy. However, gastrointestinal intolerance occurs frequently with metformin. These effects subside once the dose is reduced or when administered with meals but 5% of the patients do not tolerate even the lowest dose of metformin.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Hypoglycemia and weight gain are the most common side effects of other second-line agents such as sulfonylureas and meglitinides, whereas body fat gain, fluid accumulation, bone fractures, and increased risk of bladder cancer are the most common side effects of glitazones.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors have been associated with an increased incidence of genital and urinary tract infections.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] We also know from clinical experience that younger, newly diagnosed patients deal with the shock factor of learning of their dysglycemia with denial and are reticent to start prescription drugs. Under these circumstances, the availability of a food-based, efficacious, and safe therapeutic solution that appeals to the social and cultural sensibilities of the people from countries such as India, where traditional medicine systems coexist, could be very beneficial.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-12"><title>The cost factor</title><p>In the emerging markets, choosing an antidiabetic therapy is largely influenced by the cost of the therapy rather than its overall efficacy and safety. The recent position statement by AACE emphasizes that safety and efficacy should be given the highest importance rather than the cost of the treatment.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Availability of a food-derived formulation that could safely and effectively lower HbA1c levels could be an attractive solution for patients with newly diagnosed hyperglycemia. Better acceptability of such an option may also increase adherence, leading to substantial public health gains if these reductions could be sustained in the long term. As part of ESSENS, large-scale, long-term observational studies are already being conceptualized to evaluate the impact of PreCrea<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> on clinical outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-13"><title>Limitations</title><p>The main limitations of the present study were its relatively small sample size and shorter duration. As a result, it was not possible to determine the long-term clinical outcomes and safety of PreCrea<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>. Only treatment-na&#x000ef;ve patients were included in this study. As a result, the effect of PreCrea<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, if any, on the incremental reduction in HbA1c levels in patients already on metformin therapy could not be assessed. Further studies are required to address these limitations.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, this study demonstrates the efficacy and safety of PreCrea<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> in lowering HbA1c, FPG, and TG levels after 12 weeks of treatment in Indian subjects with newly diagnosed hyperglycemia. A nearly 1% point reduction in HbA1c levels observed at week 12 with PreCrea<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> administration is comparable to the reductions noticed with most oral antidiabetic therapies.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] There was no safety/tolerability issue observed with PreCrea<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>. Further large-scale, long-term studies are being conceptualized to determine the impact of PreCrea<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> on treatment adherence, and finally clinical outcome.</p><sec
