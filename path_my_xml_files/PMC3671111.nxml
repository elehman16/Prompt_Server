Subjects received four sprays of THC/CBD (10.8/10 mg) alongside single doses of the CYP3A and 2C19 inducer rifampicin (600 mg), CYP3A inhibitor ketoconazole (400 mg) or CYP2C19 inhibitor omeprazole (40 mg). Plasma samples were analyzed for CBD, THC and its metabolite 11-hydroxy-THC (11-OH-THC).</p><p>A single dose of four sprays of THC/CBD spray (10.8/10 mg) following repeated doses of rifampicin (600 mg) reduced the C<sub>max</sub> and AUC of all analytes. C<sub>max</sub> reduced from 2.94 to 1.88 ng/mL (-36%), 1.03 to 0.50 ng/mL (-52%) and 3.38 to 0.45 ng/mL (-87%) for THC, CBD and 11-OH-THC, respectively compared to single dose administration of THC/CBD spray alone. Ketoconazole co-administration with THC/CBD spray had the opposite effect, increasing the C<sub>max</sub> of the respective analytes from 2.65 to 3.36 ng/mL (+27%), 0.66 to 1.25 ng/mL (+89%) and 3.59 to 10.92 ng/mL (+204%). No significant deviations in C<sub>max</sub> or AUC for any analyte were observed when THC/CBD spray was co-administered with omeprazole. THC/CBD spray was well tolerated by the study subjects both alone and in combination with rifampicin, ketoconazole and omeprazole.</p><p>Evaluation of the PKs of THC/CBD spray alone and in combination with CYP450 inhibitors/inducers suggests that all analytes are substrates for the isoenzyme CYP3A4, but not CYP2C19. On the basis of our findings, there is likely to be little impact on other drugs metabolized by CYP enzymes on the PK parameters of THC/CBD spray, but potential effects should be taken into consideration when co-administering THC/CBD spray with compounds which share the CYP3A4 pathway such as rifampicin or ketoconazole.</p></sec><sec><title>Trials registration</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/NCT01323465">NCT01323465</ext-link></p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Cannabidiol</kwd><kwd>Cytochrome P450</kwd><kwd>Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol</kwd><kwd>Sativex <sup>&#x000ae;</sup><sup>&#x02020;</sup></kwd><kwd>Nabiximols<sup>&#x02020;</sup></kwd><kwd>THC/CBD spray</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2013</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The endocannabinoid system modulator &#x00394;9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)/cannabidiol (CBD) oromucosal spray (Sativex <sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, nabiximols) has been reported to be effective in relieving a number of multiple sclerosis (MS) symptoms including spasticity, central neuropathic pain and bladder dysfunction (Rog et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2005</xref>; Johnson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2010</xref>; Rog et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2007</xref>), and has recently been approved in various European countries and abroad (i.e. in Canada, Israel, New Zealand) as add-on treatment for spasticity in MS patients. Other potential indications for this compound include pain relief in advanced cancer (Johnson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2010</xref>; Porteney et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2012</xref>), as well as peripheral neuropathic pain in MS (Nurmikko et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2007</xref>). Derived from proprietary cannabis plant varieties bred to exhibit a pre-determined content of cannabinoids (CBs), THC/CBD spray is fully standardized and contains two principal CBs, THC and CBD at an approximately 1:1 ratio as well as minor amounts of other CBs and non-CB components. The specified CBs constitute at least 90% of the total CB content of the extract, however, the minor CBs and other constituents also contribute to the therapeutic profile of THC/CBD spray (Russo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2011</xref>), and may be involved in stabilizing the extract (Whittle et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2001</xref>).</p><p>CBs are thought to act primarily via activation of specific CB receptors, CB<sub>1</sub> and CB<sub>2</sub> (Howlett et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2002</xref>). CB<sub>1</sub> is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system (CNS), while CB<sub>2</sub> is primarily expressed in the periphery, especially in immune cells (Pertwee <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2007</xref>).</p><p>Endogenous ligands (&#x0201c;endocannabinoids&#x0201d;) produced in mammalian tissues target these receptors, and together with the catabolic and metabolic enzymes and transporter systems they constitute the endocannabinoid system.</p><p>Multiple drug therapy is often used with a single patient. As THC/CBD spray is indicated for MS and potentially advanced cancer pain, the likelihood is high that patients would be receiving different concomitant medications. As such, drug-drug interactions could occur which affect the bioavailability of THC/CBD spray through absorption, metabolism or disposition. In turn this could affect the treatment and adverse events (AEs) experienced by the patient (Chen &#x00026; Raymond <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2006</xref>). In some incidences, AEs experienced due to drug-drug interactions can be life-threatening, therefore understanding the mechanisms of these interactions is important so that dosing and safety information can be adjusted accordingly.</p><p>Cytochrome P450 (CYP450) is a family of isoenzymes responsible for the biotransformation of several drugs, and drug metabolism via this system has emerged as an important determinant of the occurrence of several drug-drug interactions that can result in toxicity, reduced pharmacological effect and AEs (Guengerich <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2008</xref>). Determining whether the drugs involved act as enzyme substrates, inducers, or inhibitors can prevent clinically significant interactions from occurring. Moreover, avoiding co-administration or adjusting a patient's drug regimen early in the course of therapy can provide optimal response with minimal AEs (Ogu &#x00026; Maxa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2000</xref>). Many different CYP450 isoenzymes have been identified to-date, including six which play important roles in drug metabolism (DiPiro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">1999</xref>; Cupp &#x00026; Tracy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">1998</xref>): CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4.</p><p>CYP450 inhibitors and inducers are known to affect the metabolism of THC. Previous literature reports have indicated that CBs, especially THC, are metabolized by CYP3A4, 2C9, 2C19 and possibly 2D6 in humans (Huestis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2007</xref>), and that the primary metabolites of THC and CBD are 11-hydroxy-THC (11-OH-THC) and 7-hydroxy-CBD, respectively (Huestis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2007</xref>). The formation of 11-OH-THC has been reported to be primarily catalysed by CYP2C19 and 2C9 (Bland et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2005</xref>).</p><p>In vitro studies of THC and CBD on CYP450 induction and inhibition indicate that both inhibit CYP1A1, 1A2 and 1B1 enzymes (Yamaori et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2010</xref>). CBD also has an inhibitory effect on CYP3A4 and CYP2C19. However, this effect only occurred at high concentrations (IC<sub>50</sub> = 6-9 &#x003bc;M) of CBD (GW unpublished data), and in normal dosing, peak plasma concentrations of CBD are approximately 5 ng/mL or less, 400-fold lower than the levels at which CYP inhibition may be anticipated. As such, it is unlikely that THC/CBD spray would cause a relevant inhibition of CYP450s. However, to investigate the potential interactions of THC and CBD with drugs which also interact with the CYP450s CYP3A4 and CYP2C19, various known inducers/inhibitors of these isoenzymes were employed and the pharmacokinetics (PKs) of their co-administration with THC/CBD spray evaluated.</p><p>Rifampicin is an antibiotic drug, a strong inducer of CYP3A4 and moderate inducer of CYPs 2C19, 2B6, 2C8 and 2C9, and has been extensively used in clinical studies as a prototypical inducer of these enzymes (Division of Clinical Pharmacology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2012</xref>; Federal Drug Association <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2012</xref>). Ketoconazole is a synthetic antifungal drug, is a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 (Federal Drug Association <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2012</xref>), and a weak inhibitor of CYPs 2C8 and 2C19 (Federal Drug Association <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2012</xref>). Omeprazole is a proton-pump inhibitor which is primarily metabolized by, and demonstrates high affinity for CYP2C19 (Furuta et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2005</xref>), and is also a moderate inhibitor of 2C19 (Federal Drug Association <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2012</xref>). This study investigated the potential interaction of these CYP450 inhibitors/inducers on the PK and safety profile of THC/CBD spray in healthy male subjects.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>This open-label, randomized, crossover, drug-interaction study took place at one study site in the UK (Quintiles Drug Research Unit at Guys Hospital), was approved by Guy's Research Ethics Committee, and was conducted according to the International Conference on Harmonisation guidelines on Good Clinical Practice and the ethical principles stated in the Declaration of Helsinki and local UK regulations.

Plasma samples were separated by centrifugation (approximately 2500 rpm &#x000d7; 15 minutes at 4&#x000b0;C). Samples were stored in 4 mL amber glass screw top glass vials with PTFE lined screw caps labelled with Guys Drug Research (Quintiles Limited) labels. The aliquots were stored in clearly labelled containers in a freezer set at or below -20&#x000b0;C, until shipped for assay. Samples were shipped on dry ice at the appropriate time-points.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Analysis method</title><p>The assay validation was undertaken by Advanced Bioanalytical Service Laboratories (London, UK), who developed the technique after reviewing the literature, which was based on the methodology adopted by three different groups (Foltz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">1983</xref>; Goodall &#x00026; Basteyns <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">1995</xref>; Kemp et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">1995</xref>), and designed with reference to FDA guidelines for industry (FDA Guidance for Industry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2012</xref>). The method utilised protein precipitation, solvent extraction and derivatisation for the sample preparation and then sample analysis by capillary gas chromatography and detection by a mass spectrometer (GC-MS). The validation procedure investigated the calibration model with the best regression fit over the concentration range 0.1 - 100 ng/mL for CBD, THC and 11-OH-THC, as well as precision and accuracy of the method, stability, carry-over, and specificity.</p><p>Human plasma from healthy volunteers was used to prepare the standards and quality control (QC) samples, with analytes extracted using hexane/ethyl acetate (7:1 ratio), derivatised with N,O-Bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide. Analytic grade THC (Sigma, UK), CBD (Sigma, UK) and 11-OH-THC (Radian International and Cerillant, UK) were obtained, and three sets of CBD, THC and 11-OH-THC were used to support the study. Deuterated THC-d<sub>3</sub> (Sigma, UK) was used as the internal standard. The GC-MS equipment was a Hewlett Packard 6890 Gas Chromatograph attached to a Hewlett Packard 5973 Mass Selective Detector. Data handling was carried out using an MS Chemstation System and the peak area ratio of the analytes to the internal standard was calculated in Excel (2000). The concentrations were calculated from the ratio data using least squares ln(y) on ln(x) regression performed in Excel (2000), and were then checked manually. Regression analysis was undertaken to find the regression model that best described the calibration data (for details, see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">Miller &#x00026; Miller 1992</xref>)).</p><p>Intra-assay precision and bias was examined using spiked control samples analysed in replicates of five. Inter-assay precision and accuracy were analysed in quintuplet at three concentrations and on three separate occasions.</p><p>The lowest and upper Limits of Quantification (LOQ) were investigated by looking at five (500 &#x003bc;L) plasma samples containing 0.10 ng/mL and 100.0 ng/mL (the lowest and highest calibrators) of THC, CBD and 11-OH-THC, assayed in one batch, possessing acceptable precision and accuracy. As such, these lowest and upper LOQ were deemed suitable for the measurement of these analytes in human plasma over these concentration ranges.</p><p>The inter- and intra-assay accuracy of the assay calculated for THC was -0.53, -0.45, -1.72% and -0.50, -2.10, -0.86% at plasma THC concentrations of 2.0, 20.0 and 80.0 ng/mL, respectively. The inter- and intra-assay precision of the assay calculated for THC was 1.88, 2.51, 2.41% and 2.64, 1.09, 1.29% at plasma THC concentrations of 2.0, 20.0 and 80.0 ng/mL, respectively.</p><p>The inter- and intra-assay accuracy of the assay calculated for CBD was -2.90, 0.81, 1.78% and -2.00, -0.75, 2.38% at plasma CBD concentrations of 2.0, 20.0 and 80.0 ng/mL, respectively.

The inter- and intra-assay precision of the assay calculated for 11-OH-THC was 3.45, 3.44, 2.57% and 6.04, 1.96, 1.24% at plasma 11-OH-THC concentrations of 2.17, 21.70 and 86.80 ng/mL, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Extraction procedure</title><p>A 0.5 mL aliquot of test sample, QC or blank plasma was placed into a test tube. The blank plasma was spiked with 50 &#x003bc;L of the appropriate standard solution to produce the calibration standards. 50 &#x003bc;L of the internal standard was added to each test tube. The samples were then diluted by the addition of 500 &#x003bc;L of 0.1% (w/v) ascorbic acid and the protein precipitated by the addition of 1.0 mL of acetonitrile. The proteins were removed by centrifugation and the supernatant concentrated to 1 mL using nitrogen at 50&#x000ba;C. The samples were then basified by the addition of 300 &#x003bc;L of 5M sodium hydroxide and the analytes extracted by the addition of 2.0 mL of 7:1 hexane:ethyl acetate. After mixing for 16 minutes the tubes were centrifuged and the top layer transferred into clean 3 dram vials. The solvent was removed using nitrogen at 70&#x000ba;C and the dried extract resuspended in 100 &#x003bc;L of BSTFA and transferred to microvials, capped and placed at 70&#x000ba;C for 30 minutes to derivatise the analytes.

For THC/CBD spray plus rifampicin, these were rhinitis, headache and malaise; but none was considered related to THC/CBD spray, all were of mild severity, and none was reported with a subject incidence greater than one. Subjects receiving THC/CBD spray plus ketoconazole reported the greatest subject incidence (100%) of TEAEs in the study, with a total of 35 TEAEs reported in 11 subjects. The majority of these were of the system organ class (SOC) nervous system disorders. Similarly, the majority of TEAEs reported by subjects receiving THC/CBD spray plus omeprazole were also nervous system disorders, the most common being dizziness.</p><p>No other clinically significant abnormalities for laboratory safety measurements or ECG parameters were reported during the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study investigated the effects of the known CYP450 inhibitors or inducers rifampicin, ketoconazole and omeprazole, on the PK and safety profiles of THC/CBD spray.</p><sec id="Sec27"><title>Rifampicin and THC/CBD spray</title><p>When prescribing drugs that share the CYP3A4 pathway, plasma levels should be periodically monitored, otherwise it is possible that drug levels may reach a toxic state that can manifest as serious medical events if one of them is a CYP3A4 inhibitor (such as ketoconazole) (Ogu &#x00026; Maxa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2000</xref>). If one of the drugs is a CYP3A4 inducer, such as rifampicin, then the effectiveness of the other drug might be compromised following a more rapid reduction than usual of the plasma level. As such, investigating the PKs of THC/CBD spray in combination with a CYP3A4 inducer was of high clinical importance. Rifampicin was chosen as it has been extensively used in clinical studies as a prototypical inducer of CYP3A4 (Division of Clinical Pharmacology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2012</xref>), but it is also a moderate CYP2C19 inducer (Federal Drug Association <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2012</xref>). Overall exposure to repeated daily doses of rifampicin for 10 days, followed by a single dose of THC/CBD spray (4 sprays), reduced the mean plasma levels of THC and CBD, and most of all, 11-OH-THC, as compared with levels observed when THC/CBD spray alone was administered. While the magnitude of the reduction in the plasma levels of the three analytes was within the range of inter-individual variation observed with THC/CBD spray alone, suggesting that significant induction of CYP3A4 would lead to only a slight reduction in exposure to CBs, intra-subject variability must also be considered. For example, should a subjects whose symptoms are controlled by a daily dose of seven sprays of THC/CBD spray experience a reduction in plasma levels of CBs of 1/3 in the presence of a CYP3A4 inducer, they would need to increase their dose to experience the same efficacy of THC/CBD spray. The effect of rifampicin on the group mean C<sub>max</sub> and AUC of CBD and THC was consistent with the inducing effects of rifampicin on the CYP3A4 isoenzyme (Michalets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">1998</xref>). Both CBD and THC exposure decreased when rifampicin was administered with THC/CBD spray and the apparent clearance for these analytes increased after multiple dose administration of rifampicin. Although an increase in exposure of the 11-OH-THC metabolite was expected due to anticipated conversion of THC to 11-OH-THC via CYP3A4, instead a significant decrease in the metabolite exposure was observed, suggesting that CYP3A4 is also involved in the further metabolism of the primary metabolite, 11-OH-THC. A suggested mechanism for this effect is that increased CYP3A4 activity induced by rifampicin induced further metabolism of 11-OH-THC, causing a reduced plasma level of 11-OH-THC. This is the first investigation in humans to identify CYP3A4 as a significant mediator of 11-OH-THC metabolism, an interesting finding for this psychoactive THC metabolite.</p><sec id="Sec28"><title>Ketoconazole and THC/CBD spray</title><p>Similarly, the effects of the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole on the PKs of THC/CBD spray were also investigated. For both THC and CBD, there was an increase in mean C<sub>max</sub> and AUC following THC/CBD spray administration after 5-day period of daily administration of ketoconazole. These increases in mean values were considerably less than the range of inter-subject variability for the same parameters. However, intra-subject variability must also be considered, in that should an individual experienced enhanced plasma levels of CBs in the presence of a CYP3A4 inhibitor, then their daily dose of THC/CBD spray would need to be reduced accordingly in order to balance the efficacy of the compound against any adverse effects that may occur at higher doses.</p><p>For 11-OH-THC, the C<sub>max</sub> was 3.1-times higher after CYP3A4 inhibition by ketoconazole, and the AUC was 3.8-times higher, confirming that 11-OH-THC is likely to be metabolized predominantly by CYP3A4. The effect of ketoconazole on the group mean C<sub>max</sub> and AUC of CBD and THC was consistent with the inhibitory effects of ketoconazole on the CYP3A4 isoenzyme. Both CBD and THC exposure increased when THC/CBD spray was administered with ketoconazole and the apparent clearance for CBD and THC decreased after multiple dose administration of ketoconazole. Although a decrease in exposure of the 11-OH-THC metabolite was expected due to inhibition of the conversion of THC to 11-OH-THC via CYP3A4, a significant increase in metabolite exposure was observed which again suggests CYP3A4 is involved in the metabolism of the metabolite, 11-OH-THC.</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Omeprazole and THC/CBD spray</title><p>To investigate the potential interaction of THC/CBD spray with a CYP2C19 inhibitor, omeprazole was employed. In contrast to rifampicin and ketoconazole, co-administration of THC/CBD spray with omeprazole had no apparent affect the group mean C<sub>max</sub> or AUC results for any of the analytes. Any slight differences group mean AUC and C<sub>max</sub> values for all three analytes were non-significant and well within the range of inter-individual variation observed with THC/CBD spray alone. Furthermore, the apparent clearance for THC and CBD was not changed between THC/CBD spray alone versus THC/CBD spray and omeprazole treatments. However, a decrease in exposure to 11-OH-THC was observed following co-administration of omeprazole with THC/CBD spray. Nevertheless, examining the individual exposure data, no clear conclusion could be drawn with respect to any effect of omeprazole. These findings suggest that THC, CBD are not substrates for the CYP2C19 isoenzyme.</p></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Safety and tolerability</title><p>THC/CBD spray was generally well tolerated when given alone, illustrated by the fact that there were no serious AEs during the study. The majority of TEAEs were mild in severity and, as expected, of the SOC of nervous system disorders, with somnolence being the most commonly reported. While the exposure to THC/CBD spray was lower than usual in chronic patients, the administration procedure did not follow the slow up-titration process that takes 4-5 days to reach a dose of 4 sprays/day (and goes on for 7-8 days to reach the average 6-7 sprays/day dose, and up to 14 days to reach the maximum dose of 12 sprays/day). As such, the incidence of AEs in the SOC of nervous disorders in the current study is not surprising. A review of collated results from initial randomized-controlled clinical trials with THC/CBD spray involving 930 patients demonstrated that the most frequently reported AEs (incidence &#x0003e;10%) were dizziness (28%), diarrhoea (13%), fatigue (11%) and nausea (11%) (Constantinescu &#x00026; Sarantis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2006</xref>). Recent publications also demonstrate that AEs the SOC of nervous systems disorders were among the commonly occurring AEs reported with THC/CBD spray use (Johnson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2012</xref>; Langford et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2013</xref>).</p><p>No difference was observed in the proportions of subjects reporting AEs upon co-administration of THC/CBD spray with rifampicin or omeprazole compared with THC/CBD spray alone. Again, all AEs were of mild severity, with headache and dysguesia being the most commonly reported for THC/CBD spray and rifampicin (one subject), and dizziness in three subjects taking THC/CBD spray and omeprazole.</p><p>Although all subjects receiving THC/CBD spray and ketoconazole experienced AEs, this combination was still relatively well tolerated, and all but one AE was of mild severity. The majority of TEAEs were classed as nervous system disorders, including somnolence and dizziness which occurred at the same incidence as with THC/CBD spray alone. However, there was an increased incidence of euphoric mood, lethargy, dygeusia and headache when THC/CBD spray was given in combination with ketoconazole. Only one event was classed as moderate in terms of severity (anxiety) and the event resolved without intervention. All other events were of mild severity. Notably in this group, all subjects had increases in C<sub>max</sub> for 11-OH-THC, and seven had an increase in THC C<sub>max</sub>, with nine subjects also having an increase in AUC. Taking into account the increase in exposure after combined administration compared to THC/CBD spray alone, it is possible that the difference in PKs may account for the increase in CNS-type AEs observed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>Study limitations</title><p>There were a number of limitations to this study. Kel was estimated over a short sampling period (less than two t<sub>1/2</sub>s) for the majority of profiles in this study and the regression had low precision in some profiles. AUC<sub>(0-inf)</sub> had an extrapolated area which was larger than 20% for some profiles. However, despite these limitations, the AUC<sub>(0-inf)</sub> and the AUC<sub>(0-t)</sub> were in agreement, and the statistical results are thus considered reliable. Further consistency and validity of the study is demonstrated by the similarity of the PK exposure parameters following a single dose of THC/CBD spray in the absence of any inducer or inhibitor, which are in good agreement with the PK data provided in a previous clinical study performed by the authors (ref PK study). The inter-subject variability was substantial and greater than the difference in exposure means before and after rifampicin, ketoconazole, or omeprazole treatment, suggesting that any effect of other medications metabolized by relevant CYP enzymes on THC/CBD spray is likely to be within the normal range of variation. However, there was generally a similar variability in the group mean primary PK parameters between the THC/CBD spray alone and the THC/CBD spray plus inducer or inhibitor treatments.</p><p>Doses of THC/CBD (4 sprays instead the average 6-8 sprays/day) and intake patterns (4 sprays in a row instead of evenly distributed through the day) were not equivalent to those in the approved label. However, during a phase IIb dose ranging study in cancer patients with pain, in the low dose THC/CBD spray (1-4 sprays) group, over 90% of patients titrated to a dose of 3 or 4 sprays, leading to the conclusion that a minimal effective dose was 3 sprays per day (Porteney et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2012</xref>). Additionally, efficacy was observed in the low dose group, reaching statistical significance for the continuous response analysis (pain 0-10 Numerical Rating Scale score) and for the mean change from baseline in score, demonstrating that 4 daily sprays is a clinically relevant dose (Porteney et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2012</xref>). Distributing the dose throughout the day in the current study would have given a very different PK profile, and would not have been a suitable approach for the current study. Additionally, during a previous Phase I pharmacokinetics study, doses of 2 daily sprays of THC/CBD spray gave low C<sub>max</sub> values (Stott et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2012</xref>). As such, a dose of 4 daily sprays was chosen to give good plasma concentration over time curves.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec32" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, inhibition of CYP2C19 by omeprazole did not significantly alter the PK of THC/CBD spray suggesting that THC, CBD and 11-OH-THC are not substrates for this isoenzyme at the clinically relevant dose of THC/CBD spray investigated. The CYP3A4 inducer rifampicin caused a decrease in exposure to all three analytes, although not extreme and within the natural range of variation between subjects. Conversely, the CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole caused increased exposure to all analytes, suggesting that THC, CBD and 11-OH-THC all are substrates for this isoenzyme. Moreover, the findings with rifampicin and ketoconazole suggest that CYP3A4 is involved in the metabolism of 11-OH-THC. On the basis of these findings, there is likely to be little impact on other drugs metabolized by CYP enzymes on the PK parameters of THC/CBD spray, but potential effects should be taken into consideration when co-administering THC/CBD spray with compounds which share the CYP3A4 pathway. THC/CBD spray was also well tolerated in healthy subjects both alone and in combination with rifampicin, ketoconazole and omeprazole.</p><sec id="Sec33"><title>Ethical standards</title><p>The current study was approved by Guy's Research Ethics Committee, and was conducted in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonisation guidelines on Good Clinical Practice and the ethical principles stated in the Declaration of Helsinki and local UK regulations.
