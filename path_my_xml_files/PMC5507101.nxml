Recent study results indicate that men with ED in China who were na&#x000ef;ve to phosphodiesterase inhibitor type 5 (PDE5) therapy prefer tadalafil 20-mg (on-demand) versus sildenafil 100-mg (on-demand). Differences in psychosocial outcomes may help to explain treatment preference in favor of tadalafil. This open-label, randomized, crossover study compared psychosocial outcomes and drug attribute choices between tadalafil and sildenafil in Chinese men with ED na&#x000ef;ve to PDE5 inhibitor therapy. Eligible patients were randomized to sequential 20-mg tadalafil/100-mg sildenafil (<italic>n</italic> = 190) or 100-mg sildenafil/20-mg tadalafil (<italic>n</italic> = 193) for 8 weeks each and were asked which treatment they preferred to take for the 8-week extension phase. Psychosocial outcomes were assessed using the Psychological and Interpersonal Relationship Scale (PAIRS), Drug Attributes Questionnaire (DRAQ), and Sexual Life Quality Questionnaire (SLQQ). When taking tadalafil versus sildenafil, men had a higher mean endpoint score on the PAIRS Spontaneity Domain (tadalafil = 2.86 <italic>vs</italic> sildenafil = 2.72; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001), and a lower mean endpoint score on the Time Concerns Domain (tadalafil = 2.41 <italic>vs</italic> sildenafil = 2.55; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). A numerical increase in the Sexual Self-Confidence Domain was observed when taking tadalafil versus sildenafil (tadalafil = 2.76 <italic>vs</italic> sildenafil = 2.72; <italic>P</italic> = 0.102). The most frequently chosen drug attributes explaining treatment preference were able to get an erection long after having drug, and ability to get an erection every time. SLQQ results were comparable between treatment groups. These psychosocial outcomes may explain why more Chinese men preferred tadalafil versus sildenafil for the treatment of ED in this clinical trial.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>drug attributes</kwd><kwd>erectile dysfunction</kwd><kwd>phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor</kwd><kwd>psychological assessment of sexual dysfunction</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors are the first line of treatment choice for men with erectile dysfunction (ED) in Western society.<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Traditional Chinese medicine has been widely used in China for the treatment of impotence; however, more men are switching to PDE5 inhibitors for ED treatment.<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Currently, there are three PDE5 inhibitors offered in China: sildenafil citrate, tadalafil, and vardenafil.</p><p>Previous studies have shown both sildenafil<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> and tadalafil<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> to be efficacious and well tolerated in Chinese men with ED, and it is expected that treatment with tadalafil may address some of the psychosocial concerns with sexual performance in men with ED.

Patients were then asked which treatment they preferred to take for the 8-week extension phase. Both tadalafil and sildenafil were administered as needed before sexual activity but were not administered more than 1 dose per day. The doses of tadalafil and sildenafil used in this study represent the approved maximum labeled doses in China, thus minimizing the influence of efficacy (resulting from dose) on psychosocial outcomes. Additionally, down-titration was not permitted. Patient compliance was assessed by direct questioning or examination of diary cards at each visit. Patients who were noncompliant were discontinued from the study. The use of any other ED treatment was prohibited for the duration of the study.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Study design.

Domain scores were calculated for each patient as the mean of all items in the domain with a lowest possible score for each domain of 1 and a highest possible score of 4. Higher scores on the Sexual Self-Confidence and Spontaneity Domains represent higher sexual self-confidence and spontaneity, whereas a lower score on the Time Concerns Domain represents fewer time concerns before and during sexual encounters.

Previous studies indicate that patient preference is of paramount importance in managing patients with ED,<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> and psychosocial factors are thought to impact this preference. Current ED guidelines also emphasizes that the assessment of ED treatment must consider the effects on patients and partner satisfaction, which is also related to psychosocial outcomes as well as efficacy and safety.<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> As such, this analysis evaluated the psychosocial outcomes and drug attributes of 20 mg tadalafil versus 100 mg sildenafil; allowing the identification of factors that may impact patient preference.</p><p>In this study, significant improvements in the PAIRS Time Concerns and Spontaneity Domains were observed after baseline, and the improvement in the tadalafil group was superior to that in the sildenafil group, which indicates that men felt less time pressure, less sense of urgency, and less planning before and during sexual encounters when taking tadalafil compared with sildenafil. While a significant improvement in the Sexual Self-Confidence Domain was not observed with tadalafil versus sildenafil, the mean score change from baseline after tadalafil treatment (0.75) was numerically greater than that after sildenafil treatment (0.71).</p><p>The significant improvement in both the Time Concerns and Spontaneity Domains are consistent with the randomized, open-label, crossover study conducted by Dean <italic>et al</italic>. in which men with ED had improved spontaneity and less time concerns related to sexual encounters when treated with tadalafil on-demand (at doses of 10 or 20 mg) compared to sildenafil on-demand (at doses of 25, 50, or 100 mg).<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Additionally, similar improvements in the Time Concerns and Spontaneity Domains were observed in a study directly comparing the psychosocial outcomes between once-daily tadalafil and on-demand tadalafil or sildenafil.<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> It is suspected that the differences in Time Concerns and Spontaneity Domains between tadalafil and sildenafil may be due to the differences in their duration of action as tadalafil has a duration of action of up to 36 h<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> versus 4&#x02013;5 h for sildenafil.<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> The differences between the tadalafil and sildenafil pharmacokinetic profiles allows patients greater freedom and less need to plan ahead, treatment with tadalafil may address some of the psychosocial concerns with sexual performance in Chinese men with ED.</p><p>In this study, the drug attributes most frequently chosen by men preferring tadalafil were &#x0201c;ability to get an erection long after having drug&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;ability to get an erection every time.&#x0201d; For men preferring silCenafil, the drug attributes most frequently chosen were &#x0201c;ability to get an erection every time&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;firmness of erections.&#x0201d; The DRAQ was administered after a patient had identified his preferred medication and does not allow patients to compare attributes of one drug to the other. However, it is expected that DRAQ responses provide an indication of why the chosen medication was preferred. Regardless of preferred treatment, however, the most common drug attribute choices selected by men who preferred sildenafil and men who preferred tadalafil suggest that men prefer ED medications that enable a return to the erectile function and partner interaction they experienced prior to having ED.<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p><p>While the mean change in SLQQ-QoL scores from baseline was comparable between both the tadalafil and sildenafil treatment groups, the mean SLQQ-QoL scores at the end of the extension phase were increased among both tadalafil and sildenafil-treated patients, suggesting that both treatments resulted in an improvement in the way patients evaluated their sexual quality of life.</p><p>A possible limitation of this study was the open-label design, which could increase conscious and unconscious bias in the conduct and interpretation of the trial. However, the use of a centralized interactive voice-response system (IVRS) as well as the crossover design with a 7&#x02013;10 days washout period was expected to minimize this potential for bias. The study analyzed both the intention-to-treat (ITT) population and the population of patients who completed both treatment periods in order to minimize the potential for interpretation bias.

As measured with PAIRS, men with ED had higher spontaneity and less time concerns related to sexual encounters when treated with tadalafil compared with sildenafil. These psychosocial outcomes and the ability to dissociate the intake of the pill with achieving an erection, a unique benefit to a long-acting PDE5 inhibitor such as tadalafil, may help explain why more men preferred tadalafil for the treatment of ED in this clinical trial.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-6"><title>AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS</title><p>WJB, HJL, XFW contributions: data collection, drafting and critical revision of the manuscript.
