A three-session phone intervention for nonsmoking family members and friends (i.e. support persons) was successful for increasing smoker quitline enrollment. To enhance the intervention&#x02019;s potential translatability, in this study, we delivered treatment for the non-smoker within ongoing quitline services and compared the efficacy of the three-call intervention to a streamlined version (one call). A total of 704 adult non-smokers (85% female, 95% White) wanting to help a smoker quit and recruited statewide in Minnesota participated in this randomized controlled trial with parallel groups. Non-smokers received mailed written materials and were randomly assigned to a control condition (no additional treatment, <italic>n = </italic>235), or to a one- (<italic>n = </italic>233) or three-call (<italic>n = </italic>236) intervention delivered by quitline coaches. The main outcome was smoker quitline enrollment through 7-month follow-up. Smoker quitline enrollment was similar for those linked to non-smokers in the one- and three-call interventions (14.6% [34/233] and 14.8% [35/236]), and higher than for smokers linked to control participants (6.4% [15/235]), <italic>P</italic> = 0.006. Just one quitline coaching call delivered to non-smokers increased treatment enrollment among smokers. The reach of quitlines could be enhanced by targeting the social support network of smokers.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction </title><p>In 2014, the prevalence of smoking in the United States was 16.8% [<xref rid="cyx050-B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. About half of smokers attempt to quit each year [<xref rid="cyx050-B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], but most do not utilize evidence-based interventions that could double or triple their success at quitting [<xref rid="cyx050-B3" ref-type="bibr">3&#x02013;5</xref>]. For example, the use of quitlines improves smoking cessation [<xref rid="cyx050-B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="cyx050-B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] but these are used by only 1% of smokers in the population [<xref rid="cyx050-B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Therefore, promoting use of evidence-based cessation treatments is an important public health priority [<xref rid="cyx050-B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="cyx050-B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>A promising approach for increasing the reach of interventions is to target non-smokers within the social support network of smokers [<xref rid="cyx050-B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="cyx050-B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. From observational studies, supportive interpersonal relationships [<xref rid="cyx050-B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and social networks [<xref rid="cyx050-B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] are correlated with quitting success. However, strategies that use buddy systems or involve family members or friends (i.e. support persons) with smokers seeking cessation treatment have not been uniformly effective [<xref rid="cyx050-B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="cyx050-B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Thus, a key challenge for the field is where and how to leverage social support in the cessation process [<xref rid="cyx050-B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="cyx050-B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Most research has focused on cessation&#x02014;harnessing support from family members and friends to help smokers who are already in treatment programs and have high levels of quitting readiness [<xref rid="cyx050-B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="cyx050-B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="cyx050-B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Most smokers, however, are not ready to quit [<xref rid="cyx050-B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and thus supportive strategies that reach non-treatment seeking smokers may have greater reach and utility. For example, recent studies suggest that targeting community peers and family support networks is effective for increasing quitting among non-treatment seeking smokers [<xref rid="cyx050-B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="cyx050-B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Also, the CDC Tips from Former Smokers national campaign was associated with increases in the proportion of non-smokers who talked to smokers about quitting and recommended treatment [<xref rid="cyx050-B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In a prior randomized efficacy trial [<xref rid="cyx050-B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], we evaluated if non-smokers could be effective in prompting a smoker to utilize a quitline. Non-smokers (<italic>n =</italic> 534) received written materials only (control condition) or written materials plus three counseling calls delivered by research staff. Counselors used behavioral change techniques with a motivational interviewing style to teach participants supportive skills for prompting their smoker&#x02019;s use of a quitline. Quitline enrollment was significantly greater for smokers linked to participants who received the intervention (16.1%) than for control participants (8.6%); adjusted OR = 2.09, <italic>P</italic> = 0.008.</p><p>To enhance the potential translatability of the intervention, in this study, we conducted a randomized clinical trial within the ongoing services of a quitline, transitioning the non-smoker intervention delivery from research staff to existing quitline coaches. With the ultimate goal of reducing costs and enhancing dissemination, we examined if a streamlined version (one call) was as effective as the three-call intervention; both were compared to a control condition. We hypothesized a dose response relationship between number of phone sessions (0, 1, 3) provided to non-smoking support persons and smoker quitline enrollment. This work is novel because it is the first to evaluate a quitline intervention for non-smokers to engage smokers in cessation treatment. In contrast, prior studies evaluated strategies using health care professionals to engage unmotivated smokers in treatment [<xref rid="cyx050-B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="cyx050-B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>This RCT was conducted in Minnesota, and approved by the Mayo Clinic and National Jewish Health Institutional Review Boards, and registered with clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01331226).

From prior quitline studies targeting smokers [<xref rid="cyx050-B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], we assumed quitline enrollment rates for one coaching call to be intermediate between the control (i.e. 0 calls) and the three-call conditions. Assuming a linear trend in a logistic regression model for the primary outcome of quitline enrollment, an alpha of 0.05, and the above assumptions, the study was designed with 90% power to enroll 340 support persons per group for a total sample of 1020 participants.</p></sec><sec><title>Screening, eligibility and enrollment</title><p>Non-smokers who were concerned about a smoker and interested in learning how to be helpful were recruited statewide in Minnesota over 25 months (September 2011&#x02013;2013). The first 93 participants were enrolled utilizing flyers sent to various public health organizations, health fairs, community events, press releases and advertisements in small regional newspapers and radios. The next 611 participants were enrolled through targeted mailings done from a list of potential smoking households in Minnesota, purchased from a direct marketing company. Due to study timeline and budget constraints, we stopped recruitment with 704 subjects enrolled. Recruitment advertisements included a study toll-free number and an e-mail address. Screening was completed by research staff by telephone or e-mail; those eligible were mailed a consent form and baseline questionnaire. No incentives were offered for enrollment in the study.</p><p>Eligibility criteria were: at least 18 years of age; Minnesota resident; non-smoker (never smoked or no smoking for &#x02265; 6 months); interested in supporting someone at least 18 years of age who was a Minnesota resident and smoked on average at least one cigarette per day over the previous 7 days, with whom they had any form of contact on at least 3 days/week; access to a working telephone; and provided written informed consent. Individuals were excluded if another participant from the same household had enrolled. A total of 1301 individuals were screened of which 1169 (90%) were eligible; of these 704 (60%) enrolled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="cyx050-F1">Fig. 1</xref> ).

The study stratified participants on gender because some research indicated differences between men and women on provision of and response to social support in smoking cessation [<xref rid="cyx050-B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Prior to the trial, the study statistician generated the random allocation sequence based on the stratification variables. Participants completed baseline assessments prior to being informed of their allocation to treatment condition. Participants were mailed a cover letter notifying them of their study group assignment. Enclosed in this mailing were written materials and a colorful silicone wristband with the study logo.</p><p>Follow-up data were collected from October 2011 to July 2014. Research staff blinded to treatment condition mailed a questionnaire (i.e. Support Provided Measure [SPM]) at 1 and 7 months to all randomized participants and provided reminders by e-mail or telephone, if needed. Participants received a pen for completing the 1-month follow-up and a key chain for completing the 7-month follow-up. Participants completing each follow-up were entered into a drawing for 1 of 11 Ipod touches that was conducted after all study assessments were completed. A participant&#x02019;s name was entered after each follow-up was completed, with maximum of two entries.</p></sec><sec><title>Support person interventions delivered to the non-smokers</title><p>Participants in all three groups received written materials consisting of: (i) the NCI Clearing the Air brochure that they could share with their smoker, and (ii) a tri-fold brochure containing tips on supportive behaviors and statements, information on nicotine dependence including nicotine withdrawal, and a description of services provided by the Helpline. This brochure included a study-specific quitline toll-free number and a reference code linked to the participant&#x02019;s study ID number that their smoker could use for up to 7 months. This was done to capture the primary endpoint; specifically, to link smokers enrolling in the quitline with the study participants. To ensure consistency in services provided, all smokers who used the study number were eligible to receive quitline services and were not triaged based on insurance status or health plan (the typical procedure for individuals calling). The materials informed participants that their smoker could receive free nicotine replacement therapy and counseling as part of the quitline services. The one- and three-call coaching intervention groups additionally received the Contemplation Ladder as a visual aid for education on readiness to quit.</p><sec><title>Control group</title><p>Participants assigned to the control group (<italic>n = </italic>235) received no additional treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Three-call coaching intervention group</title><p>This condition (<italic>n =</italic> 236) consisted of three proactive telephone sessions delivered by a quitline coach once per week for 3 weeks. The projected duration of each call was 10&#x02013;20 min. The quitline coaches scheduled and conducted all coaching calls, with appointments available between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. CST Monday&#x02013;Friday. Efforts were made to schedule the participant with the same coach for all three sessions. If the participant was unreachable by telephone, a letter was mailed to attempt final contact. The coaches documented call completion and call duration.</p><p>The manualized intervention [<xref rid="cyx050-B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] was adapted for implementation within a quitline context (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material</xref> S1). Coaches used behavior change strategies delivered with a motivational interviewing style [<xref rid="cyx050-B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Behavior change techniques used in the intervention manual were independently coded by two authors based on a taxonomy recommended for addiction research [<xref rid="cyx050-B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]; inter-rater agreement 92% (<xref ref-type="table" rid="cyx050-T1">Table I</xref>). The conceptual basis for the intervention was Cohen&#x02019;s theory of social support [<xref rid="cyx050-B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] which postulates that supportive actions promote positive health practices of others by encouraging more effective coping. The types of supportive actions (verbal and non-verbal) taught to participants were correlated with successful smoking cessation [<xref rid="cyx050-B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. These behaviors were instrumental (e.g. providing material aid), informational (e.g. sharing relevant quitline information), and emotional (e.g. expressing empathy, caring, reassurance) [<xref rid="cyx050-B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Supportive behaviors were more likely to predict health outcomes when matched to the demands of the situation (e.g. the smoker&#x02019;s readiness to quit) [<xref rid="cyx050-B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Another important theoretical dimension is the positive&#x02013;negative nature of supportive behaviors [<xref rid="cyx050-B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Increasing positive behaviors (e.g. encouragement) while avoiding negative behaviors (e.g. nagging) is consistently associated with change in smoking behaviors. Further, based on the substance abuse treatment literature [<xref rid="cyx050-B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], another theoretical dimension is the support person&#x02019;s self-behaviors&#x02014;those that maintain well-being and morale (e.g. acceptance that the smoker may not seek help). The intervention goal was for support persons to encourage their smoker to call the quitline. Although not assessed, support persons were also taught to recognize any step made by the smoker toward quitting as progress such as expressing interest in what the quitline offers.

For quality assurance, CSRs were trained on-site; test calls were conducted by study staff, along with quarterly refresher trainings conducted by National Jewish Health.</p><p>Smokers enrolling into the QUITPLAN Helpline received the same services provided to all Minnesota residents. This consisted of free written materials, up to five telephone coaching sessions (15&#x02013;20 min each), and the option to receive unlimited text messaging and e-mail support over a 6-month period. Smokers could also receive free nicotine replacement therapy (patches, lozenges or gum) by mail, along with information on other cessation medications that could be prescribed by the smoker&#x02019;s physician, if appropriate. For smokers not ready to quit, coaches provided interventions to help resolve ambivalence about quitting smoking.</p></sec><sec><title>Measures</title><sec><title>Non-smoker demographics</title><p>A questionnaire documented participant demographics (e.g. age, gender, race/ethnicity) and tobacco use characteristics at baseline.</p></sec><sec><title>Smoker information (baseline proxy data)</title><p>On the baseline questionnaire, participants completed questions regarding their smoker&#x02019;s gender, age and race; and were asked to characterize their smoker&#x02019;s level of readiness to quit using the Contemplation Ladder [<xref rid="cyx050-B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The Ladder, adapted for use with proxies [<xref rid="cyx050-B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="cyx050-B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup3">Supplementary Material</xref> S3), operates as an 11-point Likert scale from the smoker having no thoughts of quitting to being engaged in action to change one&#x02019;s smoking behavior. One study [<xref rid="cyx050-B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] found that Contemplation Ladder scores of support people and smokers were moderately correlated (<italic>r</italic> = .45, <italic>P</italic> = 0.001), indicating that support people&#x02019;s reports of smokers&#x02019; readiness to quit are reasonably accurate.</p></sec><sec><title>Primary outcome: smoker quitline enrollment</title><p>The primary endpoint was the proportion of participants&#x02019; smokers enrolling in the quitline during the interval from randomization through 7-month follow-up&#x02014;which is consistent with clinical trials evaluating quitlines [<xref rid="cyx050-B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Quitline enrollment was documented by the CSRs. Only calls to the study-specific number were captured. Thus, if a smoker called the general quitline number, the enrollment rates would be underestimated. Once the smoker enrolled, no other data were collected from the quitline for purposes of this study. As a secondary endpoint the proportion of smokers enrolling by 1-month follow-up was also examined.</p></sec><sec><title>Secondary outcome: SPM completed by non-smokers</title><p>Participants completed the 22-item SPM [<xref rid="cyx050-B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] at baseline and both follow-ups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup4">Supplementary Material</xref> S3). The SPM was developed based on our theoretical framework to include instrumental (e.g. &#x02018;engage in smoke-free activity with your smoker&#x02019;), emotional (e.g. &#x02018;acknowledge that quitting is hard&#x02019;), and informational (e.g. &#x02018;provide your smoker with information about quitting or medications that can help&#x02019;) support behaviors and items that apply, irrespective of the smoker&#x02019;s readiness to quit. Also included are self-behaviors such as modeling how to cope with stress and showing understanding for the changes associated with smoking. Respondents indicated if each behavior occurred (i.e. &#x02018;Yes&#x02019; or &#x02018;No&#x02019;) over the past 2-week period. The SPM demonstrated high internal consistency (alpha = 0.73) in a prior study [<xref rid="cyx050-B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. For the current baseline sample, Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha = 0.74. Factor analysis indicated the scale was best characterized by two factors [<xref rid="cyx050-B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The first factor (Smoker subscale) comprises 17 items emphasizing behaviors primarily done to help the smoker, e.g. &#x02018;Asked your smoker if they were willing to discuss their smoking&#x02019;. The second factor (Self subscale) comprises five items emphasizing behaviors the support person could do for him or herself, e.g. &#x02018;Modeled how to cope with stress by relaxing, taking a break, taking a walk or calling a friend&#x02019;. These factors indicated different functions of support were associated with different behaviors, and thus we examined treatment differences on changes in addition to the total SPM score.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>To assess the adequacy of the randomization, baseline demographics were compared between treatment groups using the chi-square (exact) test for categorical variables and analysis of variance (Kruskal-Wallis) test for continuous variables. The percentage of participants completing each follow-up (retention) was compared across groups using the chi-square test. Logistic regression was utilized to examine baseline characteristics (<xref ref-type="table" rid="cyx050-T2">Table II</xref>) associated with retention at month 7, adjusting for treatment group. The chi-square test was used to examine treatment differences on the proportion of participants&#x02019; smokers enrolled in the quitline at 1 and 7 months follow-up, using an intent-to-treat analysis; i.e. all randomized participants (<italic>n =</italic> 704) were included. Logistic regression was used to compare each treatment group to the control condition. A per protocol analysis was also done including smokers whose support person completed the 7-month follow-up assessment. The SPM score at 1-month follow-up was added to these models to assess support provided as a potential mediator of treatment effects on quitline utilization. Logistic regression was used to examine baseline characteristics associated with smoker enrollment in the quitline at 7 months. The first model included the characteristic and treatment group as predictors of quitline enrollment; the second model additionally included the interaction term to assess if the effect of the characteristic was different across treatment groups. The mean change in SPM score (total and subscale scores) at each follow-up was compared between treatment groups using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with the baseline score as a covariate. All analyses used two-sided tests with <italic>P</italic> &#x02264; 0.050 used to denote statistical significance.

No significant associations were detected between quitline utilization and support person: gender, race, marital status, employment, education, tobacco use history, type of relationship to the smoker, residing with the smoker or SPM score; or smoker: gender, age or race. Adjusting for treatment group, older age of the non-smoker (OR = 1.02, 95% CI: 1.01&#x02013;1.04, <italic>P</italic> = 0.009) and higher Contemplation Ladder score of the smoker (OR = 1.19, 95% CI: 1.07&#x02013;1.32, <italic>P</italic> = 0.001) were associated with increased likelihood of smoker enrollment in the quitline. To illustrate the later finding, the rate of quitline enrollment was 7% (13/194) for smokers with low levels of readiness to quit, 12% (40/321) for those with medium levels, and 16% (30/184) for those with high readiness. However, there was no interaction effect detected between Contemplation Ladder score and treatment group on quitline enrollment (<italic>P</italic> = 0.71). Thus, the effect of treatment group on quitline enrollment was not dependent on the smokers&#x02019; baseline readiness to quit; i.e. no moderation effect.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This RCT found that coaching interventions for non-smokers can be successfully conducted within a &#x02018;real world&#x02019; quitline setting, and just one call is effective for increasing quitline enrollment among smokers. The information and skills learned within one brief session may be sufficient for non-smokers, without the added contact time and counselor support being necessary (unlike clinical trials enrolling smokers where providing more treatment corresponds to better outcomes) [<xref rid="cyx050-B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Previous studies of social support interventions have not been uniformly effective [<xref rid="cyx050-B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="cyx050-B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] but most were conducted among smokers already engaged in treatment. Because the majority of smokers are not ready to quit in the next month [<xref rid="cyx050-B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="cyx050-B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="cyx050-B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], targeting the social support network is a promising avenue to reach smokers on a population level. Encouragingly, we observed the treatment effect on quitline enrollment was consistent across smoker levels of quitting readiness.</p><p>One of the strengths of this translational work is that the effectiveness of the three-call intervention on smoker quitline enrollment (15%) was similar to the original efficacy trial in which the coaching was delivered by research staff (16%) [<xref rid="cyx050-B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Other strengths are the use of an experimental design [<xref rid="cyx050-B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]; verified quitline utilization by smokers [<xref rid="cyx050-B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]; use of theoretically-based, well-specified manuals to enhance replicability of the intervention method [<xref rid="cyx050-B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]; treatments delivered by real-world quitline coaches with high fidelity; inclusion of quality control procedures; and very good rates of participant treatment completion and follow-up retention.</p><p>This study does have limitations. We did not assess the potential downstream effect of this approach on quitting or the level of engagement in the quitline program after the smoker enrolled&#x02014;such as use of pharmacotherapy. The interventions were designed to motivate smoker calls to the quitline. This outcome, consistent with a phase-based framework recommended for advancing the science of tobacco treatment [<xref rid="cyx050-B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], was achieved. Nonetheless, it is possible that smokers enrolling in a quitline, as prompted by a support person, may be a select group compared to smokers initiating cessation treatment on their own with very different quitting outcomes. Another limitation is that all smoker information at baseline was from proxy reports with unknown reliability. Thus, as the next step, we plan to attempt to engage and incentivize smokers to complete assessments to measure the potential impact of this approach on quitting and to directly assess smoker characteristics such as heaviness of smoking.</p><p>Another limitation was that it is unclear how the interventions worked because support provided by the non-smoker as measured by the SPM did not appear to account for the treatment effects on quitline utilization. Thus, alternative constructs of social support could be considered in future research to better understand the mechanisms of the intervention effect such as, social control and autonomy support provided [<xref rid="cyx050-B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="cyx050-B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Potential theory-based mechanisms that could also be explored among the smokers including support received and enhanced coping [<xref rid="cyx050-B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="cyx050-B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p><p>Some sample characteristics limited generalizability and potential impact of the intervention, i.e. 85% female, 95% White, and highly educated non-smokers. Finally, the sample size recruited was less than originally targeted. However, the observed treatment differences were statistically significant even with a smaller sample size.</p><p>Despite these limitations, the results provide evidence for tobacco cessation quitlines&#x02014;a treatment available in all 50 states via 1-800-Quit-Now. The North American Quitline Consortium [<xref rid="cyx050-B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] reported that about 5% of &#x0223c;500 000 annual quitline callers (25 000) were individuals calling on behalf of a loved one who smokes; these calls are unsolicited. Findings from this study provide real-world guidance for the first time to quitlines on the types of coaching that may aid non-smokers in linking their family members and friends to quitline services. Quitlines could elect to advertise the availability of such coaching targeting non-smokers though a &#x02018;Help a Loved One Quit&#x02019; campaign or other promotional activities [<xref rid="cyx050-B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. These marketing efforts could leverage the enormous potential of online social networks [<xref rid="cyx050-B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="cyx050-B40" ref-type="bibr">40&#x02013;42</xref>]. The cost to the Minnesota quitline to implement this one-call intervention (not recruitment) was $60, including the coaching session and 10&#x02013;12 min of subsequent documentation. A standard quitline call was $38; however, the one-call support person intervention was $60 due to the extended length of the call, and the cost for the three-call intervention was $135 (same rationale). The cost is very reasonable in light of the finding that one call was associated with essentially a doubling of the rate of smoker enrollment in the quitline beyond written materials&#x02014;currently the &#x02018;standard of care&#x02019; provided by most state quitlines [<xref rid="cyx050-B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Although on average the one- and three-call interventions were not time intensive it is important to note the wide range of session durations and thus implementing the interventions on a wide scale basis would require greater standardization of intervention delivery among quitline coaches.</p><p>An important next step for this line of research is to understand how the interventions apply to underserved populations as cultural and family differences may influence how support is received (acceptability) and effectiveness [<xref rid="cyx050-B44" ref-type="bibr">44&#x02013;47</xref>]. The emerging use of mobile technologies such as text messaging in low-income populations offers novel opportunities to deliver the support person interventions [<xref rid="cyx050-B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This real-world quitline study found that coaching interventions targeting non-smokers can result in significant increases in the rates that a smoker enrolls in a quitline. Just one session yielded results essentially equal to having three calls. These results provide early guidance for quitlines that want to expand their services to offer an efficient (one call) intervention to help non-smokers link their family members and friends to quitline services. Our two studies&#x02014;one an efficacy trial, the other an effectiveness trial&#x02014;showed brief coaching delivered to non-smokers significantly increased quitline enrollment among smokers and would seem to constitute a basis for broad adoption of such a program by quitlines.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary data</title><p>
