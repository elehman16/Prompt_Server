Clinical studies of gradual conversion to ESL 1,200 and 1,600 mg QD monotherapies were previously conducted in patients with POS who were not well-controlled by 1 or 2 AEDs. This report describes modeling and simulation of plasma eslicarbazepine (primary active metabolite of ESL) concentrations and time to monotherapy study exit to predict efficacy for conversion to ESL monotherapy at a lower dose of 800 mg, as an option for patients requiring or not tolerating higher doses since this regimen is effective in adjunctive therapy for POS.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and methods</title><p>A previously developed population pharmacokinetic model for ESL monotherapy was used to predict minimum plasma eslicarbazepine concentration (<italic>C</italic><sub>min</sub>) in 1,500 virtual patients taking 1 (n=1,000) or 2 (n=500) AEDs at baseline, treated with ESL 400 mg QD for 1 week, followed by 800 mg QD for 17 weeks (similar to ESL monotherapy trials where the other AEDs were withdrawn during the first 6 weeks following titration to the randomized ESL dose). Model-predicted <italic>C</italic><sub>min</sub> as a time-varying covariate and number of baseline AEDs were used to determine the weekly probability of each patient meeting exit criteria (65.3% threshold) indicative of worsening seizure control in 500 simulated ESL monotherapy trials. A previously developed extended Cox proportional hazards exposure&#x02013;response model was used to relate time-varying eslicarbazepine exposure to the time to study exit.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>For virtual patients receiving ESL monotherapy (800 mg QD), the 95% upper prediction limit for exit rate at 112 days of 34.9% in patients taking 1 AED at baseline was well below the 65.3% threshold from historical control trials, while the estimate for patients taking 2 AEDs (70.6%) was slightly above the historical control threshold.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This model-based assessment supports conversion to ESL 800 mg QD monotherapy for POS in adults taking 1 AED. For patients taking 2 concomitant AEDs, however, prescribers should consider maintenance doses of 1,200 or 1,600 mg ESL QD to reduce the likelihood of seizure worsening if conversion to ESL monotherapy is contemplated.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>eslicarbazepine</kwd><kwd>monotherapy</kwd><kwd>simulations</kwd><kwd>antiepileptic</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Eslicarbazepine acetate (ESL, Aptiom<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc., Marlborough, MA, USA; Zebinix<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, BIAL &#x02013; Portela &#x00026; C<sup>a</sup>, S.A., S.

To illustrate the predictive ability of the model, <xref ref-type="table" rid="t3-cpaa-9-065">Table 3</xref> provides the observed overall study exit rates from the Phase 3 trials and the cor-responding model-predicted study exit rates at Day 112 for the 1,200 and 1,600 mg regimens (assuming the median <italic>C</italic><sub>min</sub> for each dose group) by baseline number of AEDs. There is good concordance between the observed and model-predicted study exit rates for the 1,200 and 1,600 mg doses, thus demonstrating that the time to study exit model was unbiased and predicted the data well, except for a slight underprediction bias of the 1,200 mg regimen with 2 baseline AEDs.</p><p>When the baseline survival based on the 1,200 and 1,600 mg dose groups in the Phase 3 trials was used to simulate outcomes with 800 mg QD, the predicted study exit rate was similar to that of the 1,200 mg QD dose regimen (21%). In order to simulate responses for the lower dose regimen of 800 mg that were more predictive of the expected higher risk associated with a lower dose, the baseline survival (risk over time) was adjusted by an empirical factor of 1.75 ([1200 + 1600]/2 = 1400 mg/800 mg) for extrapolation of the lower dose regimen.</p><p>Simulated median exit rates (95% prediction intervals) at 112 days for virtual patients receiving ESL monotherapy at a dose of 800 mg QD were 34.9% (32.0%&#x02013;37.9%) for patients taking 1 AED at baseline and 66.6% (62.4%&#x02013;70.6%) for those taking 2 AEDs at baseline.

However, the 95% upper limit for the exit rate at 112 days for those patients taking 2 AEDs at baseline (ie, 70.6%) was above the historical control threshold as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-cpaa-9-065">Figure 2</xref>.

In this analysis, predicted study exit rates for subjects converting from 1 or 2 AEDs for treatment of POS to ESL monotherapy using a dosing regimen of ESL 800 mg QD were evaluated. Even when considering the worst-case scenario, the 95% upper prediction limit for the exit rate at 112 days was below the 65.3% threshold for patients taking 1 AED at baseline (37.9%) but above the threshold for those taking 2 AEDs at baseline (70.6%). This difference in predicted exit rates between patients converting from 1 versus 2 AEDs is not unexpected given this patient population with refractory partial epilepsy. It is likely that patients who had received 2 AEDs had required more drug in an effort to provide adequate seizure control, consistent with the presence of more treatment refractory dis-ease, relative to those subjects who received 1 baseline AED.<xref rid="b15-cpaa-9-065" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> It should be noted that patients receiving 2 AEDs at baseline were only included in the Phase 3 monotherapy trials if they were not receiving maximum doses of both drugs, otherwise one might expect the likelihood of success to be even lower, thereby requiring higher doses of ESL. This consideration is somewhat hypothetical, as it would not be anticipated that a patient receiving maximum doses of 2 antiepileptics in a clinical practice setting would be considered to convert to monotherapy.</p><p>In the simulations, study exit rate was predicted every other week to be consistent with the protocol-specified study visits scheduled according to defined study periods in the design of the ESL monotherapy clinical trials. To assess whether the frequency of study exit rate prediction influenced the simulation results, alternative frequencies of prediction (eg, every week) were also evaluated. However, the findings from testing of these other prediction frequencies indicated that the use of frequencies of assessment other than every other week had little influence on the simulation results.</p><p>Prior to incorporation of the empirical dose-related adjustment to the baseline survival distribution, initial simulations resulted in an apparent overprediction of efficacy from the eslicarbazepine 800 mg QD regimen such that the predicted exit rate at 112 days was similar to the observed rate for the 1,200 mg dose regimen. While model-based extrapolation is fraught with some inherent risk of inappropriate conclusion, after consideration of the marginal contributions of the baseline survival distribution, the number of AEDs at baseline, and the effect of eslicarbazepine exposure on the predicted survival probability from the time-to-event model, it was determined that the baseline survival distribution likely exerted a greater influence on the model than eslicarbazepine exposure. This may be due to the use of data from only 2 dose levels (ie, 1,200 and 1,600 mg QD) with overlapping exposure distributions in the development of the time-to-event model. Therefore, the baseline survival distribution required some adjustment to achieve logical and expected results for the 800 mg QD regimen. Although there would be no a priori expectation that the baseline survival distribution would differ based on randomized dose, the observed baseline survival distribution differed for the 1,200 and 1,600 mg QD dose groups. As such, sensitivity analyses were performed to select an empirical adjustment factor for the baseline survival distribution, appropriate for the 800 mg QD regimen. Ultimately, a factor of 1.75 was selected for the baseline survival distribution for 800 mg QD relative to the 1,200 and 1,600 mg regimens (consistent with the ratio of the average of the observed doses to the 800 mg dose) to extrapolate the model to appropriately simulate responses for the lower-dose regimen.</p><p>Overall, this simulation analysis was associated with several limitations that required assumptions to be made as described above. The risk of study exit over time (baseline survival) was dependent on the observed data, but it was shown that the observed and model-predicted study exit rate exhibited reasonable concordance. Since no actual observed data were available after administration of ESL 800 mg QD, an empirical adjustment of the baseline survival was required to allow for extrapolation to the lower 800 mg dosage regimen. In addition, predicted study exit rates for the ESL dose regimens were compared to the rate historical controls rather than actual placebo-treated subjects in the ESL conversion to monotherapy trials. This approach was considered the standard of practice at the time these studies were conducted.<xref rid="b7-cpaa-9-065" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Overall, the results of the simulations provide evidence that conversion to ESL 800 mg QD monotherapy may be possible for adults with POS who are taking 1 AED. Patients who are taking 2 AEDs are predicted to be more likely to meet the monotherapy clinical trial exit criteria (due to seizure worsening) when converted to a simulated 800 mg maintenance dose, so maintenance doses of ESL 1,200 or 1,600 mg QD should be considered if conversion from 2 AEDs to ESL monotherapy is contemplated. Since these results are based on clinical trials specifically designed to convert patients from their prior AED therapy to ESL monotherapy, the dosing recommendations provided herein should not be extrapolated for use in patients receiving ESL 800 mg QD monotherapy as initial treatment of POS.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors appreciated the insightful review of this manuscript provided by Raju Poola, MS, PhD, Associate Director, Sunovion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
