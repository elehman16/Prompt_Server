Similarly, specific early neonatal complications are also linked to gaps in documentation: prematurity/low birth weight (GA calculation) and birth asphyxia (identifying the need for resuscitation).</p><p>The strengths of this study include the large sample size, the prospective nature of data collection, the quasi-experimental study design, and data on a large number of parameters routinely used in clinical decision-making. Validation of some of these parameters also yielded valuable insights. Calculation of correct GA was low due to a failure of reconciliation of abdominal examination findings with LMPs reported by the women. The EDD documentation proportion was seen to be high owing to undue reliance on antenatal ultrasonogram reports, irrespective of their timing during pregnancy, instead of individual calculation.</p><p>During the run-in period of 4 months, we had noticed that &#x0003e; 65% of women in intervention sites had &#x0201c;examination of fourth stage&#x0201d; parameters being ticked off (without their actual performance). Subsequently, with the reiteration of the importance of documenting only on task completion, there was lower documentation rate during the study period, probably reflecting actual practice patterns. There was also a corresponding diminishing difference between control and intervention sites observed from the first to the last quarters. In our study, plotting of partograph was observed to be higher than noted elsewhere<sup><xref rid="bibr24-2333392816647605" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> partly because of retrospective filling in, as reported by the nurses.</p><p>The proportion of case sheets with a correct GA calculation increased from 15% in the first quarter to 33% in the last quarter. Similarly, proportion with abdominal examination findings (comprising fundal height, presentation, and contraction) doubled from 10% in the first quarter to 20% in the last quarter. These findings offered some face validity of a dose&#x02013;response relationship. Lack of substantial changes for some elements such as fourth-stage monitoring was attributed to staffing shortages in the delivery room; others such as failure to identify newborns eligible for resuscitation were attributed to difficulties in mastering neonatal asphyxia diagnosis and management.</p><p>Chart abstraction to study quality of care is not without limitations. It is possible that items recorded on charts may be false without never really having occurred or that only a proportion of activities actually performed may be captured in the records.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-2333392816647605" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> It was also possible there was some &#x0201c;contamination&#x0201d; of the control arm owing to the use of a common set of research assistants. In addition, our study design of concurrent evaluation may not have provided sufficient time for a &#x0201c;culture of documentation&#x0201d; to set in. There are also limitations to attribution that can arise from the use of a nonrandomized study design though we had matched facilities to minimize bias. Also, our choice of 67% as cutoff for studying completeness of charting was arbitrary. Further, information from record review would need to be complemented with other methods such as clinical vignettes, standardized patients, direct observations, and administrative data to better understand the process of delivery of care.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-2333392816647605" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="bibr25-2333392816647605" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> In addition, our selection of study hospitals, though typical of mid-tier subdistrict hospitals in Karnataka, may not be fully representative for the entire state or country. The concurrent nature of the intervention rollout along with simultaneous data collection precluded the identification of the relative contribution of the baseline training component and the ongoing mentoring component of the intervention to the adoption and maintenance of the documentation system. And finally, information on the impact of the intervention on maternal and neonatal outcomes, not presented here, would be far more compelling.</p><p>In summary, it can be concluded that a structured delivery record can be introduced in nonteaching hospitals over a &#x0201c;run-in&#x0201d; period of a few months followed by collection of reliable and robust information for improving maternal and neonatal care. Such care offered by facility staff can be captured with varying levels of completeness that can help identify easy-to-achieve fields and those that require more sustained training efforts. Further research should also help delineate the relative contribution of the different intervention components to the deployment and sustainability of such a documentation system. In the meantime, institution of a reliable and valid documentation system appears to be a critical prerequisite of plans to improve the quality of maternal and newborn care in health facilities.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors acknowledge the support of the National Health Mission-Karnataka and the Department of Health &#x00026; Family Welfare, Government of Karnataka in the project.
