on pain, lumbar range of motion (LROM) and functional disability of patients with chronic
non-specific low back pain (LBP). [Subjects and Methods] Fifty-two subjects who were aged
between 20&#x02013;69 years old, who presented with LBP of more than 3 months duration with a
numerical rating scale (NRS) value of at least 4 were randomly assigned to treatment (BCP)
and control (CON) groups. Participants in each group received six sessions of the 30
minutes treatment for two weeks. The BCP group was asked to wear the BCP during the
daytime during the study period. Pain, lumbar ROM and functional disability were assessed
before and after the 2-week treatment, and at the end of a 12-week follow up. [Results]
After the 2-week treatment and 12-week follow up, all outcomes had improved in both
groups; the BCP group had maintained the decrease in pain intensity and improved lumbar
ROM in the extension position after the 12-week follow up, and showed better improvements
in all outcomes at 2 weeks and after the 12-week follow up. [Conclusion] BCP combined with
physical therapy had better pain, lumbar ROM and functional disability outcomes than
physical therapy alone.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Lower back support</kwd><kwd>Chronic low back pain</kwd><kwd>Numerical rating scale</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Low back pain (LBP) is the most common problem in the world and is a major cause of
disability, and work absenteeism, and has a high cost of treatment. A recent study reported
the one year prevalence of LBP is more than 80%, and 10&#x02013;20% of cases develop into chronic
LBP<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. A cause of non-specific LBP is
tension, soreness and/or stiffness in the lower back region for which it is not easy to
identify a specific cause of pain. Several structures in the back, including the joints,
discs and connective tissues, may be causes of LBP symptoms<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. An abnormal curvature of spine is associated with chronic
non-specific LBP symptoms<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, an
important way of relieving and preventing LBP symptoms is suggested to be maintenance of the
appropriate spine curvature of the lower back<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>There are many potential treatments for LBP. We previously reported that physical therapy
including exercise and massage is an effective treatment for the release of muscle
stiffness, amelioration of pain, and improvement of physical functions<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Physical therapy can provide beneficial effects for muscle
relaxation and the spinal alignment in LBP. In addition to the treatment of physical
therapy, instrument can be provided to support the lumbar spine and to reduce and prevent
LBP symptoms, and lumbar support is frequently used to treat patients with LBP<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Appropriate lumbar lordosis decreases disc
pressure by changing the distribution of the load between the disc and apophyseal joints and
also reduces the tension in the intervertebral ligaments that can cause disc
degeneration<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Wearing a lumbar support may increase intra-abdominal pressure
that can decrease disc pressure, limit disc compression, and reduce disc pain<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. To create a better back supporter, the
lumbar spinal curvature of an individual should be considered. A back care pillow (BCP) was
designed to support the lumbar spine following the recommendation of a previous study.
Measurements of lumbar spinal curvature in the normal population have shown that lumbar
spinal curvature differs among age groups and genders<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, there is lack of evidence to support the effect of a BCP
in the treatment of chronic non-specific LBP patients. The aim of this study was to
investigate the effects of a BCP on pain, ROM and the functional disability of patients with
chronic non-specific LBP.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>A randomized control trial was conducted with chronic non-specific LBP patients, who were
assigned to receive a standard physical therapy treatment plus BCP or only physical therapy
treatment. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee for Human Research of Khon Kaen
University (Protocol No. HE552347) and it was prospectively registered with the United
States Clinical Trials Registry (NCT01911806).</p><p>Patients were diagnosed as having chronic nonspecific LBP by medical doctors at the
Department of Physical Therapy, Phiboonmungsaharn hospital, Thailand. Each patient was given
a personal interview by a research assistant who had one year&#x02019;s experience in orthopedic
physical therapy and a physical examination by a medical doctor. Participants aged between
20&#x02013;69 years old who presented with LBP for more than three months and had moderate to severe
pain on a numerical rating scale (score &#x02265; 4) were eligible. Participants who had underlying
systematic or visceral diseases, specific conditions such as neoplasm, ankylosing
spondylitis, previous low back surgery, cauda equina syndrome, nerve root symptoms, or
pregnancy were excluded.</p><p>The estimated sample size was calculated, based on the result of a pilot study. The
standard deviation of the pain score (numeric rating scale: NRS) after treatment of both
groups was used to calculate the sample size for a power of 80% at 5% significance and a
drop-out rate of 20% was allowed for the estimate on of the final sample size. The required
sample size was 26 subjects per group.</p><p>The patients who met the above inclusion criteria were randomly allocated to receive either
the treatment with physical therapy alone (control group, CG), or the treatment with
physical therapy and BCP (BCP group) using stratified random allocation by age group (group
1 = 20&#x02013;29 years old, group 2 = 30&#x02013;39 years old and group 3 = 40&#x02013;69 years old) with block
sizes of 2, 4 and 6. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Figure 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Procedural flow and follow-up chart</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jpts-27-2035-g001"/></fig> shows the design of the procedural flow and follow-up.

put his thumbs on the inferior margin of the posterior superior iliac spine. An ink mark was
drawn along the midline of the lumbar spine horizontal to the posterior superior iliac spine
(lower landmark). While the examiner held the tape firmly against the skin, he marked a
second line 15&#x02005;cm above the original one (higher landmark). Then, the subject was asked to
do an active anterior flexion of the trunk without increasing the pain. The new distance
between the lower and higher landmarks was measured. The subject returned to the neutral
position. The difference in the initial distance between the skin markings in the neutral
position and the measurement in the flexion position was used to indicate the amount of
lumbar flexion. After each measurement, the skin marks were removed by rubbing with alcohol
to ensure blinding of the next examiner to the landmarks<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Functional disability was measured using the Thai version of the Roland-Morris Disability
Questionnaire (RMDQ). This assesses perceived limitations in 24 activities of daily living,

outcome measures between the two treatment groups and to estimate the adjusted mean
differences and the 95% confidence intervals of each outcome measure in each group. For

(<xref rid="tbl_002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). In the comparison of the groups,
the BCP group showed more improvement in functional disability than the CG (<xref rid="tbl_003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>This study demonstrated that BCP plus physical therapy for chronic non-specific LBP
decreased pain intensity, improved LROM and functional disability better than standard
physical therapy after 2 weeks of treatment and at the end of a 12-week follow up. BCP
maintained the decrease in pain intensity and the improvement in LROM in the extension
position for 12 weeks after the 2-week treatment.</p><p>In the comparison of the BCP group and CG, a clinically significant difference was found
between the two groups in pain reduction. A mean difference in the NRS of greater than 2 is
generally considered the minimum acceptable when looking for a significant clinical
difference between groups<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. The clinical findings of the present study are similar to
those of Calmels et al.<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup> who used a lumbar
belt for patients with LBP. They found a decrease in pain intensity and RMDQ at 30 and 90
days after treatment in the intervention group. These improvements in RMDQ were clinically
important changes in RMDQ<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. Other studies have also shown that the pain intensity and
the functional status improved in patients with LBP who used a lumbar support for over 12
months; however, there were no significant clinical changes.</p><p>The benefits of BCP are possibly explained by mechanisms through which BCP maintain an
appropriate lumbar curvature, preserving normal lumbar curve stability, and adaptation of
muscle activity to the appropriate lumbar curve. This mechanism may also decrease back
muscle spasms<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, the
appropriate lordotic curve may decrease intra-disc pressure by changing the distribution of
loads between discs<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. Decreased pressure
on the apophyseal joints may decrease disc degeneration decreasing pain in the apophyseal
joints<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. The effect on spinal
structure may also improve pain intensity; however, the lumbar range of motion provided no
evidence to support our hypothesis of decreased pressure on the apophyseal joints.</p><p>Limitations of the present study were the small sample size, even though the sample size
was calculated based on a pilot study. Further studies will need to investigate different
populations, e.g. office workers, for longer periods. Finally, the mechanisms underlying the
beneficial effects of BCP also need to be determined.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The study was supported by the Faculty of Associated Medical Science, Research Center in
