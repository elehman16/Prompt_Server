Up to 20&#x000a0;% of patients remain dissatisfied after knee arthroplasty, despite the apparent technical success of the operation. Recent studies suggest that the fulfilment of patients&#x02019; expectations plays an important role in achieving satisfaction. Thus, addressing preoperative expectations more explicitly might improve patient satisfaction. The primary aim of the present study is to investigate the effect of a multidisciplinary, goal attained and individualized rehabilitation on satisfaction of activities of younger patients (&#x0003c;65&#x000a0;years) after knee arthroplasty.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>A single-centre randomized controlled trial will be conducted. In total, 120 patients (&#x0003c;65&#x000a0;years of age) with knee osteoarthritis who will undergo knee arthroplasty, will be randomly allocated to either goal attainment scaling rehabilitation or usual care rehabilitation. Goal attainment scaling rehabilitation includes drafting individually set rehabilitation goals preoperatively and measuring progress of rehabilitation on a six-point scale (-3 to +2). The primary outcome is patient satisfaction concerning activities in daily life, work and leisure time, including sports. Secondary outcome measures include KOOS, OKS, SQUASH and WORQ questionnaires and activity objectively measured with the Activ8&#x000ae; activity monitor.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The findings of this study will help to elucidate whether goal attainment scaling is an effective rehabilitation method for achieving higher levels of patient satisfaction, with a focus on activities, in younger patients after knee arthroplasty.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>This trial is since June 15<sup>th</sup> 2015 registered at the Dutch Trial Register: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.trialregister.nl/trialreg/admin/rctview.asp?TC=5251">NTR5251</ext-link>.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Knee Osteoarthritis</kwd><kwd>Rehabilitation</kwd><kwd>Physiotherapy</kwd><kwd>Satisfaction</kwd><kwd>Activity</kwd><kwd>Goal attainment scaling</kwd><kwd>Randomized controlled trial</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003142</institution-id><institution>Fonds NutsOhra</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1403-026</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Witjes</surname><given-names>Suzanne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common chronic disease causing pain and disability among adults. In particular, the incidence of knee OA is high [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In the Netherlands, 594,000 persons suffer from knee OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Due to several external factors, such as aging of the population, epidemic obesity and secondary post-traumatic joint OA mainly caused by sports injuries, the prevalence of knee OA is expected to increase drastically in the Western world. At the same time, knee OA patients are becoming younger [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>Knee arthroplasty (KA), both total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and unicondylar knee arthroplasty (UKA), has proven to be a reliable form of treatment to relieve pain, improve function and enhance health-related quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Following the increasing prevalence of knee OA, the demand for KA is expected to rise worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In the Netherlands for example, an increase of 297&#x000a0;% of KAs from 2005 to 2030 is projected, with up to 57,900 KAs performed annually by 2030 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Despite the aforementioned benefits of KA, 17&#x02013;20&#x000a0;% of patients remain dissatisfied after surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In most of these cases, no implant-related mechanical failure can be found. The younger group of patients appears to expect to be more active and be able to perform more diverse activities after KA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. These high preoperative expectations itself do not predict satisfaction after joint replacement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], but <italic>fulfilment</italic> of these patient expectations clearly seems to play an important role in patient satisfaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Current described percentages of fulfilment of expectations after KA range from 100&#x000a0;% satisfaction regarding knee pain alleviation to only about 20&#x000a0;% concerning the ability to participate in sports and leisure activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Although younger and more active patients may have higher expectations regarding activities, the expectations across patients vary highly for daily life, work and leisure time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Patients expect to be able to return to work, but a recent study showed that the number of patients returning to work after KA is limited (&#x0003c;70&#x000a0;%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Concerning leisure time activities, a recent systematic review showed that return to intermediate- to high-impact sports is actually possible, and even more likely after UKA than after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. However, the literature suggests that patients often do not actually participate in functional levels of sports after KA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Kersten et al. described that almost half of KA patients did not meet health-enhancing physical activity guidelines, and they were less active as a normative group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>Although the provision of postoperative physical therapy is almost universal, rehabilitation is the most understudied area concerning KA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. While short-term improvements of functional results with physiotherapy (PT) and exercise therapy after KA are shown in a recent systematic review, several aspects concerning rehabilitation after KA are unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Recent surveys among physiotherapists showed that currently a great variety of PT methods is being used to attain patient goals in rehabilitation after KA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>Considering the diverse expectations of this younger patient population on the one hand, and the importance of PT as part of rehabilitation on the other hand, the primary aim of the present study is to evaluate the effect of a multidisciplinary, goal attained and individualized rehabilitation on satisfaction of activities in daily life, work and leisure time including sports of younger patients (&#x0003c;65&#x000a0;years) after KA. The hypothesis is that multidisciplinary, goal attained and individualized rehabilitation, where patients&#x02019; goals are explicitly established and the feasibility of these goals is discussed and evaluated preoperatively, will result in higher patient satisfaction concerning these three domains compared to usual care physiotherapy rehabilitation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>CONSORT</title><p>In the description of our study design, we follow the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT statement) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Ethical principles</title><p>The study will be conducted according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki (59th World Medical Association General Assembly, Seoul, October 2008) and in accordance with the Medical Research Involving Human Subjects Act (WMO). Ethical approval has been received from the Medical Research Ethics Committee of the Academic Medical Center (AMC) Amsterdam. Patients will not be exposed to any potentially harmful procedures or therapies. No additional risks or discomfort are expected compared to standard rehabilitation. We only ask patients to fill in additional questionnaires preoperatively, after 3&#x000a0;months, after 6&#x000a0;months and after 1&#x000a0;year. This will take approximately 30 &#x02013; 45&#x000a0;min. The online questionnaires can be completed at home at a convenient moment. In this way, we hope to minimize the extra burden for patients. There is no direct (financial) incentive for patients to participate in this trial. Patients&#x02019; motivation derives from the possible identification of a new treatment method that might benefit all future KA patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Study design</title><p>The goAl attainment sCaling for knee arThroplasty In yOunger patieNts (ACTION) trial is a single-centre randomized controlled trial.

According to Singer et al. we use a minimal clinical relevant difference of ten points on a VAS scale from 0 to 100 with standard deviation of 15 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Currently, data concerning how younger patients score satisfaction regarding activities in daily life, work and leisure time after KA are lacking. The best prediction can be extracted from the study of Kievit et al., in which young patients participating in a paid job with usual care after a KA scored a mean VAS score of 62 out of 100 points regarding work capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. According to these data, an intervention group has to score at least 72 (out of 100) points. Calculating with a power of 90&#x000a0;%, two-tailed testing with a <italic>p</italic>-value of 0.05, and standard deviation of 15 results in a minimum of 98 participants, 49 in the intervention group and 49 in the control group (nQuery Advisor&#x000ae; version 7.0). To adjust for 15&#x000a0;% dropouts over the 12&#x000a0;months follow-up period, 120 (60 per group) participants need to be included. It is expected that three patients per week can be included from the three locations of our hospital, so the inclusion period will cover approximately 40&#x000a0;weeks.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Recruitment</title><p>All patients presenting to the orthopaedic outdoor clinics of the Amphia hospital in Breda, Oosterhout or Etten-Leur, who are indicated for KA (both TKA and UKA) and who meet inclusion criteria, will be invited to participate in the trial. One of the researchers (AH) will screen the KA waiting list for eligible patients and contact them to check if they are adequately informed and have received patient information. If this was not done initially, the patient will be informed and the patient information forms will be sent instead. If the patient has read the patient information and would like to participate, an appointment will be arranged for an inclusion meeting with the inclusion investigator (AH) on the same day the patient has to come to the hospital for another preoperative appointment (e.g. for visiting the anaesthesiologist or for a preoperative patient instruction meeting). During this inclusion meeting, the remaining questions of the potential participant can be answered. The participant will then sign the informed consent form, and after it has been signed by the investigator as well, the participant will receive a copy of it. The participants will be informed that their participation is voluntary and that they can withdraw from the study at any time. The patient will then be randomized to one of the two treatment arms and further instructions will directly follow in this inclusion meeting.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Randomization and allocation concealment</title><p>Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to usual care physiotherapy rehabilitation or GAS rehabilitation. To conceal randomization, consecutively numbered, sealed, non-transparent envelopes will be prepared by one of the researchers (AH). Envelopes will be sorted in blocks of 10 for TKA patients and UKA patients separately. The envelopes will be stored in a locked location at the Amphia Molengracht. Randomization will take place during the inclusion meeting. By necessity, participants, researchers and physiotherapists are unblinded to group allocation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Intervention</title><p>With patients wanting to participate in a great variety of activities postoperatively, standardized measurement tools do not always suffice in measuring what is relevant for the individual patient. GAS is a scoring method that measures the extent to which a patient&#x02019;s individual goals are achieved by registering these goals on personal scales [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. We will use the quality appraisal criteria for adequate scientific use of GAS scales that were recently suggested by Krasny-Pacini et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] In our study, each goal is rated on a 6-point scale, ranging from -3 up to +2. The current situation is defined as -2 and the achievable goal for the patient after rehabilitation is marked as 0. A decline in performance is rated -3 and improvements are registered as -1, 0, +1 or +2. With GAS, the caregiver will create meaningful and relevant goals in collaboration with the patient. Secondly, these goals will be described at the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) activity and participation level in accordance with the SMART (Specific, Measurable, Acceptable, Realistic and Time-specific) criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. After creating these individual goals, GAS scales have to be created by defining six realistic, distinct levels of outcome for -3, -2, -1, 0, +1 and +2, which will be used when evaluating progression during the rehabilitation. Patients in the intervention group preoperatively create their own rehabilitation goals, in collaboration with the selected and GAS-trained physiotherapist of their choice. Three goals will be set: one concerning a daily life activity, one concerning a work-related activity and one concerning a leisure time activity including sports which the patient wishes to perform better after KA. For these goals, GAS scales that can be used to objectify the progress in attaining these goals during follow-up will be created. Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> shows an example of such a GAS scale.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>GAS scale</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12891_2016_965_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p><p>The multidisciplinary research team will check if the GAS goals and scaling seem to be realistic for that individual patient, taking into account relevant baseline characteristics like age, BMI, comorbidities, preoperative physical activity level (SQUASH) and level of anxiety (HADS). When consensus concerning the rehabilitation goals and GAS scales has been reached, the treating physiotherapist will create an individualized treatment protocol for that individual patient, in accordance with the physiotherapists of the research team. The duration of the rehabilitation protocol may vary across patients but is estimated to be between 3 and 12&#x000a0;months. After KA surgery, standard in-hospital treatment and initial PT rehabilitation will be followed in both treatment groups. After hospital discharge, the patient will follow his/her personalized rehabilitation protocol.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Usual care physiotherapy rehabilitation</title><p>Patients of the control group will follow usual care physiotherapy according to the expert opinion of their treating physiotherapists. Results of our survey among physiotherapists in the area of the Amphia hospital show that &#x02265;95&#x000a0;% of therapists generally work on pain reduction and the improvement of range-of-motion, muscle strength, endurance and gait pattern (Witjes et al: Variable usual care rehabilitation and similar return to sports advice after knee arthroplasty: a survey amongst physiotherapists, submitted).</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Training of intervention physiotherapists performing GAS rehabilitation</title><p>Our multidisciplinary research team, consisting of two orthopaedic surgeons, two physiotherapists, a human movement scientist, a consultant for work-related musculoskeletal disorders and a researcher, followed an accredited course in GAS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The research team will train the participating physiotherapists for the intervention group, which will be randomly selected (on a voluntary basis) from the group of physiotherapists that declared an interest in participating in the previous survey. Throughout the trial they will be guided and supervised by our multidisciplinary research team. To avoid selection bias, physiotherapists who treat patients from the intervention group will not treat patients from the control group and vice versa. In total, GAS-trained physiotherapists will be available at 25 physiotherapy locations where the intervention may take place. Another 30 locations have been selected where patients of the control group can follow usual care physiotherapy rehabilitation. Control group locations will also be randomly selected from the respondents to our previous survey.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Data collection</title><p>Questionnaires will be collected digitally and stored on a password-protected, secured server to which only study staff will have access.

The sum of the items is converted to a 0 &#x02013; 100 score, with 100 being the best score and zero the worst.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The Net Promotor Score (NPS) is a single question asking patients how likely it is that they would recommend their operation (KA) to friends or family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. It is a 0 &#x02013; 10 point scale with zero representing very unlikely and ten very likely. Responses are divided into three groups: 10 &#x02013; 9 are &#x02018;promotors&#x02019;, 8 &#x02013; 7 are &#x02018;passives&#x02019; and 6 &#x02013; 0 are &#x02018;detractors&#x02019;. The overall score is then calculated by subtracting the percentage of detractors from the percentage of promotors, resulting in a score between -100 and +100.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The Patient Activation Measure (PAM) is a non-knee-specific questionnaire for measuring the level of patient self-management concerning their health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. It contains 13 items and asks patients about their beliefs, knowledge and confidence concerning their engagement in a wide range of health behaviours. It assigns an activation score ranging from 0 to 100, based on the responses to the 13-item scale, with 100 representing the highest level of self-management.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) is a 14-item scale containing seven questions that relate to anxiety and seven questions that relate to depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Each item is rated on a four-point scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (very often). Responses are based on the relative frequency of symptoms over the preceding week. Possible scores range from 0 to 21 for each subscale, with 0 meaning no symptoms and 21 meaning severe symptoms.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Physiotherapy evaluation questions will be asked on topics such as the average duration and frequency of PT sessions, location of physiotherapy and patients&#x02019; satisfaction concerning their PT treatment.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The Activ8&#x000ae; activity monitor is a newly designed, recently validated accelerometer that measures acceleration in three planes (3D) (Horemans et al, The Activ8 Activity Monitor: validation of detection of body postures and movements, submitted). It is a small device (2&#x000d7;3cm) that can be fixed with Tegaderm&#x02122; waterproof transparent dressing on the ventral side of the upper leg, halfway between hip and knee. This allows patients to take a shower while wearing the Activ8&#x000ae;.

In our power analyses, we accounted for 15&#x000a0;% loss to follow-up. Reasons for loss to follow-up will be explored. Patients&#x02019; baseline characteristics will be inspected to assess comparability between the two groups. Descriptive statistics will be presented for each group as the mean change (standard deviation, 95&#x000a0;% confidence intervals) in both primary and secondary outcomes from baseline to each time point, using IBM<bold>&#x000ae;</bold> SPPS software, version 19.0.</p><p>For our primary outcome measure, the VAS for activities, both mean postoperative values and mean differences between preoperative and postoperative values between intervention- and control groups will be compared.

Differences in activity level between intervention- and control group, measured preoperatively and six months postoperatively, will be calculated using Mann-Whitney U tests. Finally, we will report on the GAS scores collected at three and six months postoperatively. GAS scores will be considered ordinal data and non-parametric analysis methods will be used. We will present the percentage of patients reaching their goals (0) as well as the percentage of patients reaching less than their goal (-1), more than their goal (+1) and far more than their goal (+2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Discussion</title><p>This paper provides the study protocol of the ACTION trial, which is a single-centre RCT that will investigate the effect of individualized, goal attained rehabilitation on patient satisfaction for activities of daily life, work and leisure time including sports after KA. The main goal of this study is to establish whether GAS is an effective rehabilitation method for achieving higher levels of patient satisfaction compared to usual care physiotherapy rehabilitation. With up to 20&#x000a0;% of patients remaining dissatisfied after KA, it is important to find new ways to further improve satisfaction in this patient group. Rehabilitation after KA plays a crucial role in helping patients to regain functionality and thereby improve participation. Although first described in 1968, GAS has gained renewed attention in recent years. It has shown promising results in several paediatric rehabilitation and neurorehabilitation studies and its use in these practices is growing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. However, its use in rehabilitation after orthopaedic surgery has never been studied. As orthopaedic patient populations become more diverse, the need for individualized outcome measurements, such as GAS, increases. With our study we hope to provide a preliminary insight into the usefulness of GAS in orthopaedic rehabilitation settings. The proposed 6-point scale, ranging from -3 to +2 (compared to the original 5-point scale ranging from -2 to +2), allows us to also define and measure a possible relapse in a patient&#x02019;s performance (-3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Since GAS is described at the activity and participation level of the ICF, we believe that the GAS goals will be highly relevant to the patient. The ICF intends to provide a standard language and conceptual framework for the description of health-related states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. By using the ICF framework, involved health professionals can communicate more effectively, since the same description is used universally. In this way, the practice variation that was observed in previous physiotherapy studies might be reduced, which is desirable because of the increasing demand for effectiveness (including cost-effectiveness) in healthcare. Furthermore, goals will be described in compliance with SMART (Specific, Measurable, Acceptable, Realistic and Time-specific) criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. These SMART goals are both relevant to the patient and considered acceptable and realistic by the physiotherapist and a multidisciplinary team consisting of orthopaedic surgeons, physiotherapists, orthopaedic researchers and human movement scientists. We expect that using this method will increase the chances of actually reaching a certain goal, whereby patients&#x02019; expectations will be met more often and patient satisfaction will increase. Since we expect to find enough eligible patients in our centre to complete inclusion within 40&#x000a0;weeks, we have chosen a single-centre study setting.</p><p>The primary strength of the proposed study is its multidisciplinary approach, with orthopaedic surgeons, physiotherapists, orthopaedic researchers and human movement scientists all involved in the study. In other words, the effect of a multidisciplinary approach in the treatment of young, active knee arthroplasty patients will be investigated. The second strength of this study is the broad range of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) and performance-based measures (Activ8, GAS scores) that will be collected, thus representing actual patient satisfaction and activities in the best possible way. The outcome measures are all relatively easy to collect and our aim is to gain complete data sets. When using PROMs, using a 12-month follow-up is suggested since clinically significant improvements still occur in the six-to-twelve month recovery period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Therefore, with a follow-up of 12&#x000a0;months and a considerable difference between our two treatment groups in terms of the rehabilitation program, we expect to find a relevant difference in both patient-specific and performance-based outcome measures.</p><p>Our aim with the ACTION trial is to investigate whether a multidisciplinary, individualized rehabilitation can aid orthopaedic surgeons and physiotherapists in achieving higher patient satisfaction levels in their younger (&#x0003c;65&#x000a0;years) KA patient population. Furthermore, a first impression on the practical use of GAS in daily physiotherapy practice for orthopaedic patients can be obtained.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>GAS</term><def><p>goal attainment scaling</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>KA</term><def><p>knee arthroplasty</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OA</term><def><p>osteoarthritis</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TKA</term><def><p>total knee arthroplasty</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>UKA</term><def><p>unicondylar knee arthroplasty</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare no conflicts of interest or further financial relationship with the organization that funded the research.
