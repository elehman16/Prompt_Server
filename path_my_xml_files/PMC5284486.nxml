<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Recently, the results of a phase 2 trial failed to demonstrate doxycycline efficacy.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> However, the study included mainly patients in advanced disease stages, as evidenced by the inclusion criteria and the clinical data, such as disease duration more than 5&#x02005;months at enrolment in 39% and high periodic sharp wave complexes (PSWC) rate in the EEG (normally at late stages). Therefore, we hypothesised that the enrolment of severely impaired patients could be the reason for the resultant lack of efficacy. Here, we analyse patients at an early stage of disease (defined by neuropsychological tests) in a double-blinded prospective study. In addition, we analysed data from patients who received doxycycline as compassionate treatment, who were matched to a control group which was selected by known predictors for disease aggressiveness in CJD (age at onset, gender and codon 129). Then we combined data from an observational study and that obtained from the randomised trial in a meta-analytic framework.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Patients and methods</title><p>Our study is designed to provide class IV evidence; its primary research aim is to evaluate the potential therapeutic effect of doxycycline as an antiprion drug in patients with sCJD.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Patients</title><p>Patients with suspected human prion diseases were reported to the National Reference Center for TSE Surveillance in G&#x000f6;ttingen, Germany, and examined on site by a study physician.

Patients with <italic>PRNP</italic> mutations were excluded. The study was conducted at the University of G&#x000f6;ttingen, Germany, and was approved by the Ethics Committee of G&#x000f6;ttingen (reference number: 26/7/06). Written informed consent was obtained from the patients and/or their legally authorised representatives. Patients were randomly assigned (ratio 1:1) to receive either doxycycline or placebo. The randomisation list and the study medication were administered by the Charit&#x000e9;, Universit&#x000e4;tsmedizin, Berlin, Germany. The patients in the therapy group received oral doxycycline at a dose of 100&#x02005;mg per day. After the baseline visit (BL) and the first visit (visit 1), the patients were visited every 2&#x02005;months during the first 6&#x02005;months (visits 2&#x02013;4) and then every 3&#x02005;months. Additionally, the caregivers were interviewed by telephone every 2&#x02005;weeks to evaluate the disease progression based on a standardised questionnaire.</p><p><italic>Compassionate treatment data</italic>: Patients with suspected sCJD were seen by a physician at the time of diagnosis. Standardised clinical examination with special emphasis on CJD-specific symptoms and standardised scales to measure clinical presentation (Barthel index) and cognitive decline (MMSE) was performed.</p><p>Compassionate treatment with doxycycline (100&#x02005;mg daily dose) was initiated by the family doctor. Follow-up clinical examination in the framework of surveillance studies was performed, including a clinical examination and neuropsychological test battery. Originally, 77 patients with sCJD were treated with doxycycline.</p><p>To avoid any bias, a control group was selected from historical data and included only patients who were diagnosed with probable or definite sCJD and were not treated with doxycycline and did not participate in a previous study with flupirtine.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p><p>Only 33 patients were included as controls because of our strict selection criteria which were (1) diagnosis during the same time period as the group which received doxycycline; (2) all clinical data should be available; (3) genetic mutations in <italic>PRNP</italic> were excluded by sequence analysis and (4) the cohort was matched by age, gender and codon 129 genotype.</p><p>Since the baseline MMSE is an important prognostic factor, only patients with known baseline MMSE were considered for further analysis, resulting in a sample size of 88 (55 treated and 33 untreated) patients.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Standard protocol approvals, registrations and patient consents</title><p>The randomised, single-centre, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase II trial (EudraCT (2006-003934-14)) was approved by the local Ethics Committee of the University Medical School (26/7/2006 from 27.7.2007).</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Biochemical and neuropathological analyses</title><p><italic>CSF tests</italic>: CSF samples were obtained by lumbar puncture and the samples were subsequently frozen and stored in Eppendorf tubes at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C.

In the double-blinded randomised study, follow-up for survival starts with the randomisation (first application of study medication) and ends with date of death or end of the study, whichever occurs first. In the observational study, follow-up cannot be defined in the same way. Therefore, patients in the observational study are followed up for survival from disease onset. This start point is both a natural choice and also minimises the risk of bias when comparing patients treated with doxycycline to controls since the onset of symptoms is well defined in both groups as the date of the first interview with close relatives.</p><p>Other secondary measures included scores on cognitive and functional tests (Barthel index, MMSE, a neurological examination, CSF biomarkers (14-3-3 protein, NSE, &#x003c4; protein), EEG and cerebral MRI).</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Demographic and clinical characteristics of the cohorts were summarised by descriptive statistics and survival was defined as the primary end point. Survival times were analysed by means of Cox proportional hazard models with treatment (doxycycline vs control) as a factor. Treatment effects are reported in terms of HRs with 95% CIs and p values testing the null hypothesis of no effect of doxycycline on survival in comparison to untreated control or placebo, respectively. Analyses were adjusted for several prognostic factors including age at onset, gender, codon 129 genotype and baseline MMSE, by stratifying the Cox regression by terciles of the propensity scores. The stratification allows for differences in the baseline hazards across the three strata, but a common HR for the treatment effect could be assumed without a statistically significant loss of goodness of fit (p=0.2703, likelihood ratio test).</p><p>In order to combine the results of both groups, a random-effects meta-analysis was performed. A combined estimate of the log HR for treatment was calculated using inverse-variance weighting.

Fifty-five were treated with doxycycline by their family doctors, and furthermore had a known codon 129 polymorphism status as well as known MMSE test results at the time of diagnosis. The mean age at onset of the doxycycline-treated group was 62&#x02005;years. In the neuropsychological examination, an MMSE of 20 points was achieved. The doxycycline therapy started 168&#x02005;days from disease onset and the duration of the doxycycline treatment was 122&#x02005;days (mean). Thirty-three untreated patients with probable or definite sCJD with known codon 129 polymorphism genotype and MMSE from the same time period were analysed as controls. The clinical data and the spectrum of diagnostic findings with regard to biomarker in the cerebrospinal fluid, periodic sharp wave complexes in the EEG and increased signal intensity of the basal ganglia and/or the cortex in the MRI are described in detail in <xref ref-type="table" rid="JNNP2016313541TB2">table 2</xref>. The influence of possible confounders (age of disease onset, gender, codon 129 genotype and baseline MMSE, according to ref. <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) has to be taken into account in the data analysis. The Cox regression was stratified by terciles of the corresponding propensity scores.</p><p>In the stratified analysis, we found a significant prolongation in survival time in patients treated with doxycycline compared with the untreated controls, with an estimated HR of 0.607 (95% CI (0.372 to 0.989)). The (unadjusted) median survival time in the doxycycline-treated patients was 346&#x02005;days compared with 208&#x02005;days for the control group. The longer survival time in doxycycline-treated sCJD versus non-treated sCJD is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="JNNP2016313541F2">figure 2</xref>A. In both groups, the codon 129 genotype influenced the survival time in the doxycycline-treated group. The median survival time in the valine homozygous (VV) genotype without treatment is 162&#x02005;days and with doxycycline therapy 182&#x02005;days (HR 0.85). For the methionine/valine heterozygous (MV) genotype, the survival time is longer, with 365&#x02005;days in the non-treated patients with sCJD and 391&#x02005;days in treated sCJD (HR 0.83). The shortest survival time of 88&#x02005;days was observed in a non-treated methionine homozygous (MM) patient with sCJD and the survival time in a doxycycline-treated patient with&#x000a0;sCJD with this genotype was longer (364&#x02005;days with a significant HR of 0.034). The Kaplan-Meier survival curves are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="JNNP2016313541F3">figure 3</xref>. Owing to the small sample sizes, stratification with a propensity score is not possible in this analysis and hence no adjustment for covariates was performed.

Most data originate from anecdotal reports or observational trials. The first randomised trial was performed with flupirtine,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> which demonstrated the feasibility of a randomised trial in this devastating disease. Other placebo-controlled studies followed: quinacrine trials in the UK (PRION-1<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) and the USA<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> and doxycycline in Italy and France.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Although the results were negative, important lessons were learnt concerning recruitment protocols and study designs. The clinical scales developed in the PRION-1 trial<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> are now under validation at several sites, including Germany, and the establishment of disease-specific scales to monitor disease progression in CJD will be an important contribution for further trials to come.</p><p>Future studies need to consider specific trial designs.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> The ultimate goal in a pharmacological intervention is the enrolment of patients at an early disease stage. Exactly this point was addressed in quinacrine trials and in our cohort.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>
<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> The experiences were similar&#x02014;patients at early disease stages declined to receive placebo and did not agree to randomisation. With this, our study is in line with the observations made in the British and American US studies. Clearly, the classic standard double-blind placebo-controlled study design might be problematic for trial protocols in CJD and alternative concepts are needed.</p><p>We observed a prolongation of survival time in patients taking doxycycline. Our data differ from those reported by the multicentre trial.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> A potential explanation for the difference could be the disease stage when treatment was initiated. In our study, only patients at an early stage of the disease&#x02014;those who could be tested by a battery of neuropsychological tests&#x02014;were included. The assumption that the patients in our study were enrolled at an early stage is supported by the low frequency of PSWCs in the EEG which typically occurs in the middle and later stages.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> We are aware that our results might be biased by the small sample size in the double-blind trial as well as the inherent methodological problems of observational studies. On the other hand, single case reports demonstrate a similar phenomenon&#x02014;extension of survival time when treatment starts early.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>
<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></p><p>The influence of the codon 129 genotype (on clinical presentation with the shortest survival time in MM patients) is well established.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Our results indicate a possible life-prolonging effect of a doxycycline therapy in MM patients. In contrast, valine homozygous and heterozygous patients displayed only a slight trend towards longer survival. The small patient numbers, which are also due to our strict inclusion criteria, might influence the statistical significance of our results. We cannot completely exclude that the observed effect might result from an antibiotic effect of doxycycline and thus from a general protective effect against infection. Nevertheless, the marked difference between the genotypes suggests a genotype-specific effect of the treatment. This finding additionally supports the assumption of a specific antiprion effect of doxycycline in contrast to an antibiotic effect, which would be similarly present in all genotypes.</p><p>To study the potential effect on the disease course, we evaluated when in the disease course important clinical hallmarks such as deficits in eating, mobility, speaking and sphincter control occur. Here, we found a significantly later appearance of these deficits in the doxycycline group. Therefore, we can assume an overall delay in disease progression, which is shown by the later decline in these abilities in treated patients.</p><p>Our patients&#x02019; cohort displays an atypical distribution of codon 129 genotypes which might result from our selection criteria. We enrolled patients with only mild dementia, that is, those at an early stage of the disease. The MM disease subtype is typically characterised by very rapid dementia and is usually diagnosed at a late stage because of the aggressiveness of the disease. In contrast, in VV patients, ataxia is frequently the earliest clinical presentation, and dementia is mild at early stages. Consequently, these patients were more likely to be enrolled in our study.</p><p>On the basis of our results, we recommend doxycycline treatment, especially in MM patients with sCJD in earlier disease stages, as a useful therapeutic option, unless other treatment options become available.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> DV was involved in study concept and design, and editing the manuscript.
