onset muscle soreness during microcurrent therapy. [Methods] In this study 24 healthy
women who hadn&#x02019;t exercised regularly for six months were selected and randomly divided
into two groups. Delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) was induced and experimental Group 1
were given microcurrent treatment with the electrodes attached at a close distance
evaluated. Experimental Group 2 received the same treatment with the electrodes attached
at a greater distance apart. Visual analogue scale pain and the RIII reflex were evaluated
after inducing DOMS and after one day, two days, three days and four days of microcurrent
treatment. [Results] The visual analogue scale and amplitude of RIII amplitude only showed
significant differences with the length of time of the treatment. [Conclusion] This study
found that difference of interelectrode distance has no influence on VAS pain and the RIII
reflex of DOMS. Although there were no significant differences in RIII amplitude, we
suspect that it may be influenced by current parameters such as frequency and
intensity.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>DOMS</kwd><kwd>Microcurrent</kwd><kwd>RIII reflex test</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The muscle damage theory of Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness (DOMS) indicates that muscle pain
is caused by tiny lacerations of the muscle during strenuous exercise<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref><sup>)</sup>, and the muscular spasm theory states that muscle pain induced by
exercise causes muscular spasms, which cause local ischemia, inducing secretion of pain
producing substances which then stimulate the peripheral ends of autonomous nerves<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>It is known that delayed onset muscle soreness increases the intensity of pain within 24
hours after exercise, reaches a peak between 24 and 48 hours, disappears within 5&#x02013;7 days
after exercise<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref><sup>)</sup>, and causes muscular
weakening, edema, and limitation of range of motion<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Methods of treating delayed onset muscle soreness have been performed in various ways.
Rodenburg et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref><sup>)</sup> mentioned that
performance of warm-up, passive stretching and massage are effective. In addition, when
pulsating ultrasonic waves as an electrical therapy were applied, symptoms of inflammation
like pain and edema were reduced and it was published that it increased the rate of therapy
in many situations like damage of soft tissue, scar tissue, musculoskeletal pain, joint
diseases and edema<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Moreover, it has been
reported that transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation increases the range of motion and
reduces pain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Microcurrent therapy is a type of subsensory stimulation which is mostly applied to acute
lesions like pain, swelling, inflammations and cuts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Microcurrent creates potential differences across sensitive
channels of the cells within the body. It also opens the cell membrane, and increases ATP
(adenosine triphosphate) and protein generation by stimulating the chemical processes of
Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion, and fosters recovery and healing of cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. The effects of pain decrease and wound healing can be
obtained by providing electrical energy at the celllevel, which can create a potential
difference across the cell membrane<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>As the distance between the electrodes increases, the number of parallel paths increases
and the current tends to flow more deeply within the tissues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref><sup>)</sup> but the effects of electrode distance have not been clearly
defined. Therefore, this study examined the effects of applying microcurrent with different
electrode spacings on delayed onset muscle soreness.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study selected 20 healthy women randomly and divided them into two groups. Before the
experiment, subjects were given an explanation about the whole process of the experiment,
and the experiment was conducted after obtaining the subjects&#x02019; consent to participation in
the experiment. In addition, this study was approved by the research ethical committee of
Kwangju Women&#x02019;s University.</p><p>The research subjects were those who had no nerve, muscular or musculoskeletal diseases,
had practiced no regular exercise in the previous six months, and didn&#x02019;t take medicine which
might have affected the experiment. They were also instructed not to perform excessive
motions or regular exercise except daily activities during the experiment. The general
characteristics of the research subjects are presented in <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title> General characteristics of subjects (n=20)</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Group</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Experimental group I (n=10)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Experimental group II (n=10)</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (years)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">20.8 &#x000b1; 0.9</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">21.9 &#x000b1; 1.0</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Height (cm)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">160.8 &#x000b1; 4.7</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">161.1 &#x000b1; 3.7</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weight (kg)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">54.3 &#x000b1; 8.2</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">56.2 &#x000b1; 8.1</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap>.</p><p>We connected a performance recorder (PR1, HUR labs, Finland) to an air pressure muscular
strength exercise device (5530 leg extension/curl rehab, HUR, Finland), and measured the
maximal eccentric strength of the knee joint flexors three times. After measuring the
maximal eccentric strength of the left and right knee joint flexors three times, the mean
value was calculated and delayed onset muscle soreness in the biceps femoris muscle was
induced. To induce delayed onset muscular soreness, the subjects were asked to lean back on
the back of the manual exercise equipment, fix their body using a belt, keep their hip joint
at 90&#x000b0;, sit with their knee joint relaxed, exert the mean value of maximal eccentric
strength, and perform a total of 15 sets of knee joint flexion exercises, 15 times a set.
Eccentric exercise was performed for 20s with a 5s rest, and 20s of rest between sets. The
measurer instructed the subjects to use the knee joint flexors. The measurer counted while
delayed onset muscle soreness was induced.</p><p>The microcurrent therapy device used was a low-frequency therapeutic apparatus (endomed
482, Enraf-Nonious B.V. Co., Netherlands). A frequency of 30&#x02005;Hz, intensity of 100 &#x000b5;A, and
alternating polarity was used. Carbon rubber electrodes of 4 &#x000d7; 6&#x02005;cm<sup>2</sup> were
inserted into a sponge pad. In experimental Group I, two electrodes were attached to the
biceps femoris muscle vertically and in experimental Group II, one electrode was attached to
the biceps femoris muscle and the other one was connected to the biceps femoris tendon
vertically. Treatment was conducted for 20&#x02005;min a day, for 4 days from the onset of delayed
muscle soreness.</p><p>The outcome measures of the study were visual analogue scale (VAS) pain and the RIII
reflex. All evaluations were performed five times: immediately after delayed onset muscle
soreness, and after one, two, three and four days of treatment The evaluations were repeated
three times to reduce errors and the average was calculated.</p><p>The subjects were asked to adopt a prone position for the assessment of the degree of pain
when their knee joint was bent VAS scores range from 0 without pain to 10, the severest
pain, and the subjects were asked to indicate the degree of their pain to the tester.</p><p>The RIII reflex of the lower limb with delayed onset muscle soreness was evaluated using
EMG (neuro-EMG-micro, Ivanovo, Russia). The subjects were asked to adopt a prone position on
a bed, bend their hip joint to about 130&#x000b0; using a pillow under the abdomen and the knee
joint to about 120&#x000b0;, and the ankle was positioned. When recording the action potential, we
used a band-pass filter of 5&#x02013;2,000&#x02005;Hz, a sampling rate of 20,000&#x02005;Hz, and the notch filter
was on. Test stimulation was a square wave of six pulses in a pulse train of 1&#x02005;ms.</p><p>Before attaching the electrodes, the attachment sites were cleaned with alcohol and
conductive gel was applied to the fibula before attatchment of the ground electrode, a
rectangular AgCl electrode, 2.3 &#x000d7; 2.6&#x02005;cm<sup>2</sup> (disposable EMG electrode F3001, Fiab,
Italy).The active electrode was attached halfway along the biceps femoris long head, and the
recording electrodewas attached to the biceps femoris tendon 2&#x02005;cm above the knee. After
applying gel, electrical stimulation was applied to the passage of the sural nerve from
lateral malleoulus. The negative pole was positioned proximally and the positive pole was
located 2&#x02005;cm below the negative pole. Stimulation was increased by 1 mA at 10s. Intervals,
and the first stimulation intensity showing the RIII reflex was chosen to reflect the
threshold. Value of increasing 1.2 times from the minimum threshold was recorded.
Stimulation was given three times at 10s. intervals and amplitude values of RIII reflex the
time window of 90&#x02013;180&#x02005;ms were analyzed.</p><p>Statistical analysis was performed with Widows SPSS 12.0 program. Repeated measures ANOVA
were used to analyze the changes of the two groups according to the duration of treatment.
The significance level was chosen as &#x003b1;=0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Changes of the visual analogue scale pain with treatment duration within each group are

stimulation was effective at fostering the process of cut healing, and that a stimulation
intensity of 50 &#x000b5;A was more effective than those of 100 &#x000b5;A and 300 &#x000b5;A in the process of cut
healing as judged by gross observation, and histological and immunohistological results. His
results may differ from those of this study due to current intensity differences.</p><p>Cho<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that in a comparison of
pain between an experimental group using microcurrent and a control group containing foot
pain patients in their fifties, there were significant differences in visual analogue scale
pain before and six weeks after the experiment only in the experimental group. So it was
known that microcurrent therapy reduces pain compared to a control group. This study also
showed decreases in visual analogue scale pain in both groups, but there were no significant
differences between the groups.</p><p>RIII amplitude showed no statistically significant differences between the two groups.
Experimental group II showed an increase immediately after induction of delayed onset muscle
soreness, decreases on after the 4th day of therapy, whereas experimental group I showed an
increase immediately after induction,a decrease after the 1st day of therapy, and increases
on after the 2nd to the 4th day of treatment. The RIII reflex shows variation with the
mental condition of subjects and their external environment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref><sup>)</sup>, and it has been reported that the laboratory environment and full
knowledge of the experiment by subjects affected the results of RIII reflex
measurements.</p><p>Kim<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref><sup>)</sup> reported measuring the RIII reflex
during pain caused by erythema in normal adults. The RIII reflex increased after erythema
was induced, but it was reduced by therapy, and there was no significant difference. Ju and
Gwon<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref><sup>)</sup> found that the maximum amplitude
of the RIII reflex of healthy adults was reduced in fixed frequency treatment and modulated
frequency treatment, but there was no significant difference the between fixed frequency and
modulated frequency treatment groups. In this study, although both groups showed no
significant differences, group II showed a greater decrease than group I in RIII
amplitude.</p><p>The distance between the electrodes proved to be inconsequential in microcurrent therapy,
but different outcomes might be found in a future experiment in which current strength and
frequency, as well as the distance between electrodes are investigated.; on the ground that
decrease range of pain aspect becomes a little bit higher when the distance between
electrodes is adjusted to be farther than this experiment.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Kuipers</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Exercise-induced muscle damage</article-title>.
