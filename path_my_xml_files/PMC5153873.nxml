We developed a cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) with mindfulness that focuses on dealing with this uncertainty. In this article, we elucidate the rationale of a pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT) for testing the feasibility and potential effectiveness of this CBT for reducing symptoms of psychopathology in relatives of missing persons.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A pilot RCT comparing participants of the CBT condition (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;15) with waiting list controls (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;15) will be executed. Individuals suffering from psychopathology related to the long-term disappearance of a loved one are eligible to participate. The treatment consists of eight individual sessions. Questionnaires tapping psychological constructs will be administered before, during, and after the treatment. The feasibility of the treatment will be evaluated using descriptive statistics (e.g., attrition rate). The primary analysis consists of a within-group analysis of changes in mean scores of persistent complex bereavement disorder from baseline to immediately post-treatment and follow-up (12 and 24&#x000a0;weeks post-treatment).</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>A significant number of people experience the disappearance of a loved one. Surprisingly, an RCT to evaluate a treatment for psychopathology among relatives of missing persons has never been conducted. Knowledge about treatment effects is needed to improve treatment options for those in need of help. The strengths of this study are the development of a tailored treatment for relatives of missing persons and the use of a pilot design before exposing a large sample to a treatment that has yet to be evaluated. Future research could benefit from the results of this study.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>

Research on the psychological consequences for relatives of the disappeared is scarce and has mainly been conducted in the context of armed conflicts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. These studies indicate that the disappearance of a significant other is associated with elevated levels of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), major depressive disorder (MDD), and/or disturbed grief.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Grief following the death or disappearance of a loved one</title><p>Whereas little is known about emotional consequences of disappearance, there is a large body of knowledge about both uncomplicated and disturbed grief after the death of a loved one. Grief after the death of a loved one is typically characterized by transient sadness, preoccupation with the circumstances surrounding the loss, and longing for the deceased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. People mostly adapt well to the death of a significant other. Nonetheless, about 10&#x000a0;% of the bereaved experience disturbed grief [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. When grief complaints persist or increase at least 6&#x000a0;months post loss and are associated with distress and impairments in daily functioning, it can be defined as complicated grief (also referred to as prolonged grief disorder) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Although complicated grief partly overlaps with PTSD and MDD, research has shown that these disorders are distinguishable (for overview see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]). Persistent complex bereavement disorder (PCBD) was included in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) as condition for further study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. PCBD encompasses persistent separation distress, preoccupation with the loss and the circumstances of the loss beyond 12&#x000a0;months after the loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>There are at least three reasons to assume that grieving the loss of a disappeared relative is more complex and longer lasting than grieving the loss of a deceased relative. To begin with, the on-going uncertainty about the fate of the missing person may lead to preoccupations with his/her potential whereabouts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Constantly thinking about the missing person may exacerbate negative emotions, interfere with daily life tasks and lead to exhaustion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In addition, families of the disappeared are often confronted with financial, emotional, and practical issues for which they receive little professional support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Finally, family conflicts, social marginalization and a lack of social support from the community have been considered to increase the psychological burden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>Taken together, compared to individuals bereaved by the death of a loved one, relatives of missing persons might experience more severe PTSD, MDD, and disturbed grief (henceforth referred to as PCBD operationalized as complicated grief). To the best of our knowledge, this hypothesis was tested in only four quantitative studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and was confirmed in two of them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. For example, a study among women with unconfirmed and confirmed loss of their husband in a war-related context showed that the former group was more at risk to experience severe MDD symptoms compared to the latter group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In contrast, two other studies did not show significant differences in the severity of symptoms of psychopathology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. For example, relatives of Colombians who had disappeared or died in an armed conflict reported similar levels of PCBD, MDD, and PTSD symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>There are reasons for doubting that the results of these studies are applicable to relatives of missing persons in general. Firstly, all four studies were conducted in the context of armed conflicts. The participants were highly traumatized by different war-related stressors (e.g., torture). It might therefore be difficult to distinguish the effect of the disappearance from the effects of other traumatic events. Secondly, the studies were conducted in non-Western samples. In general, cultures may differ in how to deal with loss, but more specifically in how to deal with relatives of missing persons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Finally, there is preliminary evidence that relatives who have more hope that their loved one is still alive also experience more severe PCBD complaints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Within the context of war-related disappearances, the majority of the relatives reported being convinced that their loved one was dead [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Therefore, relatives who assume that the disappeared person is dead might suffer less from psychological distress than those who assume that the disappeared person might still be alive. Nevertheless, these comparative studies and other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] show that relatives of missing persons might be susceptible for developing symptoms of PCBD, MDD, and PTSD.</p><p>One important step would be to design and evaluate an intervention to target these psychopathological symptoms. To the best of our knowledge, this was only done once; a controlled trial compared the effectiveness of two cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)-based interventions among women who lost a husband due to death or to disappearance during the Srebrenica massacre [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Small to medium pre- to post-treatment effect sizes for both conditions were found for disturbed grief and PTSD. However, the methodological drawbacks of this study, including non-random allocation of participants and lack of a threshold of severity of psychopathology as inclusion criterion, need to be taken into account when interpreting the results. Nevertheless, CBT is the treatment of choice for bereavement-related psychopathology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. CBT might therefore also be effective in the treatment of psychopathology among relatives of missing persons.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>CBT for relatives of missing persons</title><p>A cognitive behavioural theory of PCBD offers a framework for determining variables that should be targeted in CBT among persons who developed PCBD following the death of a significant other [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. This and several other theories about PCBD highlight the important role of negative cognitions and maladaptive behavioural strategies in the development and persistence of PCBD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Cognitive variables include negative views on the self (&#x0201c;I am worthless since he/she died&#x0201d;) and life (&#x0201c;My life has no purpose since he/she died&#x0201d;), a pessimistic view on the future (&#x0201c;I don&#x02019;t have confidence in the future&#x0201d;), and catastrophic meanings assigned to one&#x02019;s own reactions to the loss (&#x0201c;If I would elaborate on my feelings, I would lose control&#x0201d;). Maladaptive behavioural strategies include anxious avoidance and depressive avoidance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The former refers to the avoidance of loss-related stimuli out of fear that confrontation with these stimuli will be unbearable. The latter refers to withdrawal from social, recreational, educational, and/or occupational activities fuelled by the belief that these activities are pointless and/or unfulfilling. Problems with integration of the loss into the autobiographical memory are also associated with PCBD. This results in easily triggered intrusive thoughts, images, and memories upon confrontation with loss-related stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Studies among bereaved individuals suffering from PCBD showed the beneficial effect of targeting these cognitive and behavioural variables using CBT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p>In addition, symptoms of PCBD have been associated with rumination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Rumination encompasses repetitive thinking about one&#x02019;s negative feelings, their consequences, and/or antecedents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. As the disappearance of a person is surrounded by uncertainties, all kinds of repetitive thoughts (e.g., about the whereabouts of the missing person), including ruminative thoughts (e.g., &#x0201c;What am I doing to deserve this?&#x0201d;), might add to the exacerbation and maintenance of symptoms of psychopathology among relatives of missing persons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Rumination can be regarded as a form of &#x0201c;maladaptive coping&#x0201d;, i.e., an unproductive way to master the consequences of the disappearance. Other forms of maladaptive coping that may be pertinent to recovery from the disappearance of a loved one include substance use and suppression of unwanted thoughts and memories.</p><p>Although never studied systematically, it is conceivable that these cognitive and behavioural variables are also involved in the maintenance of psychopathology among relatives of missing persons. For instance, relatives of missing persons might no longer perceive the world as a safe place. As a result, they may experience a reduced sense of control and elevated vulnerability. This poses threats to the view of themselves, life, and the future [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Relatives may tend to get preoccupied with the missing person and get entangled in repetitive negative thinking and intrusive memories [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Consequently, they could withdraw from previously fulfilling activities. Hoping to find the missing person and at the same time coming to terms with the disappearance can result in conflicting feelings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Holding on to hope that the loved one will return might be used as an avoidance strategy to cope with emotions associated with the thought that the separation is permanent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Some avoid discussing what might have happened to the missing loved one, fearing that this may be perceived as giving up hope [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Active searching may therefore provide distraction from dwelling on the worst-case scenarios [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p>CBT could give relatives of missing persons insights into how cognitive processes (e.g., thoughts about how they should have prevented the disappearance) affect their emotions (e.g., sadness) and behaviour (e.g., withdrawing from social activities). Unlike treatment for bereavement-related psychopathology, an intervention for relatives of missing persons should not be primarily focused on closure or coming to terms with the irreversibility of the loss. Instead, this treatment ought to be focused on tolerating the ambiguity surrounding the loss and maladaptive repetitive thinking, including thoughts about the whereabouts of the missing person [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Adding elements of mindfulness to CBT might serve this treatment aim. In contrast to focusing on external events (e.g., finding out what happened to the missing person), mindfulness is focused on inner psychological experiences (e.g., one&#x02019;s thoughts, sensations and feelings). Furthermore, mindfulness is not focused on the past or future, but on the present [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Mindfulness-based therapy aims to increase the patient&#x02019;s awareness of his/her inner thoughts, feelings, and bodily sensations in a non-judgemental way through the practice of training in mindfulness meditation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. It has frequently shown to reduce levels of psychopathology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. A systematic review showed that the beneficial effect of CBT with mindfulness might be, among other variables, due to the reductions of repetitive negative thinking and enhancement of self-compassion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Self-compassion can be viewed as an emotion-regulation strategy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] that could play a protective role by preventing to become entangled in negative thoughts and emotions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Although these mindfulness-based cognitive therapies have been tested mainly among persons with recurrent depression, preliminary results showed that this approach could also be effective in treatment of grief-related psychopathology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study objectives</title><p>The aim of this pilot study is to evaluate the feasibility and the potential effectiveness of CBT with elements of mindfulness in reducing PCBD, MDD, and PTSD symptoms and enhancing the extent of mindfulness among relatives of missing persons. Based on previous studies, we expect that the treatment effect will be mediated by changes in negative cognitive and behavioural variables plus enhancement of self-compassion.</p><p>The feasibility of the pilot RCT will be explored by the evaluation of the (1) specifics of potential participation bias, (2) attrition rate, (3) methods used and study design, (4) treatment fidelity, and (5) strengths and suggestions for improvements of the treatment from the perspective of the participant. The primary objective of the analysis of the pilot RCT is to assess changes in mean scores on a measure of PCBD from baseline to 1, 12, and 24&#x000a0;weeks post-treatment. A within-group instead of a between-groups analysis will be executed because this will give the most rigorous information about the potential effects of this treatment given the small sample size.</p><p>Secondary objectives of the analysis of the pilot RCT are (1) to evaluate whether the mean scores on measures tapping PCBD, MDD, PTSD, and mindfulness of the treatment group differ from the waiting list control group at the post-treatment/post-waiting period assessment when adjusting for the baseline scores and (2) to test whether the treatment effect is mediated by changes in negative cognitive variables (i.e., reductions in negative grief cognitions, intrusive memories, rumination, and repetitive negative thinking) and behavioural variables (i.e., avoidance behaviours) and enhancement of self-compassion. In addition, the extent of change in repetitive negative thinking, intrusive memories, and self-compassion in response to the treatment will be explored at micro-level by means of tracking measures tapping these constructs during the treatment.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec6"><title>Design</title><p>This is a multi-centre two-arm pilot RCT exploring the feasibility and potential effectiveness of CBT for relatives of missing persons suffering from psychopathology, in comparison with a waiting list control group. The intervention group will start with the treatment within 1&#x000a0;week after randomisation. The waiting list control group will receive the treatment 12&#x000a0;weeks after randomisation. An allocation ratio of 1:1 will be used. The participants will be asked to fill in questionnaires prior to the treatment and 1, 12, and 24&#x000a0;weeks post-treatment. Participants in the waiting list control group will complete an additional questionnaire 1&#x000a0;week prior to their actual start of the treatment. In addition, the participant will be asked to complete a brief questionnaire at the start of each session to assess the potential change in repetitive negative thinking, intrusive memories, and self-compassion during the treatment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Ethics approval</title><p>Ethics approval for performing this study has been obtained from the Ethical Committee Psychology at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands (ppo-014-087).</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Participants</title><p>First, second, and third degree (adoption- or step-) family members, spouses, and friends of missing persons, who are missing for more than 3&#x000a0;months, are fluent in written and spoken Dutch, and are 18&#x000a0;years of age or older are eligible to sign up for the study. A missing person is defined as &#x0201c;Anyone whose whereabouts is unknown whatever the circumstances of disappearance. They will be considered missing until located and their well-being or otherwise established&#x0201d; (p. 15) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. The 3-month criterion was used in a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] and is also chosen for this study in consultation with representatives of a peer support group and a non-governmental organisation for relatives of missing persons in the Netherlands. Additional inclusion criteria are (1) meeting criteria for PCBD, MDD, and/or PTSD, (2) written informed consent, (3) absence of mental retardation, (4) absence of substance abuse or dependence, (5) absence of psychotic disorder, (6) no high risk of suicide, and (7) no concurrent psychological treatment. In case the missing loved one will be found dead or alive during the period of participation, the participant is offered the opportunity to finish the treatment but will be excluded from further analyses.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Recruitment of participants</title><p>All recruitment procedures aim to enrol individuals of whom a loved one has been missing for participation in a survey study. The survey study aims to explore the psychological consequences for relatives of missing persons. The survey study and pilot RCT are both part of the same research project. We will recruit participants through several pathways. Firstly, representatives from a television show focused on the search of missing persons and a peer support group will distribute invitation letters to relatives of missing persons. Secondly, Victim Support the Netherlands, a governmental organisation in which professionals, mostly social workers, offer practical and legal support to victims, will inform potential participants about the research project. Thirdly, other participants will be recruited via announcements in the media, presentations at meetings for relatives of missing persons, and snowball sampling (each participant is asked to invite others). After signing up for the survey study, the participants will be sent a questionnaire including an information letter and informed consent form for participation in the survey study. The letter informs participants about the aims of the survey study and the possibility to participate in a subsequent study designed to evaluate a psychological intervention specifically developed for relatives of missing persons.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Procedure and randomisation</title><p>After receiving the completed questionnaires and the signed informed consent form for participation in the survey study, the participants will be screened for in- and exclusion criteria for the intervention study. The screening procedure comprises two parts. The first part consists of screening participants for in- and exclusion criteria based on questionnaires (questionnaires and cut-off criteria are described below). Participants who score above the threshold for PCBD, MDD, and/or PTSD will be offered written information about the intervention study together with an informed consent form for participation in the intervention study. The second part of the screening procedure consists of a clinical interview composed of the M.I.N.I. Plus version 5.0.0. and the Traumatic Grief Interview. A trained independent psychologist will conduct the interview by telephone. The M.I.N.I. Plus is developed to diagnose axis I DSM-IV psychiatric disorders and has good psychometric properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. The following modules of the M.I.N.I. Plus will be used: major depressive episode, dysthymia, suicidality, PTSD, alcoholic dependence, substance dependence, and psychotic disorders. In addition, the Traumatic Grief Interview will be administered to assess symptoms of PCBD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]; based on this interview, participants meet criteria for PCBD when they score a 2 (&#x0201c;sometimes&#x0201d;) or higher on at least 1 B-cluster symptom, at least 6 C-cluster symptoms and a score of 1 (&#x0201c;seldom&#x0201d;) or higher on the D-cluster symptom in accord with the proposed criteria of PCBD in the DSM-5 with exclusion of the criterion that at least 12&#x000a0;months must have been elapsed since the loved one has gone missing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>Randomisation will take place after the participant is screened for eligibility based on the M.I.N.I. Plus and the TGI. A random number generator will be used to perform the blocking randomisation procedure. Relatives of the same missing person will be allocated to the same study arm (i.e., intervention or waiting list condition), in order to prevent transfer of information. An independent researcher will conduct the randomisation procedure. Neither the participants nor the researchers will be blinded. The M.I.N.I. Plus and the Traumatic Grief Interview will be conducted again after the treatment, to examine whether numbers of cases of PCBD, MDD, and PTSD have decreased.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Treatment</title><p>The treatment is manualized and consists of eight 45-min individual face-to-face therapy sessions offered in a period of maximally 12&#x000a0;weeks. The treatment protocol draws from CBT for treatment of PCBD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. Participants learn cognitive behavioural skills and mindfulness practices that enable them to disengage from dysfunctional cognitive patterns related to their missing loved one, both during the sessions and through homework assignments.</p><p>In the first session, the therapist and client introduce themselves, exchange expectations regarding the treatment, and the participant is invited to share his/her story about the disappearance of the loved one. The participant receives a manual (containing psycho-education, writing assignments, and exercises for how to handle maladaptive thoughts). Social support is the theme of the second session. The client is asked to invite a relative to join the client in the second session. Mindfulness exercises are introduced in session 3. The therapist explains that mindfulness training consists of sustained attention focused on the body and breath, which integrates a decentred view of thoughts as passing mental events (i.e., &#x0201c;rather than simply being their emotions, or identifying personally with negative thoughts and feelings, patients relate to negative experiences as mental events in a wider context&#x0201d; (p. 276) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]). A mindfulness exercise is practiced, and the participant will be encouraged to perform mindfulness exercises at home at least five times a week from therapy session 3 to 8. The mindfulness exercises [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>] that stem from mindfulness-based cognitive therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] are offered on the website of our research program (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.levenmetvermissing.nl">www.levenmetvermissing.nl</ext-link>) and via a CD-ROM. The participant is asked to report aspects of their mindfulness-experiences in a mindfulness-diary (e.g., which exercise, duration of the exercise, experiences with the exercise). During session 4 to 8, CBT will be applied that consists of cognitive restructuring and exposure interventions. Cognitive restructuring aims to change dysfunctional thought patterns, and exposure techniques aim to reduce anxiety and avoidance behaviour. Four structured writing assignments are added in a fixed order to the protocol for three reasons. Firstly, the assignments can serve as exposure assignment (e.g., in one of the writing assignments participants are instructed to write about their deepest thoughts and feelings associated with the most stressful memory or image related to the disappearance that keeps popping into their mind) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. Secondly, the assignments can increase awareness of inner thoughts and feelings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. Lastly, writing about traumatic experiences helps to keep the therapeutic process flowing between the sessions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. Two of the writing assignments are imaginary exposure-assignments encouraging participants to tolerate thoughts and feelings related to the disappearance. The first assignment (between session 1 and 2) addresses the impact of the disappearance. The participant is instructed to write about the most intense thoughts and feelings during the first days of the disappearance, followed by a description of how his/her life was before the disappearance and the most painful consequences of the disappearance on his/her life. The second assignment (between session 2 and 3) addresses the description of an image or memory related to the disappearance. The participant is invited to write about the most painful image or memory related to the disappearance and to describe all experiences (thoughts, feelings, and sensations) that come to his/her mind while thinking about that image or memory in as much detail as possible. The third writing assignment (between session 4 and 5) consists of writing a supportive letter to a hypothetical friend that is facing the same situation. This assignment aims to promote the development of new perspectives on the disappearance and its circumstances and to challenge dysfunctional thoughts and behaviour patterns. In the fourth writing assignment (between session 7 and 8), the participant is instructed to write about what he/she has learned during the treatment and how he/she dealt with the disappearance prior to treatment, how he/she deals with it at the moment, and how he/she wishes to deal with it in the future. This final assignment aims to foster empowerment of the participant, in order to deal with possible difficulties in the future. The same sort of writing assignments has been successfully used in treatments of PTSD and PCBD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>].</p><p>A group of qualified therapists has received an 8-h training to apply the treatment protocol. The first, third, and last author offered the training. The therapists are all governmentally licensed as psychotherapists or mental healthcare psychologists. They are all part of a network of trained therapists divided over the Netherlands and are experienced in the treatment of PCBD, MDD, and PTSD as a result of extraordinary, high impact loss-related situations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Treatment fidelity</title><p>Treatment fidelity will be monitored by asking the therapists to report all compliances and deviations from the treatment protocol in a journal.

To test whether the treatment effect is mediated by changes in cognitive variables (i.e., grief cognitions, intrusive memories, rumination, and repetitive negative thinking), behavioural variables (i.e., avoidance behaviour), and self-compassion, only the scores of measures tapping these constructs that show the strongest association (based on univariate analyses) will be added to a multiple regression model. Finally, to assess the potential change at micro-level in repetitive negative thinking, intrusive memories and self-compassion throughout the course of the treatment a within-subjects repeated measures ANOVA with time (session 1 to session 8) as the repeated measure will be performed with mean scores of measures tapping repetitive negative thinking, intrusive memories, and self-compassion as outcome measures.</p><p>Data will be analysed according to the intention-to-treat principle. Missing data will be handled using multiple imputations. The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences will be used for the analysis.

Surprisingly, no RCT has ever been conducted to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of a psychological treatment for persistent psychopathology among relatives of missing persons. Knowledge about treatment effects is needed to improve treatment options for those in need of help. This article describes the rationale and methods of a multi-centre pilot RCT focused on the evaluation of the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of CBT with elements of mindfulness for relatives of missing persons. The treatment is based on CBT for bereavement-related psychopathology and aims to reduce dysfunctional cognitions and avoidance behaviour. Elements of mindfulness are added to the therapy to enhance skills to tolerate the ambiguity surrounding the disappearance and to prevent participants becoming entangled in negative thoughts.</p><p>Strengths of this study are (1) the development of a treatment that is targeted to a specific population, (2) the evaluation of the possible mechanisms of change of the treatment, (3) the inclusion of both an intervention and waiting list control group, (4) the use of a pilot design before exposing a large sample to a treatment that has yet to be evaluated, (5) the assessment of eligibility not only by self-report questionnaires but also with a clinical interview, and (6) the monitoring at micro-level of potential change mechanisms of the treatment. One of the limitations of this study is the lack of power to conduct a multilevel analysis to take into account the nested structure of the data (i.e., repeated measures, nested in individuals, who are, in turn, nested in families or other social systems associated with the same missing person). In addition, the recruitment procedures are focused on a non-treatment seeking population. The percentages of individuals who are willing to participate might therefore be relatively low compared to other studies, and the recruitment of sufficient numbers of participants might therefore be a challenge. Moreover, treatment fidelity will be monitored by methods that rely on self-report which might be prone to bias. Finally, participants whose loved one disappeared less than 12&#x000a0;months earlier can formally not fulfil the criteria of PCBD, because one of the proposed criteria of PCBD is that at least 12&#x000a0;months has elapsed since the loss. The reason for this time frame is to distinguish normal from pathological grief [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Because little is known about the grief reactions following the disappearance of a loved one, a shorter time frame is chosen to offer support for those in need of help.</p><p>As a result of this pilot study, we may have some evidence whether CBT is effective for relatives of missing persons. Since this is a pilot study, the future results of this study need to be interpreted with caution. The recommendations for the execution of a large-scale RCT based on the results of this pilot study are expected to be relevant for future research. Future intervention studies should verify the results of this study and other possibly effective treatments in order to offer an evidence-based intervention for this population. Taken together, this study will provide the first results of a pilot RCT that evaluates the potential effectiveness of CBT for relatives of missing persons suffering from psychopathology.</p><sec id="Sec26"><title>Trial status</title><p>Recruitment of participants was started in January 2015 and will continue until July 1, 2016.</p></sec></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>CBT</term><def><p>cognitive behavioural therapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DSM-5</term><def><p>Fifth Edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MDD</term><def><p>major depressive disorder</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PCBD</term><def><p>persistent complex bereavement disorder</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PTSD</term><def><p>post-traumatic stress disorder</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCT</term><def><p>randomised controlled trial</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contribution</bold></p><p>LL, JK, and PB are responsible for the development of the treatment.
