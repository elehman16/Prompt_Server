Good glycaemic control, preferably HbA<sub>1</sub>c &#x0003c;7 per cent can remarkably reduce the risk of such complications and this target is currently recommended in clinical practice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>.</p><p>Majority of the patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are initially treated with dietary and lifestyle modifications and oral hypoglycaemic agents (OHAs). However, with advancing duration of disease, there is progressive and inexorable loss of &#x003b2; cell function/mass and eventually most of the patients need treatment with exogenous insulin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>. This implies a once daily long-acting insulin or twice daily insulin treatment with a pre-mixed preparation. However, even with the above mentioned regimen many patients do not achieve their glycaemic targets and require intensification of insulin therapy such as basal-bolus (BB) regimen, which is near physiological and is considered as standard of care in clinical practice. Basal-bolus regimen can be practiced with either conventional insulin or insulin analogues and require four to five pricks per day. Insulin analogues have advantage over conventional insulin in terms of convenience of administration and decreased risk of nocturnal hypoglycaemia, though these are quite expensive. Biphasic human insulin (BHI) given twice a day even in reasonably high doses to avoid multiple injections is a common clinical practice. However, this is associated with post-lunch and/or pre-dinner hyperglycaemia particularly in late diners. To overcome this, biphasic insulin analogues have been given thrice a day and shown to be as efficacious as basal-bolus regimen<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>, however, BHI (30:70) has not been tried thrice a day. Therefore, this study was planned to assess the efficacy and safety of biphasic human insulin thrice-daily in comparison to basal bolus analogues regimen in patients with T2DM.</p><sec id="sec1-1"><title>Material &#x00026; Methods</title><p>This was an open-labelled randomized, study comparing BHI thrice daily with BB regimen in subjects with T2DM in whom glycaemic targets were not achieved with the use of BHI twice daily along with insulin sensitizers (metformin 2 g/day and pioglitazone 30 mg/day). The number of patients studied was arbitrarily defined, as it was a pilot study. The patients were recruited from out patient department at Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh, India between June 2008 and December 2009.

The total daily dose of BHI being received by the patient was distributed in 40:20:40 ratio (breakfast: lunch: dinner) and was later on adjusted according to self monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG). In basal bolus regimen, aspart (Novorapid, Novo Nordisk, Denmark) was injected immediately before breakfast, lunch and dinner, while detemir (Levemir, Novo Nordisk, Denmark) was administered at the bedtime (2200-2300 h). The total daily dose was split between insulin aspart and detemir as 60 and 40 per cent, respectively.

There was no difference between the groups in glycaemic control, weight gain, major, minor or nocturnal hypoglycaemic episodes except for documented symptomatic hypoglycaemic episodes. The BHI regimen was less expensive as compared to the BB regimen.</p><p>With progressive deterioration in &#x003b2; cell mass/function, majority of the patients with T2DM require intensified insulin therapy usually in the form of basal bolus regimen either with analogues or conventional insulin. Alternative to this is use of biphasic insulin analogues twice/thrice daily<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref> or biphasic human insulin twice a day with rapid acting human insulin before lunch<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>. Biphasic human insulin twice a day is commonly used in the clinical practice. However, with changing lifestyle, most of the people now dine late at night consequently pre-dinner hyperglycaemia is not uncommon with this twice daily regimen as the effect of the morning NPH wanes off by that time. No studies using biphasic human insulin thrice daily are available as there is a theoretical risk of hypoglycaemia/s due to &#x02018;stacking&#x02019; effect<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>. However, the insulin peaks and troughs seen following a single injection of insulin suspension isophane are attenuated with the use of multiple daily isophane injections and pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics become similar to long acting insulin analogues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>. With the same analogy, we tried using biphasic human insulin (30:70) thrice a day thereby presuming that short acting insulin will take care of prandial hyperglycaemia and NPH will give a basal cover throughout the day.</p><p>The glycaemic control in terms of decline in HbA<sub>1</sub>c and mean fasting plasma glucose was comparable between the two groups in the present study. There was a significant decline in fasting plasma glucose in both the groups, however, only eight (16%) patients could achieve HbA<sub>1</sub>c &#x0003c; 7 per cent, four in each group at the end of the study possibly due to short duration of follow up.</p><p>The insulin doses were adjusted in the two treatment groups according to the 6-point plasma glucose profile. The insulin dose requirement and the dose increment during the study was more in the BB regimen compared to the BHI. As insulin analogues have similar potency as per dose by dose in comparison with conventional insulin, the dose at the end of the study should have been comparable. However, this was not observed in our study probably because of higher content of NPH (70%) in the BHI regimen as compared to detemir (40%) in the BB regimen. The other reason might be the short duration of action of aspart as compared to regular insulin, thereby requiring higher doses of basal insulin to control interprandial hyperglycaemia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>.</p><p>Intensive insulin therapy in patient with diabetes is usually associated with greater frequency of hypoglycaemic episodes as shown in DCCT<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref> in T1DM and UKPDS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref> in T2 DM. It has also been shown previously that hypoglycaemic episodes were similar between biphasic insulin analogues thrice daily and basal bolus regimen<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>. But minor hypoglycaemic episodes were more in biphasic analogues thrice daily compared to biphasic human insulin twice daily, but this was not statistically significant<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>. Our study has shown that BHI thrice daily is equally safe when compared to the BB regimen in terms of hypoglycaemic episodes. The number of hypoglycaemic episodes were 12.1 and 9.2 episodes per patient year for the BHI and BB regimen, respectively, which were comparable to the other studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>. However subgroup analysis of minor hypoglycaemic events in our study showed more episodes of documented symptomatic hypoglycaemia in the patients treated with the BHI regimen, but all these episodes occurred during daytime and were managed by patients themselves.</p><p>The weight gain was similar in both the treatment groups. Therapy with detemir usually does not result in weight gain because of decreased risk of hypoglycaemia thereby reducing interprandial snacking and probably due to its selective appetite-modulating effect at hypothalamus<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>. Similar increase in weight was observed in both the groups despite significantly higher dose requirement in the BB regimen probably due to the beneficial effect of detemir on appetite. Also BHI thrice daily was much less expensive than the basal bolus analogues with comparable efficacy and safety.</p><p>The limitations of our study include less number of patients, higher HbA<sub>1</sub>c at baseline and inability to achieve target HbA<sub>1</sub>c as duration of the study was short. As patients with near target HbA<sub>1</sub>c are more prone for hypoglycaemic episodes, the safety of this BHI thrice a day regimen in such subjects needs to be further explored.</p><p>In conclusion, the biphasic insulin thrice daily regimen was found to be similar to the basal bolus analogues regimen in term of safety and efficacy.
