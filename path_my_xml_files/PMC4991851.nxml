IRE is a soft tissue ablation technique using ultra-short but strong electrical fields to create permanent and hence lethal nanopores in the cell membrane in order to disrupt cellular homeostasis (<xref rid="ref-5" ref-type="bibr">Davalos, Mir &#x00026; Rubinsky, 2005</xref>). The cell death results mainly from apoptosis and not necrosis as in all other thermal or radiation-based ablation techniques although local coagulation necrosis has been shown in the immediate proximity to the electrodes (<xref rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr">Ben-David et al., 2013</xref>). IRE is used for non-resectable liver tumors in the vicinity of vessels (due to its selectivity for tumor tissue while preserving vessel structures as well as the absence of the so-called heat sink effect) (<xref rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr">Rubinsky, Onik &#x00026; Mikus, 2007</xref>). IRE has also recently shown therapeutic efficacy and safety in other organs like pancreas and prostate (<xref rid="ref-9" ref-type="bibr">Martin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="ref-17" ref-type="bibr">Ting et al., 2016</xref>). First animal studies have shown the safety and feasibility of stereotactically delivered IRE for the treatment of telencephalic gliomas (<xref rid="ref-13" ref-type="bibr">Rossmeisl et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>IRE ablation requires the placement of two or more applicator electrodes between which the electrical fields are applied. In order to achieve successful ablation, parallel needle placement at a pre-defined distance between 1.5 cm and 2 cm is required. Mathematic models have shown that parallel placement of IRE electrodes is essential to generate an even distribution of the electromagnetic field (<xref rid="ref-6" ref-type="bibr">Edd &#x00026; Davalos, 2007</xref>). This fact was also shown in porcine animal model by <xref rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr">Ben-David et al. (2013)</xref> who investigated the therapeutic efficacy of IRE with regard to electrode orientation, tissue type and local environment.</p><p>Needles are placed under image guidance using ultrasound or computer tomography as imaging methods. Since these methods display one image plane at a time, the realization of multiple parallel needle placements can be challenging. Several attempts may be necessary to achieve the required geometrical configuration of the needle with respect to other needles and as well as in relation to the anatomical target.</p><p>Navigation technology for interventional radiology supports IRE treatments by providing comprehensive planning of needle configurations using 3D image data and by supporting needle placement through guidance functionality.</p><p>This study aims to investigate the potential benefits of CT-navigated stereotactic IRE (SIRE) needle placement compared to non-navigated conventional IRE (CIRE) for ablation of malignant liver lesions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Study design, participant selection and patient characteristics</title><p>In a prospective, non-blinded, non-randomized two-armed study carried out between July 2015 and February 2016, IRE ablations of malignant liver tumors were performed in 10 procedures with stereotactic navigation and 10 cases without. The primary end point of the study was the time required until start of the ablation (measured from the time of the first CT scan to the start of the ablation). Secondary endpoints included accuracy of IRE electrode placement (accuracy is measured as lateral deviation of the IRE electrodes to a central reference electrode); overall procedure time; number of needle replacements; radiation dose and number of control scans.</p><p>The study has been approved by the Ethics Committee of the University Regensburg (approval number 15-101-0188) and written consent was obtained from all patients. All procedures were performed according to the Declaration of Helsinki and the guideline for Good Clinical Practice from the International Conference on Harmonization.</p><p>In all cases, indication for percutaneous tumor ablation was determined by an interdisciplinary tumor board. An IRE was indicated if surgical resection was not possible, i.e., because no R0 resection was possible or an increased risk of insufficient hepatic functional reserve, and if radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and microwave ablation (MWA) were contraindicated. Exclusion criteria included any condition which, in the judgment of the clinical investigator or his designee, might increase the risk to the subject or decrease the chance of obtaining satisfactory data to achieve the objectives of the study. Patients with hereditary hematological / coagulation disorders unrelated to their liver disease were likewise excluded. Patients who were currently (within the last 30 days prior to surgery) participating in another clinical trial with any investigational drug or device were ruled out, as well as those patients undergoing liver surgery for the purpose of receiving a liver transplant.</p><p>The registration of the study (ISRCTN55383115) was applied after it was completed, since the project was initially conducted as an internal evaluation of the navigation device. In total the study comprised 20 IRE procedures performed on primary liver tumors and liver metastases in 20 patients (two female, 18 male, average age 66 years, age range 46&#x02013;81 years).

The difference of 12 mm in skin to tumor depth between both groups was neither clinically nor statistically significant.</p><p>IRE relies on increasing the permeability of the cell membrane based on nanopores induced by a strong electromagnetic field (<xref rid="ref-5" ref-type="bibr">Davalos, Mir &#x00026; Rubinsky, 2005</xref>). If the electrical field is powerful enough, the cell membrane is sufficiently damaged so that its integrity is permanently altered, allowing the induction of apoptosis in the cell (<xref rid="ref-18" ref-type="bibr">Yarmush et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="ref-7" ref-type="bibr">Jiang, Davalos &#x00026; Bischof, 2015</xref>). Although new bipolar IRE electrodes are being developed only monopolar electrodes are currently commercially available. These monopolar electrodes must be placed parallel in order to generate a sufficiently strong electromagnetic field within the entire tumor or ablation zone (<xref rid="ref-8" ref-type="bibr">Martin, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="ref-16" ref-type="bibr">Scheffer et al., 2015</xref>). The consequent complexity of probe placement results in significantly longer intervention times compared to thermal interventional methods. Thus, average intervention times of 86 min have been reported for RFA of liver tumors supported by CT fluoroscopy (<xref rid="ref-2" ref-type="bibr">Basdanis et al., 2004</xref>). On the other hand, intervention took an average of 170 min for percutaneous CIRE (<xref rid="ref-1" ref-type="bibr">Ball, Thomson &#x00026; Kavnoudias, 2010</xref>), primary due to the time-consuming manual placement of the individual probes using CT fluoroscopy.</p><p>Deviations detected in the course of control scans and resulting repositioning of individual probes represent a significant component of the distinctly longer intervention times for IRE when compared to thermal ablation. In this context, the evaluation of the benefit of stereotactic navigation technology for interventional radiology during IRE procedures was the primary aim of this study. It was demonstrated that 3D treatment planning on the navigation equipment resulted in an average planning time of 12.3 min. However, in the end, electrode placement in the course of SIRE was distinctly faster with 5.9 min per electrode, compared to 18.0 min during CIRE. This likewise resulted in a significant decrease in the total intervention time until ablation (104 min vs. 55 min; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001).</p><p>In the course of a prospective study of 70 patients, <xref rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr">Mbalisike et al. (2014)</xref> determined that robot-supported percutaneous microwave ablation provides very high precision. According to their measurements there was a minor average deviation of the active center of the microwave probe (1.9 mm) compared to the center of the tumor. Our own studies using robot-assisted MWA of a total of 64 liver tumors found a comparably minor deviation of 1.3 mm (<xref rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr">Beyer et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The distance of the electrodes from the tumor center is not a suitable measure for determining the accuracy of the placement of the IRE electrodes, since they have to be inserted in the periphery of the tumor as well as in the tumor center. Unlike thermal ablation procedures, exactly parallel insertion of the IRE probes into the liver tissue is decisive for therapeutic success. Therefore, in the course of our study, parallelism of the inserted electrodes was evaluated as such rather than their relation to the tumor center. As a result, for SIRE our study indicated an average deviation of 2.2 mm compared to 3.3 mm for insertion of electrodes using CT fluoroscopy.</p><p>Systematic errors, i.e., deviation of all probes in the same direction, cannot be ruled out with certainty by determining parallelism. Therefore, we view the short-term follow-up (after 6 weeks) as the best measure of the success of ablation. In all 20 cases, technically successful complete ablation was accomplished by both CIRE and SIRE.</p><p>In our study of percutaneous microwave ablation of malignant liver tumors, we showed that robot support significantly reduced radiation exposure (<xref rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr">Beyer et al., 2015</xref>). This applies to SIRE all the more as not only one, but several probes have to be inserted. Particularly great differences are seen in the DLP resulting from the use of CT fluoroscopy as well as in the total radiation exposure of the patient during the course of intervention (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table-4">Table 4</xref>).</p><p>During SIRE, the time-consuming manual placement of the ablation electrodes is omitted. Instead, by using an aiming device in the specified insertion position, supported by 3D planning and patient co-registration, the ablation electrodes could be inserted <italic>in situ</italic> as one step.</p><p>In near future SIRE is probably not only a suitable method just for IRE of hepatic malignancies, but also for treatment of deep-seated tumors in other anatomical regions. For example one study has reported substantially prolonged survival for IRE as part of multimodal treatment of locally advanced pancreatic cancer (<xref rid="ref-9" ref-type="bibr">Martin et al., 2015</xref>). The placement of IRE electrodes in the pancreas is highly challenging because of the anatomical characteristics, especially the long access path and immediate proximity to large vessels which are respected by the IRE procedure. Therefore, we think that SIRE might be of high value for treatment of pancreatic cancer, especially because of the high accuracy and fast electrode placement, supported by strong 3D planning tools. Further studies should be conducted to evaluate the benefits of SIRE for different anatomical regions.</p><p>This study has some limitations. The single-center setup and the low number of procedures limits generalization of our results. In particular, reported results for the CIRE are very operator dependent and may vary accordingly in different centers.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, SIRE may be associated with a marked reduction of procedure length and high accuracy compared to CIRE. Stereotactic navigation has the potential to reduce radiation dose for the patient without increasing the risk of complications or impaired technical success compared to CIRE. Due to the high accuracy and focal nonthermal ablation mechanism, SIRE might have the potential to be translated into the treatment of deep-seated tumors in other anatomical regions, e.g., pancreatic cancer, in a near future.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="supplemental-information"><title> Supplemental Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="supp-1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7717/peerj.2277/supp-1</object-id><label>Data S1</label><caption><title>Raw Data</title></caption><media xlink:href="peerj-04-2277-s001.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="supp-2"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7717/peerj.2277/supp-2</object-id><label>Supplemental Information 1</label><caption><title>TREND Statement Checklist</title></caption><media xlink:href="peerj-04-2277-s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional Information and Declarations</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interests"><title>Competing Interests</title><fn id="conflict-1" fn-type="conflict"><p>The authors declare there are no competing interests.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contributions"><title>Author Contributions</title><fn id="contribution-1" fn-type="con"><p><xref ref-type="contrib" rid="author-1">Lukas P.
