Few studies have examined the link between sustained attention and error processing. In this study, we examined how error-related negativity (ERN) of a four-choice reaction time task was reduced in the mental fatigue condition and investigated the role of sustained attention in error processing. Forty-one recruited participants were divided into two groups. In the fatigue experiment group, 20 subjects performed a fatigue experiment and an additional continuous psychomotor vigilance test (PVT) for 1 h. In the normal experiment group, 21 subjects only performed the normal experimental procedures without the PVT test. Fatigue and sustained attention states were assessed with a questionnaire. Event-related potential results showed that ERN (p &#x0003c; 0.005) and peak (p &#x0003c; 0.05) mean amplitudes decreased in the fatigue experiment. ERN amplitudes were significantly associated with the attention and fatigue states in electrodes Fz, FC1, Cz, and FC2. These findings indicated that sustained attention was related to error processing and that decreased attention is likely the cause of error processing impairment.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was supported by the National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program; No. 2011CB711003), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71201148), the Foundation of National Key Laboratory of Human Factors Engineering (Grant Nos.

Many human error accidents occur in human space flight [<xref rid="pone.0117837.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Error processing constitutes a chain of dynamic neurocognitive processes including error monitoring and behavioral adjustment and involving continuous checking of ongoing actions and mobilization of cognitive control and corrective action [<xref rid="pone.0117837.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117837.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Thus, error processing has significance in individual adaptation after an error, which might be considered as an index to assess the corrective action in a special task, such as rendezvous and docking in human space flights. Investigating the cognitive mechanism of error processing for its potential application in appropriate strategies to resolve errors is significant. Although numerous studies have been amassed on the cognitive mechanism of error processing, few studies have examined the influence of sustained attention on event-related potential (ERP) indices of error processing. The link between sustained attention and error processing, especially the quantitative relationship, might be an important theory foundation for personnel selection and training of specific positions, such as pilots and astronauts, in which human error is unacceptable. To a certain extent, error processing can be used to predict sustained attention based on the quantitative relationship.</p><p>Error processing was investigated with regard to its correlation with ERPs, such as error-related negativity (ERN) and error positivity (Pe) [<xref rid="pone.0117837.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117837.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0117837.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. ERN is a negative deflection in the ERP with approximate peaks from 50 ms to 100 ms after an incorrect response, which reaches its maximum at fronto-central scalp locations. Correct-related negativity (CRN) resembles ERN in latency, but usually has a smaller amplitude in the correct response [<xref rid="pone.0117837.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0117837.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Pe is a positive centro-parietal deflection occurring approximately 200 ms to 400 ms after erroneous responses [<xref rid="pone.0117837.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117837.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117837.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Numerous studies have investigated ERN of issues, such as the relationship between attention and ERN amplitude changes based on theory analysis, the relationship between error salience and ERN amplitude changes, and the relationship between effective state and ERN amplitude changes. However, the quantitative relationship between attention and ERN amplitude under the mental fatigue state has been seldom investigated. Moreover, how ERN changes in the fatigue state remains unclear. Attention is highly important in error processing as a central cognitive character. Conflict monitoring theory indicated that increased attention to task-relevant information resulted in enhanced ERN amplitude, whereas decreased attention to task-relevant information resulted in diminished ERN amplitudes [<xref rid="pone.0117837.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0117837.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Meanwhile, the dual-task design resulted in diminished ERN amplitudes [<xref rid="pone.0117837.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117837.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. ERN amplitudes also diminished when less attention resources were available for the primary task [<xref rid="pone.0117837.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0117837.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. However, previous studies focused only on the theoretical analysis of the relationship between attention and ERN amplitudes, without quantitative analysis of correlation and appropriate assessment of the attention state. Moreover, the definite type of attention related to ERN has also not been clearly presented. As such, the relationship between attention and ERN amplitudes remains debatable and unclear. How fatigue level may reduce ERN amplitudes remains unknown. The role of attention in ERN amplitude change is still unclear. Boksem et al. [<xref rid="pone.0117837.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] conducted a 2 h performance task to induce fatigue and then finished a 20 min flanker task. Results showed that ERN amplitudes and attention decreased, resulting in failure to monitor the error response. However, in the studies of Clayson et al. and Wiswede et al. [<xref rid="pone.0117837.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117837.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], a lower fatigue level was induced during the flanker task, which showed that ERN amplitudes may decrease or remain unchanged in the fatigue state. Different results of these studies may be caused by different fatigue levels. Attention was presented as one factor that can likely influence ERN amplitudes in mental fatigue based on theory analysis. However, a quantitative description of the relationship between attention and ERN was not provided in previous studies.</p><p>A variety of tasks, including the flanker, Go/NoGo, Stroop, SART, and two-choice reaction time (RT) tasks, were conducted in ERN research [<xref rid="pone.0117837.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117837.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0117837.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Whether ERN can be observed in different tasks, such as the four-choice RT task; how ERN amplitude changes in the fatigue state; and the quantitative relationship between sustained attention and ERN amplitudes were examined in this study. First, a 1 h psychomotor vigilance test (PVT) task was used to induce mental fatigue for the fatigue group. Then, the four-choice RT task was used for the two groups to evoke the error-related ERPs. The changes of ERN and Pe and the relationship between sustained attention and error processing in the two groups were investigated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Participants</title><p>Forty-one male volunteers from the China Astronaut Research and Training Center and BeiHang University participated in the study.

The ground electrode was positioned at AFz and the reference electrode was positioned at FCz on the forehead. Electrode impedances were kept below 5 k&#x02126;. Signals were recorded using the BrainVision Recorder (Brain Products GmbH) with an online low-pass filter (250 Hz). When an electrode reached 70% saturation, a direct current reset was applied. Sampling rate was 1,000 Hz and signals were amplified in the range of &#x000b1;3.27 mV at a resolution of 0.1 &#x003bc;V.</p><p>The EEG data were processed offline using the BrainVision Analyzer 2.0. Software (Brain Products GmbH). Tp9 and Tp10 were selected as the new reference (Brain Products GmbH). Then, EEG data were filtered using a band-pass filter from 0.01 Hz to 100 Hz. After filtration, the semiautomatic inspection method was implemented to inspect raw data. The gradient criterion was 50 &#x003bc;V/ms. The maximum absolute difference allowed was 200 &#x003bc;V and the interval length was 200 ms. Amplitude was between &#x02212;200 &#x003bc;V and 200 &#x003bc;V. The lowest allowed activity was 0.5 &#x003bc;V. After raw data inspection, the EEG signals were corrected for eye movement artifacts using the artifact rejection method based on Gratton and Coles&#x02019; algorithm, which was implemented in the BrainVision Analyzer 2.0 Software [<xref rid="pone.0117837.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The continuous EEG signals were filtered using a band-pass filter from 0.01 Hz to 35 Hz. Response-locked epochs with a length of 1,200 ms, including a 400 ms pre-response interval, were extracted. The trials with RT between 200 ms and 1,500 ms were used for ERP extraction. Response-locked amplitude averages were computed separately for each participant and each condition. Response-locked ERPs were baseline corrected for the interval from &#x02212;400 ms to 200 ms prior to the response. ERN and CRN were quantified as the mean and maximum amplitudes from 0 ms to 100 ms post-response. The Pe was quantified as the mean amplitude between the time window of 200 ms and 400 ms following the response. ERN, CRN, and Pe amplitudes were calculated at Fz, Cz, FC1, and FC2. Grand averages were filtered using a low-pass filter of 15 Hz for visual presentation.</p><p>The variance of ERN peak amplitudes in the two experiments were normally distributed, but were not homogenous (p &#x0003c; 0.05). The same was true for ERN mean amplitudes. As such, the repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) cannot be adopted for ERN peak/mean amplitudes. Only the nonparametric test could be used. The matrices of the CRN and Pe mean amplitudes in the two experiments were not equivalent (p &#x0003c; 0.01). Thus, the ANOVA could not be adopted for the CRN/Pe mean amplitudes. Only the nonparametric test can be used. The R language based on the F1 LD F1 model was used for the nonparametric ANOVA [<xref rid="pone.0117837.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. As such, the repeated measures ANOVA was used for the CPe mean amplitudes and nonparametric test was used for the other ERP data.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec012"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec013"><title>Behavioral Results</title><p>

The performance of the four-choice RT showed a declining trend in the fatigue condition, but without significant difference. The possible reasons of this finding are as follows: First, many factors may contribute to performance, such as motivation, which may compensate, to some degree, for the negative effects of fatigue on performance. Second, the induced fatigue level might not reach the level at which it would significantly decrease performance.</p><p>The degree of ERN amplitude changes was based on the fatigue level. This finding implied that fatigue level contributed to the different degrees of error processing impairment. A higher fatigue level may induce larger ERN amplitude changes. However, low fatigue levels may result in ERN amplitude without any changes, which was likely to occur because fatigue level was insufficient to decrease subject error processing, as observed by Clayson et al. and Wiswede et al. [<xref rid="pone.0117837.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117837.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, if fatigue level extended to the degree that subjects fail to monitor error in any case, ERN would disappear and be unobserved. Fatigue level in this investigation decreased ERN amplitudes, which was similar to the findings of Boksem et al. [<xref rid="pone.0117837.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The findings provide new evidence to supplement the study of Boksem et al. ERN amplitudes decreased from &#x02212;9.5 mV in Interval 1 to &#x02212;3.5 mV in Interval 6 in the study of Boksem et al. [<xref rid="pone.0117837.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The change level in the study of Boksem et al. was 0.63 ([&#x02212;9.5 &#x02212; (&#x02212;3.5)]/9.5). In this study, ERN amplitudes decreased from &#x02212;4.77 mV in the normal experiment group to &#x02212;1.96 mV in the fatigue experiment group at the Cz electrode. The change level is 0.59. This difference may be due to the varying fatigue levels. The relationships between the fatigue questionnaire and ERN amplitudes showed that increased sleepiness and fatigue might diminish ERN amplitudes. The results showed that fatigue was negatively related to error processing. Further investigation should focus on higher fatigue level effects on ERN amplitudes.</p><p>The active areas of ERN may be modulated in the fatigue state. <xref rid="pone.0117837.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3(B)</xref> shows that ERN amplitudes were more negative in the normal experiment group. Moreover, the active areas were wider. The active areas of ERN were consistent with those of previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0117837.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117837.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Impaired error processing in the fatigue state may inhibit nerve activity in some areas.</p><p>Mental fatigue can reduce attention, which is important for error processing [<xref rid="pone.0117837.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117837.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117837.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The results of this study showed that sustained attention state was an important factor influencing ERN amplitudes. The correlations between attention and ERN mean amplitudes showed that attention was significantly and negatively associated with ERN amplitudes, which denoted a linear negative relationship between ERN amplitudes and sustained attention state (which means more negative ERN amplitudes with better attention). This finding further proved that the reduced sustained attention state may be the factor that inhibited error processing and decreased ERN amplitudes. The functional diagram shows that the fatigue state decreased sustained attention. Subsequently, decreased sustained attention affected error processing and diminished ERN amplitudes. The degree of change was in line with the attention levels, which was proven by the relationships between attention and ERN amplitudes. This observation provided new evidence to support the conclusion of Boksem et al., which indicated that error processing was impaired in fatigued subjects and decreased attention may be one of the possible influencing factors (see also [<xref rid="pone.0117837.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117837.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]).</p><p>The fatigue state could inhibit the activity of the nervous system and decrease cognitive abilities [<xref rid="pone.0117837.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117837.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The results of the fatigue questionnaire revealed that sustained attention of the subjects decreased in the fatigue experiment. This finding indicates that lesser attention can be used to finish the task, which may impair error processing and thus may decrease ERN amplitudes. Moreover, with less attention after the response, less error processing was performed by the subjects. The same was true for decreased ERN amplitudes [<xref rid="pone.0117837.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In other words, the sustained attention state related to the task could inhibit error processing as the task was being undertaken and after the response. This observation was in line with previous studies, which showed increased ERN/CRN with increased attention to response accuracy [<xref rid="pone.0117837.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117837.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117837.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117837.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0117837.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The relationships between ERN amplitudes and sustained attention presented in this study provided new evidence for this.</p></sec><sec id="sec018"><title>Post-Error Slowing and ERN</title><p>Post-error slowing was observed separately in the normal and fatigue experiments groups. Post-error RT was longer than post-correct RT in both experiments. The oral reports of the subjects on errors during the experiment were recorded. The results of the oral reports and post-error slowing showed that the subjects were aware of the error response. This observation was consistent with the results of other previous studies, where post-error slowing was observed for aware errors [<xref rid="pone.0117837.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117837.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].</p><p>The relationship between post-error slowing and ERN was not observed, but the relationship between post-error slowing and Pe in the Cz electrode was observed.

Alternatively, as proposed by Notebaert and colleagues, post-error slowing might reflect an unspecific orienting response rather than an adaptive implementation of cognitive control [<xref rid="pone.0117837.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>].</p><p>The post-error slowing of fatigue exhibited a declining trend, but without significant difference in both experiments. The same was true for the error RT. We did not observe a correlation between post-error slowing and ERN, which was consistent with the findings of other studies [<xref rid="pone.0117837.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117837.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117837.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117837.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117837.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The oral reports and error results showed that few subjects corrected their incorrect responses and often continued with the response, even when they were reported as errors. As such, post-error slowing may not be positively associated with the increase in accuracy and behavioral adaptation. The observation was consistent with the findings of Danielmeier and Ullsperger, who observed that dissociation between post-error slowing and post-error improvement in accuracy was common [<xref rid="pone.0117837.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117837.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. This finding implied that different mechanisms might contribute to these effects. Another study revealed that, in the case of post-error slowing, these mechanisms were not necessarily adaptive [<xref rid="pone.0117837.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec019"><title>Emotion and Error Processing</title><p>Although verbal reports were used, the emotional factor was not considered a strictly controlled variable to examine the relationships.

Sustained attention is one of the key capabilities to maintain error processing. The results of the quantitative relationship between sustained attention and ERN amplitudes showed that impaired error processing under the fatigue experiment was most likely affected by decreased sustained attention. Therefore, sustained attention may be one factor that could diminish ERN amplitudes. The current finding will provide a foundation for human error prevention in real tasks by selecting appropriate task-related personnel, who is good at error processing and mobilization of corrective action. The relationships between ERN and post-error slowing were not observed, indicating that post-error slowing may not be positively associated with the increase in accuracy and behavioral adaptation. Novel sustained attention assessment methods and theories should be further studied in future research, which will help us understand the role of sustained attention in error processing.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec021"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0117837.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>S1_Dataset.</title><p>Data of ERP, Questionnaire and Performance.</p><p>(RAR)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0117837.s001.rar"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0117837.s002"><label>S2 File</label><caption><title>S2_highlights.</title><p>Highlights of the manuscript.</p><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0117837.s002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0117837.s003"><label>S3 File</label><caption><title>S3_CERTIFICATE OF ENGLISH EDITING.</title><p>CERTIFICATE OF ENGLISH EDITING.</p><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0117837.s003.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was supported by the National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program; No. 2011CB711003), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71201148), the Foundation of National Key Laboratory of Human Factors Engineering (Grant Nos.
