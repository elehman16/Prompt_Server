In the current study, the effects of a Korean pine nut oil product, PinnoThin&#x02122;, at doses 2 g, 4 g and 6 g triglyceride (TG) and 2 g free fatty acid (FFA), on food intake and appetite were examined in a cross-over double-blind placebo-controlled randomised counter-balanced design in 42 overweight female volunteers. 2 g FFA PinnoThin&#x02122;, given 30 minutes prior to an ad-libitum buffet test lunch, significantly reduced food intake (gram) by 9% (F(4,164) = 2.637, p = 0.036) compared to olive oil control. No significant effect of PinnoThin&#x02122; on macronutrient intake or ratings of appetite were observed. Given the recent data showing that the TG form of PinnoThin&#x02122; may also reduce appetite by increasing CCK release, the lack of any effect of the TG form found in this study could be attributed to the timing of the dosing regime. Collectively, these data suggest that PinnoThin&#x02122; may exert satiating effects consistent with its known action on CCK and GLP-1 release, and previously observed effects on self-reported appetite ratings.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Estimations of energy balance suggest that an increase in daily caloric intake of 50 kcal more than energy expenditure can result in a yearly increase in body weight of 1 or 2 kilos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] contributing to the development of obesity. To correct this positive energy balance one strategy in the arena of weight management and prevention of obesity is the control of food intake via natural appetite suppressants.</p><p>The roles of different macronutrients in appetite suppression have been extensively studied. While it has generally been accepted that protein and fibre-rich foods produce strong satiety responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], high fat foods in particular have been regarded as having a comparatively weaker impact on appetite regulatory mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In fact a weakened satiety response to fatty meals has been associated with a susceptibility to weight gain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Despite this, dietary fat in the gastro-intestinal tract has been demonstrated to trigger the release of the satiety gut hormones cholecystokinin (CCK) in the proximal small intestine (duodenum), and glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) in the distal small intestine (ileum). The effects of fat on appetite expression have long been associated with the CCK response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Moreover, in human volunteers, exogenous CCK infusions reduce food intake and enhance satiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. GLP-1 is released in response to nutrients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] such as carbohydrate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and fat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In humans, peripheral GLP-1 infusions have been shown to significantly enhance the satiating potential of a fixed caloric load [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] and also produce a reduction in intake at ad-libitum meals, effects which are associated with reductions in hunger and enhancements in satiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>The release of endogenous CCK and GLP-1 suggests, paradoxically, that fat could exert strong effects on the development of satiation and the strength of post-meal satiety, despite an association between high fat over-consumption and obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Chain length and degree of saturation may be important properties when considering the effect of fat on the expression of human appetite. Feinle and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] demonstrated that duodenal infusions of long chain triglycerides produced greater effects on hunger and plasma CCK levels than medium chain triglycerides, an effect dependent on hydrolysis of the triglyceride (TG) to free fatty acid (FFA) form. Feltrin et al., (2004) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] also demonstrated that duodenal infusions of FFA of a chain length of C12 produced more potent effects on food intake, appetite expression, CCK and GLP-1 release compared with a FFA of chain length of C10. With regard to saturation, Lawton et al., (2000) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] demonstrated that polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) of a chain length C18, exert a stronger effect on appetite expression than monounsaturated (MUFA) and saturated (SFA) equivalent C18 forms. Degree of saturation (MUFA versus SFA) also appears to affect endogenous GLP-1 response to high fat meals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Therefore, the divergent effects of fats, both in chain length and saturation, on CCK and GLP-1 release, and the expression of appetite, have implications for energy balance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>PinnoThin&#x02122; is a natural oil pressed from Korean pine nuts (<italic>Pinus Koraiensis</italic>) and consists of 92% of PUFAs and MUFAs, mainly pinolenic acid (C18:3), linoleic acid (C18:2) and oleic acid (C18:1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Nut consumption is popular worldwide and has been linked with satiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Pine nuts have long been constituent parts of the diets of many cultures, particularly in the Mediterranean and Asian regions, and they are now also consumed very widely outside these geographical areas. In vitro studies on Korean pine nut fatty acids have shown an increase in the release of CCK-8 from STC-1 cells vs. Fatty acids from Italian stone pine nuts and also several other dietary mono and poly unsaturated fatty acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. It has recently been shown that PinnoThin&#x02122; stimulates endogenous CCK and GLP-1 release in overweight women when simultaneously consumed with a fixed load breakfast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] and thereby has the potential to reduce prospective food intake.</p><p>There is however no information on whether PinnoThin&#x02122; can actually reduce food consumption. Therefore, the current study was designed to assess the impact of PinnoThin&#x02122; on human food intake and appetite expression. The present study had three aims: 1) to determine whether PinnoThin&#x02122;, given prior to consumption of a test meal, would produce a significant reduction in kilocalorie (kcal) intake in a subsequent ad-libitum meal, 2) to determine if any hypophagia produced by effective doses of PinnoThin&#x02122; were accompanied by appropriate changes in pre- and post-meal appetite ratings indicating any satiety enhancing properties, and 3) to demonstrate that any supplement-induced reductions in food intake were associated with a durable rather than a transient satiety response, consistent with the reported physiological mechanism of action. By examining ad-libitum intake at an evening meal it will be possible to determine if any initial reductions in food intake produced by PinnoThin&#x02122; are compensated for by over consumption at later eating opportunities.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Participants</title><p>The study commenced in June 2006 and was completed in February 2007.

Nuts have been studied for their satiation ability and contain fiber, protein and oil and are highly nutritious. Many cultures use Korean pine nuts in popular dishes. Korean Pine nut oil (PinnoThin &#x02122;) which is high in pinolenic acid has previously been shown to increase CCK in STC-1 cell culture and to have effects on satiety in response to a fixed caloric load, such as increasing concentrations of CCK and GLP-1 in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Specific changes in satiety measures was observed in prospective food consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the effects of PinnoThin&#x02122; on subsequent food intake in an ad-libitum meal. PinnoThin&#x02122;FFA produced a significant 9% reduction in ad-libitum food intake thirty minutes after dosing compared with the placebo control. No differences between PinnoThin&#x02122; and the placebo were seen at the evening meal, suggesting that there is no compensation for the lesser food intake during lunch. No effect was produced by any of the three doses (2 g, 4 g or 6 g) of the PinnoThin&#x02122; TG.</p><p>No adverse effects related to the study product were reported by participants during the full study period or at post-study debriefing. No significant effect of product on nausea was observed on study days. This indicates that PinnoThin TG at various doses and PinnoThin FFA 2 g were all well tolerated by the forty-two participants who completed the study.</p><p>The reduced food intake of 9% corresponded to a 7% (50 kcal) reduction in energy intake. Although this reduction was not statistically significant, probably due to lack of power (power calculations were based on a 10% difference), a reduction of 50 kcal is potentially biologically relevant. Brown et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] estimated that the average weight gain in a female population equates with an energy imbalance of only 10&#x02013;40 kcal per day. Post-hoc paired t-test revealed that the difference in kcal intake between the control and FFA condition would have been significant in a one-way test. The slight disparity between the magnitude of gram and kcal intake reduction between the control and the FFA condition could suggest small treatment induced effects of food choice i.e. a greater reduction in the intake of less energy dense foods. However, no difference was seen between the intake of macronutrients, sweet/savoury or high/low fat foods.</p><p>Both the PinnoThin&#x02122; FFA and TG forms have been shown to have an effect on satiety by increasing levels of CCK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. While the PinnoThin FFA reduced food intake, the lack of effect of any dose of the PinnoThin&#x02122;TG on food intake in this trial remains unclear. Feinle et al., (2001) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] demonstrated that duodenal infusions of a long chain TG can produce potent effects on plasma CCK levels and significantly reduce hunger. This is consistent with the known mechanisms of CCK release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. In the Feinle study, effects of TG on CCK response and appetite were blocked by the lipase inhibitor tetrahydrolipstatin. Therefore, the uptake and metabolism of the precursor triglycerides to the FFA form, the latter of which is responsible for CCK and GLP-1 release, is needed to induce satiety.</p><p>In the current study, the digestion of pine nut oil TG to FFA form was not assessed. However, there is no reason to believe that the actions of lipases were inhibited in any way. The lack of effect may be explained by insufficient time passed between the intake of the TG capsules and the ad-libitum lunch for lipase action to convert sufficient TG to FFA. In this way there could have been an insufficient rise in endogenous CCK response to significantly reduce intake at any TG dose. In support of this notion, it is known that uptake of fat from capsules taken with water and without simultaneous ingestion of food is delayed (personal communication from Dr Rob Havenaar TNO Research Zeist, The Netherlands). Also, in a previous study with PinnoThin&#x02122; the effects on CCK response took longer to develop for the TG compared to the FFA (60 min rather than 30 min) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. A long term trial including 188 overweight men and women showed that pinolenic acid was present in the blood at 4 and 8 months after daily supplementation with 3 g of PinnoThin&#x02122; TG whereas none was present in the control (olive oil) group (unpublished results). This shows that PinnoThin&#x02122; TG is normally taken up and digested, i.e. FFA are released after ingestion of PinnoThin&#x02122;TG. When comparing FFA to TG it also has to be taken into account that the total amount of FFA will become available, whereas only two out of the three fatty acids will become available for the TG. An effect seen after 2 g of FFA should therefore be compared with an effect of at least 3 g for the TG.</p><p>The mechanism of effect of PinnoThin&#x02122; is based on the increase in satiety hormones seen in an earlier study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. The effect of PinnoThin&#x02122; on intestinal hormone release is most likely mediated through chylomicron formation. Fatty acids with a chain length of more than 12 carbon atoms are absorbed into the circulation as chylomicrons. A study in rats has shown that suppression of food intake by long chain fatty acids is inhibited by blocking of chylomicron transport through specific inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. CCK signaling pathways are closely related to the transport of chylomicrons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. The fact that only fatty acids with more than 12 carbon atoms induce CCK speaks in favour of this mechanism. This suggests that the fatty acids from PinnoThin&#x02122; particularly affect chylomicron formation or transport and thereby influence release of CCK. This release leads to a delay in gastric emptying and in turn to an increased feeling of satiety and a decreased appetite. Overall, despite the lack of the TG form to affect intake or appetite in this trial, these data are consistent with the notion that fats have divergent effects on the expression of appetite.</p><p>However, whilst CCK release from the proximal small intestine may be critical in the acute effects of PinnoThin&#x02122; on within meal satiation or immediate post meal satiety, such effects may not explain any observed reductions in food intake across the whole day or any purported long-term effects body weight. A variety of CCK anti-obesity drugs in early clinical development have failed to progress in later clinical trials presumably in part because of a lack of efficacy beyond an initial reduction in hunger. PinnoThin&#x02122; induced GLP-1 released from the distal small intestine may be of more importance in suppressing post-meal intake by sustaining inter-meal satiety. The relative contributions of these two hormones to the effects of PinnoThin&#x02122; on within-meal satiation, post-meal satiety and associated changes in body weight over repeated dosing remain to be clarified. In should also be noted it has been shown that co-administration of CCK (in the form of CCK-33) and GLP-1 does not produce an additive suppression of food intake, although their effects on pre-meal hunger were greater than when administered separately [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>PinnoThin&#x02122; in both FFA and TG forms was well tolerated. PinnoThin&#x02122; FFA employed in this study produced a reduction in gram food intake consistent with previously reported effects on appetite and CCK response. The lack of significant effects of PinnoThin&#x02122;TG on food intake and appetite does not necessarily suggest that the TG form is ineffective. Comparative data on PinnoThin&#x02122; FFA and TG forms has become available since the study design which suggests that the TG produces a delayed response on gut hormone release. The time taken for TG to break down into FFA form in the human gut is unknown, and this could explain the delay. Similarly the effects of TG on gut hormone release appear to differ in magnitude.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Participants</title><p>Forty-two healthy women, aged 18&#x02013;64, with a body mass index (BMI) between 25&#x02013;30 kg/m<sup>2 </sup>completed the study.

Study doses were administered acutely in a counterbalanced sequence. Each treatment was separated by a week. At the end of five visits every participant had received each of the five treatments. The sample size was calculated on the basis of the previous clinical trial of the FFA form of PinnoThin&#x02122; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Randomisation to the study was by means of Latin squares [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Allocation of participants to condition using the Latin Square was performed by the experimenter. The company independently randomly assigned the five doses to the five conditions (A-E).</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and tools</title><p>Amount of food and water was recorded by weight scales (Sartorius Model BP8100, Sartorius Ltd., Epsom, UK; 0.1 g accuracy) before and after meals to ascertain intake. Visual Analogue Scales (VAS) were used to rate degrees of hunger, fullness, satisfaction, desire to eat, perception of how much participants could eat (prospective consumption), thirst and nausea. VAS consist of 100 mm horizontal lines anchored by "not at all" and "extremely" at opposite ends, upon which participants record with a vertical line their subjective ratings. For example, hunger was rated along a 100 mm line that was preceded by the question "how hungry do you feel at this moment?" and anchored on the left by "not at all hungry" and on the right by "extremely hungry". These questionnaires were completed immediately before and after each meal, before the supplement and at hourly intervals throughout the test day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>].</p><p>PinnoThin&#x02122; and placebo were supplied in the form of six capsules per dose per test day. Each capsule contained 1 g of oil and in total the subjects received 2 g, 4 g or 6 g PinnoThin&#x02122; Triglyceride (TG), or 2 g of PinnoThin&#x02122; free fatty acid (FFA), with 2, 4 or 6 g of olive oil (placebo) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). Olive oil was chosen as a placebo, based on the fatty acid content of PinnoThin&#x02122; and its wide use in the diet. Olive oil consists mainly of oleic acid, which is also found in PinnoThin&#x02122; (25%). Furthermore, the other main fatty acids in PinnoThin&#x02122; are linoleic (46%) and pinolenic acid (15%), both having the same chain length as oleic acid (C18). Olive oil was therefore thought to be an appropriate control. The fatty acid components of the product and placebo are shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>.

Because breakfast was fixed, this was not included in the statistical analysis. Intake at lunch was analysed in relation to macronutrient content using a 2-way within-subjects ANOVA with condition (0 g, 2 g, 4 g, 6 g PinnoThin TG, and 2 g PinnoThin FFA) and macronutrient (fat, carbohydrate and protein) as within subject factors. The 20 food items offered at the ad-libitum lunch were further analysed according to variation in fat content and taste. Foods were grouped into high fat savoury (HFSA), low fat savoury (LFSA), high fat sweet (HFSW), low fat sweet (LFSW) and fruit and vegetables (FTVG) sets. These food groups were analysed using a 2-way within-subjects ANOVA with condition (0 g, 2 g, 4 g, 6 g PinnoThin TG, and 2 g PinnoThin FFA) and taste (HFSA, LFSA, HFSW and LFSW) as within-subjects factors. The secondary outcome measures of the study were changes in ratings of appetite such as hunger, fullness, prospective consumption, and desire to eat, assessing the nature of any product-induced reductions in food intake. These parameters rated on the VAS were analysed using within-subject ANOVA for repeated measures with condition (0 g, 2 g, 4 g, 6 g PinnoThin TG, 2 g PinnoThin FFA) and time (pre-breakfast, post-breakfast, 10 am, 11 am, 12 pm, pre-dose, pre-lunch, post-lunch, 2 pm, 3 pm, 4 pm, pre-supper and post-supper) as within-subject factors. If a time-by-condition interaction effect was found significant, paired t-tests would have been conducted at each rating time between conditions. Z-score analysis (individual scores measured against the mean of all other scores) was used to identify outliers. Scores of &#x0003c;-2 or &#x0003e;+2 were considered outliers and analysis was re-run following removal of outliers. Analysis was performed using SPSS for Windows, Version 13 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, US). The assumptions of the ANOVA model were tested and if homogeneity of variance was not found, multivariate tests were adopted for that variable. All tests are two-tailed unless stated. The data remained blinded until after the primary and secondary outcomes were analysed.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>Lipid Nutrition is involved in research/development and marketing/sales of Pinnothin as a satiety ingredient.
