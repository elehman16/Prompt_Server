It is necessary because deposits of calculus on root surfaces are frequently embedded in cemental irregularities, which contain bacterial endotoxins that penetrate into the cementum. Therefore, careful subgingival SRP is an effective means to eliminate gingivitis and reduce the probing depth even at sites with initially deep periodontal pockets.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>]</p><p>The world of periodontics has seen a rapid change in the last 30 years with ever improving treatment modalities. New diagnostic instruments and surgical techniques were embraced by the periodontists all over the world. Vast array of instruments and equipments such as micro ultrasonics, endoscope, Lasers and magnification tools are available to achieve a biologically acceptable root surface. However, there is still a lack of information regarding the efficacy of SRP by using magnification. Magnification is becoming an increasingly important requirement for high quality contemporary dentistry. Magnifying Loupes (ML), dental operating microscope (DOM) are the common magnification tools used in the dental practice, providing distinct advantages to the clinician such as illumination, magnification and increased precision in the delivery of operating skills.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>]</p><p>Limited data is available in the literature regarding the use of magnification for performing SRP. Hence, the present research was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of supragingival and subgingival SRP with and without the use of ML and DOM, based on the results of microanalysis of root surface post SRP, by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), elemental analysis of root surface by energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX) and micro morphology of root surface by atomic force microscopy (AFM).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Study was conducted in the Department of Periodontology.

</p><p>Before extracting the teeth, area was marked with the help of a round bur, making a first linear groove at the location of the gingival margin to designate supragingival area, (distance between cementoenamel junction and the marked groove). Teeth were then extracted avoiding trauma to the root surface and were placed in 1% methylene blue for 2 min to stain the attached tissues and second linear groove was marked at the level of junctional epithelium demarcating the subgingival area (distance between the first and second groove). Teeth in three different groups were then placed in normal saline and transported for AFM and SEM along with EDAX analysis. Samples from all surfaces, supragingival and subgingival area were selected and a 1 mm &#x000d7; 2 mm &#x000d7; 1 mm thick slice of each surface and area to be analyzed was cut with the help of diamond disc.

It seems reasonable that there could be different elemental make-ups of hard tissue, even to the density and concentration of such constants as Ca and P. Concentrations did not vary to a great extent within the same root. Perhaps deep within the periodontal pocket, it is the organic phase of cementum that is affected by periodontal disease, but not the mineral phase as shown in various other studies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] Presence of minerals such as Cu, Zn and Mg are normal inorganic structures found in cementum of diseased and non-diseased root. This observation is in consistent with findings obtained by Barton and Van Swol,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>] which stated that any differences in the elements concentration noted within the root structure could be due to the concentration of these ions in body fluids during tooth formation. It is also possible that the dietary intake and ion exchange after tooth eruption could be reflected within the roots.</p><p>It was observed from the present study that magnification tools significantly enhance the efficacy of supra gingival and sub gingival SRP. Magnifying loupe with limited magnification showed better results than the unaided group. DOM proved to be the best aid in producing smooth root surface free of debris, calculus, scratches etc., and eliminating diseased cementum effectively.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Cobb</surname><given-names>CM</given-names></name><name><surname>Drisko</surname><given-names>CH</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Parameter on chronic periodontitis with slight to moderate loss of periodontal support.
