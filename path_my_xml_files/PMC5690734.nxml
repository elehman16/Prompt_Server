Chemotherapy combined with anti-CD20 antibodies has significantly improved outcomes in patients with DLBCL. However, relapse prevention with such interventions has not been established for DLBCL or other aggressive lymphomas.<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup></p><p>Because it can improve long-term survival, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) chemotherapy has been selected as the first-line treatment for DLBCL.<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup> The curative effect of CHOP is supposedly improved by combining rituximab with CHOP (R-CHOP). However, no randomized controlled trial has compared CHOP with R-CHOP in a Chinese population with DLBCL.</p><p>In this study, we tested the hypothesis that R-CHOP could improve the curative rate in Chinese patients with DLBCL.</p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec><label>2.1</label><title>Design</title><p>This randomized controlled trial recruited 144 Chinese patients with DLBCL. It was conducted at Affiliated Tumor Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University from January 2012 to December 2016. It was approved by the Medical Ethical Committee of Affiliated Tumor Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University. All eligible patients were identified and selected by the inclusion/exclusion criteria. All included patients were randomly divided and allocated to the intervention group or the control group in a 1:1 allocation ratio.</p></sec><sec><label>2.2</label><title>Inclusion and exclusion criteria</title><p>The inclusion criteria were previously untreated adults aged from 18 to 75 years. All patients were diagnosed with CD20-positive aggressive DLBCL, according to the World Health Organization classification. In addition, they all had achieved a complete remission (CR) or a CR unconfirmed (CRu) according to the 1999 response criteria for malignant lymphoma.<sup>[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup> All patients received complete induction treatment 4 weeks before the intervention of this study. This induction treatment included 6 infusions of rituximab (375&#x0200a;mg/m<sup>2</sup> IV) plus four to 6 cycles of chemotherapy with CHOP as first-line treatment. Additionally, patients had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status score of 0 to 2 at the inclusion time, and all of them provided and signed written informed consent.</p><p>Subjects were excluded for pregnancy, transformed lymphoma, serious nervous system diseases, uncontrolled cardiac disease, hematopoietic insufficiency, abnormal renal or liver function, active opportunistic infections, active hepatitis B or C, or positivity for human immunodeficiency virus.</p></sec><sec><label>2.3</label><title>Randomization and blinding</title><p>SAS 8.1 software (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC) was used to perform the randomization by a computerized number generator with the stratified block randomization method. Then, the randomization assignments were concealed in opaque, sequentially numbered, sealed envelopes. The patients, researchers, outcome assessors, and the data analyst were blinded to the treatment allocation.</p></sec><sec><label>2.4</label><title>Participants and recruitment</title><p>All patients were recruited through the clinic of the Lymphoma Department, Affiliated Tumor Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University, and this study was conducted at the same hospital. All patients were allocated and randomized to either the intervention group or control group after the clinical and patient eligibility evaluation. All investigators were trained in their tasks before the start of this study. The patients were informed about the research and given an information sheet.</p></sec><sec><label>2.5</label><title>Intervention</title><p>The patients in both groups received CHOP chemotherapy. In addition to this therapy, patients in the intervention group also received rituximab by intravenous infusion at a dose of 375&#x0200a;mg/m<sup>2</sup> every 2 months for 1 year.</p></sec><sec><label>2.6</label><title>Outcome measurements</title><p>The primary outcome was progression-free survival (PFS). The secondary outcomes included overall survival rate (OSR) and adverse events (AEs). Overall survival was defined as the time from random assignment or registration to death as a result of any cause. PFS was defined as the time from random assignment or registration to disease progression, relapse, or death as a result of any cause. In patients who did not show disease progression at the time treatment was discontinued, PFS assessment continued until progression was documented.</p></sec><sec><label>2.7</label><title>Adverse events</title><p>All AEs were recorded at each visit. All safety data for all included patients were analyzed and included in the analysis.</p></sec><sec><label>2.8</label><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The estimated sample size was 60 patients in each group with &#x003b1;&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.05 (2-sided) and &#x003b2;&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.20. Assuming a 20% dropout rate, at least 144 patients with 72 in each group needed to be recruited to this study. All outcome data were analyzed by an intention to treat approach. The Kaplan&#x02013;Meier method was used to analyze the data.</p></sec></sec><sec><label>3</label><title>Results</title><p>Two hundred fifteen patients with DLBCL were initially assessed for eligibility for the study (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Of those 215 patients, 71 were excluded because they did not meet the inclusion criteria, and 12 declined to participate. Finally, 144 patients were randomly assigned to the intervention or control group, 72 patients for each group. At the end of treatment, 134 patients completed the intervention.

These findings are consistent with those of other studies showing that CHOP chemotherapy combined with rituximab did not prolong event free, progression-free, or overall survival of patients with aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma.<sup>[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup></p><p>A previous systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrated that after first-line chemotherapy, 2 rituximab-combined treatment strategies, including maintenance and salvage therapies, had a survival benefit<sup>[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup>; however, due to the few included eligible studies and their low methodological quality, they did not reach a firm conclusion that rituximab combined with CHOP could improve the curative rate in Chinese patients with DLBCL.<sup>[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup></p><p>In this study, we also found that rituximab combined with CHOP could not increase the OS or PFS in Chinese patients with DLBCL, which suggests that the combination of rituximab and CHOP cannot improve the curative rates for patients with DLBCL in China. In addition, both groups had a similar safety profile, with no significant differences in any AEs between groups.</p><p>However, this study also had several limitations. First, this study was only performed at the Affiliated Tumor Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University, and most of the participants were of Uyghur ethnicity, which may have had an influence on the generalizability of our findings to patients of other ethnicities, especially the Han ethnicity, and other hospitals. Furthermore, although all investigators received training before this study, the variety of their experience levels may have resulted in bias during the period of the intervention.</p><p>We demonstrated that the administration of rituximab combined with CHOP could not improve the curative rate over CHOP alone in Chinese patients with DLBCL, and both groups had similar AEs.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: AEs = adverse events, CHOP = cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone, CR = complete remission, CRu = CR unconfirmed, DLBCL = diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, ECOG = Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group, OSR = overall survival rate, R-CHOP = rituximab combined with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone, RFS = relapse-free survival.</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>[1]</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Coiffier</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Lepage</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Briere</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><etal/></person-group>
