The use of surrogate end points provides a powerful tool to accelerate and make decisions more efficient. It reduces the cost and duration of clinical trials during the exploratory phase of drug development and can be accepted by regulatory agencies (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Specifically for diseases with risk of death or severe incapacity, this issue acquires vital importance. Surrogate end points can be measured earlier and more frequently, so the adherence to treatment is greater and less influenced by concomitant interventions than the final outcome.</p><p>Some authors (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) have demonstrated that variables based on early wound area reduction (i.e., after 4 weeks of treatment), such as the percent change in area, log healing rate, or log area ratio, can be used as surrogate end points for later complete wound re-epithelization (i.e., at 12 or 20 weeks of care) in patients that receive different treatments for diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs). However, these analyses were performed for neuropathic, relatively small (median size &#x0003c;5 cm<sup>2</sup>) ulcers. It is not clear whether they can be extrapolated to more advanced, larger lesions, including ischemic ones. In a more complicated scenario (large, chronic, nonischemic diabetic foot wounds after partial foot amputation), the percent of wound area reduction at 1 and 4 weeks was proposed as predictor of healing at 16 weeks (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Advanced DFUs that fall in Wagner classification grades 3 and 4 (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), sometimes ischemic, and &#x0003e;10 cm<sup>2</sup> are an unmet medical need that frequently lead to limb amputation (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). For these advanced ulcers, the study of surrogate end points is more difficult because of complications, possible evolution to amputation, and the scarcity of effective treatments.</p><p>The use of surrogate markers in this particular area, due to the large and complex process to achieve complete healing, is recognized (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) as well as the necessity to facilitate the product development cycle, specifying in each case the true efficacy on the treated wounds and adjusting the regulatory requirements. These authors identified some potential intermediate end points, such as the development of granulation tissue, readiness for grafting, reduction of colonization, and others, depending on the wound therapy evaluated.</p><p>Granulation has been used as an outcome in clinical trials on DFUs (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) since it is part of the healing process and should necessarily precede the final lesion closure. Besides, granulation over the ulcer area permits skin grafting to attain final healing, so some patients do not reach complete wound closure to be evaluated. In a randomized, placebo-controlled trial, recombinant human epidermal growth factor (rhEGF) was applied intralesionally in Wagner 3 or 4 DFUs up to complete wound granulation or a maximum of 8 weeks. In these subjects, a highly significant correlation between complete healing and &#x0003e;50% granulation at 2 weeks of treatment or &#x0003e;75% granulation at the end of treatment (EOT) (median, 5 weeks) was found (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). This granulation-healing correlation suggested that these variables could be used as surrogates. Multivariate analyses in this trial identified a significant influence of rhEGF treatment, ulcer etiology (neuropathic or ischemic), and initial size on wound closure.</p><p>The purpose of this work was to determine if the surrogate markers proposed for the neuropathic, small DFUs can be extended to advanced, Wagner grade 3 and 4 ulcers, including ischemic ones, and if the development of granulation tissue can be used to predict complete healing.</p><sec id="s1"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><p>Data from two multicenter, double-blind, randomized clinical trials were used to test the surrogate variables proposed for neuropathic DFUs and to explore the correlation between granulation tissue development (the main efficacy variable of the studies) and complete healing during follow-up for 1 year after the EOT (median time to complete closure, 15 weeks; 25th percentile, 9.6 weeks; 75th percentile, 21.4 weeks). In the first study, a dose-exploratory trial in five hospitals (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), patients were randomized to receive intralesional injections of rhEGF at 75 (23 subjects) or 25 &#x000b5;g (18 subjects), three times per week. In the second study, a confirmatory trial in 20 hospitals (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), 53 subjects were randomized to rhEGF 75 &#x000b5;g, 48 to rhEGF 25 &#x000b5;g, and 48 to a placebo group. Each patient had only one lesion, so the total number of ulcers included in the analyses was 190. For confirmation in a larger sample from common clinical practice, the results of an active postmarketing surveillance of rhEGF treatment in 1,440 DFUs in 60 healthcare units (41 hospitals and 19 primary care polyclinics) were taken into account (unpublished data). In this series, the 25- and 75-&#x000b5;g dose levels were used, according to the product label (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). In all series, rhEGF treatment was administered up to complete granulation or a maximum of 8 weeks.</p><p>Diabetic patients (type 1 or 2), both sexes, &#x0003e;18 years of age were included in the trials, with Wagner grade 3 or 4 DFUs &#x0003e;1 cm<sup>2</sup>. Intralesional rhEGF was administered adjuvant to standard care, which included thorough debridement (sometimes minor amputation), moist dressing, pressure offloading, and antibiotics, if necessary. Patients with chronic, uncontrolled illness, psychiatric or neurologic diseases that could impair proper reasoning for consent, or presence or suspicion of neoplasia or who were pregnant or breastfeeding were excluded.</p><sec id="s2"><title>Analyses</title><p>Variables proposed by Margolis et al.

For comparability with the results in Margolis et al.

Since missing data can constitute deviations from the intention-to-treat principle, clinical trial analyses require the use of imputation (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>).

Cutoff points were generated in order to maximize both sensitivity (probability to detect a positive result if the outcome is positive) and specificity (probability to detect a negative result if the outcome is negative). The candidate surrogates were then codified, and their association with the final outcome (complete ulcer closure) was assessed using the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values (PV+, conditional probability to have a positive result if the test was positive), negative PVs (PV&#x02212;, conditional probability to have a negative result if the test was negative), and the correct classification index (percent of individuals correctly classified), also named validity index. The corresponding 95% CIs were estimated for all of them.</p><p>Test validation and sensitivity were performed only for the placebo-controlled trial (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) for the sake of homogeneity and balance of the samples compared.</p><p>To quantify the contribution of the candidate surrogates to the final outcome, the product coefficient (PC) was estimated (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), considering these variables as continuous. This is one of the methods to assess mediation in the case of binary-dependent outcome that treats it as the product of two regression coefficients: the regression of the independent treatment variable on the mediator (&#x003b1;<sub>t</sub> in Eq. 6, below) and the partial regression coefficient of the independent treatment variable on the final outcome adjusted for the mediator (&#x003b3;<sub>s</sub> in Eq. 7, below).

The best cutoff points for variables based on the area change at the EOT were selected too. The correct classification was also high (&#x0003e;70%), with suitable diagnostic indicators.

With the area change&#x02013;dependent candidate surrogates, the estimation was only possible for log healing rate. The mediation explained by this variable was very low: 0.003 (95% CI &#x02212;0.002 to 0.008).

The effect of the intervention on healing was lost when either 2 weeks &#x0003e;50% granulation or EOT &#x0003e;75% granulation is incorporated in the model. The odds ratios for the influence of the covariates (initial area and etiology) were similar for the three dependent outcomes (2-week and EOT granulation and healing).</p><table-wrap id="T3" position="float"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Association between covariates and outcomes (granulation and healing)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="210tbl3"/></table-wrap><p>The results of the model with the EOT percent area change are also shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref> as an example.

There are no previous reports of predictive variables in this kind of lesion.</p><p>Granulation tissue development has been taken previously as a secondary outcome in DFU trials (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). It was also proposed as a potential intermediate variable (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), but its use as a surrogate of complete wound closure has not been proposed before, despite being part of the healing process and necessarily preceding final re-epithelization. The granulation process showed good capacity to discriminate healers from nonhealers with ROC curve areas &#x0003e;70% at the 2nd week and EOT. The diagnostic indexes of the dichotomized surrogate markers 2 weeks &#x0003e;50% and EOT &#x0003e;75% granulation had high correct classification percentages.</p><p>The validation tests using multivariate analyses were developed with the data of the randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial of intralesional rhEGF in advanced DFUs (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). The proportion mediated for granulation variables (at 2 weeks and at the EOT) was very high, which agrees with the idea that granulation constitutes an essential part of the healing process, particularly in larger and advanced ulcers. The EGF-induced mitogenic, motogenic, and cytoprotective actions are instrumental for healing events that may be summarized as follows: <italic>1</italic>) stimulation of productive cell migration toward the injured area; <italic>2</italic>) stimulation of granulation tissue outgrowth, including extracellular matrix accumulation, maturation, and de novo angiogenesis; <italic>3</italic>) stimulation of wound contraction by myofibroblast activation and proliferation; and <italic>4</italic>) stimulation of the damaged area resurfacing by epithelial cell migration and proliferation (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Since treatment with rhEGF was given only up to complete granulation, mechanisms <italic>1</italic> and <italic>2</italic> took place completely but not <italic>3</italic> and <italic>4</italic>, which require a previous granulating wound bed. For area change&#x02013;dependent candidates, the proportion mediated was small, which could be explained by a more exigent condition for these lesions. Had the treatment continued after complete granulation, maybe a better proportion mediated would be obtained, given that mechanisms <italic>3</italic> and <italic>4</italic> could have worked longer.</p><p>The models for final cicatrization and the granulation surrogates were adequate and fulfilled the original Prentice (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) criteria for the definition of a surrogate end point: <italic>1</italic>) treatment had a significant effect upon the surrogate end point; <italic>2</italic>) treatment had a significant effect upon the true end point; <italic>3</italic>) the surrogate end point had a significant effect upon the true end point; and <italic>4</italic>) the full effect of treatment upon the true end point was mediated by the surrogate. Additionally, the effect of the covariates (wound area and ulcer etiology) was similar in all models. Criterion <italic>4</italic> is highly dependent on the power of the model and the sample size used. These are still limitations of this work. Patients with such advanced DFUs are usually not included in clinical trials, which limits the possibility of meta-analysis at present. The larger sample of the postmarketing series could not be included since it was not a controlled study. Nevertheless, it was useful to confirm the predictive character of the EOT granulation on final wound closure. On the other hand, as a measure of statistical power, &#x02265;10 events per predictor is considered suitable, taking all the candidates and the other covariates (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). In this work, only in the placebo-controlled confirmatory trial (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), there were 93 healing events and 9 variables, so the criterion is fulfilled.</p><p>EOT &#x0003e;75% granulation had a higher PV with respect to final re-epithelization and thus should be a better surrogate for clinical trial design. This can be useful since it would not be necessary to wait for complete re-epithelization due to treatment, and alternative wound closure procedures could be used after complete granulation, such as grafts or engineered skin. The 2 weeks &#x0003e;50% granulation, being an earlier surrogate, may also have practical value for treatment algorithm decisions and/or pharmacoeconomic considerations.</p><p>Several variables based on wound area change have been proposed as surrogates for complete healing in neuropathic noncomplicated lesions. Margolis et al. (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) described the predictive capacity of 61% area reduction at 4 weeks as well as several transformations of the area change. Sheehan (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), based on previous work (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), proposes 50% wound closure at 4 weeks as a good surrogate for final healing and thus a decision point in a foot ulcer management algorithm. This cutoff point is also proposed by Snyder et al. (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).</p><p>The results of the present work suggest that the predictive property of percent area change, log healing rate, and ratio of log area can be extrapolated to more complicated, ischemic, larger, Wagner grade 3 or 4 ulcers. However, the cutoff points for classification were not the same. With the cutoff proposed by the above-mentioned authors, the correct classification percent in the present series was &#x0003c;70%, with negative PVs &#x0003c;60. This is reasonable since larger and more complex ulcers take longer to heal, and thus the value to expect as predictive around 4 weeks should be smaller, &#x0223c;16% area change, and much lower for the other transformed variables. It was not possible to validate the surrogate property for these variables in this series since the percent area change did not fulfill the Prentice criteria (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) <italic>1</italic> and <italic>4</italic>. Additionally, the proportion mediated by these variables was very low (discussed above). The extrapolation of the cutoff points proposed in the present work has the limitation of the small sample size analyzed, so it requires further research. It could not be performed in the confirmatory, postmarketing series since the partial areas were not measured in routine clinical practice.</p><p>This work provides the first evidence for the use of granulation tissue development as a predictor of wound healing in advanced DFUs. These results can be useful for clinical trial design, particularly during the exploratory phase of development of new products. The surrogate markers that we report can easily be applied by clinicians because the measurement of the proportion of wound area covered by granulation tissue is part of routine clinical care. Correctly classifying patients with advanced diabetic foot ulcers into those who will heal or not heal by the 2nd week of care or at the end of granulation may have relevant implications in new wound healing products and for healthcare programs managing diabetic foot ulcers. Further research is needed to finally validate these results.</p></sec>
