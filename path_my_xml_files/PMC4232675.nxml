Studies have shown that high-risk paediatric patients have improved survival when managed in specialist centres and that volume of cases is a predictor of care quality. In acute cases where distance and time impede access to specialist care, clinical advice may be provided remotely by telephone. Emergency retrieval services, attended by medical and nursing staff may be used to transport patients to specialist centres. Even with the best quality retrieval services, stabilisation of the patient and transport logistics may delay evacuation to definitive care. Several studies have examined the use of telemedicine for providing specialist consultations for critically ill children. However, no studies have yet formally examined the clinical effectiveness and economic implications of using telemedicine in the context of paediatric patient retrieval.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>The study is a pragmatic, multicentre randomised controlled trial running over 24&#x000a0;months which will compare the use of telemedicine with the use of the telephone for paediatric retrieval consultations between four referring hospitals and a tertiary paediatric intensive care unit. We aim to recruit 160 children for whom a specialist retrieval consultation is required. The primary outcome measure is stabilisation time (time spent on site at the referring hospital by the retrieval team) adjusted for initial risk. Secondary outcome measures are change in patient&#x02019;s physiological status (repeated measure, two time points) scored using the Children&#x02019;s Emergency Warning Tool; change in diagnosis (repeated measure taken at three time points); change in destination of retrieved patients at the tertiary hospital (general ward or paediatric intensive care unit); retrieval decision, and length of stay in the Paediatric Intensive Care Unit for retrieved patients. The trial has been approved by the Human Research Ethics Committees of Children&#x02019;s Health Services Queensland and The University of Queensland, Australia.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Health services are adopting telemedicine, however formal evidence to support its use in paediatric acute care is limited.

In this model, larger centres provide paediatric intensive care services and have ready access to a range of sub-speciality expertise. These specialist centres may also provide referring facilities with clinical advice by telephone and also contribute to, or be supported by, specialised paediatric patient retrieval services.</p><p>The clinical argument favouring regionalisation is that the concentration of expertise and resources, high patient volume and co-ordination of services within a geographic area leads to improved patient outcomes. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] While a relationship between volume and outcome for children managed in paediatric intensive care units (PICU) has not been clearly established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], studies have shown that high-risk paediatric patients have improved survival when managed in tertiary centres [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and that volume of cases is positively associated with care quality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. It has also been shown that the centralisation of paediatric intensive care services, in combination with a specialised patient retrieval service, has clinical benefits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. There is also an economic argument for regionalisation: geographical factors and population distribution may dictate that regionalisation is the only affordable ways for a health system to provide complex specialist care. However, while the regionalised model may be both clinically beneficial and in some cases economically necessary, in urgent and emergent situations distance and time impediments may disadvantage those who live outside of the major centres of population.</p><p>When a critically ill child presents at a referring centre, the quality and timeliness of communication with clinicians at the specialist centre is very important. In this context, real-time telemedicine based consultations, alongside high-quality local care and a well-coordinated retrieval service, may have a useful role. It may be that consultation by telemedicine has advantages over use of the telephone arising from the ability to view clinically useful visual information, including directly observing the child, procedures, medical images and equipment such as the patient monitor output and ventilator settings.</p><p>The use of telemedicine is not new [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and its potential role in paediatric critical care was first discussed by Wetzel in 2001 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] at a time when the use of telemedicine in adult intensive care units (ICU) was still embryonic and PICU applications had yet to be developed. Subsequently, early studies of telemedicine for managing seriously ill children first began to appear in the literature in 2004, with the majority of the reported work being led by investigators at The University of California Davis (UCD). The first reported study examined the use of telemedicine to support the care of children admitted as inpatients in a remote adult ICU in Northern California [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. This two year study, involving 70 consultations for 47 patients, found that children who received telemedicine consultations from a PICU at the UCD Medical Center (UCDMC) had mortality and length of stay (LoS) outcomes that were comparable to those of severity-adjusted reference benchmark data from 33 national PICUs. The study also reported that the referring clinicians and parents had high satisfaction with the use of telemedicine. Overall, the study suggested that it was feasible to provide quality care to some children in the community hence avoiding transport and inconvenience for families. The investigators also conducted an economic analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] which reported annual hospital and transport savings of USD172,000 for patients who received telemedicine consultations and USD300,000 for patients who received telemedicine consultations and for whom transport was determined to be avoided. By retaining patients in the adult ICU, the referring hospital also increased their annual revenue by USD186,000 for patients who received telemedicine consultations and USD279,000 for patients for the patients who received telemedicine consultations and for whom transport was avoided. The annual cost of providing telemedicine was reported as USD120,000 economic benefit.</p><p>Also in 2004, Marcin et al. reported a second study of telemedicine consultation. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] In this study 17 paediatric trauma patients who had been admitted to the same remote adult ICU were recruited. Telemedicine consultations were provided from UCDMC at the discretion of the referring clinician. This study also concluded that the approach was feasible for trauma care and was considered satisfactory by the referring clinicians and families. In 2005, Kon and Marcin reported two case studies of the use of telemedicine to support paediatric resuscitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In these examples, an intensivist observed and provided advice by telemedicine from home. While in one case resuscitation was ultimately unsuccessful, the attending teams reported that telemedicine had benefits because the intensivists could directly observe cardio-pulmonary resuscitation, bagging and the patient monitor and recommend interventions based on visual information that would not be available during a telephone call.</p><p>Between 2006 and 2008, Health et al. conducted a two year prospective study of intensivist telemedicine consultations to rural emergency departments (ED). [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] They reported the results of 63 consultations conducted across 10 rural EDs. Six point questionnaires were used to survey clinician opinions of telemedicine. The majority of both referring and providing clinicians agreed, or strongly agreed (referring 87.5%, providing 88.9%), that telemedicine improved the quality of care for the patient. Referring and providing clinicians differed in their views of whether the consultation could have been conducted as well by telephone, with 55% of referring clinicians disagreeing, or strongly disagreeing with the statement, compared with 90.5% of providing clinicians. Opinions on the technical quality of the consultations and on the quality of clinician communications were comparable between referring and providing clinicians, with the majority agreeing or strongly agreeing that the quality was high.</p><p>In 2012, Yager at al. examined the use of telemedicine for providing night-time consultations by intensivists to a PICU from home. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] This descriptive retrospective study reviewed the audio and video quality, duration, reason for consultation, persons present and changes in medical management for 56 out-of-hours consultations. The study concluded that the use of telemedicine was feasible and valuable, though the effect on patient outcomes was not assessed.</p><p>In 2013 using a retrospective chart review, LaBarbera et al. identified that telemedicine consultations between intensivists and a community hospital physicians, together with the implementation of a paediatric hospitalist program at the community hospital had the potential to reduce the need for patient transport to the PICU. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] Also using retrospective chart review, a validated implicit quality review tool and surveys, Dharmar et al. compared the quality of care provided to children who received a telemedicine consultation with a paediatric intensivist, a telephone consultation with a paediatric intensivist or no paediatric intensivist consultation at all. The study found that patients who received telemedicine consultations had the highest quality of physician-reported quality of care, intermediate quality was reported for telephone consultations and the lowest quality was reported for no intensivist consultation. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] Dharmar et al. also compared medication errors in groups of children who received telemedicine consultations, telephone consultations or no consultation. The children who received telemedicine consultations experienced significantly fewer physician-related medication errors (3.4%) compared with those who received telephone consultations (10.8%) or no consultations at all (12.5%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>In general, while telemedicine is not new, the formal evidence to support its use remains weak. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] While pragmatic randomised controls may are a useful method of producing evidence for clinicians and policy-makers, very few have been published in telemedicine. In paediatric critical care specifically, there is very limited high-quality evidence. In their 2012 systematic review and meta-analysis, Wilcox et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] identified no randomised studies of telemedicine in critical care. In their pooled analysis of 9 observational studies they found that the use telemedicine was associated with a reduction in ICU and hospital mortality (RR 0.79; 95% CI 0.65 to 0.96 and RR 0.83 95% CI 0.73 to 0.94 respectively). However, the pooled analysis included only one study of paediatric patients (Marcin et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]) and that study favoured the control over telemedicine and had a wide confidence interval (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.13 to 8.87). Wilcox also found that telemedicine was associated with a statistically significant reduction in LoS (both in ICU and in hospital) however no studies involving paediatric patients were reported in the pooled estimates.</p><p>While observational studies suggest that telemedicine may have clinical and economic benefits when compared with consultation by telephone, formal evidence is needed.</p><p>The aim of this study is to formally explore the clinical and economic effects of providing telemedicine consultations from a PICU to referring hospitals in Queensland&#x02019;s regionalised public health care system.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Objectives and hypotheses</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Hypotheses</title><p>Consultation using real-time video-based telemedicine between a PICU consultant and a referring hospital clinician will:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Clinical effectiveness<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Reduce the time needed by the retrieval team to stabilise the child before transport</p></list-item><list-item><p>Improve the child&#x02019;s condition between time of initial call and time of retrieval team arrival</p></list-item><list-item><p>Reduce diagnostic discordance</p></list-item><list-item><p>Reduce the number of retrieved children being admitted to general wards at the tertiary hospital</p></list-item><list-item><p>Reduce PICU LoS for retrieved children</p></list-item></list></p></list-item><list-item><p>Economic effects<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>From the health service perspective, be economically beneficial by reducing the number, and consequently the cost, of (i) retrievals, (ii) unnecessary tertiary hospital admissions, and (iii) LoS.</p></list-item></list></p></list-item></list></p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Design</title><p>This study is a pragmatic four-centre open randomised controlled trial.

It has a population of over 4.5 million, has around 60,000 births per year and high population growth in regional areas. However, Queensland&#x02019;s two tertiary children&#x02019;s hospitals are both located in the state capital of Brisbane in the southeast corner of the state, in effect centralising speciality and sub-speciality care.</p><p>The Royal Children&#x02019;s Hospital (RCH) PICU provides a state wide advice and retrieval service. Approximately 230 paediatric patients who need critical care are retrieved to the unit each year. Clinical advice and retrieval management between the PICU and referring hospitals is provided by telephone. First point of call, clinical co-ordination, prioritisation and tasking of resources for all paediatric retrievals is conducted centrally by Retrieval Services Queensland (RSQ) based at the Queensland Emergency Medical System Coordination Centre in Brisbane.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Study site selection</title><p>The study is funded to provide the RCH PICU and four study sites with telemedicine equipment. To maximise recruitment within the resource constraints of the project, retrospective data were examined to identify four referring hospitals which consistently contributed to the PICU retrieval workload over two recent years (2010, 2011). For this period, when referring hospitals were ranked by retrieval activity, the top four hospitals accounted for 220 patients (i.e. approximately 110 patients per year). These cases represent almost half of the total retrieval workload of the PICU. These study sites are all large regional public hospitals, each with an emergency department, paediatric ward and paediatricians on staff. In some cases, adult ICUs at the referring hospitals may admit paediatric patients if needed. Site round trip distances from the RCH PICU range from 62&#x000a0;km to 1042&#x000a0;km (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The four sites identified will be provided with telemedicine links to the RCH PICU.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>

The process of generating these sequences will be conducted by an independent party. Four tables of random numbers will be generated, one for each study site.

While all parties will aim to comply with the study protocol, there may be circumstances under which the referring and PICU clinicians elect to override the randomisation process in the interest of the care of the child.

The tool is designed to identify patient deterioration and to trigger appropriate clinical escalations. The tool has nine components: respiratory rate, respiratory distress, Oxygen rate, Oxygen saturation, temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, capillary refill time, and level of consciousness. Observations are charted at the bedside, as with a conventional patient chart. Within each component, observations are translated to a score, on a scale of 1 (best) to 3 (worst). A score of &#x02018;E&#x02019; and purple colour coding is used to prompt an emergency response (e.g. a respiratory rate &#x0003c;10 breaths/min, heart rate &#x0003c;60 beats/min or any component of blood pressure &#x0003c;50&#x000a0;mmHg).</p><p>After each patient assessment, a total CEWT score is calculated by summing the component scores.

However, little is known about the use of telemedicine in the complex, risky and expensive area of paediatric acute care retrieval.</p><p>Using a pragmatic randomised design, with telemedicine consultation as the intervention and telephone consultation as the control, this study will provide new information on the effectiveness and economics of using telemedicine for paediatric acute care retrieval management in a regionalised public health care system. In particular, it will determine whether using telemedicine for specialist consultation prior to patient retrieval results in a more stable patient and hence lead to their more efficient evacuation to definitive care. It will also examine whether the use of telemedicine improves diagnosis, can improve the appropriateness of retrieval and reduce the length of stay in PICU. The study incorporates an economic analysis to allow the observed effects of telemedicine to be costed.</p><p>The results of the study will be useful to both clinicians and health service policy makers in the Australian context and in other regionalised or centralised specialist health care systems.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-list><def-item><term>CEWT</term><def><p>Children&#x02019;s Early Warning Tool</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DRG</term><def><p>Diagnostic Related Group</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ED</term><def><p>Emergency Department</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICU</term><def><p>Intensive Care Unit</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ITT</term><def><p>Intention to Treat</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LoS</term><def><p>Length of Stay</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCH</term><def><p>Royal Children&#x02019;s Hospital</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PICU</term><def><p>Paediatric Intensive Care Unit</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PIM3</term><def><p>Paediatric Index of Mortality 3</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCT</term><def><p>Randomised Controlled Trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RSQ</term><def><p>Retrieval Services Queensland</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>UCD</term><def><p>University of California Davis</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>UCDMC</term><def><p>University of California Davis Medical Center</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>USD</term><def><p>United States Dollars</p></def></def-item></def-list></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>NRA conceived the study.
