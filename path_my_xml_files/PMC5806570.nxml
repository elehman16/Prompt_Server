They underwent two cycles of sleep restriction (5-hr time in bed [TIB] for five and three nights in the first and the second cycles, respectively; 01:00&#x02013;06:00) and recovery (9-hr TIB for two nights per cycle; 23:00&#x02013;08:00) intended to simulate the weekday sleep loss and weekend attempt to &#x0201c;catch up&#x0201d; on sleep. Half of the participants received a 1-hr nap opportunity at 14:00 following each sleep-restricted night, while the other half stayed awake. Sustained attention, sleepiness, speed of processing, executive function, and mood were assessed 3 times each day.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Participants who were not allowed to nap showed progressive decline in sustained attention that did not return to baseline after two nights of recovery sleep. Exposure to the second period of sleep restriction increased the rate of vigilance deterioration. Similar patterns were found for other neurobehavioral measures.

Simulating 2 school weeks, the present study demonstrated that the negative effects of weekday sleep restriction on neurobehavioral function cumulated and were incompletely reversed by weekend catch-up sleep. Deficits were compounded by a second successive period of sleep restriction, indicating failure to adapt to successive cycles of sleep restriction. Afternoon naps were beneficial, but for the purpose of preserving neurobehavioral function, napping together with weekend catch-up sleep were still inferior to adequate and regular nocturnal sleep.</p></sec></boxed-text><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Sleep curtailment in adolescents is prevalent in many societies.<sup><xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Approximately 75% of adolescents in the United States and over 90% in Asian countries receive less than the recommended 8&#x02013;10 hr of sleep.<sup><xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2&#x02013;4</xref></sup> Sleep curtailment in this demographic results from the tandem effects of later bedtime during late adolescence and early school start times.<sup><xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Factors contributing to later bedtimes include maturational delay in circadian rhythm,<sup><xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> slower build up of homeostatic sleep pressure during wakefulness,<sup><xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> reduced parental control over bedtime,<sup><xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> increased academic pressure,<sup><xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> and high levels of electronic media use.<sup><xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup></p><p>Adequate sleep is important for adolescent cognitive function,<sup><xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> and sleep curtailment over multiple nights results in degraded neurobehavioral performance.<sup><xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13&#x02013;15</xref></sup> Recently,<sup><xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> we recorded neurobehavioral measures in adolescents when their sleep opportunity was reduced to 5 hr for 7 nights and found cumulative deficits in sustained attention, working memory/executive function, and speed of processing. Subjective alertness and positive mood were also impaired. Among the measures evaluated, sustained attention was most affected by multiple nights of sleep restriction. Critically, some neurobehavioral measures did not fully recover even after 2 nights of 9-hr sleep opportunity, raising the question of how they would respond on immediate reexposure to another bout of sleep restriction. This is relevant as many adolescents attempt to catch up on sleep on weekends,<sup><xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> only to undergo sleep restriction again in the ensuing week.</p><p>Weekday naps are another measure often taken to offset sleepiness arising from nocturnal sleep curtailment: Approximately 30% of the adolescents in the United States and Australia reported napping at least 2 times per week.<sup><xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> In adults, a nap can improve sustained attention<sup><xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> and other cognitive functions<sup><xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19&#x02013;21</xref></sup> that are degraded by <italic>a single</italic> night of sleep restriction. However, the effectiveness of napping in adolescents particularly following <italic>multiple</italic> nights of sleep curtailment has yet to be examined. Further, the cognitive benefits of napping have primarily been studied in the period immediately following waking and have rarely been tracked beyond late afternoon.</p><p>In this 15-day study, adolescent participants underwent a sleep schedule that simulated weekday sleep loss and the attempt to &#x0201c;catch up&#x0201d; with sleep over the weekend. We tracked changes in cognitive performance, subjective sleepiness, and mood during two successive cycles of sleep restriction and recovery to determine whether neurobehavioral deficits would be compounded by the second exposure to sleep restriction. We also examined the temporal evolution of behavior associated with daily 1-hr afternoon naps, taking measurements <italic>from afternoon to the following morning</italic> over <italic>multiple</italic> nights of sleep restriction.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="s3"><title>Participants</title><p>Fifty-seven adolescents (31 males; age = 15&#x02013;19 years) participated in the Need for Sleep study 2 (NFS2). They were recruited through sleep education talks and recruitment campaigns in three high-ranking schools, advertisements on the laboratory and social networking websites as well as by word of mouth. All interested participants and their legal guardians were invited to attend a briefing session, during which written informed consent was obtained from both the participant and their legal guardian. The eligibility of each participant was based on the selection criteria which were the same in NFS1<sup>14</sup> and NFS2: 15&#x02013;19 years of age, healthy; no sleep disorder, body mass index (BMI) &#x02264;30, not habitual short sleepers (where short sleepers were identified as individuals having an actigraphically estimated average time in bed [TIB] of &#x0003c;6 hr and no sign of sleep extension for &#x0003e;1 hr on weekends), consumption of &#x02264;5 cups of caffeinated beverages a day, and did not travel across &#x0003e;2 time zones 1 month prior to the experiment.</p><p>In this parallel group study, participants were randomized into the nap (<italic>n</italic> = 29) or the no nap group (<italic>n</italic> = 28).

Compliance was verified with actigraphy (mean &#x000b1; standard error of mean of bedtime of the nap, no nap, and control groups: 23:00 &#x000b1; 00:11, 23:00 &#x000b1; 00:07, 23:02 &#x000b1; 00:11, <italic>F</italic> = .62, <italic>P</italic> = .54; wake time: 08:02 &#x000b1; 00:16, 08:03 &#x000b1; 00:21, 07:53 &#x000b1; 00:13, <italic>F</italic> = 2.40, <italic>p</italic> = .10).</p><p>The 15-day protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>) in NFS2 started with two baseline nights (B1 and B2) when all participants had 9-hr nocturnal sleep opportunities (23:00&#x02013;08:00) for adaptation and baseline characterization. This was followed by two cycles of sleep restriction and recovery sleep. The first cycle began with five nights of 5-hr sleep opportunity (M<sub>1</sub>1&#x02013;M<sub>1</sub>5; 01:00&#x02013;06:00) and ended with two nights of 9-hr recovery sleep opportunity (R<sub>1</sub>1&#x02013;R<sub>1</sub>2; 23:00&#x02013;08:00). This protocol simulated the typical Monday to Friday school week, where sleep is usually restricted the night before school days (Sunday&#x02013;Thursday) and extended on nights before weekend days (Friday and Saturday). The second cycle consisted of three nights of sleep restriction (M<sub>2</sub>1&#x02013;M<sub>2</sub>3) and two nights of recovery sleep (R<sub>2</sub>1&#x02013;R<sub>2</sub>2). After each sleep-restricted night, half of the participants (the nap group) had a 1-hr daytime nap opportunity from 14:00 to 15:00, while the rest (the no nap group) watched documentaries. The nap episodes began at 14:00 which corresponded to the time when many schools ended and the earliest time the students could have a siesta. The control group consisted of participants from NFS1 who had a 9-hr sleep opportunity (23:00&#x02013;08:00) every night during a 14-day protocol.<sup><xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup></p><fig fig-type="figure" id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Experimental protocol.

All participants stayed in air-conditioned, twin-share bedrooms with en-suite bathrooms. Bedroom windows were fitted with blackout panels to ensure participants were not woken up prematurely by sunlight. Earplugs were also provided, and participants were allowed to adjust the temperature of their bedrooms to their personal comfort. Three main meals were served each day, with snacks being provided upon request. Caffeinated drinks, unscheduled sleep, and strenuous physical activities were prohibited. Outside scheduled sleep, meal, and cognitive testing times, participants spent the majority of their free time in a common room that was illuminated by natural and artificial lighting. They were allowed to read, study, play games that did not involve physical exertion, watch videos, and interact with the research staff and other participants. Participants were under constant supervision by the research staff.

Participants were required to wear earphones during testing to minimize distraction and for tone presentation during certain tasks.</p><p>The KSS<sup><xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>: Participants rated their current level of subjective sleepiness on a 9-point Likert-type scale (1: very alert; 9: very sleepy, great effort to keep awake).</p><p>The SDMT<sup><xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>: This 2-min task measures speed of processing. Participants were shown a key displaying 9 pairs of digits (from 1 to 9) and symbols. A symbol appeared below the key in each trial, requiring participants to respond by typing in the symbol&#x02019;s corresponding digit as quickly as possible. If no response was detected after 15 s, a beeping tone was presented until a response was provided. The total number of correct trials was used as the critical measure.</p><p>The verbal 1- and 3-back tasks<sup><xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>: These tests assess working memory and executive function. Letters from the English alphabet were presented sequentially for 1 s, with a 3-s interstimulus interval. Participants had to decide if the current stimulus was identical to the letter shown 1 item (1-back) or 3 items (3-back) ago. The match to mismatch ratio was 8:24, and two nonparametric measures of sensitivity (A&#x02019;) and response bias (B&#x0201d;<sub>D</sub>) were used to quantify performance. A&#x02019; is a measure of the ability to distinguish matches and mismatches and is computed using the hit rate (number of match trials correctly responded to &#x000d7; 100 / 8) and false alarm (fa) rate (number of mismatch trials incorrectly responded to &#x000d7; 100 / 24). A&#x02019; ranges from 0 to 1, with 0.5 indicating performance at chance level. B&#x0201d;<sub>D</sub> is a measure of the participant&#x02019;s tendency toward liberal (B&#x0201d;<sub>D</sub> &#x0003c; 0) or conservative (B&#x0201d;<sub>D</sub> &#x0003e; 0) response behavior. The former favors more &#x0201c;match&#x0201d; responses and hence likely leads to higher hit and false alarm rates, while the latter favors &#x0201c;mismatch&#x0201d; responses and would therefore result in fewer hits and false alarms. Neutrality is centered at 0 (B&#x0201d;<sub>D</sub> = 0).</p><p>The two measures were derived with the following formula:

During the afternoon PVT administered 1 hr after waking up from the nap, participants had fewer lapses relative to the test taken that morning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">C</xref>).

Interestingly, the significant gap in performance between the nap and the no nap groups was sustained through the evening tests (approximately 5 hr after nap had ended; <italic>p &#x0003c;</italic> .05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><p>The nap benefit on sustained attention did not extend to the following morning during the first cycle of sleep restriction: The nap group had more lapses than the control group (<italic>P &#x0003c;</italic>.002) and in fact performed similar to the no nap group (<italic>p &#x0003e;</italic> .22; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>) from the second to the last day of sleep restriction.

Specifically, the no nap group displayed greater deficits in working memory/executive function (A&#x02019; in the 1- and 3-back tasks; left panels of Figures S1A and S2A, respectively), and speed of processing (slower improvement in the MAT and the SDMT; Figure S3A) in the second sleep restriction period, relative to the first. They also exhibited a more prominent reduction in subjective alertness (KSS; Figure S4A) and positive mood (PANAS; left panel of Figure S5A). Strikingly, although working memory/executive function (i.e., A&#x02019; in the 3-back performance) <italic>did</italic> return to baseline level after two nights of recovery sleep, a faster rate of decline was observed upon reexposure to sleep restriction (left panel of Figure S2A).</p><p>As with PVT lapses, the other neurobehavioral measures also showed immediate benefits of afternoon napping (Figure S1-5C) that extended into the evening (Figure S1-5D). Also, we observed benefits to performance (i.e., better performance in the nap relative to the no nap group) in the following morning for subjective alertness at the end of the first sleep restriction period (Figure S4B) and for a working memory task with a high executive load in the second sleep restriction period (left panel of Figure S2B). In contrast, at this time of day, performance in a working memory task with a low executive load (left panel of Figure S1B) and two speed of processing tasks (Figure S3B) as well as mood (Figure S5B) received little protective effect from afternoon naps in the previous waking periods.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s15"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Contrary to the popular notion that adolescents are relatively resilient to the negative impact of sleep curtailment, we showed that sleep restriction to 5-hr TIB over five nights resulted in cumulative deterioration in adolescents&#x02019; cognitive functions, subjective alertness, and mood. We also showed that recovery was incomplete after 9-hr TIB for two simulated weekend nights. Critically, even neurobehavioral functions that had apparently &#x0201c;recovered&#x0201d; showed accelerated deterioration on reexposure to sleep restriction the following &#x0201c;school week&#x0201d; compared to the previous week. While daily 1-hr afternoon naps after each sleep-restricted night alleviated performance degradation, these deficits were not fully eliminated.</p><sec id="s16"><title>Cognitive Deficits are Compounded by a Second Consecutive Cycle of Sleep Restriction</title><p>In our previous study,<sup><xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> we reported progressive deficits in neurobehavioral functions, particularly in sustained attention, in adolescents exposed to seven nights of partial sleep deprivation (5-hr TIB). Extending this work, here, even with the sleep restriction period shortened to five nights&#x02014;the length of a typical school week&#x02014;there was still incomplete recovery of sustained attention and other neurobehavioral functions following two nights of &#x0201c;weekend&#x0201d; recovery sleep. These findings are in line with two observations in adults: (1) progressive reduction in sustained attention, working memory/executive function, speed of processing, and subjective alertness following multiple nights of sleep restriction<sup><xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">36&#x02013;38</xref></sup> and (2) subsequent partial recovery of some neurobehavioral functions after an extended nocturnal sleep opportunity.<sup><xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> Others have also found that adolescents who have been sleep-restricted for three to five nights have impaired cognitive performance<sup><xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> and more frequent reports of sleepiness, inattention as well as problems with metacognition.<sup><xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup></p><p>Our novel finding that neurobehavioral functions deteriorate at an accelerated rate on exposure to a second sleep restriction period suggests the presence of residual effects of sleep restriction that were temporarily masked by recovery sleep. With two successive cycles of sleep restriction and recovery, we found no evidence for adolescents adapting to recurrent sleep loss. This contrasts with the finding of allostasis following sleep restriction in rodents,<sup><xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> which would predict stable (albeit reduced) performance in the second period of sleep restriction as in the first.</p><p>The present findings should stimulate study into the broader significance of adverse effects of repeated cycles of sleep restriction on other aspects of adolescent health. For example, habitual sleep variability is associated with abdominal obesity in adolescents.<sup><xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> Sleep curtailment also influences metabolic processes,<sup><xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> gene expression,<sup><xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> and inflammatory responses.<sup><xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="s17"><title>A 60-Min Mid-Afternoon Nap Improves Neurobehavioral Functions in Sleep-Restricted Adolescents</title><p>The neurobehavioral functions of the nap group were, in general, superior to those of the no nap participants possibly due to the additional 37&#x02013;53 min of sleep they had on the sleep-restricted days, which minimized the accrued sleep debt. This corroborates the cognitive benefits of napping found in adults after a night of sleep restriction.<sup><xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17&#x02013;21</xref></sup> Previous work showed that these benefits could be observed almost immediately after napping.<sup><xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup> We found similar results, and further demonstrated that napping in the afternoon was still beneficial to neurobehavioral functions in the evening. This could possibly be attributed to the nap&#x02019;s effect in reducing sleep propensity later in the day.<sup><xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup> However, afternoon naps did not have much benefit on cognitive functions the following morning, particularly in the first sleep restriction period. Interestingly, on exposure to sleep restriction for the second time, the nap group exhibited less deficit in some neurobehavioral functions than the no nap group, suggesting that afternoon naps may be beneficial at this time of day if sleep restriction is recurrent.</p></sec><sec id="s18"><title>Limitations and Future Studies</title><p>Our experimental protocol had a few limitations. First, sleep restriction was achieved by both delaying bedtime and advancing wake times by 2 hr in order to align the mid-points for both the sleep episodes and the wake episodes throughout the protocol for minimizing shifting in circadian phase. However, a delay in circadian phase was still observed under such circumstances in earlier adult studies.<sup><xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup> Also, dissimilar to our protocol, adolescents may delay their bedtimes on weekends relative to weekdays so that the sleep timing becomes more in line with the maturational delay of their biological clock.<sup><xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Furthermore, in our protocol, as the test batteries were administered at the same clock times, participants were awake for 2 hr more at each neurobehavioral assessment during the sleep restriction period relative to the baseline and recovery periods. A longer duration of prior wakefulness before testing might accentuate neurobehavioral deficits associated with nocturnal sleep curtailment.</p><p>Second, to minimize the inconvenience caused to the participants during their vacation period, the second cycle consisted of only three nights of sleep restriction. However, exacerbated deficits were still found even in this relatively short period of sleep restriction, suggesting that the carryover effects from prior sleep restriction could be immediately observed upon reexposure to sleep loss. Future studies should use more cycles and investigate whether the human homeostatic sleep system shows allostatic responses, thereby allowing neurobehavioral functions to stabilize under conditions of chronic, recurrent sleep restriction.</p><p>Third, we shortened participants&#x02019; sleep opportunity to 5 hr in each sleep restriction night. This level of sleep restriction may be uncommon in Western countries but is common in Asia where more than half the world lives. A nationally representative survey in Korea has shown that 43% of the adolescents reported sleeping less than 6 hr each night.<sup><xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Furthermore, a survey on high school students in Singapore found that on average, the actigraphically estimated TST was below 5.5 hr during weekdays (unpublished data)&#x02014;a sleep duration similar to the estimate from our sample (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). As such, the severity and duration of sleep restriction used here has real-world relevance. Nevertheless, future studies should investigate the extent of neurobehavioral deficits with different TIBs during repeated cycles of sleep restriction and recovery.</p><p>Fourth, although changes in multiple cognitive tasks were tracked in the present study, other cognitive functions that are important for students&#x02019; academic performance, such as memory encoding and consolidation as well as creativity, were not studied. The impact of successive cycles of sleep restriction and recovery on these higher order cognitive functions remain to be evaluated in future studies.</p><p>Finally, here, the 1-hr nap opportunities for the nap group were placed at 14:00&#x02013;15:00, and we found minimal impact of afternoon naps on nocturnal sleep in the subsequent nights. However, two surveys have pointed out that adolescents typically nap at 16:00,<sup><xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> and 48% of adolescent nappers nap for at least 1 hr.<sup><xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Furthermore, data from young adults have revealed that the duration and timing of nap episodes can have a significant impact on nocturnal sleep. Specifically, a nap that starts at 18:00 and has an average TST of 75 min can increase sleep latency and shorten sleep in the subsequent night.<sup><xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup> Future studies should address whether late and long naps affect adolescents&#x02019; nocturnal sleep similarly and as a result alter the effectiveness of napping in alleviating neurobehavioral deficits<sup><xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup> during recurrent nocturnal sleep curtailment.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s19"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Sleep restriction for the duration of a school week has cumulative negative effects on cognitive functions, subjective alertness, and mood that cannot be completely reversed by weekend catch-up sleep. A second successive cycle of sleep restriction results in accelerated neurobehavioral impairment. While afternoon naps do confer some benefits, these together with weekend catch-up sleep appear to be less effective in optimizing neurobehavioral functions than having the recommended sleep duration <italic>every</italic> night. Hence, parents and clinicians should advise adolescents to get the recommended 8&#x02013;10 hr of sleep each night for optimal performance. Furthermore, educators and policy makers should consider delaying school start time so as to increase nocturnal sleep opportunity for this age-group.<sup><xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="s20"><title>SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL</title><p>Supplementary Material is available at <italic>Sleep</italic> online.</p></sec><sec id="s21"><title>FUNDING</title><p>Financial support was provided by the National Medical Research Council, Singapore (NMRC/STaR/015/2013) and The Far East Organization.</p></sec><sec id="s22"><title>DISCLOSURE STATEMENT</title><p>None declared.</p><p>This work was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the National University of Singapore.
