The hospital was a tertiary-care center. Nearly all the patients are native Chinese. This study included outpatients (from October 2009 to October 2010) who were diagnosed with <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection by endoscopy or UBT. All the patients were carefully interviewed by physicians. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) Patients who used to receive <italic>H. pylori</italic> eradication treatment, (2) patients who took bismuth, PPIs, H2-receptor blockers, and antibiotics in the previous 1 month, (3) patients who were allergic to the drugs included in the study, (4) patients who were pregnant or breast-feeding.

Written informed consent was obtained from all the patients at enrolment.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Patients were further categorized into three groups by their manifestation, medical history, and endoscopic diagnosis. Firstly, endoscopic findings of peptic ulcer are categorized into peptic ulcer disease (PUD) group. Secondly, endoscopic findings of nonulcer but indication of gastroesophageal reflux or clinical complaint of vomiting and heartburn were categorized into gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) group. Finally, the remaining patients enrolled were categorized into NUD (Non Ulcer Dyspepsia) group.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>The method of <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection</title><p><italic>H. pylori</italic> infection was tested by rapid urease test (RUT) during endoscopy or<sup>13</sup> C-UBT, and the results were reported by Ji Danian and Liu Xuejing, respectively.

The difference of the incidence of dropouts between the OAC-1 group (11.89%) and the OAC-2 group (9.03%) was no significant.

At ITT analysis, OAC-2 (67.09% with 95% CI of 52.30%&#x02013;81.88%) was found to be significantly more effective compared with OAC-1 (55.94% with 95% CI of 39.67%&#x02013;80.94%) (<italic>P</italic> = 0.048). According to the PP analysis, the difference was not significant between OAC-2 eradication rate (73.76% with 95% CI of 57.81%-88.28%) and OAC-1 (63.49% with 95% CI of 46.68%-80.30%). At one-factor analysis, 2-week regimens showed a trend toward a significantly higher efficacy than the 1-week regimens according to ITT criteria (OR: 1.44 with 95% CI of 1.10-2.84, <italic>P</italic> = 0.018), and were significantly effective at PP analysis (OR: 1.79 with 95% CI of 1.06%-3.03%, <italic>P</italic> = 0.029). No significant differences were found as far as age, gender, and type of disease, either at ITT or PP analysis [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>] is concerned. The multifactor logistic regression model was adopted both for the ITT and PP analyses [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>]. Antibiotic combination and duration of therapy resulted as independent factors correlated with the eradication of <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection. The eradication rate achieved with OAC-2 regimens was significantly higher than that with OAC-1 regimens at ITT but not at PP analysis. The 2-week duration of therapy was associated with a higher rate of <italic>H. pylori</italic> eradication at ITT analysis.

Lushan Conference in China in 2007 advocated that 14-day therapy is superior to 10-day and 7-day therapies.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] The results of sequential therapy are inconsistent. Many clinical researches reported that it is superior to 7-day or 10-day therapies, even better than 14-day therapy, and it can provide alternative regime in case of drug resistance. But the effectiveness of sequential therapy can also decrease due to drug resistance, which indicates the cause of the unsatisfied reality of application in recent years.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] A recent report showed that sequential and standard triple therapies were similarly effective at eradicating <italic>H. pylori</italic> in two-thirds of Saudi patients.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] The follow-up studies show that in some countries, such as Italy, in the same period there are areas with unchanged efficacy of the OAC regimen[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and area with a relevant decreasing efficacy.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Most of these recommendations are based on PPI combined with amoxicillin or metronidazole.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] With increasing drug resistance of firstline antibiotics to <italic>H. pylori</italic>, an assessment on the efficacy and advantage of 14-day triple therapy after all these application years is necessary.</p><p>In this study, we compared 14-day with 7-day triple therapy of OAC. We also did other comparisons as drug resistance to <italic>H. pylori</italic> may be associated with smoking, gastric diseases, or some other factors.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>The result shows that 14-day therapy is superior to 7-day therapy in ITT analysis. The therapeutic effectiveness in patients with GERD is superior than those with NUD.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Mamori reported that age can influence the eradication rate. The eradication rate in patients younger than 50 years is lower than those older than 50 years. But in our study, the eradication rate showed no statistical difference between these two groups. There was also no influence of age (data not shown) in the study. This can be explained by difference in compliance.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>OCA is obviously not the best therapy to those who are resistant to clarithromycin. This may greatly influence those results of the investigation using clarithromycin. According to various reports, clarithromycin resistance varies remarkably in different geographic areas. The rates of Europe (11.1%), Asia (18.9%), and America (29.3%) significantly differ.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] According to Gao, the resistant rate of <italic>H. pylori</italic> to clarithromycin has reached 35% in Peking area; according to Sun, from the year 2000 to 2009, it has increased from 9.0% to 20.7% in Shanghai.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] In a prospective multiregion study on primary antibiotic resistance of <italic>H. pylori</italic> isolated from Chinese people, the clarithromycin resistance rate has reached up to 37.5%,[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] which indicated that the resistance rate may be unexpectedly high in the metropolis areas due to the wide use of clarithromycin in respiratory diseases. Resistance to clarithromycin may even reduce the eradication rates up to 70%. Not surprisingly, the eradication rate in this report is relatively low, and it is lower than several recent reports of eradication therapy using clarithromycin.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] This enhances the necessity of further research in drug resistance of <italic>H. pylori</italic> strains in particular populations.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] In addition, the current result has several limitations. We excluded the patients with amoxicillin hypersensitivity in advance and the triple therapy is simply based on omeprazole, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin. These may cause some bias in the result.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] The data of adverse reaction gathered is incomplete, but this article focuses on the happening situation because of the severe adverse effects. The results show that the difference between the two groups was not significant (<italic>P</italic> = 0.657), six and five patients due to severe adverse effects in the OAC-1 group and in the OAC-2 group, respectively. This could suggest that there may be no significant difference between the side effects seen in OAC-1 and OAC-2 in a way.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-4"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>A fourteen-day OAC triple therapy for <italic>H. pylori</italic> eradication is significantly more effective than 7-day therapy.
