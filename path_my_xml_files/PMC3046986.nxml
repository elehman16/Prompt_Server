Antiretroviral-na&#x000ef;ve individuals initiating free highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in the form of fixed-dose combination pills (d4T, 3TC, and nevirapine) were randomized to one of four arms: counseling (three counseling sessions around HAART initiation), alarm (pocket electronic pill reminder carried for 6 months), counseling plus alarm, and neither counseling nor alarm. Participants were followed for 18 months after HAART initiation. Primary study endpoints included plasma HIV-1 RNA and CD4 count every 6 months, mortality, and adherence measured by monthly pill count.

However, two factors have recently cast doubt on the poor adherence problem: (1) recent studies have shown that adherence is high in African HIV treatment programs and often better than in Western HIV clinics. For example, in a meta-analysis of 27 cohorts from 12 African countries, adequate adherence was noted in 77&#x00025; of subjects compared to only 55&#x00025; among 31 North America cohorts; (2) choice of antiretroviral regimens may impact on the development of antiretroviral resistance. In poor countries, most antiretroviral regimens contain non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), such as nevirapine or efavirenz, which remain in the patient's circulation for weeks after single-dose administration. This situation means that such patients may not experience antiretroviral resistance unless they drop below 80&#x00025; adherence&#x02014;contrary to the more stringent 95&#x00025; plus adherence levels needed to prevent resistance in regimens based on unboosted protease inhibitors&#x02014;ultimately, off-setting some treatment lapses in resource-limited settings where NNRTI-based regimens are widely used.</p></sec><sec id="s1a2"><title>Why Was This Study Done?</title><p>Given that adherence may not be as crucial an issue as previously thought, antiretroviral treatment programs in sub-Saharan Africa may be spending scarce resources to promote adherence to the detriment of some potentially more effective elements of HIV treatment and management programs. Although many treatment programs currently include adherence interventions, there is limited quality evidence that any of these methods improve long-term adherence to HIV treatment. Therefore, it is necessary to identify adherence interventions that are inexpensive and proven to be effective in resource-limited settings. As adherence counseling is already widely implemented in African HIV treatment programs and inexpensive alarm devices are thought to also improve compliance, the researchers compared the impact of adherence counseling and the use of an alarm device on adherence and biological outcomes in patients enrolled in HIV programs in rural Kenya.</p></sec><sec id="s1a3"><title>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</title><p>The researchers enrolled 400 eligible patients (newly diagnosed with HIV, never before taken antiretroviral therapy, aged over 18 years) to four arms: (1) adherence counseling alone; (2) alarm device alone; (3) both adherence counseling and alarm device together; and (4) a control group that received neither adherence counseling nor alarm device. The patients had blood taken to record baseline CD4 count and HIV-1 RNA and after starting HIV treatment, returned to the study clinic every month with their pill bottles for the study pharmacist to count and recorded the number of pills remaining in the bottle, and to receive another prescription. Patients were followed up for 18 months and had their CD4 count and HIV-1 RNA measured at 6, 12, and 18 months.</p><p>Patients receiving adherence counseling were 29&#x00025; less likely to experience poor adherence compared to those who received no counseling. Furthermore, those receiving intensive early adherence counseling were 59&#x00025; less likely to experience viral failure. However, there was no significant difference in mortality or significant differences in CD4 counts at 18 months follow-up between those who received counseling and those who did not. There were no significant differences in adherence, time to viral failure, mortality, or CD4 counts in patients who received alarm devices compared to those who did not.</p></sec><sec id="s1a4"><title>What Do These Findings Mean?</title><p>The results of this study suggest that intensive adherence counseling around the time of HIV treatment initiation significantly reduces poor adherence and virologic treatment failure, while using an alarm device has no effect. Therefore, investment in careful counseling based on individual needs at the onset of HIV treatment initiation, appears to have sustained benefit, possibly through strengthening the relationship between the health care provider and patient through communication, education, and trust. Interactive adherence counseling supports the bond between the clinic and the patient and may result in fewer patients needing to switch to expensive second-line medications and, possibly, may help to decrease the spread of resistant HIV. These findings define an adherence counseling protocol that is effective and are highly relevant to other HIV clinics caring for large numbers of patients in sub-Saharan Africa.</p></sec><sec id="s1a5"><title>Additional Information</title><p>Please access these Web sites via the online version of this summary at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1000422">http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1000422</ext-link>.</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>UNAIDS provides information about <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.unaids.org/en/resources/unaidspublications/2010/">HIV treatment strategies</ext-link>

In addition, it has been suggested that alarm devices, which are relatively inexpensive and easy to distribute, may improve pill adherence in Kenya <xref rid="pmed.1000422-Frick2" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. In order to concurrently evaluate the value of these distinct adherence interventions in a resource-limited setting, we conducted a factorial randomized trial in Nairobi, Kenya and compared impact of adherence counseling and the use of an alarm device on adherence and biological outcomes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s3"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Setting and Recruitment</title><p>The trial was conducted between May 2006 and September 2008 at the Coptic Hope Center for Infectious Diseases in Nairobi, Kenya (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1000422.s001">Texts S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1000422.s002">S2</xref>). The Hope Center is an HIV treatment clinic established in 2004 by the University of Washington and the Coptic Orthodox Mission. Supported by the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), the Hope Center provides free HIV care and antiretroviral treatment. Clinic procedures have been described elsewhere <xref rid="pmed.1000422-Chung1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. As per Kenyan national guidelines, newly diagnosed clients are initiated on free NNRTI-based HAART if they have: a CD4 count &#x0003c;250 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>, World Health Organization (WHO) clinical stage IV disease, or a CD4 count &#x0003c;350 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> with WHO clinical stage III disease <xref rid="pmed.1000422-Ojoo1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>.

In a 2&#x000d7;2 factorial design, participants were randomized in a 1&#x02236;1&#x02236;1&#x02236;1 ratio to one of four arms prior to initiating HAART: (1) adherence counseling alone; (2) alarm device alone; (3) both adherence counseling and alarm device together; and (4) a control group that received neither adherence counseling nor alarm device. Randomization was performed at enrollment by the study nurse who opened a sealed envelope containing a computer-generated block randomization code that was developed by the study biostatistician. Study investigators and participants were not blinded to the interventions. The prespecified primary endpoints for this study were adherence as measured by monthly manual pill counts, plasma HIV-1 RNA, and CD4 count.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Interventions</title><p>In the adherence counseling intervention, trained counselors administered two counseling sessions to participants prior to HAART initiation and a third session one month after HAART initiation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1000422.s001">Text S1</xref>). Counseling sessions around HAART initiation were based on a model of successful antiretroviral adherence promotion at a large University of Washington-affiliated HIV treatment program in Seattle, Washington <xref rid="pmed.1000422-Frick1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. All counseling sessions followed a written standardized protocol and lasted between 30 and 45 min. In the first session, counselors explored personal barriers to good adherence and taught participants about the HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, antiretroviral medications, and the risks of treatment failure due to poor adherence. The second session occurred on a separate day and involved a review of a participant's understanding and readiness to begin antiretroviral medications. The third session allowed the counselor to examine practical and personal issues that the participant may have encountered on HAART. The adherence counseling intervention had been previously used and adapted at the same site in Kenya for over 2 y and was delivered in English and Kiswahili.</p><p>Participants in the alarm device intervention received a small pocket digital alarm, the ALRT PC200 (ALR Technologies Inc), which the individual was to carry at all times for 6 mo duration. The device was programmed by the study staff to beep and flash twice a day at a time convenient to the participant when medications were to be taken. The digital alarm could not be reprogrammed or inactivated by the individual and was utilized for 6 mo after HAART initiation before being disabled by study staff.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Control</title><p>At HAART initiation, the study pharmacist explained the side effects of medications and problems associated with poor adherence in a 15-min session prior to dispensing drugs. All participants, including those in the control arm, received this educational message. Participants randomized to the control group did not receive adherence counseling or an alarm device.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Follow-up</title><p>At enrollment, participants signed a written informed consent, had blood drawn for HIV-1 RNA levels and CD4 count, and shared information on sociodemographic characteristics, risk behavior, and distance from clinic. After initiating HAART, participants returned to the study clinic at monthly intervals with their pill bottles to pick up antiretroviral medications. At each monthly visit, the study pharmacist counted and recorded the number of pills remaining in the bottle, the visit date, whether the participant took his or her morning dose, and the number of pills dispensed that day. Participants randomized to receive an alarm device were asked if they had been using the device at each of these monthly visits, and any defective, lost, or stolen devices were replaced at this time. Blood was drawn for CD4 count and HIV-1 RNA at 6, 12, and 18 mo after HAART initiation. Participants were followed for 18 mo on HAART before exiting the study. HIV-1 RNA was measured using the Gen-Probe quantitative HIV-1 viral load assay <xref rid="pmed.1000422-Emery1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. CD4 counts were determined using flow cytometry (FACScan, Becton Dickinson).</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Endpoints</title><p>Adherence was calculated at each pharmacy refill visit as the percentage of dispensed doses that were taken since the previous visit to the study pharmacy. Total time between the last date the participant was in the pharmacy and the participant's subsequent pharmacy visit included any missed visits to the pharmacy or time when the participant was not attending the clinic. This calculated adherence was assumed to be constant and the same as daily adherence throughout this time period. Continuous adherence and time to monthly adherence &#x0003c;80&#x00025; and &#x0003c;95&#x00025; were calculated <xref rid="pmed.1000422-Bangsberg1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pmed.1000422-Nachega1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.

Other study endpoints included mortality and change in CD4 count.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Statistical Methods</title><p>All analyses were modified intent-to-treat in that only individuals who initiated HAART, and therefore had pill count data collected for adherence measurement, were included in the analyses. Data from all participants were utilized in analyses until time of exit either because of completion of the study, loss to follow-up, or death. Because of the factorial design of the study, models to evaluate the study interventions were developed by first testing the statistical interaction between those who received counseling and those who received alarm. In all models, the interaction term had a <italic>p</italic>-value larger than 0.20 and therefore was dropped from the model. Accordingly, following the factorial design of the study, those who received counseling were compared against those who received no counseling and those who received an alarm device were compared against those who received no alarm. Analyses of discrete time-to-viral-failure event models were performed using SAS 9.2; all other analyses were performed using StataSE v10 (StataCorp).</p><p>Univariate comparisons were done using the Mann Whitney U test for continuous variables, and Chi square tests for binary variables. Baseline characteristics were compared between interventions and if there were statistically significant differences (i.e., an imbalance in a variable at baseline), then these variables were tested to see if they also related to the various outcomes of interest (adherence, mortality, viral load, and CD4 count).

Dedicating time towards effective communication regarding adherence may strengthen a provider-patient relationship that, in turn, promotes adherence through trust <xref rid="pmed.1000422-Watt1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. These findings support the implementation of adherence counseling among HIV clinics in sub-Saharan Africa and suggest that forms of relationship-strengthening adherence interventions should be continued, even in the setting of increasing resource constraints.</p><p>An intervention that reduces viral failure by more than half represents significant cost savings both from the deferred purchase of more expensive second-line antiretroviral medications and the potential expense of treating opportunistic reinfections. Compared to the costs of treatment failure, employing counselors in this setting is relatively inexpensive. Using tents where necessary to preserve confidentiality and having one counselor interact with groups of patients in the first session further decreases costs. Thus, upfront investment in adherence counseling could save programs from future financial losses due to treatment failure that, without counseling, could double. Our study also demonstrates that the best method of &#x0201c;treatment preparedness&#x0201d; as recommended by the WHO <xref rid="pmed.1000422-World1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, is not simply educating patients about antiretroviral drugs, side effects, and adherence, as was given to all participants in this study. Instead, two interactive, anticipatory sessions of counseling prior to HAART and a session 1 mo after HAART initiation may better prepare a patient in a resource-limited setting to adhere to a lifetime of antiretroviral drugs.</p><p>In contrast to counseling, our study did not find any beneficial effect of using an external alarm device on adherence or viral failure. This result concurs with recent studies and reviews that find limited impact or insufficient evidence to demonstrate the effectiveness of using an external reminder alone <xref rid="pmed.1000422-Mannheimer2" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1000422-Wise1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1000422-Simoni2" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. Although the pocket alarms were widely accepted and used by participants in this study, the alarm devices did not address psychosocial barriers to good adherence such as depression and stigma, which may be better handled through counseling in this population. External reminders that only inform patients when to take their pills may be less effective than those electronic devices, such as cell phone text messages, which can emulate and reinforce adherence counseling by supporting the relationship between patient and provider through interactive feedback. In this way, the positive impact of cell phone text messaging on adherence as recently demonstrated by Lester et al. may be interpreted as less a function of the cell phone as a reminder device but rather as a means to provide regular patient support <xref rid="pmed.1000422-Lester1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. The failure of alarm devices to demonstrate any impact on adherence or virologic outcomes suggests that contrary to previous assumptions <xref rid="pmed.1000422-Donnelly1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, reminding patients when to take their medication may not be the primary constraint to adherence in sub-Saharan Africa.</p><p>This study enrolled 400 participants and followed them for 18 mo, making it one of the largest and longest, single-site, randomized trials on adherence interventions and biological outcomes <xref rid="pmed.1000422-Rueda1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1000422-Simoni1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1000422-Amico1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. Two distinct and important interventions were assessed concurrently in a factorial trial, allowing parallel comparison of interactive counseling and more passive alarm-reminder interventions as adherence interventions. Multiple outcomes were regularly measured including manual monthly pill counts, HIV-1 plasma viral levels, CD4 counts, and mortality. Participants were antiretroviral na&#x000ef;ve and initiated the same free HAART regimen: a single fixed-dose combination pill (d4T, 3TC, nevirapine) taken twice a day. Based in a semi-private mission hospital in Nairobi and located near Kibera, one of the largest slums in Africa, the study clinic drew patients from a wide variety of socioeconomic and educational backgrounds <xref rid="pmed.1000422-Chung2" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. Adherence among all study participants were comparable to the generally high levels found throughout sub-Saharan Africa <xref rid="pmed.1000422-Mills1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, with 91&#x00025; having adherence &#x02265;80&#x00025; over 18 mo. These study strengths support the validity and broad applicability of adherence counseling among antiretroviral treatment programs in resource-limited settings.</p><p>There are several limitations to the study. The intent-to-treat analysis was modified to include only those who initiated HAART since pill count was a necessary method of measuring adherence. In an analysis comparing those who were lost to follow-up and those who were retained, the study was biased towards retaining those who may have been slightly poorer and therefore potentially more receptive to attentive counseling and free medications. This may have resulted in associations that are more applicable to a poorer population. Despite randomization, baseline differences between intervention arms were noted; these were adjusted for in multivariable analyses if they were related to the outcome of interest <xref rid="pmed.1000422-Pocock1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Adherence in this study was measured using clinic-based monthly manual pill counts. Although there is no gold standard for measuring adherence to medications <xref rid="pmed.1000422-Osterberg1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>, pill counts may overestimate adherence since missing pills may not have been ingested by the participant but instead have been shared, discarded, or lost <xref rid="pmed.1000422-Gill1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. Similarly, use of the alarm device was measured by self-report and was not able to be verified. It is possible that continuous use of the alarm device was overestimated and that the insignificant associations found in this study may have been due to poor participant participation in this intervention. The adherence counseling intervention was not associated with decreased mortality. The lack of an association may have been due to relatively short follow-up and lack of power due to few mortality events. Given that virologic failure precedes death due to poor adherence, the demonstrated impact of adherence counseling on virologic outcomes in this study suggests that beneficial effects on mortality might have been apparent if the study was larger and had longer follow-up <xref rid="pmed.1000422-Mellors1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>.</p><p>Definitions of viral failure and poor adherence are variable. The threshold of viral failure in this study was defined using WHO guidelines (HIV-1 RNA &#x02265;5,000 copies/ml) <xref rid="pmed.1000422-World1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, and an association with adherence counseling was also demonstrated at lower thresholds (HIV-1 RNA &#x02265;1,000 copies/ml). However, the threshold of viral failure may be defined differently <xref rid="pmed.1000422-Aldous1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1000422-Hosseinipour1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. Adequate adherence defined as taking &#x02265;95&#x00025; of prescribed pills derives from literature examining regimens containing un-boosted protease inhibitors (PIs) <xref rid="pmed.1000422-Paterson1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. The impact of counseling on adherence &#x0003c;95&#x00025; was not significant in this study. An adherence level of &#x0003c;80&#x00025; was defined as poor adherence in this study, because HAART containing NNRTIs and not PIs were used and NNRTI-based regimens are most commonly prescribed in resource-limited settings <xref rid="pmed.1000422-Calmy1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1000422-WoolsKaloustian1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. This definition is supported by study evidence showing that adherence &#x0003c;80&#x00025; was significantly associated with HIV-1 RNA &#x02265;5,000 copies/ml.</p><p>In summary, we found that intensive counseling on adherence to antiretroviral medications around the time of HAART initiation significantly reduced poor adherence and virologic treatment failure, while using an alarm device had no impact. Investment in careful individualized counseling at the onset of HAART appears to have sustained benefit. These findings are highly relevant to other HIV clinics caring for large numbers of patients in sub-Saharan Africa. Implementing adherence counseling or interventions that strengthen the relationship between the provider and patient through communication, education, and trust may substantially reduce the risk of antiretroviral treatment failure. Supporting the bond between the clinic and patient in this way appears to be more effective than using a device that simply reminds patients when to take their pills. Through interactive counseling and communication, fewer patients may need to switch to expensive second-line medications and the spread of resistant HIV may decrease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1000422.s001"><label>Text S1</label><caption><p>Trial protocol.</p><p>(0.33 MB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1000422.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1000422.s002"><label>Text S2</label><caption><p>CONSORT checklist.</p><p>(0.22 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1000422.s002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the research personnel, clinic staff, and data management teams in Nairobi, Kenya and Seattle, Washington; the Coptic Hope Center for Infectious Diseases for their cooperation; and the Division of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at Kenyatta National Hospital for providing facilities for administration and data analysis.
