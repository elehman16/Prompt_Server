While they may not be clinically diagnosed as depressed, nurses often suffer from depression and anxiety symptoms, which can lead to a low level of patient care. However, there is no rigorous evidence base for determining an effective prevention strategy for these symptoms in nurses. After reviewing previous literature, we chose a strategy of treatment with omega-3 fatty acids and a mindfulness-based stress management program for this purpose. We aim to explore the effectiveness of these intervention options for junior nurses working in hospital wards in Japan.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>A factorial-design multi-center randomized trial is currently being conducted. A total of 120 nurses without a managerial position, who work for general hospitals and gave informed consent, have been randomly allocated to a stress management program or psychoeducation using a leaflet, and to omega-3 fatty acids or identical placebo pills. The stress management program has been developed according to mindfulness cognitive therapy and consists of four 30-minute individual sessions conducted using a detailed manual. These sessions are conducted by nurses with a managerial position. Participants allocated to the omega-3 fatty acid groups are provided with 1,200 mg/day of eicosapentaenoic acid and 600 mg/day of docosahexaenoic acid for 90 days.</p><p>The primary outcome is the change in the total score of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), determined by a blinded rater via the telephone at week 26. Secondary outcomes include the change in HADS score at 13 and 52 weeks; presence of a major depressive episode; severity of depression, anxiety, insomnia, burnout, and presenteeism; utility scores and adverse events at 13, 26 and 52 weeks.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>An effective preventive intervention may not only lead to the maintenance of a healthy mental state in nurses, but also to better quality of care for inpatients. This paper outlines the background and methods of a randomized trial that evaluates the possible additive value of omega-3 fatty acids and a mindfulness-based stress management program for reducing depression in nurses.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Clinicaltrials.gov: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02151162">NCT02151162</ext-link> (registered on 27 May 2014).</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Anxiety</kwd><kwd>Behavior therapy</kwd><kwd>Depression</kwd><kwd>Fatty acids</kwd><kwd>Omega-3</kwd><kwd>Mindfulness</kwd><kwd>Prevention and control</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Hospital nurses are vulnerable to psychological stress and mental disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In early reports, the suicide rate of female nurses was significantly higher than that of average workers, and their life expectancy at the age of 45 years was 26.9 years, which is only one year more than that of miners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In a cross-sectional survey conducted in Cyprus, 65% of nurses reported that their job was stressful, and the prevalence of fatigue was higher in females (93%) than in males (88%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>Consequently, nursing is highly associated with depression. The prevalence of depressive symptoms above a clinical cut-off among hospital-employed nurses is 18% in the United States [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Nurses with depression are not only likely to suffer personally, but their illness may also have an impact on the quality of care for patients, through an increase in presenteeism. In terms of the monetary burden of patient care, the costs due to increased falls and medication errors that are caused by presenteeism are estimated at 1,346 USD per nurse annually [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>A systematic review conducted on psychological distress among hospital nurses in the United States reported that emotional fatigue and burnout in nurses is associated with lack of support from senior management in the form of safety programs, and support from supervisors, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Less-experienced junior nurses need support from senior colleagues and require interventions to empower resilience in order to alleviate their psychological distress.</p><p>When considering the possible options for intervention in depression, pharmacological treatments can be discounted because they are not useful as a preventive intervention due to their adverse side effects. Instead, lifestyle interventions, such as exercise and diet, are highly likely to be easily implemented and are promising options. With regard to exercise, according to a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), depressive symptoms among patients with a chronic illness and functioning problems were reduced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]; however, rigorous evidence has not supported exercise as a preventive measure for depression and anxiety symptoms among the elderly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] or children and young people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In addition, intensive exercise may not be feasible due to the busy schedule of nurses working in hospitals. In contrast, the most feasible interventions may be diet. Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), in particular eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), have been most frequently evaluated for their effects on depression and anxiety disorders. Many previous systematic reviews that have accumulated data from RCTs have been published; however, there are some reviews that show a positive effect of omega-3 PUFAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and others that do not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In addition, these reviews did not focus on preventative interventions.</p><p>In a recently published comprehensive meta-analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], omega-3 PUFAs were effective in patients with a diagnosis of major depressive disorder, but not effective at preventing depression in healthy subjects. In this analysis, three parallel design RCTs for the prevention of depression in healthy subjects were assessed, with a follow-up duration of over three months. The studies employed a daily dose of 1.093 g EPA and 0.226 g DHA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], 3.0 g EPA and 0.6 g DHA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] or 3.0 g EPA and 0.6 g DHA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. However, a high daily EPA dose of between 1,000 and 1,500 mg/d with a ratio of 2:1 DHA is argued as optimal for affective disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Based on the current evidence for omega-3 PUFAs as a preventive tool for anxiety and depressive symptoms, we believe that methodologically rigorous trials employing optimal doses of EPA and DHA are still needed.</p><p>On the other hand, psychological interventions, such as stress management, problem solving and support should be considered as possible interventions in workplace settings because of their feasibility and accessibility. A Cochrane review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] has revealed that a psychological intervention to alleviate stress among workers in the workplace can be efficacious according to several small RCTs; however, this review concluded that the methodological quality of these trials was not sufficient, and further methodologically sound trials with a larger sample size are needed to reach firm conclusions.</p><p>Among the various types of psychotherapy, mindfulness-based cognitive therapy and meditation have been given particular attention by both clinicians and researchers. In a systematic review, mindfulness meditation programs have shown moderate evidence of improvements in depression, with an effect size of 0.30 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.00 to 0.59) at post-treatment), when compared with nonspecific active controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]; however, the review focused on a clinical sample and therefore was not able to conclude any preventive effects of the psychotherapy. To the best of our knowledge, there has been no systematic review focusing on the prevention of depression and anxiety symptoms in the workplace. Although the efficacy of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy in nurses has been examined in a previous RCT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], the trial included only a small number of participants and no firm conclusions could be drawn. For this reason, a conclusive RCT is necessary to establish evidence of an effective psychological intervention that can help to maintain a healthy mental state in hospital nurses.</p><p>Hence, the present study aims to conduct a methodologically rigorous factorial-design trial with 1:1:1:1 allocation to explore the effectiveness of omega-3 PUFAs, and a mindfulness-based stress management program for maintaining a healthy mental state in hospital nurses.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Trial design</title><p>A parallel-arms factorial-design RCT with a 52-week follow-up period has been planned. Participants will be randomly allocated to one of the four intervention arms: 1) mindfulness-based stress management program plus omega-3 PUFAs; 2) mindfulness-based stress management program plus placebo; 3) psychoeducation leaflet plus omega-3 PUFAs and 4) psychoeducation leaflet plus placebo. A total of 30 participants will be allocated to each arm. These interventions will terminate within three months from the registration of the participant. The primary outcome will be the depression and anxiety severity at 26 weeks (rated blindly), assessed using the 14-item Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). After each assessment, an assessor will guess which group the participant has been assigned to, making it possible to examine if the blinding is successful.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>The inclusion criteria for participants are as follows:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Aged between 20 and 59 years at entry to the study and of female gender.

Leaflets with information about the study will be distributed to nurses in hospital wards and interested nurses will be contacted by a CRC. Each nurse will input her data, except the HADS criterion, into an electronic data capturing (EDC) system via the internet, with some assistance by the CRC, and if she satisfies all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria, provisional written informed consent will be obtained. The participants will then be interviewed using the HADS through their mobile phone by a rater located in Kyoto University. If the nurse does not satisfy the HADS exclusion criterion, formal written informed consent will be obtained.</p><p>The participants will be randomly allocated to one of the four intervention arms via the EDC using a minimization method. Minimization is an adaptive stratified allocation system that is used in clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Minimization can reduce the imbalance between the numbers of patients in each treatment group over possible confounding factors. The participant&#x02019;s place of work, total score on the HADS of 11 or higher [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], and whether they have been working as a nurse for one year or more will be used as stratification variables (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>

Although a previous trial of 41 nursing students [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] employed mindfulness meditation with the non-judgmental awareness of moment-to-moment experiences as the central axis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], we extracted the treatment components of body scan and breathing meditation from mindfulness meditation because these techniques are considered easy to learn and helpful for nurses, in our experience. The stress management program consists of four weekly 30-minute individual sessions and is highly structured, with a detailed manual. The contents of each session are as follows: 1) understanding the cognitive behavioral model of stress and emotion of the participant, 2) reviewing the model and conducting body scanning and breathing exercises, 3) reviewing the results of model and body scanning and then promoting awareness of the cognition of the participant and 4) reviewing the model, providing suggestions about increasing pleasant behaviors and planning a strategy to manage future stress. The feasibility of the program has been examined by employing five nurses as participants in a pilot run, the protocol of which was approved by the institutional review boards of the National Center of Neurology and Psychiatry on 15 November 2013 (approval number: A2013-102). No dropouts due to the program were observed. All the participants reported that the program might be helpful for nurses to manage stress from their work. Some rewordings have been done to the program according to comments from the participants.</p><p>The stress management program will be conducted by senior nurses in four individual sessions within the first three months. Senior nurses will have taken a seven-hour workshop, including lectures and role-playing sessions. The detailed manual and videos, including lectures, will be provided to the senior nurses. The senior nurses will be supervised monthly by email once the program commences. All sessions will be audiotaped and 20% of them will be randomly selected and evaluated by two independent researchers to assess the integrity of the program. They will check for adherence to the treatment manual with a checklist for each session.</p><p>A leaflet has been prepared for the psychoeducation leaflet groups. This is based on a freely distributed psychoeducation leaflet about healthy mental state written by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The leaflet includes information about checking for signs of stress, relaxation and sleep hygiene, and suggestions for stress management such as exercise, laughter and meeting intimate friends. It also includes a list of consultants for mental health. We have adapted this leaflet to be applicable to our study by adding advice from senior nurses about working without stress. Participants allocated to the leaflet groups will be instructed to read this often, especially when they feel anxious or stressed.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Supplements interventions</title><p>Omega-3 PUFA capsules have been formulated to contain 1,200 mg EPA and 600 mg DHA (Kentech Co. Ltd., Toyama, Japan) according to recommendations from experts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The participants will take the capsules once a day for 90 days from entry into the study. Placebo capsules contain rapeseed oil (47%), soybean oil (25%), olive oil (25%) and fish oil (3%), and have an identical appearance and similar odor (Kentech Co. Ltd., Toyama, Japan).</p><p>Adherence to the regimens will be checked among nurses working for the National Center of Neurology and Psychiatry Hospital and National Disaster Medical Center from results of blood tests. At baseline and at the three-month assessment, red blood cells (RBCs) will be obtained from EDTA-anticoagulated blood (Terumo Corporation, Tokyo, Japan), washed twice with saline and frozen at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C until analysis. The fatty acid composition of the total phospholipid fraction of the RBCs will be determined as described previously, with slight modifications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Briefly, the total lipid content will be extracted from RBCs according to the method used by Bligh and Dyer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The total phospholipid fraction will be separated by thin-layer chromatography. After transmethylation with HCl-methanol, the fatty acid composition will be analyzed using a gas chromatography system (GC14A Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan) equipped with a capillary column DB-225 (length: 30 m; internal diameter: 0.25 mm; film: 0.25 &#x003bc;m; J&#x00026;W Scientific, Folsom, California, United States); the entire system was controlled using gas chromatography software CLASS-GC10 version 1.3 (Shimadzu Corporation). In addition, to assess adherence to the regimen, all the remaining capsules will be collected from all the participants after the three-month assessment.</p><p>Participants who decide to leave the allocated intervention due to adverse events or any other reason within the first 13 weeks will be classified as dropouts from the intervention, but will still be asked to complete the assessments. Participants allocated to the leaflet and placebo capsule groups will not be allowed to take the stress management program and omega-3 PUFA capsules respectively, after 26 weeks. However, they will be allowed to take these interventions thereafter, and information will be collected from these participants.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Assessment measures</title><p>Information about depression and anxiety symptoms (primary outcome), insomnia, burnout, presenteeism, quality of life, sick leave, consultation about the mental state of the participant and oxidative stress will be collected at baseline, three months, six months (primary time point) and 12 months from registration for each participant (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>

The PHQ-9 was developed as a self-report version of the PRIME-MD that aims at a DSM-IV diagnosis of several common mental disorders. The PHQ-9 has been used as an assessment of major depressive disorder, according to DSM-5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The PHQ-9 consists of the nine diagnostic criteria items, which make a total score range between 0 and 27. Good test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC)&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.92) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] and internal consistency reliability (Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.89) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] have been reported.

The GAD-7 was developed to screen for and evaluate the severity of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) in the general population. The GAD-7 consists of seven items and can give a diagnosis according to DSM-IV and DSM-5. The internal consistency and test-retest reliability of the GAD-7 were a Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha of 0.92 and intraclass correlation of 0.83, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Total scores between five and nine, 10 and 14, or 15 and 21 indicate mild, moderate or severe anxiety symptoms, respectively. According to a recently published systematic review, the GAD-7 was the best performing test for GAD, with a positive likelihood ratio of 5.1 (95% CI: 4.3 to 6.0) and a negative likelihood ratio of 0.13 (95% CI: 0.07 to 0.25) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. A Japanese version of the GAD-7 has been developed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] and the agreement rate of diagnosis compared to the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview was reported as satisfactory.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Burnout</title><p>The Maslach&#x02019;s Burnout Inventory (MBI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] will be used to assess burnout in nurses. The MBI is a tool for detecting and measuring the severity of burnout syndrome. It is a 22-item questionnaire that assesses the degree of burnout in terms of three subscales: emotional exhaustion (EE), depersonalization (DP) and personal accomplishment (PA). EE represents feelings of being emotionally exhausted and having a lack of energy, DP represents feelings of impersonal responses towards recipients of the service and PA represents feeling of incompetence. The original English version has a good validity and reliability, with a Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha of 0.71 to 0.90 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. The Japanese version also has good reliability, with a Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha of 0.77, 0.76 and 0.60 for EE, DP and PA, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Insomnia</title><p>The Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] will be used to assess insomnia at baseline, 13, 26 and 52 weeks. The ISI is now considered a standard global measure for assessing the severity of insomnia and is used in many studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Total scores between eight and 14 and 15 and 28 indicate subthreshold insomnia and clinical insomnia, respectively. The internal consistency of the ISI has a Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha of 0.90 in a community population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. In a clinical population, a difference in score of &#x02212;8.4 points (95% CI: &#x02212;7.1 to &#x02212;9.4) was associated with a moderate improvement, as rated by an independent assessor after treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. The Japanese version has been validated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Somatic symptoms</title><p>The Bradford Somatic Inventory (BSI) will be used to measure somatic symptoms at baseline, 13, 26 and 52 weeks. The BSI is a 44-item questionnaire for female subjects about symptoms experienced in the previous month, which was designed to detect physical symptoms commonly related to depressed patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. We selected the BSI as a measurement for somatic symptoms because there are no other assessment tools for this purpose in the Japanese language. The original English version of the BSI was translated into Japanese by two Japanese psychiatrists (NW and YM) and back-translated into English by one psychiatrist (TAF). The translations were then checked by the original author of the BSI (Professor David B Mumford). The number of positive items in the BSI will be used as a measure of the severity of somatic symptoms in this study. Data from the BSI will be collected through the EDC on days seven to 21 from entry into the study to check the test-retest reliability.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Presenteeism</title><p>The World Health Organization Heath and Work Performance Questionnaire (HPQ) will be used to assess presenteeism at baseline, 13, 26 and 52 weeks. The HPQ is a self-report instrument designed to estimate the workplace costs of health problems in terms of self-reported reduced job performance (presenteeism). The HPQ measures of presenteeism can be used to calculate two scores: the absolute presenteeism score, obtained by multiplying the respondent&#x02019;s response to the second question by 10, and the relative presenteeism score, obtained by dividing the first response by the second response, then multiplying by 100. Absolute and relative presenteeism scores will be used in this study.</p><p>The validity of the scale has been confirmed in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. The Japanese version of the HPQ was used in the World Mental Health Survey in Japan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. The area under the curve values for absolute and relative presenteeism in relation to future absences due to mental disease were 0.71 (95% CI: 0.62 to 0.80) and 0.65 (95% CI: 0.55 to 0.75), respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Quality of life</title><p>The EuroQol (EQ-5D) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>] will be used to assess health-related quality of life (QoL) at baseline, 13, 26 and 52 weeks. The EQ-5D is a standardized instrument used as a measure of health outcome and is applicable to a wide range of health conditions and treatments. The five domains include mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain and/or discomfort, and anxiety and/or depression. There are three levels of severity: no problems, some or moderate problems and severe or extreme problems. Each pattern of responses is allocated to an individual utility score, which ranges from 0 (death) to one (perfect health). The Japanese version has been developed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. The test-retest reliability of the Japanese version was 0.996, and Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha was 0.827 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Oxidative stress</title><p>Oxidative stress and antioxidant levels will be evaluated at the baseline and three-month assessments among the nurses working for the National Center of Neurology and Psychiatry Hospital and National Disaster Medical Center. Oxidative stress is the imbalance between oxidative stress and antioxidant defenses. High oxidative stress or low antioxidant status are becoming increasingly recognized as biological mechanisms associated with poor health outcomes and the progression of a wide range of diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. An association between depression and oxidative stress has been reported in a recently published meta-analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]; however, the conclusions seem inconsistent due to large heterogeneity among the included studies, with an I<sup>2</sup> of 80% and possible selection bias as the studies did not cover a broad range of depression. Moreover, the meta-analysis included only cross-sectional studies; therefore, associations between changes in depression and oxidative stress remain unclear.</p><p>In the present study, we will use reactive oxygen metabolite-derived compounds (d-ROMs) and biological antioxidant potential (BAP) tests [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>] to evaluate oxidative stress and antioxidant levels, respectively, as used in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Adverse events</title><p>An adverse event is defined as any unwanted or unintended signs (including laboratory exams, suicidal and self-harm behaviors and very unstable mental states), symptoms or disease seen in trial participants, regardless of the causal relationship with the study intervention.

There are no previous reports associated with the stress management program, in terms of nurse-to-nurse interventions, that can contribute to the power calculation of our trial. Based on trials that have used nurses as therapists and the HADS as the primary outcome, one trial has examined the efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy conducted by nurses for depression in the elderly after lumber fracture operations, and a difference of 3.7 was found compared with treatment as usual [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. To the best of our knowledge, there have been no reports assessing treatment with omega-3 fatty acids for depression or anxiety in nurses. One systematic review and meta-analysis has shown that treatment with omega-3, &#x02265;60% EPA and &#x02264;40% DHA led to an effect size of &#x02212;0.026 (95% CI: &#x02212;0.200 to 0.148), when compared with a placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. Therefore, the mean difference in the HADS scores was estimated to be 4&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;6 (SD) between the stress management program and leaflet groups, and between the omega-3 fatty acids and placebo groups. To detect a significant difference at <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05 (two-tailed) with a power of 0.9, it was calculated that 48 patients would be required for each of the arms in both comparisons.

In the present factorial-design RCT, 30 participants would be necessary for each of the four groups.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Data management and analysis</title><p>All of the participants who are randomized at baseline will be included in the primary analyses (intention-to-treat (ITT)). First, a descriptive analysis of the variables at baseline will be performed. We do not plan any statistical tests to detect a difference at baseline among the trial arms because we aim to avoid multiple tests, and the decision to adjust for baseline data in RCTs should not be determined by whether baseline differences are statistically significant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. However, when clinically important differences at baseline are noted from a clinician&#x02019;s point of view, a sensitivity analysis will be performed by adjusting for all such possible confounds.</p><p>Second, for the primary outcome and all the continuous outcomes assessed at 26 and 52 weeks, differences among groups will be examined using a mixed-model repeated measures analysis. When missing data exist for categorical variables, which are all negative outcomes, an ITT principal will be applied by assuming that all dropouts did not satisfy the outcomes. However, per protocol analyses, where only data from completers are incorporated, will also be presented according to a recent recommendation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>].

In addition to these symptoms, approximately one in four nurses who are shift workers in Japan suffer from shift work disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>], which is characterized by excessive sleepiness and/or insomnia associated with their shift work schedule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. The high prevalence of these common psychiatric symptoms is probably due to the high responsibility, need for high levels of expertise and relatively low reward associated with the nursing profession. A significant association was found between depressive symptoms and effort-reward imbalance, with an odds ratio (OR) of 10.8, and between esteem-reward imbalance, with an OR of 3.2 in nurse managers working in hospitals in France [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>].</p><p>It would be hard to restructure the proportion of hospital workers and increase the number of nurses, or to reduce the responsibility and increase the salary of nurses. However, realistic interventions are needed to empower resilience in order to alleviate psychological distress among nurses. Lifestyle interventions, such as diet and psychotherapeutic approaches, are highly desirable options. When an effective preventive intervention has been established, the results may not only lead to the maintenance of a healthy mental state in nurses, but also a better quality of care for inpatients. We believe that the present study will be able to contribute to this goal.</p><p>The present study is not without methodological limitations. First, a previous observational study with a large sample size has reported that an increase in a nurses&#x02019; workload by one patient, and no bachelor&#x02019;s degree-level education led to an increase in preventable hospital deaths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. We do not plan to collect information about patient outcomes, because inpatients from the hospitals included in the study are usually discharged within approximately 14 days, and many nurses are involved in the care of each patient. Therefore, we have decided <italic>a priori</italic> not to investigate the efficacy of interventions on patient outcomes.</p><p>Second, some essential organizational characteristics, including decision-making latitude and quality and quantity of support from peer nurses, are not considered in the study. All of the hospitals that are enrolled in the study are funded by national or local government and located in the capital city of Japan. Neither private nor rural hospitals are included. These may have an effect on the mental health of nurses and therefore these impose a negative impact on the applicability of findings from the study. However, the methodology of quantitatively measuring decision-making latitude, and quality and quantity of support from peer nurses in various disciplines has not been confirmed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The hospitals in this study are core general hospitals in the district and we believe that they are representative among hospitals in developed countries.</p><p>Third, because fish consumption is higher in Japan than in other countries, one may doubt the applicability of the findings about omega-3 PUFAs from the present study. A high consumption of fish has been reported to be correlated with a lower countrywide prevalence of major depression, according to a study published in 1998 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. However, the Japanese diet has been changing to a more Western diet similar to countries in other parts of the world. Moreover, we have excluded participants who consume fish as the main course of a meal four or more times per week. Therefore, we believe that our findings can be applied to the other countries.</p><p>In conclusion, this paper outlines the background and methods of a randomized trial evaluating the promising interventions for maintaining a healthy mental state in hospital nurses.</p><sec id="Sec32"><title>Trial status</title><p>The randomized trial is currently in the phase of participant enrolment and follow-up.</p></sec></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-list><def-item><term>BAP</term><def><p>Biological antioxidant potential</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BSI</term><def><p>Bradford Somatic Inventory</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CI</term><def><p>confidence interval</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CRC</term><def><p>Clinical research coordinator</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DHA</term><def><p>Docosahexaenoic acid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DSM</term><def><p>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EPA</term><def><p>Eicosapentaenoic acid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EDC</term><def><p>Electronic data capturing</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EQ-5D</term><def><p>EuroQol</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GAD-7</term><def><p>Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HADS</term><def><p>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICC</term><def><p>Intraclass correlation coefficient</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ISI</term><def><p>Insomnia Severity Index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ITT</term><def><p>Intention-to-treat</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MBI</term><def><p>Maslach&#x02019;s Burnout Inventory</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NNT</term><def><p>Number needed to treat</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OR</term><def><p>Odds ratio</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PHQ-9</term><def><p>Patient Health Questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PUFA</term><def><p>Polyunsaturated fatty acid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PRIME-MD</term><def><p>Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCT</term><def><p>Randomized controlled trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>d-ROM</term><def><p>Reactive oxygen metabolites-derived compound</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RBCs</term><def><p>Red blood cell</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HPQ</term><def><p>World Health Organization Heath and Work Performance Questionnaire</p></def></def-item></def-list></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors have no conflicts of interests to declare that may be affected by the publication of the manuscript.
