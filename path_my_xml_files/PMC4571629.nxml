As a result, patients often go many months without experiencing relief of their symptoms. There is a crucial need both to identify novel agents that provide a more rapid clinical onset of antidepressant effects and to develop methods that can predict the potential for patients to respond to specific antidepressant agents. The identification of biomarkers associated with treatment response in a rapid antidepressant paradigm carries potential both to identify critical neurobiology associated with treatment outcome and guide the development of novel antidepressant agents (<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">Zarate et al., 2013</xref>). An important aspect of biomarker development includes the replication of findings in independent cohorts as well as evaluations of the specificity or generalizability of a result.</p><p content-type="indent">While pretreatment activity and posttreatment change (<xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">Pizzagalli, 2011</xref>) in neural activity observed in the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) and other areas of the rostral anterior cingulate cortex has been linked to antidepressant treatment response in MDD (<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">Drevets et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">Mayberg et al., 1997</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Covington et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">Pizzagalli, 2011</xref>), neural activity in response to sad faces early in treatment (2 weeks) in sgACC predicted subsequent clinical response (<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">Keedwell et al., 2009</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Importantly, in these same studies, activity in areas of the occipital cortex at the same 2-week period, together with sgACC, also correlated with subsequent antidepressant response. These findings highlight the potential for neural activity within the sgACC and visual cortices to reflect subsequent clinical outcome, and if assessed prior to treatment, activity in these brain regions may function as biomarkers of subsequent antidepressant response.</p><p content-type="indent">The cholinergic neurotransmitter system is implicated in mood disorders (<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">Janowsky et al., 1972a</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">1972b</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0056" ref-type="bibr">Sitaram et al., 1982</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Dube et al., 1985</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">Janowsky et al., 1994</xref>), and the muscarinic-cholinergic antagonist scopolamine when administered intravenously produces rapid antidepressant effects (within 3 days) in patients with MDD (<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">Furey and Drevets, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Drevets and Furey, 2010</xref>). Importantly, this agent offers clinical efficacy in a fraction of the time required for conventional antidepressant options. This rapid response also offers a unique opportunity to quickly evaluate potential biomarkers of treatment outcome (<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Drevets et al., 2012</xref>). Previously, we demonstrated that pretreatment levels of neural activity in middle occipital cortex (MOC), when performing a face emotion working memory task, predicted treatment outcome to scopolamine in MDD (<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">Furey et al., 2013</xref>). Importantly, this effect was specific to an emotional processing condition, as no predictive value was observed when the same faces were included in a face-identity working memory task. The change in neural response in the MOC to these same task conditions measured acutely post-scopolamine administration also correlated with treatment outcome, and the direction of correlation reversed relative to the pretreatment correlation. Thus, brain regions reflecting the potential to respond to treatment also were modulated by acute scopolamine in a manner that correlated with treatment response.</p><p content-type="indent">The most consistently reported cognitive feature of mood disorders is a negative emotion-processing bias where patients demonstrate a bias towards processing negative emotional stimuli over positive stimuli (<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Bradley et al., 1995</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Mogg et al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">Murphy et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Erickson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">Harmer, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">Koster et al., 2010</xref>).

Moreover, the cholinergic transmission to these regions is influenced by structures involved in evaluating the salience of emotional stimuli, such as the amygdala (reviewed in <xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">Price, 2010</xref>). In healthy individuals, cholinergic activity differentially modulates neural responses in visual cortices based on emotional content (<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">Bentley et al., 2003</xref>), and thus the cholinergic dysfunction characterized in mood disorders may contribute to the emotional processing biases observed in this population.</p><p content-type="indent">The purpose of the current study was to assess neural estimates of an emotional processing bias as a potential biomarker of rapid treatment response to scopolamine within brain regions previously found to effectively predict treatment response in patients with MDD.

This procedure ensured that data were acquired following drug administration without compromising the double-blind nature of the study. After the infusion and before scanning, a 45-minute waiting period followed to allow the peak cognitive effects to develop and the peak side effects (ie, drowsiness) to diminish (<xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">Safer and Allen, 1971</xref>).

For each trial, participants were shown 2 stimuli comprised of superimposed images of faces and houses presented side-by-side. Participants were instructed to attend to either the face or the house component of the stimuli and to perform a matching task based on the attended stimulus component. For example, when participants attend to faces, the task is to determine if the faces in the 2 stimuli are of the same person or different people. Trials were separated by a 1500-ms inter-stimulus interval. Every 4 to 7 trials, the cue changed (2500ms), which instructed participants to shift attention to the other stimulus component. Under both attention conditions, the emotion in the face stimuli was modulated (happy or sad), creating conditions of explicit (attend to faces) and implicit (attend to house) emotion processing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). For each trial, both faces expressed the same emotion. The attentional target (faces or houses) was randomized at the beginning of each run. (B) Task runs alternated with control runs where stimuli were presented in the same spatial and temporal manner, but here the unattended stimulus component was phase scrambled. Thus, when matching based on faces, the house component of each stimulus is phase scrambled to provide visual noise with the same contrast and spatial frequency information as in the intact stimulus condition. Participants were instructed to perform a matching task based on the intact stimulus component. Every 4 to 7 trials, the participants would be cued, and then the intact component would shift from faces to houses or vice versa. When viewing faces, emotional expressions (happy and sad) were used but did not influence response requirements.

Approximately 80 face (most with multiple emotions and 2&#x02013;3 orientations) and 80 house (each with -3 orientations) stimuli were used to create the stimulus set for each session. Multiple orientations were used so that on matching trials, participants could not perform a simple pattern match. The same stimulus set was used to create the attention and control tasks. All complex stimuli were unique, but individual face and house pictures were used multiple times to complete the stimulus set for a session.

Five MDD subjects (31%) had a comorbid anxiety disorder that arose secondary to the primary MDD diagnosis based upon ages at onset. Overall, the patients showed a significant reduction in depression severity as indicated by a decrease in MADRS score from baseline to study end (t=4.7, <italic>P&#x0003c;.</italic>001). The percent reduction in MADRS scores ranged from -5% to 93%, with a mean decrease of 14.4 points. Image data from 2 MDD participants were excluded from analysis, one due to movement in the scanner that exceeded 1 voxel and one due to inadequate behavioral performance (chance level) indicating that they were not performing the task. Of the 14 patients (females=11, mean age [&#x000b1;SD] = 32 [&#x000b1;8.9]) whose image data were included in the analysis, 7 showed a clinical response following scopolamine (ie, &#x02265;50% reduction in MADRS score) and 7 were either partially or nonresponsive (reductions in MADRS of &#x0003c;50%). For subjects receiving scopolamine first (S/P), there was no worsening in depression severity between the end of the scopolamine block and the end of the study (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003e; .50). One subject discontinued the study after 5 infusions (the participant did receive the full series of scopolamine infusions and was included in these analyses as a nonresponder). The other participants completed all 7 infusions. Three additional participants failed to provide the final assessment (assessment 8, which occurs 3 to 5 days following the seventh infusion); they were included in the analysis using the last observation carried forward (2 of whom received scopolamine in the first series). The clinical findings for the patients included in this analysis are among those reported previously (<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">Furey and Drevets, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Drevets and Furey, 2010</xref>).</p><sec id="s14"><title>Emotional Processing Bias Analysis</title><p>Treatment response magnitude correlated significantly with the difference in BOLD response (ie, emotion processing bias) only under implicit processing (AH) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).

No bias estimate correlated with treatment response (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003e; .25).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s18"><title>Discussion</title><p>The results of this study demonstrate that the differential neural response that reflects an emotional processing bias, specifically during the implicit processing of emotion, may provide a biomarker of antidepressant response to the antimuscarinic agent, scopolamine. We observed that those patients who showed higher levels of neural activity at baseline to implicitly processed sad relative to happy faces in MOC subsequently manifested the larger clinical response to scopolamine. Moreover, greater neural activity in response to happy vs sad faces in the sgACC similarly predicted larger clinical response. These effects were specific to implicit emotion processing, when participants are attending away from the emotional faces, and thus reflect a processing bias associated with automatic emotional processing. These findings suggest that the magnitude and direction of an emotional processing bias may reflect the potential to respond clinically to scopolamine. Importantly, neural activity associated with the emotional processing bias during implicit processing at baseline did not predict placebo response, suggesting that these effects are specific to clinical improvement following scopolamine. As the patterns of correlation in MOC and sgACC mirror each other, these findings may indicate that a distributed brain network differentially responds to implicitly processed emotion in a manner that correlates with subsequent treatment outcome to scopolamine. This finding calls for more specific network analyses that address this possibility.</p><p content-type="indent">An emotion processing bias also was evident in the behavioral performance data, with patients responding more rapidly when stimuli contain sad faces than happy faces under implicit emotion processing conditions. The behavior effect was selective to the implicit processing condition, as no bias was evident between emotional expressions under explicit processing conditions or during the control task. Healthy participants showed no behavioral emotion processing bias.</p><p content-type="indent">Previously, we showed in an independent cohort of patients with MDD that baseline neural activity selectively during an emotion working memory task (and not when viewing the same faces but performing an identify working memory task) in a similar, spatially overlapping area in MOC also predicted treatment outcome to scopolamine (<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">Furey et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, 2 distinct tasks similarly predicted treatment outcome, and the predictive task conditions were selective to specific emotion processing requirements. Together, these findings suggest that neural activity per se is not sufficient to predict treatment outcome, but rather the task-specific processing demands associated with the neural response are critical. While each independent study indicated relevant selectivity of task conditions, the processing demands defined by the tasks are quite different. Additional work will be necessary to better define the specificity of processing demands that will uncover the relationship between neural response and treatment outcome. Our current data also provide a replication of the earlier finding, together pointing to MOC as a brain region that may prove to be a critical biomarker of treatment response to scopolamine, and the extant literature suggests that this may extend to other forms of antidepressant treatment (<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">Keedwell et al., 2009</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Thus, the results indicate that pretreatment neural activity in MOC associated with processing emotional faces under various task conditions may offer a biomarker of treatment response to scopolamine.</p><p content-type="indent">That these effects are specific to implicit processing, when attending away from the emotional faces, speaks to the relevance of automatic or bottom-up emotion processing to these findings. Evidence suggests that stimulus-driven, implicit processing of face emotion leads to differential levels of activity in the sgACC in MDD (<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">Laxton et al., 2013</xref>) and in visual cortical regions in healthy (<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">Bentley et al., 2003</xref>), supporting the implication of these regions in our findings.</p><p content-type="indent">Others also have identified biological measures that correlate with antidepressant treatment response. Several meta-analyses have reported that clinical status observed at 2 weeks into conventional antidepressant treatment is predictive of subsequent clinical response (<xref rid="CIT0058" ref-type="bibr">Szegedi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">Gorwood et al., 2013</xref>), allowing for clinical management decisions to be made earlier in the course of treatment. Clinical symptomatology and functional neuroimaging measures have been evaluated as markers of antidepressant response to conventional treatments such as SSRI&#x02019;s (<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">Harmer, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">Korb et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">MacQueen, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">Pizzagalli, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Furey et al., 2012</xref>), cognitive behavior therapy (<xref rid="CIT0053" ref-type="bibr">Siegle et al., 2006</xref>), and transcranial magnetic stimulation (<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">Gershon et al., 2003</xref>) as well as more experimental approaches that produce a rapid-onset of antidepressant action, including ketamine (<xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">Salvadore et al., 2009</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) and scopolamine (<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Furey et al., 2012</xref>). The identification of pretreatment biological measures that correlate with treatment response may prove particularly useful for guiding treatment decisions and hastening clinical response. In addition to predicting treatment response to specific or experimental agents, identified biomarkers carry the potential to be applicable to conventional treatments as well.</p><p content-type="indent">Several limitations to the current findings should be considered; those associated with the clinical findings (side effects, carry-over effects, unblinding and cognitive effects) have been discussed previously (archives 2006; BP 2010). Limitations associated with our primary results include a small sample size, although such sample sizes are not uncommon for placebo controlled pharmacoimaging studies with multiple groups (<xref rid="CIT0057" ref-type="bibr">Surguladze et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">Furey et al., 2013</xref>). A second limitation is related to the concern around the reproducibility of BOLD response to emotional faces. Importantly, the primary findings are based only on data acquired in the first session, and thus multiple session practice effects are not of concern. The possibility that habituation effects influence BOLD measures acquired post-scopolamine should be considered. The literature reflecting the impact of task repetition across imaging sessions is complicated and suggests that BOLD response is unchanged in some brain regions, while in other areas BOLD activity increases or decreases across sessions (<xref rid="CIT0060" ref-type="bibr">Tegeler et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">Miki et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">Qin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">Kirschen et al., 2005</xref>). Reproducibility of activation is relatively good in the visual cortex, with between 75% and 90% overlap in significant voxels (<xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">Rombouts et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">Miki et al., 2001</xref>). The literature does report suppression of the BOLD response with repeated presentations of the same stimuli (<xref rid="CIT0063" ref-type="bibr">Weigelt et al., 2008</xref>), which prompted us to use unique stimuli in each session. Importantly, BOLD signal did not change in a systematic manner post-scopolamine in the current study, as the changes that did occur were related to treatment outcome. A final limitation is related to the correlation between the change in the BOLD signal bias following scopolamine and treatment outcome. As the change score inherently retains information regarding the pretreatment BOLD estimate, this analysis is not independent from the primary analysis.</p><p content-type="indent">The need to improve upon current treatment options is clear, and the identification of biomarkers of response, particularly in a human biomarker of rapid antidepressant effect paradigm (<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">Zarate et al., 2013</xref>), will facilitate this goal. Functional brain imaging has been used successfully to discriminate between treatment responders and nonresponders (<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">Korb et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr">Salvadore et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">Furey et al., 2013</xref>) and to begin to characterize pretreatment, brain-based differences among patients that reflect the potential to respond to specific treatments. These findings indicate that biological variables underlie the clinical variability associated with treatment response, supporting the concept that a more personalized approach to treatment has the potential to be successful. Our findings further demonstrate that brain function per se is not sufficient to predict treatment response, but rather task- and/or stimulus-specific neural activity in key brain regions is necessary to successfully predict treatment outcome.</p><p content-type="indent">The findings reported here show that baseline, pretreatment neural activity and the rapid manipulation of this activity predict clinical response to scopolamine, indicating that baseline brain function inherently reflects the potential to respond to treatment. While others have observed correlations between response to various antidepressants and neural activity in both visual cortex and sgACC, those effects were observed 2 weeks into treatment, and thus the predictive nature was unrelated to baseline function. Importantly, our findings replicate earlier results indicating that differential neural response to emotional stimuli in visual cortex might provide a useful biomarker for identifying a subgroup of patients who will respond favorably to scopolamine. While these findings may not offer immediate utility to clinicians, they do indicate that biologically based measures can inform us about the potential for patients to respond to treatment and further may guide the development of novel antidepressants.</p></sec><sec><title>Interest Statement</title><p>The NIMH has filed a use-patent for the use of scopolamine in the treatment of depression, and Drs.
