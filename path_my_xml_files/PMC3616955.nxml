However, there is very little information as to their role in acute asthma exacerbations. We hypothesized that LTRAs may accelerate lung function recovery when given in an acute exacerbation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted at the Aga Khan University Hospital to assess the efficacy of oral montelukast on patients of 16&#x000a0;years of age and above who were hospitalized with acute asthma exacerbation. The patients were given either montelukast or placebo along with standard therapy throughout the hospital stay for acute asthma. Improvements in lung function and duration of hospital stay were monitored.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>100 patients were randomized; their mean age was 52&#x000a0;years (SD +/&#x02212; 18.50).

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Its incidence is on the rise all across the world, especially in the pediatric population, with bronchial asthma accounting for 4% of the pediatric out-patient visits
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. A multi-country survey has demonstrated a rise in asthma symptoms from 8.5% to 11.7% in 13&#x02013;14&#x000a0;year old Pakistani children, over a 6&#x000a0;year period
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>Asthma is associated with chronic airway inflammation with recruitment of a number of inflammatory cells including T-cells, mast cells and eosinophils. The macrophages, eosinophils and mast cells in particular have the capacity to synthesize cysteinyl leukotrienes. The interaction of these mediators with the Type 1 cysteinyl leukotriene (CysLT) receptors, located on inflammatory cells and the structural cells of the airways, is implicated in inflammatory cell infiltration, initiation of bronchial smooth muscle contraction, mucus secretion and increased vascular permeability that ultimately leads to airway narrowing
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Montelukast is the most commonly used cysteinyl leukotrienes receptor 1 (CysLT-1) antagonist. It has been shown to improve symptoms and lung function (FEV<sub>1</sub>) within 15&#x000a0;minutes of administration in chronic asthma with its effects lasting for a period of at least 24&#x000a0;hours
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>The existing therapeutic modalities for acute asthma include oxygen and short acting &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> agonist bronchodilators in order to promptly reverse airflow obstruction
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The systemic corticosteroids are recommended for exacerbations that are unresponsive to initial therapeutic measures but studies have shown a 4&#x02013;6&#x000a0;hour delay in the onset of the effects of steroid therapy
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Such a delay can prove to be catastrophic in the 30% of patients who fail to respond to initial therapy by short acting &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonists
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Furthermore, an increased rate of relapse following an acute exacerbation persists even with corticosteroid therapy
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] with an estimated 10% rate of relapse within 7&#x000a0;days of discharge from the emergency room (ER) and a 31% recurrence rate 10 to 21&#x000a0;days after discharge

All patients presenting either to the emergency department or outpatient clinics of the AKUH requiring hospitalization with acute asthma exacerbation were screened for inclusion in the study. The study was approved by the Ethical Review Committee (ERC) of the Aga Khan University (375-Med/ERC-04). A written informed consent was obtained before enrollment and findings were shared with subjects interested in the study outcome on clinic follow-up. The patients underwent a baseline spirometry and peak expiratory flow (PEF) testing soon after enrollment. A brief questionnaire was used to obtain information about the duration, severity and treatment of asthma.</p></sec><sec><title>Measurement</title><p>The bedside spirometry was done using PiKo-1 (ATS and EU electronic peak flow monitor, Ferraris Respiratory Europe Ltd., Westford SG13 7NW, UK) software which measures the PEF and FEV<sub>1.</sub> The PiKo-1 test was repeated three times. The primary aim of utilizing the software was to facilitate both patient and investigator use. Each test was performed within three minutes of the previous one. The spirometry was done on admission and discharge. Other investigations like chest radiographs and arterial blood gases (ABG&#x02019;s) were done if deemed necessary by the admitting team.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size</title><p>A group sample size of 50 patients in treatment (Montelukast) and 50 in placebo group achieved 80% power to detect a mean difference of 0.3 liters between the two groups with a mean of 2.2

The required final target sample size was 100 patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Randomization and blinding</title><p>The AKUH pharmacy played a pivotal role in the randomization of patients. The trial coordinator at the AKUH pharmacy was the key person to maintain randomization and blinding and was the only one to know the treatment status of the patient. Allocation numbers were generated and assigned to each patient found eligible to be enrolled in the study. Patients were distributed to each arm based on the allocated code. Neither the evaluators, nor the on-call admitting team were made aware of the actual treatment allocations.</p><p>The patients were randomly allocated to one of the two study arms; patients in arm-1 received standard therapy and oral montelukast sodium (10&#x000a0;mg once daily) and those in arm-2 received standard therapy along with a placebo.</p></sec><sec><title>Intervention</title><p>All patients with acute asthma underwent clinical assessment for severity of attack and received standard therapy with oxygen and inhaled bronchodilators via jet nebulizer with salbutamol 2.5&#x000a0;mg and ipratropium bromide 500 mcg mixed with 2&#x000a0;cc of normal saline every 15 to 30&#x000a0;minutes. The duration of the high dose bronchodilator therapy was variable (1&#x02013;4&#x000a0;hours) and subsequently tapered to every 6&#x000a0;hours depending on the symptomatic response to therapy. A dose of systemic corticosteroids in the form of hydrocortisone 200&#x000a0;mg IV was administered in the ER followed by 100&#x000a0;mg every 6&#x000a0;hours.

The cysteinyl leukotrienes possess pro-inflammatory characteristics which can directly cause or potentiate airflow obstruction by increased mucosal secretion and bronchospasm
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Leukotriene pathway modifiers, hence, are a subject of interest as a possible adjunct therapy in the acute management of asthma exacerbation. However, our results are in contrast to data recently published by Ramsay et al. They randomized 73 patients and found a significantly higher peak expiratory flows (PEFs) measured in the morning after admission in patients who received montelukast (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.046, 95% CI of 1.15-113.6&#x000a0;L/min) as compared to patients who did not
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. A study by Silverman et al. evaluated the effects of another LTRA, zafirlukast. They randomized patients into three groups; oral zafirlukast at 20&#x000a0;mg and 160&#x000a0;mg vs. placebo. They looked at the time to relapse in the outpatient setting after discharge from the emergency department and found reduction in the absolute rate of relapse by 5.3% in patients treated with zafirlukast. They reported significant improvement in FEV<sub>1</sub> and dyspnea in the ER only with 160&#x000a0;mg of zafirlukast
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Other studies have also looked into effects of intravenous montelukast in managing acute asthma exacerbations. Camargo et al. randomized 201 patients to three groups with two receiving separate doses of montelukast (7&#x000a0;mg and 14&#x000a0;mg) and one group receiving placebo. They reported significantly higher FEV<sub>1</sub> in patients receiving standard therapy with montelukast as compared to placebo at 10&#x000a0;minutes (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.03), 20&#x000a0;minutes (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.007) and two hours (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.003)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. These results were validated in a more recent study in Japan which reported both IV monteleukast 7&#x000a0;mg and 14&#x000a0;mg to be effective as an adjunct therapy over 60&#x000a0;minutes; p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05 and p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001 respectively
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first one to report no added benefits of using montelukast in acute asthma exacerbation in hospitalized adult population. Other studies which report similar findings mostly correspond to the pediatric population
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Nelson et al.
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and Morris et al.
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] did not find any significant increase in FEV<sub>1</sub> by using oral and intravenous montelukast respectively while Todi et al. reported similar proportion of children having Modified Pulmonary Index Score&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;9 in both the study and control groups
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>A possible reason we failed to find significant improvement is that we looked at PEFs early in the course of hospitalization instead of FEV<sub>1</sub> in comparison to the positive studies cited above. Another reason for failure of significant improvement might be the use of enteral route of administration. However, Dockhorn et al. conducted a study comparing the effectiveness of intravenous montelukast vs. oral montelukast vs. placebo in the setting of acute asthma. Though intravenous montelukast was quicker in onset of action with the mean percentage change in FEV<sub>1</sub> higher at earlier time intervals (15 mins to 1&#x000a0;hour), this difference decreased over the time and was not significant (p&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.05). Moreover, there was no difference in mean maximum percentage change in FEV<sub>1</sub> from baseline between intravenous and oral montelukast (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.071)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>This study has several limitations. Firstly, our study sample is relatively small. Secondly, we excluded patients with respiratory failure requiring positive pressure ventilation, either noninvasive or invasive. Both these factors may have impacted on the strength of difference observed in the two groups. Another limitation is the lack of biological surrogate markers like cysteinyl leukotrienes levels which have been shown to be higher in states of acute asthma exacerbation
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. It is possible that these levels may have reduced in the patients but did not translate into clinical effectiveness yet. The use of Piko-1 pocket spirometer is another limitation in our study. A study from Switzerland revealed that the accuracy of Piko-1 spirometer is acceptable. However, it tended to underestimate FEV1 in the lower range in 20 volunteers
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Lastly, this was a single center study and hence, cannot be generalized to the whole population.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our study suggests that there is no added benefit of using montelukast along with the standard therapy for the management of acute asthma exacerbation in hospitalized adult population.
