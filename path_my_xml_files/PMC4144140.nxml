These main factors can be summarized as the design of the toothbrush, the skill of the individual using the brush, and toothbrushing frequency and duration of use.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] The last two factors represent individual toothbrushing behavior and are affected by learning experience, motivation and manual capacity and can of course be improved with good co-operation established between dentists and patients. However, the first factor represent technology improvement and is affected by the physical and mechanical properties of the toothbrush bristles and the shape, size and morphometry of the tooth brush heads and handles.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Furthermore, it was well-known that most people use a simple horizontal tooth brushing action and brush their teeth for the duration markedly shorter than optimal time.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Manufacturers of toothbrushes aim for innovations in the brush head design that will help to compensate for nonideal toothbrushing technique and time.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] The more basic designs include tooth brushes with standard (straight) bristles and more advanced models with angled (CrissCross<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) bristles specially aiming at helping to remove plaque from teeth and along the gum line.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] The advanced toothbrushes has the potential to remove greater amounts of plaque, especially from the gum lines and approximal surfaces than conventional tooth brushes incorporating straight bristles.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] On the other hand, there has been conflicting results whether which design is more capable of effective plaque control.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Gingival recession (GR) is defined as the exposure of the root surface due to the displacement of the gingival margin apical to the cemento-enamel junction (CEJ). First toothbrushes were developed solely to effectively remove plaque and they had hard and then medium bristle softness. Recently, soft bristles were used in straight and criss-cross brushes as hard and medium bristle stiffness could have the potential for causing soft tissue damage.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, there has been no clinical evidence that a toothbrush with criss-cross bristles does not cause soft tissue trauma after long-term usage.

The participants were instructed to brush their teeth twice daily using given toothbrushes during the study period. They were also asked to refrain from all oral hygiene procedures and chewing gum for 12 h prior to their appointment before each measurement appointment. The toothbrushes and toothpastes (a basic toothpaste with no antiplaque agent (Ipana Classic Taste, P and G, Istanbul, Turkey) were delivered according to the allocation of randomization and all clinical indices were performed and recorded by another investigator (EC) blinded to randomization. Plaque index (PI) was scored according to the criteria of the Quigley and Hein index[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] modified by Turesky:[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Score 0: No plaque. Score 1: Separate flecks of plaque at the gingival margin of the crown. Score 2: A thin continuous band of plaque at the gingival margin of the crown. Score 3: A band of plaque wider than 1 mm but covering less than one-third of the crown of the tooth. Score 4: Plaque covering less than two-thirds of the crown of the tooth. Score 5: Plaque covering more than two-thirds of the crown of the tooth. The dental plaque on the teeth was disclosed with basic fuchsin tablets. Gingival index (GI)[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] was scored according to the following criteria by Silness and Loe: Score 0: Absence of inflammation. Score 1: A slight change in color and little change in texture. Score 2: A moderate redness, edema and hypertrophy and bleeding on probing (BoP). Score 3: A marked redness, hypertrophy and tendency to spontaneous bleeding. Probing depth (PD) (distance from the gingival margin (GM) to the bottom of the sulcus) and clinical attachment level (CAL) (distance between CEJ and bottom of the sulcus) were also measured. All measurements were taken at six sites around all teeth excluding the third molars. The presence of BoP[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] was recorded almost 10 s after each PD measurement. GR was evaluated and classified according to Miller classification.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Vertical recession (VR) (distance between CEJ and the gingival margin), horizontal recession (HR) (mesio-distal distance of denuded tooth surface at enamel-cement level) and gingival margin location (GML) (location of gingival as referenced to CEJ) was measured using a Williams Probe (Hu-Friedy Manufacturing, Chicago, IL, USA) and rounded to the nearest 0.5 mm. Volpe-Manhold index (VMI)[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] was used to detect calculus deposits on the lingual surfaces of the six anterior mandibular teeth.

The researchers concluded that advances in toothbrush design can present greater plaque removal outcomes.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] In a recent clinical study, the influence of three manual toothbrushes on dental plaque and gingival inflammation was investigated. The PI and GI scores were statistically significantly lower in subjects using the tapered and cross angled soft bristle design toothbrushes than those using the American Dental Association (ADA) standard toothbrushes after 30 days.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] In an another clinical study, criss-cross bristle design used for 1-min (sub-optimal) was compared for plaque removal efficacy with an ADA manual toothbrush used for 2 min (optimal). Both of the toothbrush was achieved efficient plaque removal and didn't differ significantly.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] Furthermore, criss-cross bristles was found statistically significantly effective in reducing gingivitis.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] However, in a clinical single-blind, cross-over, 24 h plaque re-growth study on 25 subjects, a computer-based planimetric PI was used to evaluate pre- and post-brushing plaque on lingual surfaces of mandibular posterior teeth. Convex, multilevel or flat trimmed brushhead designs were not able to prove significant superiority over the other brushes.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Furthermore, in a comparative plaque removal study, eight branded toothbrushes were used and none of the modifications in brush design actually facilitated plaque removal was concluded.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Sripriya and Shaik Hyder Ali evaluated the efficacy of four most commonly used bristle designs of toothbrushes in plaque removal. The results of the clinical study indicated that all the toothbrushes reduced plaque scores significantly compared to the baseline scores, but there is no single superior design of manual toothbrush was found.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] In a single-blind, cross-over study the performance different toothbrush models for controlling plaque was compared. The three brushes were capable of efficiently removing plaque and the arrangement of the bristles had little effect over the removal of plaque.[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] The findings of our study demonstrated that either bristle designs were almost equally effective in removing dental plaque and preventing gingival inflammation; a slight superiority in favor of criss-cross design for reducing gingival inflammation consistent with the findings of above mentioned studies.</p><p>Gingival recession is described as the exposure of the root surface due to the displacement of the gingival margin apical to the CEJ.[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] The etiology of GR is multifactorial; tooth malpositon, orthodontic tooth movement, high muscle attachment and frenal pull, periodontal inflammation and the resultant loss of attachment. Besides these factors, Gorman has confirmed that traumatic toothbrushing might be a contributing factor for GR many years ago.[<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] In addition, Page and Sturdivant indicated that localized GRs at early age are considered a growing cause both on esthetical and functional base.[<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and may be related traumatic toothbrushing.[<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref><xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] A significant relationship between bristle hardness and the seriousness of GR was reported.[<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] Manual toothbrushes with hard bristles may cause more soft tissue trauma compared to brushes with softer bristles was reported in a recent study.[<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] However, no significant relation was found between toothbrushing factors (hardness of the bristles, strength of toothbrushing and period of brushing) and GR except the frequency of tooth brushing.[<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] In a systematic review concluded that the majority of the cross-sectional studies verified that toothbrushing is related with the development of GR but the knowledge to support or disprove the relation are inadequate.[<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that examined in a longitudinal design the correlation between flat-trim and criss-cross manual soft toothbrushes and GR. There was no advance of GR in subjects using either toothbrush over 6 months. The results of this study have shown that use of toothbrushes with criss-cross bristles are not related with higher occurrence of GR (vertical or horizontal) compared with standard, flat-trim bristles.</p><p>In a single-blind, 8-week study confronted the influence of a sonic toothbrush and manual tooth brush in 40 subjects with periodontitis.
