Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment. However, many anxious youth do not seek treatment. Low-intensity CBT in schools may improve access to evidence-based services. We aim to investigate the efficacy of two CBT youth anxiety programs with different intensities (i.e., number and length of sessions), both group-based and administered as early interventions in a school setting. The objectives of the study are to examine the effects of school-based interventions for youth anxiety and to determine whether a less intensive intervention is non-inferior to a more intensive intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>The present study is a randomized controlled trial comparing two CBT interventions to a waitlist control group. A total of 18 schools participate and we aim to recruit 323 adolescents (12-16 years). Youth who score above a cutoff on an anxiety symptom scale will be included in the study. School nurses recruit participants and deliver the interventions, with mental health workers as co-therapists and/or supervisors. Primary outcomes are level of anxiety symptoms and anxiety-related functional impairments. Secondary outcomes are level of depressive symptoms, quality of life and general psychosocial functioning. Non-inferiority between the two active interventions will be declared if a difference of 1.4 or less is found on the anxiety symptom measure post-intervention and a difference of 0.8 on the interference scale. Effects will be analyzed by mixed effect models, applying an intention to treat procedure.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The present study extends previous research by comparing two programs with different intensity. A brief intervention, if effective, could more easily be subject to large-scale implementation in school health services.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.cov/show/NCT02279251">NCT02279251</ext-link>.

Youth anxiety is associated with a decreased level of functioning in many areas, e.g., poorer academic performance, social dysfunction, sleep problems, school absenteeism and school drop-out [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Youth anxiety furthermore increases the risk for subsequent depression and substance abuse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Thus, early identification and intervention to prevent the onset of youth anxiety disorders is critical to reduce the adverse effects of anxiety on development, social functioning and school performance.</p><p>Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment for anxiety disorders in children and adolescents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. However, the majority of anxious adolescents do not receive treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], and among those who do, long delays from disorder onset to treatment are common [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Children and adolescents often experience considerable barriers accessing mental health services (e.g., lack of knowledge of mental health problems among care givers and health workers, referral procedures, long distances and lack of transportation, stigma, costs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. It is therefore of critical importance to develop, implement and evaluate easily accessible, early interventions for anxious youth.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Low-intensity CBT</title><p>Attempts to increase access to evidence-based interventions have resulted in a shift in treatment delivery, away from face-to-face high intensity treatments by specialist mental health care professionals, toward low-intensity CBT methods (LI-CBT). No common definition of LI-CBT is found. However, Bennett-Levy et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] argue that LI- CBT aims to achieve similar outcomes with <italic>less costly and easier to access interventions</italic> compared to standard CBT. LI-CBT typically includes briefer and/or fewer sessions, may include use of self-help material (e.g., books, internet programs), use of group interventions and treatments delivered by less specialized health care workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. This approach aims to make evidence-based treatments more accessible for larger groups suffering from the most prevalent mental health problems, such as mild to moderate levels of anxiety. Despite the increased availability of LI-CBT interventions, few rigorous studies are available that have evaluated the effectiveness of these with young people.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>School-based interventions</title><p>To achieve broader dissemination of empirically validated treatments, delivering interventions to anxious youth in the school setting is an alternative to traditional treatment approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Adolescents spend much of their time in schools, with many situations during the school day triggering anxiety (e.g., social situations, separation from primary caregivers, being evaluated by teachers and peers). School-based interventions may furthermore reduce key barriers to access help for children and adolescents.</p><p>School nurses engage with youth on a daily basis and are particularly well positioned to intervene with anxious youths. They have intimate knowledge of the school environment and represent a low-threshold health service available for all youth during school hours. However, school nurses, in line with other primary health care workers, need training to accurately identify and manage youth mental health problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Most school nurses have no prior CBT skills and limited knowledge on identifying and treating anxious youth.</p><p>Systematic reviews of studies on early intervention and targeted prevention have demonstrated that CBT is promising when delivered to children and adolescents with elevated levels of anxiety symptoms. Overall, small to moderate effects of these interventions are found [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Early intervention and targeted prevention studies most often recruit individuals with heightened levels of symptoms, but who do not necessarily fulfill the criteria for an anxiety disorder. A meta-analysis from 2011 identified 21 indicated prevention randomized controlled trials (RCTs) targeting symptoms of youth anxiety as a primary or a secondary goal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The included studies varied with regard to program evaluated (primarily CBT), profession of program leaders (e.g., mental health professions, school personnel), length of intervention (usually between 8 to 12 sessions), study quality and control groups (e.g., wait-list control, attention control, no control group). The meta-analysis demonstrated that anxiety prevention programs have a significant and desirable effect for youth anxiety, with an average effect size of 0.32 for targeted prevention programs. Gender of participants was the most robust moderator for long-term effects on anxiety, with smaller effects in samples with a higher percentage of girls. The other moderators were not significant in the multivariate analysis (e.g., age of participants, profession of group leaders).</p><p>Many prevention and early intervention studies include a limited number of participants and do not provide long-term follow-up, limiting the knowledge of the long-term effectiveness of the interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In a systematic review from 2009, focusing exclusively on school-based interventions, 11 studies of targeted prevention and early intervention were identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Only four studies included any control group (wait-list or attention control). Although the number of school-based studies has increased since this review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], we need further studies on the effect and implementation of early intervention of youth anxiety where the methodological limitations in many previous studies are addressed (i.e., insufficient sample sizes, no control groups and limited follow-up data).</p><p>The CHILLED program has previously been found to be an effective treatment for youth anxiety disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], with two RCTs examining the effect of the child version of the program administered as a school-based, early intervention program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. One trial demonstrated a significant reduction in anxiety symptoms relative to a wait-list control group in children from an economically disadvantaged area (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;91, 8-11 years) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The other study (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;152, 7-12 years) failed to find group differences on child- and teacher-reported child anxiety symptoms compared to waitlist, but found a reduction in parent-reported child anxiety symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. No evaluation has been done examining the effect of CHILLED as early intervention in a school setting with anxious adolescents. Targeting adolescents is important, as this is a critical stage of life transition with a heightened risk of subclinical levels of anxiety developing into anxiety disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p><p>Before commencing the present study, a school-based group CBT program for anxious youth (the Friends for Life program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]) was implemented in four schools in Western Norway during 2012-2014 (Fjermestad, Wergeland, Bjaastad, Rogde &#x00026; Haugland:Indicated prevention for anxious youth: A feasibility study in the school health services (in preparation)). The school nurses delivering the program reported that, due to high workload and shortage of time, it was challenging to administer weekly 90-min sessions over a period of 10&#x000a0;weeks. Others have argued that school-based CBT interventions have to be adapted to better fit with the school system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and the need to develop and evaluate school-based CBT interventions for anxious youth that reduce the burden on the school system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. One way of achieving this is by changing the treatment schedule toward briefer and fewer sessions. To our knowledge, no studies have focused on what intensity and amount of therapist face-to-face time that are needed for youth anxiety prevention programs to be effective.</p><p>The present study will add to previous research on school-based early intervention with anxious adolescents by comparing the effect of two CBT interventions of different intensity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Objectives</title><p>The high prevalence and burden of anxiety for young people and the barriers to treatment for these youths make it important to evaluate low-intensity interventions that may be easy to scale up and sustain in non-specialty settings such as schools. The interventions in the present study are considered as LI-CBT because they are easily accessible, group-based and delivered primarily by school nurses. Both interventions focus on key CBT anxiety principles (e.g., psychoeducation, affect regulation, cognitive restructuring and exposure to anxiety-evoking situations). However, the two interventions differ with regard to intensity, i.e., the number and length of sessions. Research investigating the efficacy of LI-CBT for anxious youth is scarce, and it is critical to investigate whether CBT delivered by school nurses can be administered with acceptable fidelity. Moreover, we need to study with whom LI-CBT interventions should be used. In this study we aim to examine the effectiveness of two interventions for youth with anxiety (CHILLED and VAAG<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1">1</xref>) compared to a waitlist control group (WLC) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>: T3, T3WL). Second, we examine whether a brief intervention (VAAG), with reduced hours of direct face-to-face therapist contact, is non-inferior to a longer intervention (CHILLED) with regard to the effect on anxiety symptoms and impairment. Finally, we investigate the long-term effects of the two CBT interventions. The main research assumptions are: (1) school-based CBT is effective for youth anxiety, (2) a brief CBT program is non-inferior to a program of higher intensity and (3) the outcome of both CBT programs will be maintained at 1-year follow-up. Our choice of a non-inferiority trial design is based on the expectation that the brief, less intensive intervention may be sufficient to make changes in adolescents with mild to moderate levels of anxiety. Also in the brief intervention a self-help component has been added that might compensate for an expected loss of effect due to lower face-to-face therapist contact (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Flow chart of the study</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2017_1831_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>

Participants allocated to the two active interventions will start after a group of 5-8 adolescents has been assembled and randomized. Both interventions last for 10&#x000a0;weeks, VAAG comprises five sessions and CHILLED ten sessions. In addition CHILLED has two separate parent sessions. The expected number of hours of face-to-face professional contact is 18&#x000a0;h for the Chilled program and 5.5&#x000a0;h for VAAG. The waitlist group will be randomized in groups of 5-8 adolescents. Those allocated to the waitlist group will be randomized a second time to either VAAG or CHILLED after a delay of 10&#x000a0;weeks. Based on previous research, CBT early intervention for anxious youths is expected to be efficacious [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]; therefore, we consider it unethical to withhold the intervention for adolescents allocated to the waitlist group for an extended period.

Adolescents and parents were invited to take part in a survey focusing on symptoms of anxiety and related youth mental health problems. The survey was completed in the classroom during school time, and participants received feedback about their score on the anxiety symptom measure.

In the present study the cutoff on the anxiety measure is above this mean score, allowing for the inclusion of youths with mild and moderate levels of anxiety.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Exclusion criteria</title><p>
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>The adolescent exhibits behavior that makes participation in groups with other adolescents challenging.

</p><p>The inclusion and exclusion criteria are selected to mirror &#x0201c;real-life practice&#x0201d; as much as possible. Thus, inclusion is not based on formal diagnostic evaluation, and youths participating in other treatments (medication, other psychotherapy) are not excluded [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Recruitment</title><p>Participants will be recruited from 17 public and 1 private junior high school (8th to 10th graders between 12-16 years) located in 9 municipalities in the West, East and South of Norway. We apply several recruitment strategies to ensure a sufficient sample size. The school nurses are in charge of the recruitment as well as the baseline assessments. From a pilot study we found this to be a feasible procedure (&#x0feff;Fjermestad, Wergeland, Bjaastad, Rogde &#x00026; Haugland: Indicated prevention for anxious youth: A feasibi&#x0feff;lity study in the school helath services (in preparation)). Adolescents are recruited from routine meetings with the school nurses (including all 8th graders). School nurses inform teachers about the study and how to recognize anxious adolescents in a school setting. Other primary health-services (e.g., community psychologists, school psychologists, medical doctors) receive information about the study and may nominate adolescents to be assessed for inclusion. Furthermore, information is given to parents and adolescents (e.g., by pamphlets, at school meetings, information boards and local media), making recruitment by self-referral an option. Finally participants are informed and recruited through the school survey mentioned above.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Enrollment and randomization</title><p>Eligible adolescents first meet with the school nurse for information about the study. This is followed by a semi-structured interview developed for this study, conducted with the adolescent and caregiver(s). The interview includes assessments of anxiety symptoms, severity and impairment, what goals the adolescent wants to achieve with regard to anxiety as well as assessment of whether exclusion criteria apply. Next, the adolescent and caregiver(s) complete a battery of questionnaires administered electronically. These may be completed either at the office of the school nurse or at home. Based on their score on the anxiety symptom measure and the interference measure, the adolescent is enrolled in the study. Randomization to condition occurs after having enrolled five to eight adolescents from the specific school, with the group serving as the unit of randomization. As 3 of the 18 schools are too small to recruit groups, youths from these three schools are included in groups at a nearby school, resulting in 15 sites for randomization. The randomization is done according to an outline prepared at the start of the study, using a computer-generated random digit procedure, comprising lists of six possibilities (2 CHILLED&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;2 VAAG&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;2 WLCs) at each school. After the waiting period the WLC group is randomized to CHILLED or VAAG. The randomization will be administered by staff employed at Uni Research Health. To reduce systematic biases between schools and group leaders, all three conditions will take place at each school, with group leaders being trained to deliver both CHILLED and VAAG.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Interventions</title><p>
<italic>VAAG</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] is a manualized CBT program developed for this study, comprising five sessions, each session lasting between 45 and 90&#x000a0;min (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The program lasts for 10&#x000a0;weeks and is administered as a group intervention with two group leaders. The first four meetings occur weekly and are focused on basic CBT principles for treating youth anxiety, e.g., psychoeducation, cognitive restructuring, in-session exposure exercises and behavioral experiments, as well as homework assignments (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> for further description of VAAG). Parents are invited to participate in session two together with the adolescents, where helpful parenting with anxious youths is discussed. Parents receive written material with advice on how to support their adolescent in coping with anxiety. In a period of 5&#x000a0;weeks, between sessions four and five, the adolescents are encouraged to practice exposure tasks on their own, assisted by self-help material and two phone calls or text messages from the group leaders. The self-help material is the Psychological First Aid kit (PF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], which is a central part of the VAAG program. This is a tool used for psychoeducation and communication about basic CBT principles and also used as a self-help tool between sessions. PF comprises an illustrated booklet, small figurines used as therapeutic reminders to externalize &#x0201c;helpful&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;non-helpful&#x0201d; thoughts, and a work sheet (&#x0201c;the helping hand&#x0201d;). A previous feasibility study indicates that primary health workers find PF to be a useful therapeutic tool, particularly when working with youth with anxiety and depressive symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. VAAG ends with a fifth group meeting, reviewing each participant&#x02019;s progress, setting new goals and mutual support.</p><p>
<italic>CHILLED</italic> (adolescent version of the Cool Kids program) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] is a manualized CBT program for the treatment of youth with anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. In the present study, the school version of the program is applied. The CHILLED program addresses cognitive, physiological, emotional and behavioral components that interact in the development and maintenance of anxiety (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The program comprises separate workbooks for adolescents and parents with session summaries, worksheets and guides for home practice. CHILLED is a ten-session program for the management of broad-based childhood anxiety disorders (e.g., social anxiety, separation anxiety and generalized anxiety). Adolescents attend the sessions on a weekly basis, each session lasting 90&#x000a0;min. The sessions are led by two group leaders and cover standard CBT principles for the treatment of youth anxiety. In-session, therapist-led exposures are included to ensure that the exposure exercises are individualized and successful. Exposure training is also included as a homework assignment between sessions. The program includes additional skills training, not directly related to anxiety management (e.g., assertiveness training, problem solving and dealing with bullying). Parents are invited to attend two separate parent information evenings where they are informed about the content of the program and discuss ways to support their anxious child.</p><p>In the present study, the CHILLED program is administered with the same content and structure as in previous school studies, with three exceptions: we apply the adolescent version of the program, and the non-anxiety skills (e.g., assertiveness training) are voluntary for the group leaders to include. If these are not included, they will have more time for in-session exposure tasks and cognitive restructuring. We have also replaced the group meeting in session five with individual sessions (15-20-min individual session&#x000a0;for each participant). This is done to ensure that the exposure plans are targeted to focus on the anxiety problems of each youth. These changes are made in agreement with the authors of the CHILLED program and are in accordance with their on-going revision of the program.</p><p>Time spent by school nurses in preparing, delivering and receiving supervision will be measured. If VAAG is found to be non-inferior to CHILLED with regard to effect, while less face-to face therapist time and time for preparation and supervision are needed, this will be a less resource-consuming intervention for schools to implement.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Assessment</title><p>Adolescents and parents will complete questionnaires administered electronically at pre-treatment (T1), mid-treatment (T2), post- treatment (T3) and 12-month follow-up (T4) (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1 (the SPIRIT table)).

With an assumed attrition of 10%, we need to recruit 323 participants. Even though an average effect size in targeted prevention studies is 0.32 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], we expect a somewhat larger effect size compared to WLC since we have included an intervention that has shown moderate to large effect sizes in previous studies when delivered as treatment or as a targeted preventive school intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Non-inferiority</title><p>The study has two primary outcome measures, each with caregiver and youth self-report versions (SCAS-c/p and CALIS-c/p).

The study extends previous studies on early intervention for anxious youth by comparing two programs with different intensity. The brief intervention may be easier to implement in schools as it requires less time and professional resources, but needs first to be found non-inferior to the more intense intervention. In the present study, psychometrically sound measures are applied with multiple informants in a randomized controlled design. The interventions are studied with conditions that closely match real-world implementation. The use of diagnostic interviews and blind evaluators of treatment gains was, however, not feasible with the resources available and would also not be in accordance with the school health services as they are usually being provided.</p><sec id="Sec26"><title>Trial status</title><p>Recruiting.

Written consent is obtained from caregivers with adolescents assenting. Personal confidentiality is guaranteed. None of the assessments are considered to involve any health risk, and we believe most adolescents will benefit from participation in the interventions. Those who do not benefit will be offered referral to other mental health treatment. The adolescents will not lose their right to get professional help they otherwise would be offered if this project was not conducted. The letter of informed consent emphasizes the participants&#x02019; right to withdraw from the project at any time, without giving any explanation.</p></sec></ack><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Essau</surname><given-names>CA</given-names></name><name><surname>Conradt</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Peterman</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Course and outcome of anxiety disorders in adolescents</article-title><source>J Anxiety Disord</source><year>2002</year><volume>16</volume><fpage>67</fpage><lpage>81</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/S0887-6185(01)00091-3</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">12171214</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CR2"><label>2.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kessler</surname><given-names>RC</given-names></name><name><surname>Berglund</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Demler</surname><given-names>O</given-names></name><name><surname>Jin</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Merikangas</surname><given-names>KR</given-names></name><name><surname>Walters</surname><given-names>EE</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Lifetime prevalence and age-of-onset distributions of DSM-IV disorders in the National Comorbidity Survey Replication</article-title><source>Arch Gen Psychiatry</source><year>2005</year><volume>62</volume><issue>6</issue><fpage>593</fpage><lpage>602</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1001/archpsyc.62.6.593</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15939837</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CR3"><label>3.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bodden</surname><given-names>DH</given-names></name><name><surname>Dirksen</surname><given-names>CD</given-names></name><name><surname>Bogels</surname><given-names>SM</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Societal burden of clinically anxious youth referred for treatment: a cost-of-illness study</article-title><source>J Abnorm Child Psychol</source><year>2008</year><volume>36</volume><issue>4</issue><fpage>487</fpage><lpage>97</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1007/s10802-007-9194-4</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">18214667</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CR4"><label>4.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Costello</surname><given-names>EJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Mustillo</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Erkanli</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Keeler</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Angold</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Prevalence and development of psychiatric disorders in childhood and adolescence</article-title><source>Arch Gen Psychiatry</source><year>2003</year><volume>60</volume><issue>8</issue><fpage>837</fpage><lpage>44</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1001/archpsyc.60.8.837</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">12912767</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CR5"><label>5.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Mykletun A, Overland S, Dahl AA, Krokstad S, Bjerkeset O, Glozier N, Aaro LE, Prince M.
