Study 1 examined differences in baseline heart rate (HR) and HR reactivity in 68 survivors of motor vehicle accidents (MVAs) and healthy controls without MVA. MVA survivors with PTSD (<italic>n</italic>=26), subsyndromal PTSD (<italic>n</italic>=22), traumatized controls without PTSD (non-PTSD with MVA, <italic>n</italic>=20) and healthy controls without MVA (HC, <italic>n</italic>=27) underwent measurement of HR during baseline and exposure to a neutral, positive, negative, and trauma-related picture. PTSD patients showed elevated baseline HR and increased HR reactivity only during exposure to the trauma-related picture. Study 2 investigated whether the elevated physiological responses observed in Study 1 normalized after cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). We conducted a randomized, controlled treatment trial comparing CBT (<italic>n</italic>=17) to a Wait-list condition (WLC, <italic>n</italic>=18). Results showed a greater decrease in HR reactivity for CBT than for WLC.

Heightened psychophysiological responsiveness to cues reminiscent to the trauma has been consistently shown for a variety of PTSD populations like combat veterans (Blanchard, Kolb, Taylor, &#x00026; Wittrock, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">1989</xref>; Orr, Lasko, Shalev, &#x00026; Pitman, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">1995</xref>; Orr et&#x000a0;al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2003</xref>; Orr, Meyerhoff, Edwards, &#x00026; Pitman, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">1998</xref>), victims of childhood sexual abuse (McDonagh-Coyle et&#x000a0;al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2001</xref>; Orr, Lasko et&#x000a0;al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">1998</xref>), and in mixed trauma samples (Shalev, Orr, &#x00026; Pitman, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">1993</xref>). In motor vehicle accident (MVA) survivors, Blanchard and colleagues (Blanchard, Hickling, Buckley et&#x000a0;al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">1996</xref>; Blanchard, Hickling, Taylor, &#x00026; Loos, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">1994</xref>; Veazey, Blanchard, Hickling, &#x00026; Buckley, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2004</xref>) reported elevated psychophysiological responses to audiotaped idiosyncratic accident descriptions in PTSD patients compared to non-PTSD subjects with and without MVA. Especially heart rate (HR) reactivity has been shown to reliably discriminate diagnostic groups of MVA survivors (Blanchard, Hickling, Buckley et&#x000a0;al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">1996</xref>; Blanchard et&#x000a0;al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">1994</xref>; Veazey et&#x000a0;al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2004</xref>) or combat veterans (Blanchard et&#x000a0;al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">1989</xref>; Casada, Amdur, Larsen, &#x00026; Liberzon, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">1998</xref>; Keane et&#x000a0;al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">1998</xref>). Results of a recent multisite study using a large sample of Vietnam veterans showed heightened baseline levels and increased physiological reactivity in response to both standardized audiovisual cues and idiosyncratic script driven imagery in PTSD participants (Keane et&#x000a0;al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">1998</xref>).</p><p>Reports of baseline elevations of psychophysiological activity have been less consistent. In a recent meta-analysis, Buckley and Kaloupek (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2001</xref>) demonstrated an association between PTSD and tonic cardiovascular activity (especially greater resting heart rate). Furthermore, they found that baseline heart rate was highest among the most chronic PTSD samples, which gave support for the assumption that repeated stress (cardiovascular responses) occurring over long periods of time causes cardiovascular dysfunction.</p><p>In study 1, we recorded heart rate activity during baseline and during the presentation of emotional pictures (neutral, positive, negative, trauma-related) in MVA victims with PTSD, subsyndromal PTSD, and without PTSD as well as in non-traumatized healthy controls. Based on previous reports on MVA victims we hypothesized that PTSD patients would show elevated HR reactivity specific to the trauma-related picture. Additionally, we obtained self report measures of affect. This was done for two reasons: first to evaluate the effects of baseline and emotional stimuli independently of HR, and second to assess the association of this subjective measures with HR to increase interpretability of our results. In Study 2 we examined whether altered HR patterns normalize with successful treatment. For this purpose we compared HR activity before and after cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in comparison to a Wait-list condition in a subsample of PTSD and subsyndromal PTSD patients of study 1.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>STUDY 1</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Participants</title><p>Seventy-three MVA survivors were recruited for a treatment study through self-referral local media coverage and advertising. It was required for inclusion that the accident was at least 6 months ago. Exclusion criteria were a history of neurological problems like epilepsy, brain surgery, and brain damage during the accident. Furthermore, we excluded subjects with current alcohol and/or substance abuse or dependence, current or past schizophrenic, bipolar, or psychotic disorder. All participants were required to be off all psychotropic medication for at least 1 month before testing.</p><p>Additionally, 28 healthy controls (HC) were recruited through local media coverage and advertising. They were required to have no history of any severe accident or other trauma and to have an absence of current or past DSM-IV axis I psychopathology.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Diagnostic Procedure</title><p>After a short telephone screening asking for PTSD symptoms, exclusion criteria and details of the accident, participants were scheduled for the diagnostic and the psychophysiological assessments. All participants received a comprehensive description of the study and provided written informed consent at the initial diagnostic assessment. Both MVA subjects and HC were paid 15 Euro for undergoing the assessments. Participants were assessed by advanced doctoral and diploma students in clinical psychology who had previously received extensive training in the diagnostic procedures.</p><p>First, an accident-interview was conducted asking for details and information about severity of the accident and injuries. Second, a German version (Schnyder &#x00026; Moergeli, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2002</xref>) of the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) (Blake et&#x000a0;al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">1995</xref>) was used to assess PTSD status and severity. The CAPS allows both, a categorical diagnosis of either PTSD, subsyndromal PTSD (sub-PTSD) or non-PTSD, and a sum CAPS score indicating PTSD severity. Reliability of PTSD diagnosis was established by rescoring (which was conducted by clinical psychologists blinded to the diagnosis) the CAPS of a subsample (<italic>n</italic>=18) of interviews. This yielded a good diagnostic agreement (kappa of .824, <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;.001). At the end of the session, the Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM-IV (SCID) (First, Spitzer, Gibbon, &#x00026; Williams, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">1996</xref>; German version: Wittchen, Wunderlich, Gruschwitz, &#x00026; Zaudig, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">1997</xref>) was conducted (except the PTSD module), evaluating the presence of concurrent and lifetime DSM-IV Axis I disorders.</p><p>In addition, a battery of self-report measures was sent to the participants that had to be filled in until the diagnostic session. Depression was assessed using a German version (Hautzinger, Bailer, Worall, &#x00026; Keller, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">1994</xref>) of the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) (Beck &#x00026; Steer, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1987</xref>). State and trait anxiety were evaluated using the German version of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) (Laux, Glanzmann, Schaffner, &#x00026; Spielberger, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">1981</xref>). Trait and state positive (PA) and negative (NA) affect were assessed by an extended (24-items) German version (Krohne, Egloff, Kohlmann, &#x00026; Tausch, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">1996</xref>) of the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) (Watson, Clark, &#x00026; Tellegen, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">1988</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Participant Characteristics</title><p>The MVA victims were classified based on the CAPS into three groups: full PTSD, subsyndromal PTSD, and non-PTSD. Patients with full PTSD met symptomatic criteria for PTSD according to DSM-IV (symptom clusters B through D). Diagnosis of subsyndromal PTSD was given when participants met criterion B (Intrusion) and either Criterion C (Avoidance/Numbing) or Criterion D (Hyperarousal) following the most prominent definition of subsyndromal PTSD proposed by Blanchard and colleagues (e.g. Blanchard, Hickling, Taylor et&#x000a0;al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">1996</xref>). Subsyndromal or partial PTSD has been shown to constitute a significant proportion of MVA victims that is clinical meaningful and associated with significant distress (Marshall et&#x000a0;al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2001</xref>; Schuetzwohl &#x00026; Maercker, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">1999</xref>). The non-PTSD group was required to meet either none or one criterion but not criterion F (experience distress because of their PTSD symptoms).</p><p>This classification yielded three groups: PTSD (<italic>n</italic>=26), subsyndromal PTSD (<italic>n</italic>=24), and non-PTSD (<italic>n</italic>=23). The data sets of 2 subjects with subsyndromal PTSD, 3 with non-PTSD, and 1 HC were excluded because of an insufficient amount of artifact free heart rate data. The resulting final sample comprised patients with PTSD (<italic>n</italic>=26), subsyndromal PTSD (<italic>n</italic>=22), non-PTSD controls with MVA (<italic>n</italic>=20), and healthy controls (<italic>n</italic>=27).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1">1</xref></p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Heart Rate Assessment Procedure</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Experimental Conditions.</title><p>The assessment of electrocardiograms (ECG) was conducted usually on the same day as the interview. After arriving at the laboratory, participants were asked to fill in the state version of the STAI. The assessment was conducted in an electrically shielded room with dim light and the participants sitting in a comfortable arm chair. After electrode application, a baseline data were collected. Participants were informed that there would be eight 1&#x000a0;min baselines, four with eyes open four with eyes closed and were asked to try to minimize eye blinks and movements. Two randomly assigned, counterbalanced orders were used for eyes open (O) and eyes closed (C) trials of the baselines (C-O-O-C-O-C-C-O, O-C-C-O-C-O-O-C). Participants heard a tone indicating the beginning and a double tone indicating the end of each 1-min recording. Immediately after the final baseline period the participant&#x02019;s mood was assessed with the PANAS-state questionnaire. The baseline recording procedure is recommended for reliable electroencephalographic (EEG) baseline measurement (Tomarken, Davidson, Wheeler, &#x00026; Kinney, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">1992</xref>), which was also assessed in this study but is reported elsewhere (Rabe, Beauducel, Z&#x000f6;llner, Maercker, &#x00026; Karl, in press).</p><p>After the baseline assessment, 4 phases of mood induction via picture presentation were conducted. The positive (two bunnies), negative (a barking dog), and neutral (spoon) pictures were taken from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) (Lang, &#x000d6;hmann, &#x00026; Vaitl, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">1988</xref>). The MVA-picture was an actual photograph from a crashed car lying on the roof. The sequence of the picture presentation phases was counterbalanced between participants. The picture presentation phases lasted 1&#x000a0;min and were separated by intervals of 2&#x000a0;min. Directly after picture presentations, participants rated their mood using the PANAS-state questionnaire. Following this procedure, an event-related-potential experiment (not reported here) was administered.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Measurement of Heart Rate.</title><p>ECG&#x02019;s were recorded with surface Ag/AgCl electrodes attached to the right clavicle and the seventh rib on the left. The ECG signal was recorded by a Nihon Kohden amplifier (NeuroFileII system), filtered with a time constant (10&#x000a0;s), a high frequency cut-off (300&#x000a0;Hz) and was digitized online at 1024&#x000a0;Hz and stored at 256&#x000a0;Hz. Additionally, we recorded electroencephalographic (EEG) activity. ECG data were edited with a customized computer program developed in our laboratory. Heart rate was extracted by triggering R waves and measuring the time between R waves. ECG data were visually inspected for artifacts. Artifactual HR data points (not correctly triggered R waves) were replaced by manually included trigger points. Data sets with high proportions of artifacts were not evaluated.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Response Definitions.</title><p>The mean values of HR for the 8 one-minute baselines were averaged to yield a single value for baseline HR. For calculation of HR reactivity scores (&#x00394;HR) during picture presentation we first computed mean values of HR for each of the four 1-min pictures. Then, we subtracted the value for the neutral picture from the value for the positive, negative, and trauma-related pictures. This resulted in HR-reactivity values (&#x00394;HR) for the positive, negative, and trauma-related pictures.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>Demographics and Psychometrics</title><p>Demographic and psychometric data were examined using Chi-Square tests and one-way ANOVAs with Group (PTSD, sub-PTSD, non-PTSD, HC) as between-subjects variable followed by Tukey multiple comparison tests. As summarized in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">I</xref>, there were no significant differences between the diagnostic groups in gender, age, and time since the accident. PTSD patients had significantly higher scores in PTSD severity (CAPS Score), depression (BDI), and trait anxiety (STAI) than the other 3 groups. Subsyndromal PTSD patients had higher scores on the same measures than the 2 control groups, who did not differ in BDI and STAI-Trait.

Accordingly, we computed two-tailed Pearson product-moment correlations between baseline heart rate and the time since accident (in months), state anxiety (STAI) measured before the experiment, and PANAS-NA for the baseline. There was a significant association of baseline heart rate with PANAS-NA [<italic>r</italic>(<italic>n</italic>=94)=.26, <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;.05] but not with time since accident and state anxiety (both <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;.40). Thus, the more negative the baseline condition was rated the higher was heart rate during this condition. In an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) we repeated the above analysis on baseline HR using baseline PANAS-NA as covariate. This resulted in a decrease of the group effect on baseline heart rate [<italic>F</italic>(3,89)=1.29, <italic>p</italic>=.28] indicating that negative affect during baseline might mediate the association of PTSD diagnosis and baseline heart rate.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Mood Conditions</title><sec id="Sec17"><title>Negative Affective Responses.</title><p>A two-way repeated measures Group&#x000d7;Condition (neutral, positive, negative, trauma-related) ANOVA was computed for PANAS-NA scores.

For baseline HR we found elevated values in PTSD subjects with an average of approximately 6&#x000a0;bpm faster relative to the other 3 groups. These results are similar to that reported in a recent meta-analysis (Buckley &#x00026; Kaloupek, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2001</xref>), although studies in MVA related PTSD did not find elevated basal HR (Blanchard, Hickling, Buckley et&#x000a0;al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">1996</xref>; Blanchard et&#x000a0;al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">1994</xref>; Veazey et&#x000a0;al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2004</xref>). Furthermore, PTSD patients rated the baseline condition as more aversive (PANAS-NA).

Boudewyns and Hyer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">1990</xref>) compared direct therapeutic exposure (DTE) with conventional counseling in male Vietnam veterans with PTSD using skin conductance level (SCL) and HR to imagery exposure to scenes of stressful combat memories. They did not find significant differences between treatment conditions in reduction of physiological responses. However, for HR there was a trend of diminished HR-reactivity in DTE but not controls. Shalev, Orr, and Pitman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">1992</xref>) investigated SCL, HR, and frontalis electromyographic (EMG) responses during script-driven imagery as an outcome measure in 3 PTSD patients before and after treatment with systematic desensitization. Physiological responses to imagery of traumata normalized with successful treatment. However, the lack of a control group impairs interpretation of the differential impact of treatment on physiological responses. Karl, Malta, Alexander, and Blanchard (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2004</xref>) investigated startle responses in a small sample of MVA survivors with PTSD and subsyndromal PTSD as part of a controlled treatment study comparing (CBT), Supportive Therapy (ST), and a Wait-list condition. At posttreatment, a significant reduction in startle reactivity to different stimuli was observed in participants who received active treatment (either CBT or ST), compared to Wait-list controls.</p><p>Recently, Blanchard et&#x000a0;al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2002</xref>) investigated MVA survivors with PTSD or subsyndromal PTSD, who completed a randomized, controlled trial with three conditions: CBT, supportive Therapy (SP), and Wait-list. They measured HR reactivity to audiotaped idiosyncratic accident descriptions, both before and after each of the treatments. Results showed a greater reduction in HR reactivity for CBT compared to SP or Wait-list. Furthermore, they found a significant correlation between PTSD severity changes and changes in HR reactivity.</p><p>The aim of study 2 was to examine whether heightened reactivity to the trauma-related picture and increased baseline HR observed in study 1 normalizes due to successful treatment. Therefore, we compared HR data in MVA survivors with PTSD and subsyndromal PTSD assessed before and after CBT in comparison to Wait-list controls (WLC), as part of a recently completed randomized, controlled treatment trial (Maercker, Zollner, Menning, Rabe, &#x00026; Karl, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2006</xref>).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn2">2</xref> We expected a greater reduction in HR reactivity to the trauma-related picture for the CBT group than for the WLC.

Sitting in a dark relatively small room may itself be reminiscent of the accident and therefore more aversive for PTSD patients. The results of study 2 showed that baseline HR decreased similarly in CBT and WLC and was not related to clinical improvement. The results let us speculate that heightened baseline HR in PTSD patients with MVA may reflect an acute emotional reaction (but not chronic hyperarousal) which simply habituates with repeated measurement. However, a definitive interpretation of our results is not possible. Increased negative affect and heightened heart rates of the PTSD patients might be present during different situations outside the laboratory and thus chronic. A longtime assessment of HR (e.g. 24&#x000a0;hr) in different natural situations might be useful to answer that question.</p><p>As was shown in study 1, MVA survivors with chronic PTSD and subsyndromal PTSD showed higher HR reactivity specific to a trauma-related picture. This is consistent with findings in MVA-related PTSD (Blanchard, Hickling, Buckley et&#x000a0;al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">1996</xref>; Blanchard et&#x000a0;al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">1994</xref>; Veazey et&#x000a0;al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2004</xref>) and other PTSD subpopulations like combat veterans (e.g., Keane et&#x000a0;al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">1998</xref>) or sexually abused women (e.g., Orr, Lasko et&#x000a0;al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">1998</xref>). HR reactivity was not different between groups for positive or non-trauma-related negative pictures which underlines that group differences in HR reactivity are not attributable to a generalized hyperarousal to a stimulus change, but are specific only to trauma-related cues (e.g., Casada et&#x000a0;al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">1998</xref>).</p><p>The average magnitude of HR reactivity of about 3&#x000a0;bpm was smaller than that reported for ideosyncratic audiotaped MVA descriptions ranging from 4&#x02013;7&#x000a0;bpm (e.g., Blanchard, Hickling, Buckley et&#x000a0;al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">1996</xref>; Veazey et&#x000a0;al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2004</xref>). Furthermore, classification rates based on HR reactivity were lower than those previously reported in MVA-victims, but comparable to rates observed in a large study of combat-related PTSD (Keane et&#x000a0;al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">1998</xref>). Especially, the sensitivity for PTSD diagnosis was reduced with 50% of non-responding PTSD participants in contrast to a good specificity. One reason for this might be that we used standardized pictures instead of idiosyncratic descriptions of the MVAs.</p><p>HR reactivity to the trauma-related picture in the subsyndromal PTSD group was comparable to PTSD patients. This is in contrast to earlier studies with MVA victims (e.g., Blanchard, Hickling, Buckley et&#x000a0;al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">1996</xref>; Veazey et&#x000a0;al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2004</xref>). One explanation for this finding might be that our sample of subsyndromal PTSD participants was more chronic with an average of 38 months post accident in comparison to earlier studies in MVA victims with an average of 1&#x02013;12 months since accident. Initial acute PTSD may remit to subsyndromal PTSD (Blanchard, Hickling, Barton et&#x000a0;al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">1996</xref>) and it might be reasonable to assume that persons who suffer chronically from PTSD symptoms differ from those with more recent onset of symptoms. Future studies should explore the differences between acute and chronic subsyndromal PTSD.</p><p>Study 2 attempted to replicate the findings of Blanchard et&#x000a0;al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2002</xref>) who showed a reduction in HR reactivity for PTSD and subsyndromal PTSD patients receiving a CBT treatment. Similarly, we found a greater decrease in HR reactivity to the trauma-related picture in the CBT group than for WLC controls. Psychological treatment models of PTSD propose that activation of the traumatic fear memories via imaginal exposure is crucial for successful treatment (Foa &#x00026; Rothbaum, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">1998</xref>). However, future studies are needed to investigate which components of CBT (e.g. imaginal exposure, cognitive restructuring, relaxation procedures) may be essential for the reduction of HR responses.</p><p>Comparable to the study of Blanchard et&#x000a0;al. the reduction in HR reactivity accounted only for little variance in CAPS score changes. There are several explanations for this finding. First, as mentioned by Blanchard et&#x000a0;al., clinical status of PTSD is a multi-determined phenomenon and change in &#x0201c;objectively&#x0201d; measured physiological arousal represents only one facet of change. Second, repeated HR measurement using identical stimulus material at pre- and post-assessments may lead to a reduction of HR responses simply due to habituation. Future studies investigating treatment related physiological changes might use different stimuli at pre- and post-assessments. This may increase the reliability of measured HR responses and increase validity of HR measurement as a diagnostic tool reflecting clinical improvement, although in repeated psychophysiological assessments there will be always some habituation to the testing environment.</p><p>In summary, we demonstrated trauma-specific exaggerated HR reactivity in PTSD and subsyndromal PTSD in contrast to MVA controls and non-MVA controls, which normalized with successful treatment.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>This study was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (KA 1476/3).
