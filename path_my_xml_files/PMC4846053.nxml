Lysozyme (270 mg) or placebo was administered orally for 52 weeks as an add-on to the standard therapies such as bronchodilators. COPD exacerbation, pulmonary function, and COPD assessment test scores were analyzed.

Since this disease is pathologically progressive, prevention of exacerbation is important for the treatment of stable-phase COPD. The causes of COPD exacerbation are worsening of airway inflammation and increased sputum production.<xref rid="b1-copd-11-831" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Moreover, the decline over time in airway obstruction is higher in COPD patients with mucus hypersecretion than in those without it.<xref rid="b2-copd-11-831" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Thus, control of sputum production may be assumed to contribute to both resolution of pathological conditions and prevention of exacerbation in patients with COPD.</p><p>Lysozyme is a bacteriolytic enzyme that was discovered by Alexander Fleming, the pioneer of penicillin, and exists widely in nature, including in humans and birds. Lysozyme is an enzyme with lytic action that is found in human secretions such as that produced by the eye, breast milk, and respiratory tract secretions. It is present in high levels in the respiratory epithelium and neutrophil granules and has antibacterial activity against gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens.<xref rid="b3-copd-11-831" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b4-copd-11-831" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Lysozyme has been shown to inhibit chemotaxis of the activated leukocytes. Other anti-inflammatory functions of lysozyme include inhibition of mitogen-induced lymphoblastogenesis and autologous mixed lymphocyte reaction.<xref rid="b5-copd-11-831" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>In Japan, an egg white lysozyme preparation has long been used in routine clinical practice as an oral mucolytic agent for bronchitis with expectoration. Ciliary hypermotility and the promotion of foreign material excretion induced by lysozyme in the airway have been reported in animal models.<xref rid="b6-copd-11-831" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b7-copd-11-831" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> The results of a clinical pharmacological trial suggested that sputum excretion is promoted in patients with chronic respiratory diseases by changing the properties of the sputum.<xref rid="b8-copd-11-831" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Furthermore, a recent double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study on patients with COPD demonstrated significantly greater improvements in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV<sub>1</sub>), impulse-oscillation-system-assessed peripheral pulmonary function, and COPD assessment test (CAT) scores in those receiving a combination of lysozyme with regular treatment than in those receiving regular treatment alone.<xref rid="b9-copd-11-831" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p><p>Carbocysteine and <italic>N</italic>-acetylcysteine, which facilitate expectoration, have been shown to have preventive effects on COPD exacerbation.<xref rid="b10-copd-11-831" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b11-copd-11-831" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Thus, the current study was conducted in patients with COPD receiving bronchodilators and other standard therapeutic agents under actual clinical conditions to investigate whether the add-on treatment with lysozyme, a mucolytic agent, would prevent COPD exacerbation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Study design</title><p>This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted from August 2012 to January 2015 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> number, NCT01645800). The protocol was evaluated in terms of ethics, safety, and scientific validity and approved by the Institutional Review Board at each participating institution.</p><p>During the screening period (day 0&#x02013;28), patients who had provided written consent were assessed by investigators at each medical institution for eligibility for the current study, and baseline characteristics such as time of initial COPD diagnosis, clinical phenotype, the presence or absence of concurrent bronchial asthma, and smoking history were recorded. The investigators were experts with a lot of experience in the diagnosis and treatment of COPD. In daily clinical practice in Japan, a definitive diagnosis of COPD is made using computed tomography (CT) in most cases, in addition to spirometry. The investigators classified COPD as airway-or emphysema-dominant phenotype on the basis of clinical symptoms (eg, cough and sputum) as well as findings on CT images of the patients (if available).</p><p>After the screening period, the patients were randomly assigned to either lysozyme or placebo treatment in a ratio of 1:1. Treatment with the study drugs was administered for 52 weeks after randomization, and lysozyme (90 mg) or placebo was administered orally three times a day, before each meal.</p><p>Any bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids that the patients had been receiving before treatment with the study drugs were considered standard therapy and were maintained until the end of the treatment period, without changing the dosage of prescribed medicines.</p><p>The use of expectorant was prohibited until the end of the treatment period. Moreover, systemic corticosteroids, antibacterial agents, antitussive agents, and cold remedies, as well as bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids that were not included in the standard therapy, were not allowed except in the case of temporary use at the time of COPD exacerbation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Patients</title><p>Patients were enrolled in this trial at 47 Japanese medical institutions. Those meeting the following conditions were eligible: age between &#x02265;20 years and &#x0003c;85 years; smoking history (+); post-bronchodilator ratio of FEV<sub>1</sub> to forced vital capacity (FVC) of &#x0003c;70% and FEV<sub>1</sub> of &#x0003c;80% predicted in the screening period; history of at least one episode of exacerbation within the previous 1 year; and diagnosis of COPD by a physician. Patients were excluded if they met any of the following criteria: history of COPD exacerbation within the 7 days before the start of oral administration of the study drugs; history of lung transplantation, pneumonectomy, or lung volume reduction surgery; egg allergy; domiciliary oxygen therapy; pneumonia or pulmonary tuberculosis; severe cardiovascular disorders; severe kidney disorders; severe hepatic disorders; severe hematological disorders; cancer; and alcohol or drug dependence.</p></sec><sec><title>Endpoints</title><p>The primary endpoint was prevention of COPD exacerbation (as assessed by exacerbation rate and time to first exacerbation). An exacerbation was defined as a worsening of more than one symptom of COPD (cough, sputum volume, purulent sputum, or breathlessness) for &#x0003e;1 day leading to a change in medication. For 52 weeks, patients were asked to record the &#x0201c;presence of symptoms&#x0201d; in a symptom diary only when they felt worsening of their symptoms compared with their everyday symptoms before study enrollment. Any additional drug used for the treatment of COPD exacerbation was also recorded in the symptom diary. At 4-week interval follow-up visits, the investigators determined the presence or absence of COPD exacerbation on the basis of the records in the symptom diaries and the results of interviews with the patients.</p><p>The secondary endpoints were respiratory function assessed by spirometry and health status assessed by CAT.<xref rid="b12-copd-11-831" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> During spirometry, FEV<sub>1</sub>, %FEV<sub>1</sub>, and FVC were measured after inhalation of a bronchodilator at the follow-up visits on weeks 12, 24, 36, and 52. To avoid variations in measurements, the follow-up visits for spirometry measurements were scheduled as close to the same time as each other as possible. At each follow-up visit, the same spirometer was used as far as possible. The spirometers used were calibrated before each measurement. For the CAT, the patients filled in and submitted CAT forms to the investigators at the 4-week interval follow-up visits.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The mean rates of COPD exacerbation in the lysozyme group and the placebo group were assumed to follow Poisson distributions of 0.92 and 1.24, respectively; this was based on the absence of any previous clinical reports on lysozyme and COPD exacerbation, or the expectorant test result. The power of this test was calculated as 80% with a two-sided significance level of 5% and 180 cases in each group. Assuming a dropout rate of ~10%, the final number of cases was set as 200 in each group (400 cases in total).</p><p>The rate of COPD exacerbation was compared between the lysozyme group and the placebo group by Poisson regression analysis, with the COPD exacerbation rate in the past 52 weeks (1, 2, or &#x02265;3) and treatment group as covariates and concurrent bronchial asthma as a factor. Exacerbation rates of 5 or more episodes in 52 weeks were recorded as five episodes occurring in that period.</p><p>For time to first exacerbation, the patients were stratified by the rate of COPD exacerbation in the previous 52 weeks (1, 2, or &#x02265;3) and the presence or absence of concomitant bronchial asthma and then compared between the treatment groups with a stratified log-rank test. Hazard ratios were calculated with stratified Cox regression models.</p><p>For spirometry (FEV<sub>1</sub>, %FEV<sub>1</sub>, and FVC), measurements were taken at each assessment point in each treatment group, and the changes from pretreatment levels (measurement at each assessment point &#x02212; pretreatment level) were calculated. The changes were then compared between the placebo and lysozyme groups with <italic>t</italic>-tests.</p><p>For the CAT, scores for each question item and the total scores for all items were determined at each assessment point in each treatment group, and the changes from pretreatment scores (score at each assessment point &#x02212; pretreatment score) were calculated.

While 66 patients (31 in the lysozyme group and 35 in the placebo group) were withdrawn from the current study before its completion, 340 patients (171 in the lysozyme group and 169 in the placebo group) completed the 52-week treatment.</p><p>The baseline characteristics of the 406 patients are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-copd-11-831">Table 1</xref>.

In this study, we examined whether add-on treatment with 270 mg/d lysozyme to standard therapeutic agents for COPD had preventive effects on COPD exacerbation in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD. However, the primary endpoint was not fully met.</p><p>In recent years, COPD has been recognized as a complex condition composed of various clinical phenotypes, rather than a simple disorder of airflow obstruction, and personalized care has been emphasized.<xref rid="b13-copd-11-831" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> In the current study, common criteria for determining airway-or emphysema-dominant phenotype were not set; instead, the individual investigators diagnosed the patients as having either phenotype of COPD. In the subgroup of patients with airway-dominant phenotype, the results suggested that lysozyme might prevent COPD exacerbation. If the therapeutic effects of lysozyme are investigated in a patient population further subdivided according to disease types of COPD in the future, the preventive effects of lysozyme on COPD exacerbation might well be validated.</p><p>COPD exacerbation was defined in the study of Carbocysteine on acute exacerbation of COPD<xref rid="b10-copd-11-831" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> as the condition when COPD-related symptoms occur on the basis of the definition developed by Anthonisen et al.<xref rid="b14-copd-11-831" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> However, in the current study, COPD exacerbation was defined as the condition when worsening of COPD-related symptoms resulted in changes in medication. Thus, because the latter definition includes only more severe cases of exacerbation, the number of cases of exacerbation based on the definition used in the current study was likely to be smaller than that based on the former definition. The proportion of patients with Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) stage II disease was higher at 62.1% in the current study, as compared with 48.7% in the PEACE study. Despite this, the number of exacerbations per patient per year in the PEACE study was 1.01 in the active drug group and 1.35 in the placebo group, whereas the rate in the current study was 1.8 in the lysozyme group and 1.6 in the placebo group. Thus, the current study is assumed to include more patients with a higher exacerbation risk and more severe exacerbation symptoms as compared with the PEACE study. In such a patient population, the add-on effects of lysozyme might have been underestimated.</p><p>In contrast, spirometry and CAT, which were the secondary endpoints of the current study, may have suggested the presence of add-on effects of lysozyme. Since inflammatory responses of the airway are associated with the pathology of COPD, respiratory function can be assumed to have been improved by alleviation of inflammation by the anti-inflammatory effects of lysozyme, the detailed mechanism of which is not known.<xref rid="b15-copd-11-831" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="b16-copd-11-831" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Moreover, because of decreased ciliary motility of the respiratory mucosa in patients with COPD,<xref rid="b17-copd-11-831" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> FEV<sub>1</sub> is lower in those with increased secretion from the airway because of the presence of inflammatory cells.<xref rid="b18-copd-11-831" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> It is also plausible that improved expectoration alone via the enhancing effects of lysozyme on ciliary transport<xref rid="b3-copd-11-831" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b4-copd-11-831" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> might have contributed to the reduction in decrease in FEV<sub>1</sub>. The annual decrease in FEV<sub>1</sub> in Japanese subjects has been reported to be &#x02212;0.032 L.<xref rid="b19-copd-11-831" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Moreover, a study conducted on carbocysteine in Japan showed that changes in FEV<sub>1</sub> at 6 months after treatment were &#x02212;0.02 L in the carbocysteine group and &#x02212;0.03 L in the placebo group. In comparison to these results, the current study showed that changes in FEV<sub>1</sub> at 24 weeks after beginning the treatment were 0.009 L in the lysozyme group and &#x02212;0.005 L in the placebo group. Thus, lysozyme appears to be comparable to carbocysteine in its preventive effect on the temporal decrease in FEV<sub>1</sub> in patients with COPD.</p><p>In recent years, drug evaluation based on patient-centered outcomes has been emphasized. The American Thoracic Society and the European Respiratory Society also issued a joint recommendation to promote the use of patient-centered outcomes in clinical studies in the field of COPD.<xref rid="b20-copd-11-831" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> The CAT, which is used in Japan and many other countries in the world, is a patient-completed questionnaire for subjective symptoms and quality of life. It is one of the typical methods to evaluate drugs for COPD based on patient-centered outcomes.<xref rid="b21-copd-11-831" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> An improvement of two or more points in the CAT is considered the minimum clinically important difference.<xref rid="b22-copd-11-831" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> The proportion of patients who improved two or more points in this study in the lysozyme group was significantly higher than that in the placebo group only in week 12 of the 52 weeks. However, the number of improvement points was always greater in the lysozyme group than in the placebo group during the 52 weeks. Thus, the addition of lysozyme might be meaningful within the bronchodilator-based treatment scheme for COPD.</p></sec><sec><title>Limitation</title><p>This study had some limitations. It is known that orally administered lysozyme is absorbed in the intestinal tract,<xref rid="b23-copd-11-831" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> but the lysozyme concentration in the lungs and the lysozyme receptor distribution in the lungs have not been clarified. In addition, although the investigators are experts in COPD diagnosis, the classification of COPD as airway- or emphysema-dominant could have been judged differently by each investigator.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, the current study showed that the effect of add-on administration of oral lysozyme to standard therapy was not significantly different to placebo and was insufficient for the prevention of COPD exacerbation. Further studies are needed to investigate whether FEV<sub>1</sub>, CAT, and the add-on effects of lysozyme affect the time to first COPD exacerbation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We would like to express our appreciation to the principal investigators and their staff at the 47 Japanese medical institutions who participated in the current study.
