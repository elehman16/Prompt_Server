They were randomized into two groups: 100 cases were given peroperative calf muscle electrostimulation for DVT prophylaxis (Group A) and the remaining 100 patients were taken as controls without any prophylaxis (Group B).

An approval from the Institutional Review Board was obtained. The present study included 200 consecutive patients who sustained trauma around the hip joint and underwent surgeries under spinal anesthesia.</p><p>Patients &#x0003e;25 years requiring surgeries around the hip joint who underwent surgery within 2 weeks of sustaining trauma, and were operated under spinal anesthesia were enrolled. Established cases of DVT, or patients taking antithrombotic medication, patients who sustained open fractures, and patients on pacemakers were excluded from the study. Patients with other serious life-threatening conditions, pathological fractures, and associated vascular injuries were also excluded from the study. The patients were randomized into two groups of 100 patients each by odd&#x02013;even number, with even numbered patients considered as cases for peroperative calf muscle electrostimulation (Group A) and odd numbered ones considered as controls (Group B). All of them received standard primary care and underwent adequate orthogonal radiographs. The patients were encouraged to perform active and passive physiotherapy as tolerated. Preoperative Doppler ultrasound was done on HDI 4000 (Philips Medical Systems Inc., Boston, MA, USA) for all the patients on both the lower limbs using linear probe (5.38&#x02013;12 MHz) a day prior to the surgery to rule out pre-existing DVT, thereby excluding any patient with clinical or subclinical DVT as a result of trauma. First group of patients received thromboprophylaxis using the VenioPlus&#x02122; (Ad Rem Technology, France) stimulator device for electrostimulation of the calf muscles during surgery was stimulated given to both calf muscles whereas the other group of patients (Group B) did not receive any sort of thromboprophylaxis. The stimulator device delivered the low voltage (peak value being usually around 15&#x02013;25 V) and small energy impulses (below 25 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>C per impulse) to calf muscles. A record was maintained about the involved side, the type of surgery, and the position during surgery for both the groups.</p><p>All the patients were mobilized in bed as tolerated postoperatively, and static and dynamic exercises were started on the next day after the surgery. It was ensured that none of the patients was immobilized in bed for more than 3 days after the surgery. All the patients were examined daily for clinical signs of DVT like diffuse swelling of the leg and foot, calf tenderness (Moses sign) and Homan's sign (pain on passive dorsiflexion of foot). Another Doppler ultrasound was performed on the 7<sup>th</sup> postoperative day on the same machine for all the patients on bilateral lower limbs to look for DVT. The radiologist was blinded about the study and group of the patients. The Doppler assessment included examination of bilateral common femoral, superficial femoral, popliteal, anterior tibial, and posterior tibial veins. They were assessed for flow, visualized thrombus, compressibility, and augmentation. A diagnosis of DVT was made when there was visualization of thrombosis, absence of flow, and lack of compressibility or augmentation. The thrombi were classified to be proximal if they were found in popliteal vein or more proximal locations, and distal if they involved tibial or calf muscle veins. Patients who had both proximal and distal thrombus were classified as having proximal thrombosis. The patients having evidence of DVT on Doppler examination were treated according to the American College of Chest Physicians guidelines.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All the statistical analyses were performed on Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS Inc., version 16.0, Chicago, IL, USA) for Windows. Fisher's exact test was used to examine the significance of association (contingency) between the two kinds of interventions. It was referenced for two-tailed <italic>P</italic> value and 95% confidence interval was constructed around sensitivity proportions using normal approximation method. A value of &#x0003c;0.05 was assumed to attain sufficient statistical significance.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>R<sc>ESULTS</sc></title><p>The mean age of the patients was 54.3 years (19-82 years), whereas it was 55.3 (19-82 years and 53.3 years (22-80 years), respectively, in case and control groups,and the difference was found to be statistically insignificant (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003e;0.05). One hundred and fifty six patients were males and 44 were females. Right lower limb was operated upon in 56% (n-112) of the patients.

Four patients were operated in supine position with traction (two each among Group A and B), while another four were operated in lateral position (all among Group B). Four of them (two each among Group A and B) were operated with dynamic hip screw; two underwent hemi-replacement hip arthroplasty, one closed reduction and internal fixation of neck of femur fracture, and another open reduction and internal fixation of acetabulum. All the patients had distal venous thrombus formation involving only the intermuscular (soleal) veins without any proximal migration, which resolved with anticoagulant therapy given in form of low molecular weight heparin (dalteparin) 5000 U subcutaneously twice a day for 7 days along with oral warfarin 5 mg daily for 6 weeks. Doppler ultrasonography was done at the end of 6 weeks to confirm resolution of the thrombus.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec1-4"><title>D<sc>ISCUSSION</sc></title><p>The incidence of DVT in patients undergoing various surgeries around the hip joint are reported to have wide variation, especially in Indian scenario.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref> The distribution of lower limb DVT in Indian patients is not exactly known and any specific approach to its prevention remains a dilemma.

This further confirms the unreliability of physical signs in the diagnosis of DVT, as shown by Stulberg <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref> All the patients included in our study had surgery performed under spinal anesthesia. It has been suggested that patients undergoing surgery in general anesthesia are 50% more likely to develop DVT than those under spinal anesthesia as vasodilatation that accompanies spinal anesthesia increases the blood flow to lower limbs, thus inhibiting stasis and hypercoagulability.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref> Effect of limb position and manipulation during surgery causing femoral vein occlusion is well studied in total hip replacement.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref> It has been suggested that surgeries in lateral position with hip in flexion, adduction, and internal rotation may lead to femoral vein kinking which may further reduce the venous flow return from the lower limb. However, our study did not show any significant relation between the position during surgery and the occurrence of DVT.</p><p>LMWH is currently recommended as the preferred agent for thromboprophylaxis,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref> but it increases the treatment cost and has risk of bleeding complications and in turn, lead to infection, re-operation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref> To obviate these potential complications, non-pharmacological methods have been considered. Since stasis is considered as a major factor in the development of DVT, efforts have been made to increase the venous blood flow in the deep veins during and after surgical interventions. Mechanical compression devices have been considered to prevent clot formation by increasing the venous blood flow from the legs and causing the release of endothelial-derived relaxing factors and urokinase,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref> though these devices may have poor patient compliance, incompatibility in patients with lower limb injuries, and ineffectiveness in preventing pelvic thrombi.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref></p><p>Doran <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated that out of the three factors involved in causation of DVT &#x02013; venous stasis, hypercoagulability, and endothelial damage (Virchow's triad) &#x02013; peroperative venous stasis appears to be the most important factor in causing DVT postoperatively, and thus calf muscle stimulation during the operation prevented the reduction in venous flow velocity in legs and reduced the risk of postoperative DVT. Also, the biochemical stresses in the form of metabolites produced during the surgery in the operated limb add to the risk of DVT in the limb undergoing the procedure as compared to the opposite nonoperated limb.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref> Lindstrom <italic>et al</italic>. studied the effects of peroperative calf muscle stimulation in patients undergoing major abdominal surgeries with groups of impulses producing a short lasting tetany of calf muscles. It had similar effects on the incidence of postoperative thrombosis as compared with that of Dextran 40.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></p><p>Doran <italic>et al</italic>. also demonstrated that during lower limb surgery, the velocity of venous return reduces to a level that DVT can develop in 50% of patients and it can be effectively counteracted by calf muscle electrostimulation whilst the operation is in progress.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></p><p>We have used hand held VeinoPlus stimulator device which delivers electrical impulses into a vicinity of motor points on the muscle via skin patch electrodes in order to squeeze the blood from deep veins of calf. The electrical impulses are characterized by low energy and low voltage within safe limits. It produces a train of impulses with rectangular voltage waveform when connected to the electrodes. The waveform of current of every impulse is symmetrical and exponential biphasic during the treatment, thus causing powerful and almost symmetrical calf muscle contractions on each side.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></p><p>Considering the small sample size of our study, it may not be very prudent to draw firm conclusions on the usefulness of calf muscle electrostimulation device (VenioPlus) in the prevention of DVT following orthopedic surgeries around the hip joint in patients having no additional risk factors. Multicentric studies with larger sample size may evaluate therapeutic benefits of this device in lower limb surgeries.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>R<sc>EFERENCES</sc></title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Cronan</surname><given-names>JJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Dorfman</surname><given-names>GS</given-names></name><name><surname>Grusmark</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Lower-extremity deep venous thrombosis: further experience with and refinements of US assessment</article-title><source>Radiology</source><year>1988</year><volume>168</volume><fpage>101</fpage><lpage>7</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">2967984</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Stulberg</surname><given-names>BN</given-names></name><name><surname>Insall</surname><given-names>JN</given-names></name><name><surname>Williams</surname><given-names>GW</given-names></name><name><surname>Ghelman</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Deep-vein thrombosis following total knee replacement.
