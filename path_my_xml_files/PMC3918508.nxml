While ethanol is reported to profoundly decrease tremor severity in the majority of patients with ET, preclinical experience suggests that long-chain alcohols such as 1-octanol might lead to a comparable tremor reduction without ethanol&#x02019;s typical side effects of sedation and intoxication. Here, we review the literature on the first clinical trials on 1-octanol and its metabolite octanoic acid (OA) for the treatment of ET.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The literature on preclinical and clinical trials on long-chain alcohols as well as OA was reviewed and summarized, and an outlook given on next phases of development.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>1-octanol was demonstrated to be safe and effective in a double-blind, placebo-controlled low-dose trial, and open-label data showed excellent tolerability and dose-dependent efficacy up to 128&#x02005;mg/kg. Despite 1-octanol&#x02019;s efficacy, its future viability as an effective therapy is limited by its pharmacological properties that require large volumes to be orally administered. Pharmacokinetic data indicate that OA is the active metabolite of 1-octanol. Preclinical efficacy data for OA are positive, and human pilot data demonstrated excellent safety as well as efficacy in secondary outcome measures of tremor amplitudes. OA also has more favorable pharmacological properties for drug delivery; hence, OA may be worth developing as a pharmaceutical.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Essential tremor</kwd><kwd>alcohol</kwd><kwd>ethanol</kwd><kwd>octanol</kwd><kwd>octanoic-acid</kwd><kwd>harmaline-model</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Essential tremor (ET) is a common movement disorder with a prevalence in the general population between 0.4% and 3.9%.<xref rid="b01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> ET is a slowly progressive disease with 73% of patients describing disabilities in multiple functional domains including eating, drinking, writing, and body care.<xref rid="b02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p><p>Since there is currently no curative therapy available for ET, medical agents including propranolol and primidone as well as deep brain stimulation of the ventral intermediate nucleus (VIM) are symptomatic therapeutic options. However, the clinical effects of these first-line drugs are often limited by contraindications and intolerable side effects, particularly in elderly patients,<xref rid="b03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> and many patients are not keen on surgery.</p><sec id="s1a"><title>Ethanol <italic>and essential tremor</italic></title><p>One characteristic observation in ET is that up to 74% of affected subjects report a significant reduction in tremor intensity after the administration of small amounts of ethanol.<xref rid="b04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> It should be noted that this observation is based on subjective data only, while objective data on the ethanol response in ET is scarce. In a study by Knudsen et al.,<xref rid="b07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> a standardized oral ethanol challenge led to an improvement of up to 50% of hand tremor scores in 25 patients, which lasted up to 3&#x02005;h. It was also demonstrated by the same group that after ethanol, ataxia scores and number of missteps during tandem gait improved equally in patients with ET, suggesting a beneficial effect of ethanol in ET patients beyond the actual tremor.<xref rid="b08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> The evidence for a central effect of ethanol stems from neurophysiological studies using weighted accelerometry demonstrating a significant reduction of the central tremor component following standardized oral ethanol administration.<xref rid="b09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Furthermore, the specificity of the effect was demonstrated to be mediated by the central nervous system (CNS), as an effect was seen after systemic intravenous administration, without effect after intra-arterial perfusion in a vascularly isolated limb of patients with ET.<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> The tremor-reducing effect on the central component was demonstrated to be specific for ethanol, as diazepam showed no effect. Furthermore, this finding demonstrated that ethanol acted specifically on a central tremor oscillator at plasma ethanol levels of 0.05&#x02005;g/dL, independent of effects mediated through relaxation or sedation seen with diazepam.<xref rid="b09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p><p>Several hypotheses exist regarding the mechanism of ethanol&#x02019;s effect in ET.</p><p>First, ethanol has been suggested to decrease the neuronal firing rate of the inferior olive (IO) and may therefore lead to a reduction in hypersynchronous bursting activity within Mollaret&#x02019;s triangle connecting the red nucleus, the IO, and the cerebellum, with further propagation along the cerebello-thalamo-cortical loop.<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> There are two possible derangements. First, this mechanism is thought to be mediated through modulation of low-threshold calcium channels in the IO that are responsible for rhythmical cellular firing.</p><p>There can be hyperfunctioning of the low-threshold calcium channel in the inferior olivary cells leading to oscillatory neuronal activity.<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Notably, ethanol in low doses has been reported to increase T-type currents of low-threshold calcium channels; however, at toxic levels data show ethanol is blocking these channels.<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> While the relevance of low-threshold calcium channels has been demonstrated in the harmaline model of ET, the role in humans remains to be elucidated, as in humans lesions affecting the efferent cerebellar pathways (such as strokes) might abolish tremor in ET patients, but no &#x0201c;curative&#x0201d; lesions affecting the IO complex have been reported so far.<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p><p>Contrary to the hypothesis of ethanol as a depressor of neuronal IO firing, a study using different methods of anesthesia by Rogers et al.<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> suggested that the depressing effect might in fact be due to the specific anesthesia used in the original experiment by Harris and Sinclair (urethane),<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> as ethanol under this varying anesthesia condition actually led to an increase in the IO single-unit firing rate.</p><p>Second, the neuronal rhythmic discharges within the IO may be hypersynchronized by electrical coupling mediated through gap junctions.<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> These gap junctions connect and therefore electrically couple dendritic spines in synaptic glomeruli within the IO, which are thought to be central for the IO&#x02019;s oscillatory activity. Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic terminals in the synaptic glomeruli have shown to decrease the extent of electric coupling.<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> By blocking connexin 36, a crucial gap junction protein within the IO, mice still develop harmaline-induced tremor although with decreased tremor coherence.<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> This suggests that the profound tremor-reducing effect of gap junction blockers such as mefloquine in harmaline mice may act via different gap junctions, not containing connexin 36.<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p><p>Furthermore, ethanol&#x02019;s agonism on GABA-receptors has been implicated as a correlate of its tremor-suppressing properties. GABA is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter, with GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors being expressed either synaptically (90%) or extrasynaptically (10%). Synaptic receptors mediate phasic inhibition, whereas tonic inhibition is mediated via extrasynaptic receptors,<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> which are thought be physiologically activated by &#x0201c;overspill&#x0201d; of synaptically released GABA.<xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors form pentamers containing two alpha, two beta, and either one gamma or one delta subunit.<xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> The majority of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors contain a gamma subunit, are expressed synaptically, and are benzodiazepine sensitive. Receptors containing a delta subunit are mainly expressed extrasynaptically and are non-sensitive to benzodiazepines but in contrast show a very high sensitivity to GABA and ethanol, and therefore might play a role in facilitating a GABAergic effect of ethanol.<xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Delta subunits containing receptors form pentamers with alpha1, 4, and 6 subunits. While alpha1delta receptors can only be found in the hippocampus, alpha6delta receptors are exclusively expressed in cerebellar granule cells, and alpha4delta receptors more widespread in the cerebral cortex, thalamus, and the cerebellum.<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> The major role of the extrasynaptically located alpha6delta receptor in determining the response to ethanol has been confirmed in a recombinant study where the R100Q polymorphism of the gene coding for the alpha6 subunit was shown to enhance sensitivity to ethanol.<xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> While alpha1 subunit knockout mice have been suggested to exhibit a phenotype resembling ET including ethanol responsivity, a screen for variants in the gene coding for the alpha1 subunit showed no genetic differences between ET subjects and controls.<xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Genetic alpha6 subunit variants have been associated with different levels of response to ethanol in humans.<xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></p><p>Although disputed by others,<xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> data from a prospective ET brain bank study showed a reduced cerebellar Purkinje cell number in over 75% of patients compared with control brains.<xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> With GABA being the main neurotransmitter of Purkinje cell projections, ET has been suggested to be a &#x0201c;Purkinjopathy&#x0201d;, also characterized by increased prevalence of axonal swellings (&#x0201c;torpedoes&#x0201d;) of Purkinje neurons in ET brains.<xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></p><p>Summarizing the evidence on the ethanol effect in ET, although there are several hypotheses on the potential mechanisms of action, it is important to point out that insights gained from the harmaline model are not certain to reflect the human pathophysiologic mechanism in ET. Specifically, T-type calcium channels and non-connexin 36 gap junctions in CNS regions other than the IO, as well as the GABAergic system, represent relevant targets to be further investigated.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>The relevant literature on preclinical and clinical trials of long-chain alcohols and OA were identified via a Pubmed search.

Three patients (two in the octanol group, one in the placebo group) complained of headaches occurring after the completion of the study. In all three patients, the headache lasted for less than 2&#x02005;h and responded to acetaminophen. No changes in vital signs or liver function tests were detected.

Efficacy was found at all dosages, and a trend toward a dose response was noted. Safety profiles showed no significant adverse events, with some mild side effects. Two subjects had a self-limited headache following drug administration, four subjects noted a taste associated with the drug approximately 1&#x02005;h after ingestion, four subjects described a transient mild asthenia without signs of intoxication, and two subjects had a prolonged feeling of lethargy at 64&#x02005;mg/kg lasting for several hours. Single reports of nausea, dry mouth, calcium oxalate crystals in the urine, and urinary tract infections were present, and in the case of the last two were likely unrelated. No laboratory abnormalities or electrocardiogram (EKG) changes were noted.<xref rid="b40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></p><p>The most recent 1-octanol protocol (clinicaltrials.gov ID: NCT00102596) investigated the pharmacokinetic properties of two different oral formulations of 1-octanol in 15 patients with ET.<xref rid="b41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> The first formulation consisted of 1-octanol adsorbed to microcrystalline cellulose and fine particle silica and encapsulated; the second formulation consisted of a soft-gel capsule containing 1-octanol embedded in soybean oil.<xref rid="b41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></p><p>This protocol was designed as a three-phase unblinded inpatient study of adults with ET receiving weight-adjusted oral dosages of two different formulations of 1-octanol in a crossover fashion. Phase 1 of the study was designed to develop octanol and OA detection assays using high-performance liquid chromatography. Five subjects in phase 1 received daily escalating dosages (1&#x02013;64&#x02005;mg/kg) of a single 1-octanol formulation. In phase 2, 10 subjects received one of the two formulations at 64&#x02005;mg/kg during two inpatient days separated by one washout-day. In phase 3, two patients received a high-dose challenge of both formulations of 1-octanol (128&#x02005;mg/kg).</p><p>Plasma concentrations of both 1-octanol and OA were detectable as early as 5-min post dose. While OA concentrations showed a dose response, 1-octanol remained at very low basal levels until the 64&#x02005;mg/kg dose. The OA plasma half-life was 73.6&#x02005;min. In phase 3 of the study, after the administration of a high dose of 1-octanol (128&#x02005;mg/kg), observed OA plasma levels followed a linear relation compared with lower doses of 1-octanol. These findings suggested that 1-octanol is rapidly converted to OA, which might then act as the active metabolite. Efficacy was measured using objective digital tremor spiral analysis.<xref rid="b42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> Spiral tremor measurements showed a 32% reduction in tremor amplitudes at 90&#x02005;min with significant tremor improvement up to 180&#x02005;min after administration. The safety profile of 1-octanol up to 128&#x02005;mg/kg resembled prior studies with non-serious side effects being mild and self-limiting. The most frequent adverse event was taste change, which was reported by eight subjects (38%), followed by headache, heartburn, and bloating (each five subjects, 24%). Nausea and dry mouth were reported by four subjects (19%), and three subjects reported constipation (14%). Two serious adverse events were not related to the study drug. Again, no signs of intoxication were noted at either dose level.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Octanoic acid</title><p>OA (synonym: caprylic acid) is a fatty acid with an eight-carbon chain, which has been shown to inhibit gap junction permeability in cultured rat astrocytes.<xref rid="b43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> Whether this observation is relevant to explain a potential effect in ET remains uncertain, as it is not known whether OA also blocks neuronal gap junctions. OA occurs naturally in palm and coconut oils, as well as in human and bovine milk, and is part of commercially available nutritional supplements (Caprinol&#x000ae;, Capryl&#x000ae;). After absorption in the intestinal mucosa and entering the portal venous system, the hepatic metabolism of OA involves catabolism via &#x003b2;-oxidation to acetyl coenzyme A (CoA) with subsequent entry into the Krebs cycle.

The primary outcome measure for this study was the effect on tremor power of the dominant hand, 80&#x02005;min after administration of the study substance compared with placebo. Tremor power was measured using accelerometry with loading to test the central tremor component. Secondary outcome measures included recordings of tremor power as measured by accelerometry at multiple other time points up to 300&#x02005;min after administration. The change in tremor severity documented by digital spiral analysis, safety assessment (laboratory testing, documentation of vital signs, adverse events questionnaire, and intoxication scale), and pharmacokinetic sampling acted as a further secondary outcome parameter.</p><p>Efficacy endpoints measured with tremor accelerometry did not meet the primary endpoint (reduced tremor power of the dominant hand 80&#x02005;min after administration, compared with placebo). However, secondary efficacy measures showed a significant benefit over placebo at later time points, starting at 150&#x02005;min. At the last observational time point, 300&#x02005;min, there was still a significant reduction in tremor power compared with baseline.</p><p>Pharmacokinetik analysis of OA showed a <italic>t</italic><sub>max</sub> at 72.8&#x02005;min, a relatively large volume of distribution (389&#x02005;L), and an elimination half-life of 83.5&#x02005;min. The elimination did not entirely follow first-order kinetics, suggesting the presence of a second compartment. The mean C<sub>max</sub> after administration of 4&#x02005;mg/kg was 1,288.4&#x02005;ng/mL, which is close to the C<sub>max</sub> of OA that was measured after the administration of 4&#x02005;mg/kg of 1-octanol.</p><p>Safety analysis showed that the dose was safe and well tolerated. There were no serious adverse events related to OA, with non-serious adverse effects being mild, self-limiting, and equally present after OA and placebo. Two serious adverse events were classified as not related to OA (food poisoning with isolated troponin I elevation after placebo, and bleeding from the insertion site of a peripherally inserted central venous catheter after premature removal of pressure dressing). There were no significant abnormalities noted on vital signs, EKG, or laboratory measures throughout the study.</p></sec><sec id="s3h"><title>Summary and outlook</title><p>With pharmacotherapy in ET often being limited by insufficient efficacy, intolerable side effects, and potential drug interactions, novel treatments for ET are strongly needed. While the ethanol effect in ET is still not fully understood and currently under investigation, it is clear that the majority of patients experience a clinically significant effect of tremor reduction even after low doses of ethanol consumption, often exceeding the effects of pharmacological treatments such as propranolol and primidone.</p><p>With the detailed mechanism of effect of ethanol in ET still to be determined, promising preclinical data led to the further development of long-chain alcohols as potential treatment agents in ET. It is however important to point out that ethanol shows different (lower) affinity to target structures than longer-chain alcohols such as 1-octanol. It is therefore not necessarily the case that ethanol and 1-octanol act via the same mechanism. Also, 1-octanol might act not via one, but multiple mechanisms (i.e., blockage of gap junction, T-type calcium channels, GABA-receptor interaction).</p><p>The fact that the 1-octanol and OA studies so far required participants to exhibit a beneficial response to ethanol therefore stems from a debatable assumption of similar pathways facilitating the effect. It is however also important to point out that the current concept on the proportion of ET patients responding beneficially to ethanol, or not, is likely outdated, as these data stem from purely subjective reports. Objective data from larger-scale populations are still pending, to investigate whether differences in ethanol response can be objectively delineated and whether therefore a concept of two separate ET endophenotypes based on ethanol response can be sustained. However, in the light of the current diagnostic uncertainty and significant disagreement in the field on the &#x0201c;core&#x0201d; ET phenotype, a limitation to objective ethanol responders might be justified for early stage clinical trials to achieve a cohort exhibiting a more homogeneous phenotype.</p><p>With three clinical trials available on efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetic properties of 1-octanol, the main results can be summarized as 1-octanol being safe and well tolerated in doses up to 128&#x02005;mg/kg. The most common adverse event was mild and transient dysgeusia, with patients reporting a distinct taste of orange peel, which was to be expected as 1-octanol as natural flavoring substance is present in orange peel. In terms of efficacy, all studies demonstrated a significant treatment effect of 1-octanol, though it should be noted that only the first, low-dose study was a double-blind, placebo-controlled design. One major finding of the 1-octanol trials was the detection of OA as an active metabolite with a significant plasma response after the administration of 1-octanol. The feasibility of 1-octanol was furthermore questioned, not only because the distinct taste would make sufficient blinding challenging, but also because of the relatively large volumes to be administered orally at doses of 64 and 128&#x02005;mg/kg: even with the formulation using the highest 1-octanol concentration (gel capsule containing 800&#x02005;mg 1-octanol), a patient weighing 78&#x02005;kg who took part in the highest dose group of 128&#x02005;mg/kg had to swallow 12 capsules as a one-time dose.</p><p>OA itself showed an excellent safety and efficacy profile in preclinical testing and during human exposure as a nutritional agent, even at high doses and in vulnerable subjects such as preterm infants. While OA was well tolerated in a pilot study using a low dose (4&#x02005;mg/kg), the primary efficacy outcome was not met, with OA not being different from placebo in reducing tremor 80&#x02005;min after administration. However, the study design included several secondary efficacy outcomes, which showed a significant effect on tremor at later time points. The observation of a peak in plasma levels at 73&#x02005;min being dissociated from a clinical effect manifesting at 150&#x02005;min and later, in conjunction with an elimination profile compatible with a second compartment, suggests that the second compartment is likely the CNS, where the clinical effect is manifesting after distribution of the compound across the blood&#x02013;brain barrier, potentially explaining the lag of a clinical efficacy peak following the plasma peak. While the effect was evident using highly sensitive tremor accelerometry, other methods better reflecting daily-life activities such as digital spiral analysis were not different between OA and placebo. As this was a low-dose study, it was assumed that the effect at 4&#x02005;mg/kg was still small and not yet translating into a clinically relevant benefit. Therefore, a dose escalation study, with the goal of defining a maximum tolerated dose with doses up to 128&#x02005;mg/kg, was initiated (NCT01468948), with the results at the time of this review still pending. Further studies are needed on the effect of OA when administered continuously (e.g., twice daily, three times daily, etc.), on the further characterization of OA&#x02019;s pharmacokinetic profile at higher doses, and the optimization of the drug&#x02019;s formulation.</p><p>To conclude, despite its efficacy and safety, 1-octanol itself does not seem a feasible candidate for further development due to the relatively large volumes to be administered when formulated in capsules for oral administration, as well the finding of OA as the active metabolite. Although OA&#x02019;s mechanism of action in ET is still unknown, the therapeutic potential of OA in ET can be considered as significant, due to promising preclinical and early-stage clinical trial data. However, a clinically relevant effect translating into a reduced burden of tremor in patients&#x02019; daily lives still remains to be demonstrated, and additional phase 2 data on safety and efficacy in a long-term administration setting are necessary, in order to keep OA moving forward towards prime time.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> Clinical trials on 1-octanol and OA were conducted at the NINDS intramural research program through support by the NINDS research program, the Austrian Science Fund (D.H.) as well as a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with Manhattan Pharmaceuticals (B.V.).
