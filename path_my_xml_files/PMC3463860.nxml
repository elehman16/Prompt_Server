Quantitative and qualitative abnormalities in tear fluid cause tear film destabilisation and keratoconjunctival epithelial disorders, including damage to the mucin layer in the keratoconjunctival epithelium.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref> This in turn leads to subjective symptoms, such as eye discomfort, foreign body sensation or visual disturbance, eventually lowering patients&#x02019; quality of life (QOL).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref> When treating dry eye, it is recommended to initially supplement the water component by artificial tear. If that is ineffective, treatment with anti-inflammatory agents or secretagogues becomes necessary because simple supplementation of the aqueous component is inadequate; it is essential to improve the tear fluid quality as a whole. Conventional treatment agents for dry eye include artificial tear, sodium hyaluronate solution, corticosteroids and cyclosporine.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref> Artificial tear is limited to temporary water and electrolyte supplementation. Although sodium hyaluronate has been used in the treatment of keratoconjunctival disorders by corneal epithelial extension in addition to water supplementation,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref> it is considered ineffective against conjunctival disorders caused by mucin layer damage.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref> While corticosteroids improve ocular surface inflammation in dry eye patients, adverse drug reactions with long-term use, including increased intraocular pressure and cataract progression, are anticipated. Topical cyclosporine A treats tear secretion disorders through anti-inflammatory activity, but does not have a direct tear-enhancing effect.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref> At present, no adequate therapeutic options are available to treat the individual factors of this multifactorial disease. In clinic practice, there is a great demand for therapeutic agents with a novel mechanism of action, which can improve the quality and quantity of tear fluid in dry eye patients.</p><p>Diquafosol is a P2Y<sub>2</sub> purinergic receptor agonist. P2Y<sub>2</sub> receptor is present at various sites within the ocular surface, including the palpebral and bulbar conjunctival epithelium, goblet cells and adipocytes and ductal epithelial cells in the meibomian gland.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref> ATP or uridine triphosphate (UTP) reportedly promotes water and mucin secretion from the conjunctiva by activating this P2Y<sub>2</sub> receptor.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref> Diquafosol has P2Y<sub>2</sub> receptor agonist activity, which is equivalent to that of UTP,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref> and is more stable in solution form compared with ATP or UTP. Topical instillation of diquafosol reportedly improves corneal epithelial disorders in rat and rabbit dry eye models; this may be due to the promotion of mucin secretion from the conjunctival tissue. In addition, diquafosol induces tear secretion in normal rabbits.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18 R19 R20">18&#x02013;20</xref> This tear secretion-promoting effect is also confirmed in dry eye patients,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref> in whom diquafosol exerts its effects by activating the P2Y<sub>2</sub> receptor in the conjunctiva and promoting the secretion of tear fluid with aqueous and mucin components, thereby improving the quality and quantity of tear fluid.</p><p>This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 3% diquafosol ophthalmic solution in dry eye patients, and to compare its efficacy with that of 0.1% sodium hyaluronate ophthalmic solution as an active control.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design</title><p>The efficacy and safety of 3% diquafosol ophthalmic solution in dry eye patients were compared with those of 0.1% sodium hyaluronate ophthalmic solution in a multicenter, randomised, double-masked, parallel-group comparison study.

Diquafosol ophthalmic solution is a dry eye therapeutic agent which is suitable for the treatment of dry eye with respect to its pathogenesis.</p><p>Diquafosol is clinically important for dry eye treatment in two ways. First, it improves the rose bengal staining score more effectively than does sodium hyaluronate. Because rose bengal stains the ocular surface areas not fully covered by mucin, mucin disorders of the keratoconjunctival epithelium can be assessed using this method.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref> Mucin retains tear fluid and lubricates the ocular surface by converting the corneal epithelial cell surface to a hydrophilic state. If parts of the corneal surface are not fully covered by mucin, corneal epithelial disorders may worsen as a result of low tear retention or reduced ocular surface lubrication. In a multicenter, double-blind comparative study of sodium hyaluronate ophthalmic solution in dry eye patients, no significant improvement in the keratoconjunctival rose bengal staining score was observed when compared with placebo.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref> In the present study, diquafosol was shown to be superior to sodium hyaluronate in improving rose bengal staining scores.</p><p>Furthermore, diquafosol was shown to improve the corneal fluorescein staining score more effectively than sodium hyaluronate; in addition, the fluorescein clearing rate from the central cornea was significantly greater with diquafosol than with sodium hyaluronate. Fluorescein allows examination of corneal epithelial disorders, which occur as a result of cell shedding and damaged intercellular spaces in the corneal epithelium.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref> In dry eye, the corneal epithelial disorder is caused by drying of the ocular surface because of reduced lacrimal secretion and volume. Increasing the aqueous component of tear fluid secreted from the lacrimal gland and conjunctival epithelial cells is essential for treating corneal epithelial disorders. Because diquafosol has tear secretion-promoting actions, its effect in improving corneal epithelial disorders, as seen in this study, is presumably caused by the promotion of tear secretion. Because epithelial disorders affecting the central cornea have a significant impact on visual function and lead to a reduced QOL, diquafosol is more effective than sodium hyaluronate in improving the QOL of dry eye patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref> Moreover, in this study, the subjective symptom of heaviness was significantly improved following treatment with diquafosol compared with that following treatment with sodium hyaluronate. On the other hand, the subjective symptom of eye discharge was not improved following treatment with diquafosol compared with that following treatment with sodium hyaluronate. This may possibly be related to the mucin secretion of diquafosol. No significant intergroup differences were seen for other subjective symptoms. A long-term study is required to provide further follow-up on QOL improvements, and to elucidate the optimal cure for this condition.</p><p>In the BUT assessment, the diquafosol group showed significant improvement from baseline, and the change was greater than that in the sodium hyaluronate group; however, the difference was not significant. The sample size, which was selected in order to detect any significant inferiority in fluorescein staining score, may have been too small to detect any statistical difference in BUT. Further studies are needed to evaluate the effect of diquafosol ophthalmic solution on BUT.</p><p>Safety evaluations showed that the incidence rates of mild adverse drug reactions, eye discharge and eye irritation were higher in the diquafosol group than in the sodium hyaluronate group. However, owing to their mild nature, these were considered clinically non-problematic and allowed study continuation. Moreover, the symptoms disappeared with continuing administration of the study drug, or with completion/discontinuation of treatment with the study drug. With regard to clinical laboratory test values, no clinically significant changes from baseline were observed in either group before or after the treatment period.</p><p>The results of our study demonstrate that, in the treatment of epithelial disorders in dry eye patients, diquafosol ophthalmic solution causes an equivalent improvement in fluorescein staining score and a superior improvement in rose bengal staining score when compared with sodium hyaluronate. Diquafosol is believed to exert its therapeutic effect in dry eye patients by activating the P2Y<sub>2</sub> receptor in the conjunctiva, thereby improving the quality and quantity, promoting the secretion and increasing the aqueous and mucin content of tear fluid.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The Diquafosol Ophthalmic Solution Phase 3 Study Group: Akihito Kuroda (Horinouchi Eye Clinic, Tokyo), Fukuichi Oura (Miyazaki Chuo Eye Hospital, Miyazaki), Hidehito Kawabata (Kawabata Eye Clinic, Chiba), Hidenao Ideta (Ideta Eye Hospital, Kumamoto), Hidetoshi Yamashita (Yamagata University, Yamagata), Hiroki Shiroma (Ryukyu University, Okinawa), Hiroko Shimizu (Shimizu Eye Clinic, Tokyo), Hironori Aoki (Kumamoto Medical Center, Kumamoto), Hiroshi Mishima (Nara Hospital Kinki University Faculty of Medicine, Nara), Hiroshi Takahashi (Nippon Medical School, Tokyo), Hitoshi Watanabe (Kansai Rosai Hospital, Hyogo), Ikue Takagi (Kyushu Medical Center, Fukuoka), Jun Kozaki (Kozaki Eye Clinic, Osaka), Jun Shimazaki (Tokyo Dental College Ichikawa General Hospital, Chiba), Katsura Kimura (Iwate Medical University, Iwate), Kazunori Miyata (Miyata Eye Hospital, Miyazaki), Kazuo Ichikawa (Social Insurance Chukyo Hospital, Aichi), Kazuo Tsubota (Keio University, Tokyo), Kazutaka Kamiya (Kitasato University Hospital, Kanagawa), Ken Hayashi (Hayashi Eye Hospital, Fukuoka), Kenji Inoue (Inoue Eye Hospital, Tokyo), Kenji Sakagami (Hoshigaoka Koseinenkin Hospital, Osaka), Koji Hirano (Banbuntane Houtokukai Hospital, Aichi), Makoto Omura (Yamagata City Hospital SAISEIKAN, Yamagata), Masahiko Yamaguchi (Ehime University, Ehime), Masakazu Yamada (Tokyo Medical Center, Tokyo), Miho Enoki (Ogori Daiichi General Hospital, Yamaguchi), Miki Sakata (Goken-Cho Kozawa Eye Clinic, Ibaraki), Miki Uchino (Ryogoku Eye Clinic, Tokyo), Misaki Ishioka (Ryogoku Eye Clinic, Tokyo), Naoki Hamada (Omiyahamada Eye Clinic, Saitama), Naoko Kato (Shinagawa East Medical Clinic, Tokyo), Naoyuki Maeda (Osaka University, Osaka), Norihiko Yokoi (Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Kyoto), Sadao Hori (Tokyo Women's Medical University, Tokyo), Shigeki Okamoto (Okamoto Eye Clinic, Ehime), Shiro Amano (Tokyo University, Tokyo), Tairo Kimura (Ueno Eye Clinic, Tokyo), Teruo Nishida (Yamaguchi University, Yamaguchi), Tetsuro Oshika (University of Tsukuba, Ibaraki), Tomoko Goto (Takanoko Hospital, Ehime), Torao Sugiura (Sugiura Eye Clinic, Osaka), Toshio Kodama (Matsuyama Red Cross Hospital, Ehime), Yasuko Nakamura (Kagoshima Miyata Eye Hospital, Kagoshima), Yasutaka Uchihori (Osaka General Medical Center, Osaka), Yoshikazu Shimomura (Kinki University, Osaka), Yoshinori Takahashi (Tachikawadori Clinic, Tokyo), Yoshitsugu Inoue (Tottori University, Tottori), Yoshitsugu Tagawa (Hokkaido University, Hokkaido), Yu Monden (Kurume University, Fukuoka), Sadao Komemushi (Kinki University Faculty of Agriculture, Nara).</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Collaborators:</bold> The Diquafosol Ophthalmic Solution Phase 3 Study Group: Akihito Kuroda, Fukuichi Oura, Hidehito Kawabata, Hidenao Ideta, Hidetoshi Yamashita, Hiroki Shiroma, Hiroko Shimizu, Hironori Aoki, Hiroshi Mishima, Hiroshi Takahashi, Hitoshi Watanabe, Ikue Takagi, Jun Kozaki, Jun Shimazaki Katsura Kimura, Kazunori Miyata, Kazuo Ichikawa, Kazuo Tsubota, Kazutaka Kamiya, Ken Hayashi, Kenji Inoue, Kenji Sakagami, Koji Hirano, Makoto Omura, Masahiko Yamaguchi, Masakazu Yamada, Miho Enoki, Miki Sakata, Miki Uchino, Misaki Ishioka, Naoki Hamada, Naoko Kato, Naoyuki Maeda, Norihiko Yokoi, Sadao Hori, Shigeki Okamoto, Shiro Amano, Tairo Kimura, Teruo Nishida, Tetsuro Oshika, Tomoko Goto, Torao Sugiura, Toshio Kodama, Yasuko Nakamura, Yasutaka Uchihori, Yoshikazu Shimomura, Yoshinori Takahashi, Yoshitsugu Inoue, Yoshitsugu Tagawa, Yu Monden, Sadao Komemushi.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> ET: acquisition of data, drafting the article, final approval of the version published; KT: acquisition of data, revising the article critically for important intellectual content, final approval of the version published; HW: acquisition of data, revising the article critically for important intellectual content, final approval of the version published; YO: conception and design, revising the article critically for important intellectual content, final approval of the version published.
