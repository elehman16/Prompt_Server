Some of them have described this process frightening and stressful, even after using opioids.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Stress can cause difficulties in the process of childbirth. Hernandez-Mart&#x003bd;nez <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] after examining the childbirth of 205 women, discovered that low levels of stress increase the rate of natural childbirth. Ryding <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] believes that bad experience of a previous childbirth is one of the reasons which can increase fear and anxiety.</p><p>Anxiety is one of the reasons known to be the cause of 10&#x02013;15% of depression cases after childbirth.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Hoban and Liamputtong[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] emphasized that a midwife should be alert about the patterns of care and support before and after the childbirth in order to prevent the post-childbirth depression. Anxiety affects women's quality of life and even the future of the baby. Wiktor <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] recommends the post-childbirth evaluation, especially for the case of the primiparous women and the women with more than 20 years of age.</p><p>Episiotomy is one of the most common surgical operations which has side effects such as pain and can bring about anxiety.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Although sedatives and sleep inducing drugs are recommended before sensitive medical operations, they also have side effects. Benzodiazepines are used more than other drugs to treat anxiety; however, they are known to weaken the central neural system.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] In some cases, diazepam needs to be cut short before or during the childbirth. Among its side effects are kernicterus, hypotonia, hypothermia, elimination of the beat to beat variations of the heartbeats of embryo, apnea, and reduction of the blood pressure of mother.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>Promethazine is also used like diazepam.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Therefore, these two medicines are repetitively prescribed in midwifery and labor sections.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Promethazine may cause headache, vertigo, and stress.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>Jantjes <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] have reported the dissatisfaction of primiparous women and delivery agents from sedative drugs that are used for the reduction of pain and anxiety. Drowsiness and failure in following the instructions and cooperation of the mother and the midwife were the main reasons of dissatisfaction of the delivery agents. The women participated in the study even indicated that they would prefer nonmedicinal methods for soothing the pain or anxiety, including methods such distraction or praying. This is because of their awareness that helps them to take their share of the responsibility for the labor.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] On the other hand, we should take the limitation of narcotics into account because they have rather high side effects such as nausea, more sedation, constipation, cognitive disorders, etc.</p><p>Today, the tendencies towards nonmedicinal methods are increased due to the nonevasive nature of such methods and the lack of side effects.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] In the recent decades, virtual reality (VR) is used as a new technology with the aim of reducing pain and anxiety during the painful treatments. In this method, patients experience virtual environments that are similar to reality.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] One of the methods of treating anxiety disorders is to experience virtual environments (VRET).[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] The successful application of VRET can be applied for the treatment of abnormal fears.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] The VR can reduce the abnormal fear from closed spaces (claustrophobia).[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>Reduction of anxiety, although not statistically significant, was reported by van Twillert <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] during the replacement of the dressing of patients suffering from burn. Sullivan <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] also reported a significant reduction of children's heartbeats, after using the VR, which is indicative of their anxiety during dental operations. Frenay <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] reported significant reduction of anxiety during the replacement of the dressings of patients suffering from burn.</p><p>Although episiotomy repair is a rather common surgical operation in labor rooms, and Vakilian[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] has reported that its incidence equals the primiparous childbirth, no study has been found to examine the effects of VR on the anxiety of women during the childbirth.

Allocation of the groups after childbirth into intervention and control groups was done by dropping a coin. The head showed the first person of the intervention group and then samples were distributed into the two groups. After the childbirth, depth and length of perinea incision were measured with graded swab (In centimeter) and five minutes before the start of repair, 5 minutes before beginning repair was infiltrated lidocaine (5 ml from 2% solution lidocaine). Moreover, audio-visual glasses were given to the intervention group and they were asked to put them on during the repair operation. The volume was adjusted according to their will and the entire duration of the video was 42 min.</p><p>Although the list of videos was given to the women of intervention group, in all cases their favorite was the scenes of dolphins with natural scenes and a mild song.</p><p>The level of anxiety (0&#x02013;10 anxiety scale) of the parturient women were asked and recorded by the research assistant before the repair and during the Hyman repair. Then, the research assistant 15 min after the end of the episiotomy repair (for infant care and management of the fourth stage of labor for example breast feeding, helping her needs and drinking sweet juice) explained to each participant how to completed the state-trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) at the same time.</p><p>Instruments used in this Study were:</p><p>

These findings are consistent with the findings of Patterson <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and Hoffman <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</p><p>Morris <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and Gershon <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] also reported a reduction in the anxiety scores (without significant statistical difference) during the application of VR. It is worth mentioning that different criteria were used in these studies for the measurement of anxiety. Morris used the anxiety scores of Burn Specific Pain Anxiety Scale. This criterion is used for appreciation of burn anxiety during the physiotherapy of patients suffering from burn. It is while Gershon has used the scores of Emotional Distress Scale, which is used to measure the level of anxiety in the children suffering from cancer during their treatments and intravenous injections.</p><p>In this study, scale of the Spielberger State was used to determine the level of anxiety in the first hour after the delivery and the numerical score (0&#x02013;100) was used to determine the level of anxiety before and during the episiotomy repair. In addition to the differences in instruments that can justify the differences among the results, in Gershon's study, research units were of a larger age range (7&#x02013;19). As researchers noted, young children endured more anxiety, whereas some teenagers maintained that connection of the needle to the cutter for chemotherapy does not provoke anxiety for them. Therefore, judgment is rather hard due to the lack of homogeneity in the age range. Another important point in Gershon's study is the significant difference between the number of heartbeats of the control group and the intervention group (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). Therefore, Gershon <italic>et al</italic>. admitted that although no significant difference was noted between the two groups, the number of heartbeats can be indicative of anxiety.</p><p>In Morris's study, sample size was limited (11 samples) and had a wide age range between 23 and 54 with the average of 33 years. In the present study, the difference of the age of primiparous women was less and they were almost in the teenage range. Age is an important factor in the detection of anxiety. Obviously, watching videos has affected their level of anxiety.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</p><p>This study had its own limitations too. For instance, it could not be designed as a single blind study. In addition, controlling the personal differences and the previous experience of the research units were not possible. According to the psychiatrist, STAI could not be used in all the phases (before and during the labor). This was because of the pregnant women who were not in a condition to fill out the questionnaire during the reception, start of the labor, and during the episiotomy repair. Therefore, it is suggested that in the future studies more homogeneity is obtained among the research units, especially at the childbirth, and with one criterion that can be used for the evaluation of anxiety of women during the episiotomy repair.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>In this paper, we state the importance of using VR on reducing anxiety in therapeutic procedure such as episiotomy with similar conditions.
