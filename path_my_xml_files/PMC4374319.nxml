Miller[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] published his &#x0201c;focal infection theory&#x0201d; in 1981 suggesting that &#x0201c;mainly microorganisms or their waste products enter other parts of the body from the mouth.&#x0201d; Several studies[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and systematic review[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] have suggested that chronic periodontal infection serves as a pool for micro-organism, endotoxins, and inflammatory mediators such as interleukin-1&#x003b2; (IL-1&#x003b2;), IL-6, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-&#x003b1;), C-reactive protein (CRP), etc., providing the hematogenic translocation of these products to the feto-placental unit resulting into adverse pregnancy outcomes. CRPs are acute phase reactant produced by liver in response to diverse inflammatory response. CRP level is the markers for systemic inflammation and is also associated with chronic bacterial infection like periodontitis.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Evidence also shows that treating periodontal diseases seems to reduce serum CRP levels. Raised CRP level has also been associated with adverse pregnancy outcome such as preterm birth (PTB),[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] low birth weight (LBW), preeclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Controlling the PD could prevent this hematogenous spread of bacteria, inflammatory cytokines and mediators to feto-placental unit, thus minimizing the chances of adverse pregnancy outcomes.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>Considering, periodontal infection as one of the risk factor in preterm LBW (PTLBW), this study was performed to determine the effect of periodontal treatment on reduction of the incidence of PTB and LBW infants and associated raised serum CRP level in pregnant females affected with periodontitis.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-2"><title>Aims and Objectives</title><p>

The strongest form of evidence is randomized controlled clinical trial. A randomized, controlled clinical trial is the best method to establish a cause-and-effect relationship between exposure and disease. The present study was designed to determine whether nonsurgical periodontal therapy can reduce raised serum CRP level and decrease the risk for PTB and LBW infants in women affected by periodontitis.</p><p>Subjects in this study were relatively similar based on the social and demographic factors. The distributions of other known risk factors for PLBW were similar in the treatment and control groups. Women aged age &#x0003c;18 years or &#x0003e;35 years is a risk factor for PLBW. Multiple gestations are also closely associated with preterm labor.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Hence, subjects with only singleton gestation within age range of 18&#x02013;35 years were included in the study.</p><p>The study population was drawn from a rural set up based community belonging to the similar socioeconomic status mostly classes III, IV and V; most of the subjects had a similar education level and similar oral hygiene practices and awareness. Among rural Indian women, prevalence of smoking is low. However, the use of tobacco as pan chewing or for tooth cleansing (Mishri) is very common.

CRP could mediate association of the periodontitis with adverse pregnancy outcomes.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Studies have shown that nonsurgical periodontal therapy decreases the incidence of PTB and LBW delivery,[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and also levels of inflammatory mediators such as CRP[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and other pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1&#x003b2;,[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] IL-6.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Hence, nonsurgical mechanical debridement was provided to the subjects in the treatment group which included plaque control instructions, scaling and root planning.</p><p>Outcome measures considered in the study were gestational age and weight of an infant at delivery. The birth outcome which occurred after 37 completed weeks of gestation or, birth of an infant with a weight &#x02265; 2500 g was defined as normal. Estimation of gestational age was based on the last menstrual period, ultrasound examination, sequential physical examinations, and postnatal examination. All examinations were done under the supervision of a gynecologist.</p><p>Considering, exposure of major risk factor were similar in both the group, decrease in the incidence of preterm and LBW infants in the treatment group could be attributed to periodontal intervention. The results are in agreement with findings of Tarannum and Faizuddin[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] that states significant reduction in the incidence of PTB and LBW in 67.03% and 35.16% in women who received periodontal therapy respectively in contrast to incidence of 83.15% and 58.43% in the control group, respectively.</p><p>C-reactive protein is an acute phase reactant produced in response to inflammatory stimuli, trauma, heat, infection, and hypoxia. CRP has been associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. Furthermore, PD has also been associated with increased risk of preterm delivery and LBW infants.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Therefore, CRP might be one of the plausible mediators of the association between periodontitis and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Raised CRP levels could multiply inflammatory response through activation of complement system, release of inflammatory cytokines and resulting into premature rupture feto-placental membrane. Therefore, may mediate the relationship between periodontitis and adverse pregnancy outcomes.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</p><p>Periodontal therapy at least in the form of mechanical debridement can be helpful to reduce bacterial load and associated bacteremia. Thus, reducing the systemic effect of raised inflammatory mediators. Very few studies have shown the effect of periodontal therapy on CRP level and adverse pregnancy outcome in women suffering from periodontitis. Sharma <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] showed statistically significant reduction in CRP level and PTB after periodontal therapy. However, experimental and control group were not matched for other exposure or risk factor.</p><p>In the present study, all attempts are made to match treatment and control group for other risk factors such as age, socioeconomic status, parity, single gestation, prenatal care, adequate hemoglobin, evidence of other infection and severity of periodontal disease. Nonsurgical supportive periodontal therapy by mean of thorough mechanical debridement and root planning carried out in the second trimester of pregnancy showed a significant reduction in serum CRP level compared with control the group. Reduction of CRP and other inflammatory mediator may be a possible reason for reducing incidence of PTB and LBW infants in the treatment group.</p><p>The potential mechanisms that are put forward to explain the relationship between PD and PTB and LBW infant delivery is that a periodontal infection serves as a chronic reservoir of lipopolysaccharide, which are responsible for the production of IL-1&#x003b2;, PGE2 and TNF-&#x003b1; and CRP that are in turn associated with PTB and fetotoxicity.</p><sec id="sec2-7"><title>Limitation of study</title><p>

</p><p>From the results of this study, it seems likely that PD can influence the adverse pregnancy outcome by modulating levels of inflammatory mediators. Nonsurgical supportive periodontal therapy reduces the microbial load and inflammatory response, and thereby reduces the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. The potential relationship between PD and adverse birth outcomes, if proven to be causative, could be significant for increasing oral health awareness among pregnant women in the community.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors would like to thank Dr. Prashant Kharde, Department of Gynecology for active support and express gratitude to Dr. Ishwardas, Dr. H.
