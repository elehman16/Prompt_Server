Until 2002, postmenopausal women were typically prescribed hormone therapy (HT) if they were considered to be at risk of developing osteoporosis. Although research from the Women&#x02019;s Health Initiative Trial confirmed that HT reduces postmenopausal bone loss and hip fracture risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], the results, along with findings from several other large-scale studies, have also raised safety concerns about the use of HT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. These concerns have led to a dramatic decline in HT use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and the need to identify non-hormonal anti-osteoporotic agents.</p><p>One widely studied non-pharmaceutical alternative for promoting postmenopausal bone health is isoflavones; among commonly consumed foods, they are found in physiologically relevant amounts only in the soybean and soyfoods. Isoflavones are present in soybeans almost exclusively as glycosides, and the three aglycone isoflavones genistein, daidzein and glycitein and their respective glycosides account for approximately 50, 40 and 10% of total isoflavone content, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Mean isoflavone intake in western countries is typically &#x0003c;3&#x000a0;mg/days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], whereas in Japan, daily intake of approximately 30&#x02013;50&#x000a0;mg can be achieved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>In general, isoflavones are considered to be phytoestrogens, because some members were shown to bind to transactivate estrogen receptors and to initiate gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Initial speculation about their efficacy was based on their estrogen-like properties and early research showing that the chemically synthesized isoflavone structurally derivatized drug, ipriflavone, exerted skeletal benefits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The results of prospective epidemiologic studies conducted in Shanghai [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and Singapore [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] seem to support the efficacy of isoflavones, as high soy intake in these studies was associated with approximately 30% reductions in fracture risk. However, the &#x0003e;25 clinical trials that have examined the effects of isoflavones on bone mineral density (BMD) have produced mixed results, although two out of three recently published meta-analyses found that soy isoflavones reduced bone loss at the lumbar spine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. However, only four studies, the 3-year Italian trial by Marini et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], the 2- and 3-year US studies by Levis et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and Alekel et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], respectively, and the 2-year Taiwanese study by Tai et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] were more than 1&#x000a0;year in duration. In the study by Marini et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], there were dramatic increases in postmenopausal spinal and hip BMD after genistein supplementation, whereas in the other three studies, there was little evidence that soy isoflavones produced skeletal benefits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>To substantially reduce the risk of a chronic disease such as osteoporosis, through lifestyle and dietary intervention, requires the adoption of a comprehensive approach. Evidence suggests that a combination of potentially bone-protective dietary agents working through different mechanisms is more likely to result in a substantial benefit than any single agent alone. For example, dietary protein is viewed as beneficial for bone when sufficient dietary calcium is consumed, but possibly harmful when it is not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Also, vitamin D enhances the absorption of calcium and may have independent skeletal benefits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. There is also evidence that vitamin K is needed for &#x003b3;-carboxylation of specific glutamic acids which converts 3 glutamic acid (Glu) residues in osteocalcin (OC) to &#x003b3;-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], an essential structural modification for the integration of osteocalcin into the bone matrix. Finally, supplementation with long-chain omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) may reduce bone loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In mice, isoflavones and fish oil additively induced parameters of bone structure and increased bone mass synergistically in an ovariectomy-induced bone loss model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>It is reasonable to speculate that when a combination of agents is used, the amount of isoflavones required for efficacy may be reduced. Therefore, we decided to conduct a pilot study using geniVida&#x02122; to determine whether a physiological dose of genistein (30&#x000a0;mg/days), when combined with other bioactives, will favorably impact bone health in postmenopausal women. This dose of genistein is in line with the mean intake of genistein among older Japanese following a traditional diet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. This pilot intervention study was conducted to generate data on the impact of a genistein bone blend (GBB) on bone loss in early postmenopausal women. Should efficacy be demonstrated, the data could be used as a basis for designing a larger and longer follow-up study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Subjects and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design and trial supplementation</title><p>In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 6-month pilot intervention study, the effect of a combination of genistein (30&#x000a0;mg/days), vitamin D3 (800&#x000a0;IU/days), vitamin K1 (150&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/days) and polyunsaturated fatty acids 1&#x000a0;g (PUFAs) as ethyl ester: EPA/DHA ratio&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;~2/1) on bone health in postmenopausal women was investigated. The protocol, informed consent form and advertisement for subjects were approved by the Creighton University institutional Review Board (IRB) (no. 06&#x02013;14202). The study was conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice Guidelines from the International Conference of Harmonization and was registered at ClinicalTrial.gov (NCT 00698984).</p><p>Genistein, vitamin K1 and D3 and PUFAs were manufactured by DSM Nutritional Products, Ltd.

The randomization list was provided to Intergel Division, IVC Industries Inc., for packaging and placement of capsules into bottles and bottle labeling. Bottles with randomization code numbers, which were shipped to Creighton University, were dispensed to study subjects in sequenced numbers. Unblinding occurred after all data management procedures were completed. Only emergency envelopes were located at the study site. The randomization code was kept locked at the safety management company (United BioSource Corporation (UBC), Geneva, Switzerland). Subject identification was written on the appropriate bottles and entered into the subject enrollment log along with the randomization code.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Compliance</title><p>Study personnel dispensed supplements together with a personal diary in which the subjects documented the date and time of supplement use. Compliance was assessed on the basis of pill count. Subjects were considered compliant if 80% of the required number of pills was taken.

Candidates who successfully completed the telephone screening interview were scheduled for the pre-study examination. In the pre-study examination, which took place 1&#x02013;2&#x000a0;months prior to study start, subject eligibility was again determined. Subjects signed an informed consent form prior to the pre-study examination being performed.</p><p>After successful completion of the pre-study examination, volunteers were enrolled into the study, starting with a 2-week run-in period during which time they received the placebo. During the run-in period, the volunteers familiarized themselves with the study procedures and the dietary guidelines to which they were expected to adhere. If the subjects successfully completed the run-in, they were asked to sign a second informed consent for study participation as well as to allow disclosure of personal data. They were then randomly enrolled into either the placebo or GBB group and provided the appropriate capsules.</p><p>Each subject had 5 visits (pre-study examination, start of run-in, visits 1, 2 and 3) and received 6 phone calls (screening and months 1, 2, 4 5 and follow-up) over a period of 7&#x02013;9&#x000a0;months. They were instructed to maintain their normal diet and exercise routine. Telephone calls between visits allowed compliance to study protocol to be assessed. Fifteen days after the final visit, subjects were contacted by phone to identify any changes in health status since the final visit.</p><p>At visits 1, 2 and 3, bone markers (see below), plasma genistein, 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25(OH)D) and phylloquinone concentrations, dietary records and physical activity levels were assessed, and diet counseling was conducted.

year during which subjects were enrolled, which could reflect differences in sun exposure and therefore endogenous vitamin D synthesis, had no effect on the change in BMD at any bone site. Stepwise regression analysis revealed that baseline BMD was the strongest predictor of BMD after 6-month supplementation; baseline 25(OH)D did not further predict BMD. The second most predictive factor determining BMD was GBB independent of the season when subjects were enrolled. This observation suggests that supplementation was sufficient to counterbalance seasonal variations in vitamin D concentrations. In addition, there was a significant relationship between plasma 25(OH)D and PTH at screening/baseline and visit 3 (pooled data: Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b). There were no statistically significant correlations at any of the three time points between any blood analytes and BMD or bone markers.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Anthropometry and dietary intake</title><p>There were no significant changes in body weight, BMI and body fat mass in either group when comparing baseline with final values.

Of the total of 59 AEs that occurred in 35 subjects, 37 were reported in 20 subjects in the placebo group and 22 in 15 subjects in the GBB group. One AE in each of three individuals led to their withdrawal from the study, and 51% of AEs led to treatment. None of the AEs were classified as severe, 66.1% were considered mild and 33.9% as moderate. All of the AEs except one were considered to be unrelated to the trial supplement (98%). One moderately severe AE (abdominal pain) was judged as probably related to the GBB supplement. After withdrawal from the trial during the second month, this symptom resolved. Approximately 80% of the AEs resolved at study completion.</p><p>AEs were distributed over a wide range of system organ classes (SOC); however, most of the AEs fell into the SOC of &#x0201c;Infections and infestations&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Reproductive system and breast disorders.&#x0201d; The most frequently reported AE was vaginal hemorrhage (vaginal bleeding and spotting); 5 AEs of this type occurred in 4 subjects in the placebo group compared to one each in 2 subjects in the GBB group.</p><p><italic>Serious Adverse Event (SAE)</italic>: There were three cases of incidental findings on the final vaginal ultrasounds, two in one subject in the placebo group and one in the intervention group. These SAEs were documented as Unanticipated Events and unrelated to the effects of the GBB by the investigator who reported to the IRB.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec24" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The results of this pilot study show that GBB can reduce bone loss in early postmenopausal women. In the placebo group, women lost 1.2 and 1.1% BMD at the femoral neck and Ward&#x02019;s triangle, respectively, whereas women in the GBB group gained 0.1 and 2.3% at these sites, respectively. The bone maker results were unexpectedly inconsistent. We observed increases in both BAP and Ntx at both the 3- and 6-month time points in the GBB group, whereas no changes were noted in the placebo group. This was remarkable since another bone formation marker (OC) and one bone resorption marker (DPD) remained unchanged. In general, the bone turnover marker BAP is decreased during bone-sparing osteoporosis therapies, for example, bisphosphonates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], hormone therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] or selective estrogen receptor modulars (SERMs). Interestingly, only the more sophisticated therapy, using intermittent application of a recombinant human PTH (1&#x02013;34) that can reverse bone loss, is also accompanied by increased BAP levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. We speculate that the increased bone turnover is linked to genistein initiating bone formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], which was evident after just 3&#x000a0;months. Bone formation is coupled to a parallel bone resorption response, which is observed by the increased Ntx level after 6&#x000a0;months. Therefore, it is unclear why the bone formation marker OC and the resorption marker DPD apparently remained unchanged in the treatment group. An increase in OC and a reduction in DPD were observed in the genistein supplementation study of Morabito et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] using a daily 54&#x000a0;mg dose. Interestingly, when using 200&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/days vitamin K1 alone for 6&#x000a0;weeks, B&#x000fc;gel et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] did not observe any effect on bone turnover markers (total osteocalcin, BAP, Ntx and DPD). Nevertheless, the vitamin K status markers were improved after supplementation. The serum ucOC/cOC ratio was significantly decreased. Interestingly, Schurgers et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] could improve the serum carboxylated/undercarboxylated osteocalcin ratio with even a lower dose of 100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g vitamin K1. Our study included healthy subjects that were taking a balanced diet on the top of the GBB supplementation. Obviously, the 150&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g vitamin K1 had no measurable impact on their K status. As expected, plasma levels of genistein, EPA and DHA and 25(OH)D increased in the active group. That there were significant effects at the femoral neck and Ward&#x02019;s Triangle is especially notable because the sample size for this study was calculated to detect a trend, not necessarily statistically significant effects. Therefore, the results indicate that a follow-up study requires a sample size of only 70 subjects to confirm the effects of the GBB at these two bone sites. However, the results generated from this pilot study also indicate that to detect a statistically significant effect (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05) at the lumbar spine would require a sample size of 900 subjects.</p><p>The findings of the present pilot study are consistent with the majority of the published positive isoflavone supplementation trials that also struggled with the limitations of small sample size (&#x0003c;50 subjects/group) and short duration (&#x02264;1&#x000a0;years) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Intriguingly, the four large isoflavone studies that lasted longer than 2&#x000a0;years resulted in ambiguous outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In the study by Marini et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], there were dramatic increases in postmenopausal spinal and hip BMD in response to 54&#x000a0;mg/days genistein in aglycone format. On the other hand, Levis et al. and Alekel et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] that used mixtures of isoflavones in glycoside format observed only modest or no effect at all. Both groups used high doses of isoflavones, 80 and 120, and 200&#x000a0;mg/days, respectively. The contrasting results trigger speculations that the different application formats, aglycone vs glycoside, could be responsible for the results due to different bioavailability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. However, most recent research now casts doubts on this hypothesis. Tai et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] administered 300&#x000a0;mg isoflavones in aglycone format and yet did not observe skeletal benefits. An alternative explanation is that genistein by itself functions differently than genistein in combination with daidzein and glycitein. Currently, there is little evidence to support this theory, however. Another possibility could be that 80&#x000a0;mg and higher doses of genistein are not beneficial; consequently, the bone-sparing effect of genistein is negated. The in vitro data of Dang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] point in this direction. They have shown that isoflavones stimulate osteogenesis at low concentrations and inhibit osteogenesis at high concentrations in osteoblasts and osteoprogenitor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], which could explain the observed discrepancy.</p><p>Although the current results are consistent with some previous trials showing genistein exerts skeletal benefits, there are important differences. For example, during the first year of the 3-year trial by Marini et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], women in the genistein group gained 2.4% BMD at the femoral neck, whereas women in the placebo group lost approximately this much bone. There were also marked increases in spinal BMD in response to genistein. The more pronounced effect observed in that trial could be because the subjects were osteopenic and as such had much lower baseline BMD (e.g., femoral neck BMD, 0.0667 vs 0.740) than women in the current trial). However, if the women in the placebo group in the current trial continued to lose BMD at their 6-month rate over the course of 1&#x000a0;year, their bone loss would have essentially matched the loss in the Italian study. Therefore, differences in baseline BMD may not have contributed to differences between the two studies. An alternative and more straightforward explanation is that the lower dose used in the current study (30 vs 54&#x000a0;mg/days) accounts for the less robust results. Animal data suggest this could be the case [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Differences in dose may also explain why the current study did not show effects at the spine whereas the study by Marini et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] did. We believe that a longer duration trial is required to see significant effect of the GBB on spinal BMD.</p><p>It is notable that GBB supplementation had a greater effect on Ward&#x02019;s triangle than it did on the femoral neck. Bone loss at Ward&#x02019;s triangle in the placebo group was similar to that of the femoral neck, whereas there was a 2.3% increase in the GBB group. Ward&#x02019;s triangle was not measured in the study by Marini et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. However, in an earlier study from this group, the effect of genistein on Ward&#x02019;s triangle was slightly greater than it was on the femoral neck. Ward&#x02019;s triangle is not a true anatomic area but is generated by the DXA scan as the area having the lowest BMD in the femoral head. Interestingly, a small study by Yoshihashi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] found that in men, the only DXA BMD measurement that was sensitive for detecting osteoporosis was Ward&#x02019;s triangle. Among the women in the current study, the DXA BMD at Ward&#x02019;s triangle and the femoral neck were equally sensitive in detecting changes in BMD.</p><p>Because a combination of ingredients was used, it is not possible to determine to what extent the individual components contained in the GBB contributed to the observed skeletal benefits. Combined calcium and vitamin D supplementation has been shown to reduce fracture risk in postmenopausal women to a greater extent than supplementation with either agent alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. In the current study, the baseline plasma 25(OH)D concentrations were in the normal range. As expected, only GBB supplementation further increased the 25(OH)D level. Each group was supplemented with calcium (500&#x000a0;mg), which when added to their dietary intake brought their total calcium intake to &#x0003e;1,200&#x000a0;mg/days. Interestingly, despite the rather small study sample size, it was still possible to detect an inverse relationship between plasma vitamin D and PTH levels (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b), which is consistent with previously published data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>].</p><p>In 2006, Cockayne et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>] reviewed the fracture risk reduction after vitamin K supplementation in a meta-analysis. They showed that phylloquinone and menaquinone-4 reduced bone loss and fracture risk. A more recent review by Iwamoto et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] also concluded that vitamin K supplementation reduces fracture risk. However, most trials included in this analysis used far higher doses than the amount contained within the GBB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Furthermore, according to these authors, vitamin K works via mechanisms other than by increasing BMD and affecting bone turnover. Thus, even if the inclusion of vitamin K enhanced the ability of the GBB to reduce fracture, the benefits may have not been detected in the health outcomes analyzed. The fact that there was no change in the undercarboxylated/carboxylated osteocalcin ratio also argues against vitamin K contributing to the increases in BMD that were observed.</p><p>Finally, in regard to omega-3 fatty acids, the evidence that they exert skeletal benefits is intriguing but still quite speculative [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Nevertheless, in ovariectomized rats, Krammer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>] found that genistein (15&#x000a0;mg/kg bw) and n-3 PUFA (5% by weight) independently increased femoral BMD over an 8-week period and the combined effect was greater than the effect of either agent alone. Our study has taken advantage of this finding and used nutritional levels of PUFA and genistein in combination with vitamin D and K in the GBB supplementation mixture. The results suggest that genistein supplementation at levels that are compatible with Asian isoflavone intake exerts favorable effects on bone health although long-term trials are needed to confirm efficacy.</p><p>The GBB was well tolerated by the subjects as there were few AE and no SAE attributable to the intervention. Plasma levels of E2 did increase although modestly so and they remained within the normal range, which is generally consistent with the literature showing that isoflavones have little effect on estrogen levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Furthermore, and more importantly, there were no effects of the GBB on endometrial thickness. In fact, endometrial thickness decreased over time in the GBB group although the difference in final values between groups was not significant. Estrogen markedly stimulates endometrial tissue and increases risk of endometrial cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. In the previously mentioned 3-y trial by Marini et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], genistein (54&#x000a0;mg/d) had no effect on endometrial thickness in postmenopausal women.</p><p>In conclusion, the results of this pilot study suggest that the use of the physiological relevant dose of genistein in combination with EPA and DHA and vitamins D3 and K1 (GBB) may help to prevent osteoporosis and may reduce fracture risk, at least at the hip, in postmenopausal women. The results are also reassuring about the safety of this product. However, additional research and especially longer-term clinical trials are needed before definitive conclusions can be made.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We want to thank each participant who volunteered for this study.
