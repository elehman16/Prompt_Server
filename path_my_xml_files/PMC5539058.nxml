The objective of this analysis was to determine whether onabotulinumtoxinA has an impact on headache-day severity in patients with CM among those patients who were deemed non-responders based on reduction in the frequency of headache days alone.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Data from the Phase 3 REsearch Evaluating Migraine Prophylaxis Therapy (PREEMPT) clinical trial program (a 24-week, 2-treatment cycle, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group phase, followed by a 32-week, 3-treatment cycle, open-label phase) were pooled for analysis. Patients kept a daily diary to record headache severity on a 4-point scale (from none to severe), and a 6-domain Headache Impact Test (HIT-6) was used to determine the clinical impact of headaches. Analysis was undertaken to assess whether the subset of patients that were headache-day frequency non-responders at week 24 (patients with &#x0003c;50% reduction in headache-day frequency) experienced a reduction in headache severity whilst receiving onabotulinumtoxinA.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">For headache-day frequency non-responders, significant reductions in the number of severe headache days, average daily headache severity, pooled percentage of severe headache days and headache severity score were observed at week 24 for patients who had received onabotulinumtoxinA compared with those who had received placebo. The between-group differences were reduced and non-significant at week 56. Similarly, headache-day frequency non-responders receiving onabotulinumtoxinA were found to have an improvement in the clinical impact of headaches using results from the HIT-6.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">These results suggest that even those patients with CM who are deemed non-responders based on analysis of headache frequency alone experience clinically meaningful relief from headache intensity following treatment with onabotulinumtoxinA.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s10194-017-0784-4) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Chronic migraine</kwd><kwd>OnabotulinumtoxinA</kwd><kwd>Headache severity</kwd><kwd>Hit-6</kwd><kwd>PREEMPT</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007819</institution-id><institution>Allergan</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par14">Chronic migraine (CM; &#x02265;15 headache days per month for &#x02265;3 consecutive months and with &#x02265;8&#x000a0;days/month of migraine-type headaches) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] is associated with significant personal, societal, and economic burdens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].

</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Analysis based on HIT-6 scores</title><p id="Par39">Separate analysis was undertaken to assess whether HIT-6 scores demonstrated a positive response to treatment (&#x02265;5-point increase in HIT-6 scores from baseline, as has previously been deemed to be a positive response to treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]) in patients whose headaches reduced in severity (&#x02265;1 grade change in severity).

Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were consistent with the known safety profile of onabotulinumtoxinA. In the double- blind phase of the study, neck pain (6.7%), muscular weakness (5.5%), eyelid ptosis (3.3%), injection-site pain (3.2%), headache (2.9%), myalgia (2.6%), musculoskeletal stiffness (2.3%), and musculoskeletal pain (2.2%) were reported by &#x02265;2% of patients receiving onabotulinumtoxinA. TRAE decreased in the open-label phase of the study with neck pain (4.6%), muscular weakness (3.9%), eyelid ptosis (2.5%), muscle tightness (2.2%) and injection site pain (2.0%) the only TRAEs occurring in &#x02265;2% of patients. Serious TRAEs were rare occurring in 1 patient (0.1%) in both the double-blind and open-label phases of the PREEMPT trials.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par41">In an earlier analysis of the PREEMPT data, it was observed that 49% of patients treated with onabotulinumtoxinA demonstrated a&#x000a0;&#x02265;&#x000a0;50% reduction in headache-day frequency after 1 treatment cycle, and an additional 11% who did not respond after the first treatment cycle responded after treatment cycle 2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In the current analysis, we present data for the effect of onabotulinumtoxinA on headache-day severity among those with CM who did not have a reduction in headache-day frequency after two cycles of treatment (non-responders defined as &#x0003c;50% reduction in headache-day frequency at week 24). During the randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind phase, patients treated with onabotulinumtoxinA demonstrated a greater reduction from baseline in the number of severe headache days per 28-day period than did those receiving placebo. In addition, compared with the placebo group, there were a lower percentage of patients receiving onabotulinumtoxinA with an ADHS score of severe, a lower percentage of severe headache days pooled across all patients within the onabotulinumtoxinA group, and a higher rate of at least 1-grade improvement in headache severity from baseline (severity responders). Among all severity responders, the proportion of HIT-6 responders (&#x02265;5-point improvement from baseline) was greater for the onabotulinumtoxinA group than the placebo group at the end of the double-blind phase.</p><p id="Par42">The headache-day severity endpoints showed a noteworthy peak at week 24 in both onabotulinumtoxinA and placebo treatment groups. The key reason for this non-response peak is the selection criteria, since the population of interest was predefined as those without adequate treatment response in relation to headache-day frequency at week 24. It is interesting that in this group of non-responders, there was some response at other time points both before the arbitrary 24-week non-response point and after that time point.</p><p id="Par43">Open-label results where both groups were receiving onabotulinumtoxinA generally demonstrated lesser between-group differences, with no significant differences between the groups observed by the end of the 56-week study. Conversely, headache-day frequency, as previously reported by Aurora et al., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] was significantly reduced by onabotulinumtoxinA in the double-blind phase and continued to show between-group differences through to week 56, making a case for early treatment with onabotulinumtoxinA in patients with CM. This observation suggests that treatment with onabotulinumtoxinA produces significant reduction in headache-day severity that may compliment a reduction in headache-day frequency, since onabotulinumtoxinA treatment in the open-label phase was able to eliminate between-group differences in severity, but not frequency. These findings are worthy of further investigation to fully understand the potential therapeutic benefit of early treatment with onabotulinumtoxinA.</p><p id="Par44">Importantly, the current analysis demonstrated reduced headache-day severity at the first post-baseline assessment (week 4) in patients who were headache-day frequency non-responders at week 24, suggesting an important clinical response to treatment not captured by the measure of headache-day frequency reduction. Furthermore, the alignment of the HIT-6 response with the severity response suggests that the reduction in headache-day severity of at least 1 grade was clinically meaningful. Further study is required to determine whether this clinical response translates into a reduction in healthcare resource utilization and broader economic benefits.</p><p id="Par45">The large number of patients with CM included in these double-blind placebo-controlled studies makes these results particularly robust. The use of the voice interactive daily telephone diary encouraged high patient compliance with diary record keeping and captured data without the need for reliance on long-term recall. This would be expected to result in more accurate capture of patient data, as others have shown that current health status can have an impact upon a patient&#x02019;s recollection of the past [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par46">The study is not without its limitations. The lack of an active comparator is a potential limitation. However, the lack of any approved prophylactic treatment for CM makes it difficult to identify an appropriate comparator. The time point to determine headache-day frequency nonresponse was set at week 24, which was an arbitrary time point. The selection of a different time point for the definition of non-response may have resulted in different outcomes. Further clinical trials may be required to understand if a different time point for the determination of headache-day frequency non-response has any clinically meaningful impact on the interpretation of the data presented here.</p><p id="Par47">Similarly, no optimal responder rate for the reduction from baseline in headache-day frequency has been defined for the CM population. Although both 30% and 50% cutoffs for headache measures have been suggested to be clinically meaningful, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] a 50% cutoff is more commonly used in migraine studies, and provided the rationale for the definition of non-responders for the current analysis. Analysis of the current data using a&#x000a0;&#x0003c;30% reduction in headache-day frequency as the definition for non-response produced similar results to those reported here, with those classified as non-responders achieving a significant reduction in headache severity (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1, and Figures S1 and S2). This additional analysis using &#x0003c;30% as the cutoff further strengthens the findings of this analysis.</p><p id="Par48">The International Headache Society has published guidelines for clinical trial assessment of prophylactic treatment for CM, including guidelines on the selection of outcome measures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The primary end-point outcomes recommended by these international experts include headache days with moderate or severe intensity, migraine days, or frequency of migraine episodes. However, despite this international accord on the selection of outcome measures to encourage robust clinical trials, the outcomes may not fully align with the patient&#x02019;s expectation of therapy. This study demonstrates that frequency day response alone may not be sufficient to determine a clinically meaningful response to therapy, and highlights the need for further work on developing key patient-endorsed outcome measures for the assessment of prophylactic treatment of chronic migraine in particular and headache disorders in general.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par49">Patients from the PREEMPT clinical trial program who received onabotulinumtoxinA and met our definition for headache-day frequency non-response (&#x0003c;50% reduction in headache-day frequency at week 24) demonstrated significantly reduced headache-day severity (compared with those receiving placebo). Among those who showed reduced headache-day severity, onabotulinumtoxinA also produced greater reduction in headache impact scores. These results suggest that patients with CM experience clinically meaningful relief from headache intensity following treatment with onabotulinumtoxinA, even among those who may not experience a clinically meaningful reduction in the frequency of their headaches.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec18"><title>Additional file</title><p id="Par54">
