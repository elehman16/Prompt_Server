objectives:</title><p>Improving quality of life (QOL) of healthy people living with HIV (PLHIV) is critical needing home-based, long-term strategy. <italic>Sudarshan Kriya</italic> yoga (SKY) intervention is acknowledged for its positive impact on health. It is hypothesised that SKY would improve PLHIV's QOL, justifying an evaluation.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Methods:</title><p>In this open label randomized controlled pilot trial, 61 adult PLHIV with CD4 count more than 400 cells/&#x000b5;l and Karnofsky scale score above 70 were enrolled. Those with cardiac disease, jaundice, tuberculosis, or on antiretroviral therapy/yoga intervention were excluded. All were given standard care, randomized to SKY intervention (31: I-SKY) and only standard of care in control (30: O-SOC) arms. The I-SKY participants were trained for six days to prepare for daily practice of SKY at home for 30 min. A validated 31-item WHOQOL-HIVBREF questionnaire was used to document effect in both arms from baseline to three visits at 4 wk interval.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>Baseline QOL scores, hypertension and CD4 count were similar in both arms. An overall 6 per cent improvement of QOL scores was observed in I-SKY group as compared to O-SOC group, after controlling for baseline variables like age, gender, education and occupation (<italic>P</italic> =0.016); 12 per cent for physical (<italic>P</italic> =0.004), 11 per cent psychological (<italic>P</italic> =0.023) and 9 per cent level of independence (<italic>P</italic> =0.001) domains. Improvement in I-SKY observed at post-training and in the SKY adherence group showed increase in these two domains.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusions:</title><p>A significant improvement in QOL scores was observed for the three health related QOL domains in SKY intervention arm.

This was an open label study registered with Clinical Trial Registry of India (CTRI/2014/01/004353). The ethical approvals were taken for the protocol and related documents for the study <italic>i.e.</italic> the informed consents in Marathi and English from the institutional ethics committee.</p><p>This study was conducted by the research team of Social and Behavioural Research Division at National AIDS Research Institute (NARI), Pune, Maharashtra, India. The study participants were screened at four NARI clinics and were referred for enrolment in SKY study at the OPD Clinic of NARI, Pune, India. Enrolments took place from December 2010 to August 2011.</p><p><italic>Inclusion criteria:</italic> Healthy PLHIV of 18 yr and above with CD4 count above 400 cell/&#x000b5;l and Karnofsky scale<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> score above 70, <italic>i.e.</italic> the normal healthy PLHIV were included in the study.</p><p><italic>Exclusion criteria:</italic> Those suffering from cardiac problems, jaundice, tuberculosis, patients on ART and/or on any yoga therapy were excluded.</p><p>The study was designed as a pilot study and no research data for India were available on QOL scores in PLHIV performing SKY. A sample size of 30 in each of the two arms was considered appropriate. The participants from I-SKY arm received 24 hour SKY training along with the standard of care <italic>i.e.</italic> the counselling and medical care given as a routine provided at the clinic. The control arm, O-SOC received standard of care of routine counselling and medical care (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Flow chart showing the study design and number of patients enrolled during December 2010-August 2011.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJMR-141-90-g001"/></fig><p>The computer generated randomization sequence was used to allocate participants into 1:1 ratio in both the arms. It was assumed that participants would be distributed approximately equally by gender and age in both intervention and control arms. Of the 61 participants enrolled, 10 dropped out with five participants each in the intervention arm (I-SKY) and the control arm (O-SOC) due to long travel distance during the study period. One participant could not complete the SKY training due to personal social emergency and received only partial training for three of six days of SKY training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>).</p><p>One participant randomized in O-SOC had not disclosed his HIV status at home; all other 60 participants had disclosed their HIV status at home to their spouse and family members.</p><p><italic>Intervention:</italic> The enrolled I-SKY participants underwent six-days training at NARI Campus. It was conducted in four batches during January, March, May and August 2011 covering 6-8 participants randomized to I-SKY arm. The O-SOC participants received the standard of care and medical consultation at NARI. The SKY training was given by two trained teachers of Art Of Living (AOL) Centre, Novel Institute, Pune, at NARI. This was followed by a six-day practice of SKY meditation at NARI to ensure a correct daily practice of SKY at home. Thereafter the I-SKY participants visited NARI on every Saturday evening for 12 wk for SKY practice under the guidance of an AOL teacher. At the follow up meetings there was an opportunity to meet participants of I-SKY from different batches.</p><p>The SKY has four distinct components<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>: (<italic>i</italic>) &#x0201c;<italic>Ujjai</italic>&#x0201d; breathing or &#x0201c;victorious breath&#x0201d; that involved the conscious sensation of the breathing touching the throat, with 2-4 breaths per minute. The subjective experience of this breathing is physical and mental calmness with alertness; (<italic>ii</italic>) <italic>Bhastrika</italic> or &#x0201c;bellows breath&#x0201d;, where air is rapidly inhaled and forcefully exhaled and causes excitation followed by calmness; (<italic>iii</italic>) &#x0201c;<italic>Om</italic>&#x0201d; is chanted with very prolonged expiration; and (<italic>iv</italic>) Sudarshan kriya meaning &#x0201c;proper vision by purifying action&#x0201d;, is an advanced form of rhythmic, cyclical breathing: slow, medium and fast cycles<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>. It is performed in sitting position on floor or if necessary on bed keeping the spine erect.</p><p><italic>Tools and techniques:</italic> Karnofsky scale, a performance scale that rates a person's normal activities, was used by the clinician to evaluate the patient. This was a one-time evaluation at baseline for assessment of physical and mental health for enrolment. Only those with scores above 70 were included in the study.</p><p><italic>Quality of life scales:</italic> The standardized WHOQOL-HIVBREF tool for assessing QOL scores for HIV having 31 items covered in the following six domains was used in this study<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>.</p><p>

This SKY pilot study had a smaller sample size (61) for which validity and reliability test was not done independently.</p><p><italic>Biological parameters:</italic> Blood pressure, height and weight were recorded at the three points at 4-weekly visits at the clinic by trained research nurses of the team; medical records were maintained by the clinicians. At baseline and at the end, 6 ml blood was drawn for CD4 counts estimation.</p><p><italic>Interview:</italic> The WHOQOL-HIVBREF questionnaire was interviewer-administered to maintain uniformity. This was done at baseline and at 4, 8 and 12 wk visits. The I-SKY participants were interviewed soon after training within 2-3 days. The socially desirable responses, as a possibility, was minimized to some extent as the WHOQOL-HIVBREF has questions on varied domains in a mixed order rather than being arranged domain-wise. Also the team attempted to change the interviewers at each visit of the participant.</p><p><italic>Outcome:</italic> This study was aimed at comparing the changes in the quality of life scores in healthy PLHIV between the intervention arm (I-SKY) and control arm (O-SOC). The QOL scale WHOQOL-HIVBREF was administered to all participants of both arms at the start of the study, 2-3 days after the initial 6-day SKY training and after 4, 8 and 12 wk of training for I-SKY participants and to O-SOC participants after 4, 8 and 12 wk of baseline study. The QOL data were analyzed according to scores in the six domains<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>.</p><p><italic>Statistical analysis:</italic> The data were analyzed using intention- to- treat (ITT) analysis.</p><p><italic>Outcome variable:</italic> As per WHOQOL-HIVBREF manual, higher scores reflect better quality of life. Six domain-wise scores and the total QOL scores were calculated as per WHO guidelines<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>. Adjusted QOL scores from baseline were calculated and these were used for analysis.</p><p><italic>Exploratory analysis:</italic> For continuous data, medians and inter-quartile ranges were used if the data were skewed. Means and standard deviations were used if the data were normally distributed and compared using a Mann-Whitney test or unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test as applicable. Paired comparisons of baseline and post-training or week 12 QOL scores and biomarkers were done using a non-parametric Wilcoxon signed- rank test.</p><p>In our study the outcome of quality of life scores for repeated time points were nested within individuals and individuals were nested within arms. Hence, random effect model was used to assess the effect of intervention and socio-demographic confounding variables like age, gender, education and occupation on the six domains of adjusted QOL scores as well as overall scores. Analysis was done in STATA version 10.0 (Stata Corp, Texas, USA).

Significant improvement was observed for overall scores, physical, psychological and level of independence domains.</p><p>In the sub-group analysis of intervention arm, it was observed that a regular practice of SKY might improve quality of life of healthy PLHIV, their level of independence, at both physical and psychological level. This may contribute to improving their self esteem and decision-making ability. Higher self esteem and decision-making ability have been documented to influence health seeking behaviour<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>. This improvement in quality of life, if sustained through counselling intervention and regular practice of SKY, may contribute to better adherence to ART intervention with improved decision making ability. No significant changes were observed for biological markers like CD4, BMI and blood pressure during this 12 wk period, indicating a need for a longer duration of observation.</p><p>The QOL score assessment at post-SKY training in I-SKY participants showed overall improvement. Need for consistent performance of SKY was highlighted in the dose-response analysis in the I-SKY group. Significant improvement was seen in adherent group with 75 per cent or more follow ups than the less than 75 per cent adhering group. However, these results are only suggestive but may not be considered conclusive due to small sample size.</p><p>A pilot study design and a small sample were the major limitations of this study. Further, this observational period of 12 wk was too short to observe changes in biomarkers and also for observing the sustenance of SKY practice and improvement in QOL scores in all domains.</p><p>The stigma attached to HIV/AIDS, loss of physical functioning and loss of friends at a young age are among the most pressing stressors that distinguish HIV/AIDS from other chronic-fatal diseases<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>. Yoga is practiced by general population and it is easily available and accessible. However, estimation of effect of meditation, pranayam and yoga intervention among PLHIV has not been well documented even in Indian set up. On the other hand, many studies done outside India have mentioned the wide usage of yoga with recommendation for its use<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>.</p><p>In a study at Canada using meditative techniques positive changes in wellbeing on mental health index was noted and the effect was primarily seen immediately following the programme and disappeared at later data points<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>. In our study, similar effect was visible and the difference remained significant for those who were adherent to SKY. There is enough evidence to suggest that SKY is a beneficial, low-risk, low-cost adjunct to treatment of stress, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, stress-related medical illnesses<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>.</p><p>The analysis for six QOL domains in the intervention arm and control arm showed marked differences for the QOL scores pertaining to physical, level of independence and the psychological domains but differences were not significant in social, environmental and spiritual domains. Hence, a larger study should be taken up with adequate sample size at different sites to establish the findings of this study in PLHIV for improvement in quality of life through <italic>Sudarshan Kriya</italic> yoga.</p><p>The need for ensuring sustenance of SKY practice through effective monitoring using innovative methods is a pre-requisite. This includes tracking study participants through mobile phone messaging for reminders for its daily practice. Also integrating the follow up visits within the existing network of AOL centres where the study participants may interact on a regular basis may also be explored with robust networking maintaining confidentiality of participants.</p><p>This pilot study has formed a base to pursue more such intervention studies in this non-invasive, low cost, non pharmacological technique for improving quality of life of PLHIV. This may be initiated in our country to contribute in improving quality of life of PLHIVs and attempt to bring them to the main stream.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>Help of AOL teachers Shriyut Vilas Jeurkar, Sunil Agre, Surya Kant Jadhav, Ms Shubhangi Girme and Shri Anna Shetty for initiating this study is acknowledged.
