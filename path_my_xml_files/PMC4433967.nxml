valgus angle, the cross-sectional area of the abductor hallucis muscle, and the hallux
valgus angle during active abduction. [Subjects and Methods] Twenty-four subjects with
hallux valgus were randomly assigned to orthosis and orthosis plus toe-spread-out exercise
groups. The orthosis group wore the orthosis for 8 weeks, while the orthosis plus
toe-spread-out group also performed the toe-spread-out exercise. The hallux valgus angle,
the cross-sectional area of the abductor hallucis muscle, and the hallux valgus angle
during active abduction were measured initially and after 8 weeks by radiography and
ultrasonography. [Results] While there were no significant changes in the three parameters
in the orthosis group, there were significant differences in the orthosis plus
toe-spread-out exercise group after 8 weeks. In addition there were significant
differences in the three measures between the two groups. [Conclusion] The toe-spread-out
exercise reduces the hallux valgus angle and hallux valgus angle during active abduction,
and increases the cross-sectional area of the abductor hallucis muscle. The toe-spread-out
exercise is recommended for patients with mild to moderate hallux valgus.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Hallux valgus</kwd><kwd>Radiography</kwd><kwd>Toe-spread-out exercise</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Hallux valgus (HV) is defined as a progressive abnormality in the degree of lateral
deviation of the big toe at the metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint, which may involve pain at
the medial aspect of the first metatarsal head<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. The HV angle, which corresponds to the angle between the bisection
line of the first metatarsal bone and the first proximal phalanx<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>, is classified as either normal (&#x02264; 15 degrees), mild (&#x0003c;
20 degrees), moderate (20&#x02013;40 degrees), or severe (&#x02265; 40 degrees)<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Generally, available treatments for HV are divided into operative and non-operative
treatments. Although the operative method is effective for mild-to-moderate HV, pain
persists for weeks or even months afterward, and necessitates protracted non-weight-bearing
periods<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Non-operative methods include wearing an orthosis and engaging in
specific exercises. The effectiveness of orthosis is subject to conjecture. Several studies
report there is no benefit of orthosis on big toe angle<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>, but other studies have
suggested that orthoses are effective for HV surgery patients, and can confer short-term
symptomatic relief<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Specific exercises can also be used to treat HV. Several researchers have suggested that
exercise is necessary during the early stages of HV, to prevent further increases in the HV
angle<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. HV patients are characterized by an imbalance in the activities of
the abductor hallucis (AbdH) and adductor hallucis (AddH) muscles<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Several studies
have highlighted the importance of strengthening the AbdH muscle in HV patients<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>,
but few studies have determined which specific exercises should be performed. Recently,
Keller<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup> introduced a novel exercise,
the &#x0201c;Toe-Spread-Out&#x0201d; (TSO) exercise, and a subsequent electromyographic (EMG) study revealed
greater activation of the AbdH muscle during performance of the TSO exercise than during the
short-foot exercise, in mild HV patients<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, evidence of the long-term effectiveness of the TSO
exercise is currently lacking, and although there have been many EMG studies of the AbdH
muscle activity<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>, few have measured the
cross-sectional area (CSA) of the AbdH muscle at pre- and post-intervention. Therefore, we
aimed to determine whether the TSO exercise is effective at decreasing the HV angle, the HV
angle during active abduction, and increasing the CSA of the AbdH muscle, using an 8-week
randomized controlled trial design. We hypothesized that wearing an orthosis, in conjunction
with performing TSO exercises, would decrease the HV angle, and the HV angle during active
abduction, and increase the CSA of the AbdH muscle.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Twenty-four subjects (13 males, 11 females) between 19 and 29&#x02005;years of age, with a
diagnosis of HV, were included. Fifteen subjects were categorized as having a mild HV angle,
and nine as having a moderate HV angle, during standing. The only inclusion criterion was an
HV angle of &#x0003e; 15 degrees. Exclusion criteria included a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis
or osteoarthritis, previous history of foot surgery, previous use of a foot orthosis, and
previously diagnosed central or peripheral nervous system injury. Subjects were randomly
divided into two groups of 12 persons each using the block randomization method. Subjects in
the experimental group were trained in the TSO exercise and required to wear an orthosis.
Control subjects were only required to wear an orthosis. All subjects signed an informed
consent form approved by the YONSEI University Wonju Institutional Review Board for Human
Investigations prior to participation.</p><p>The HV angles of subjects were measured by dorsoplantar radiography (KOB, Donga X-ray,
Anyang, Korea) in a standing position, with normal alignment. An experienced radiologist
measured the HV angle using the Centricity PACS RA1000 software package (ver. 2.1.0; GE
Healthcare Integrated IT Solutions, Barrington, USA). The HV angle was measured as the angle
between the bisection line of the first metatarsal bone and the first proximal phalanx<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>For the measurement of the HV angle during active abduction of the hallux, subjects sat on
a chair situated above the radiographic table, and assumed a 90 degrees flexion angle
between the hip and knee, with the ankle maintained in the neutral position (i.e., 0
degree). Dorsoplantar radiographs were taken at rest, and during maximal abduction of the
big toe. These radiographs were analyzed in the same way as for the HV angle.</p><p>The CSA of the AbdH muscle was measured using ultrasound (SonaAce X8, Medison Co Ltd.,
Seoul, Korea), with subjects relaxed in the long-seated position. The measured foot was
positioned with the ankle in the neutral position and the knee flexed at 15 degrees. The hip
joint was maintained at a comfortable degree of external rotation, for ease of measurement
during the AbdH muscle scan<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
researcher palpated the medial malleolus and used a ruler to draw a line anterior to this
bony landmark, in an inferior direction. The probe was positioned perpendicular to the drawn
line. Three images of the left foot were obtained, and the mean CSA of the AbdH muscle was
calculated. The ultrasound procedure was conducted by an experienced doctoral graduate
student. The CSA of the AbdH muscle was obtained to enable manual measurement of the
muscle<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. The CSA of the AbdH muscle
was measured three times, and the mean value was calculated.</p><p>The 24 subjects were randomly divided into two groups (orthosis and orthosis plus TSO
exercise). The orthosis group was required only to wear the orthosis; and the orthosis plus
TSO exercise group wore the orthosis and also performed the TSO exercise for a period of 8
weeks. Each subject wore an appropriately sized orthosis, made of spandex material, the
Bunion Sleeve (DLI Co. Seoul, Korea). Subjects were required to wear the orthosis for &#x0003e;
8&#x02005;h/day. Subjects in the orthosis plus TSO exercise group were trained to perform the TSO
exercise following the method described by Keller<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. The subjects were instructed to lift all toes while keeping the
metatarsal heads and heel on the floor, and to then push the little toe downward, in a
lateral direction, while pushing the big toe slowly downward in a medial direction. Prior to
the commencement of the experiment, training exercises were performed for 2 days, for a
total of 2 hours. Between the first experimental day and the end of the study, subjects
performed the TSO exercise for 20&#x02005;min/day, 4 days/week. On a single occasion each week, the
orthosis plus TSO exercise group received 30 minutes of instruction from a supervisor
regarding correct performance of the TSO exercise. All subjects were evaluated before and
after the study, with respect to HV angle, CSA of the AbdH muscle, and HV angle during
active abduction.</p><p>Data are expressed as means &#x000b1; standard deviation. The independent t-test was used to assess
the significance of between-group differences in the initial value of the HV angle, the CSA
of the AbdH muscle, and the HV angle during active abduction. The independent t-test was
also used to investigate group differences after the 8-week intervention. The paired t-test
was used to determine the pre- and post-intervention group differences. Statistical analyses
were performed using the SPSS version 21.0 for Windows software package (SPSS, Inc.,
Chicago, IL, USA). A value of p &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical
significance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The general characteristics of subjects, including the HV angle, CSA of the AbdH muscle,

between-group after 8-week intervention in effect sizes, for HV angle, CSA of the AbdH, and
HV angle during active abduction, were 1.09, 1.89, and 1.76, respectively.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>After the 8-week intervention, the HV angle, and the HV angle during active abduction, were
significantly reduced, and the CSA of the AbdH muscle was significantly increased in the
orthosis plus TSO exercise group, but there were no significant differences in the orthosis
group.</p><p>The AbdH muscle originates in the medial process of the calcaneal tuberosity, flexor
retinaculum, plantar aponeurosis, and adjacent intermuscular septum, and connects to the
medial side of the base of the proximal phalanx of the big toe<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. The AbdH muscle also sends lateral fibers to the medial
tendon of the flexor brevis<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>, and is
involved not only in abduction but also in plantar flexion of the first MTP joint<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, exercises targeting the AbdH
muscle should involve diagonal movements combining both abduction and flexion of the big
toe. In a previous study, TSO exercises promoted greater AbdH muscle activity; i.e.,
abduction and flexion of the big toe, compared with the short-foot exercise, thereby
strengthening the AbdH muscle in mild HV subjects<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, we employed the TSO exercise in this study. After
performing the TSO exercise for 8 weeks, the othosis plus TSO exercise group showed a
significant decrease of 3.41 degrees in the average HV angle.</p><p>In the orthosis plus TSO exercise group, the CSA of the AbdH muscle was significantly
increased after 8 weeks of treatment, but no change was observed in the orthosis group.
Therefore, it appears that the TSO exercise was responsible for the increased CSA of the
AbdH muscle, which in turn affects muscular function and force<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. Stewart et al.<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup> assessed the relationship between the CSA of the AbdH muscle and
the severity of HV using musculoskeletal ultrasound, and reported a significantly larger CSA
in non-HV than in HV patients. The CSA of the AbdH muscle is important, because muscle size
is considered an important determinant of muscle strength, and Maughan<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>, demonstrated a positive correlation between muscle
strength and CSA. In our study, TSO exercise increased the CSA of AbdH muscle, and decreased
the HV angle, and the HV angle during active abduction in the orthosis plus TSO exercise
group. Because the TSO exercise involves abduction of the big toe, it may have a positive
impact on the CSA of AbdH and HV angle during active abduction.</p><p>As yet, the effects of orthosis on HV patients are subject to conjecture. This study showed
that there were no statistically significant differences in the three parameters after the
8-week intervention in the orthosis group. These results are similar to the results of
previous studies, which found there was no decrease in the HV angle<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The present study had several limitations. First, the results cannot be generalized because
our subjects were relatively young (mean age = 23&#x02005;years), and had only mild-to-moderate HV.
Additional research examining the effects of TSO exercise on different age groups, and in
severe HV cases, is required. Second, we didn&#x02019;t evaluate the strength of the AbdH muscle
during the 8 weeks. Future studies should assess the strength of AbdH muscle after TSO
exercise lasting for 8 weeks.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><person-group><name><surname>Sarwark</surname><given-names>JF</given-names></name></person-group>: Essentials of Musculoskeletal Care, 4th ed.
