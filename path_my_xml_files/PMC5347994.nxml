The PRIME study evaluated an intervention aiming to improve fever case management using mRDTs at public health centers in Uganda.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><p>A cluster-randomized trial was conducted from 2010&#x02013;13 in Tororo, a high malaria transmission setting. Twenty public health centers were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to intervention or control. The intervention included training in health center management, fever case management with mRDTs, and patient-centered services; plus provision of mRDTs and artemether-lumefantrine (AL) when stocks ran low. Three rounds of Interviews were conducted with caregivers of children under five years of age as they exited health centers (N = 1400); reference mRDTs were done in children with fever (N = 1336). Health worker perspectives on mRDTs were elicited through semi-structured questionnaires (N = 49) and in-depth interviews (N = 10). The primary outcome was inappropriate treatment of malaria, defined as the proportion of febrile children who were not treated according to guidelines based on the reference mRDT.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Findings</title><p>There was no difference in inappropriate treatment of malaria between the intervention and control arms (24.0% versus 29.7%, adjusted risk ratio 0.81 [95% CI: 0.56, 1.17] p = 0.24). Most children (76.0%) tested positive by reference mRDT, but many were not prescribed AL (22.5% intervention versus 25.9% control, p = 0.53). Inappropriate treatment of children testing negative by reference mRDT with AL was also common (31.3% invention vs 42.4% control, p = 0.29). Health workers appreciated mRDTs but felt that integrating testing into practice was challenging given constraints on time and infrastructure.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The PRIME intervention did not have the desired impact on inappropriate treatment of malaria for children under five. In this high transmission setting, use of mRDTs did not lead to the reductions in antimalarial prescribing seen elsewhere. Broader investment in health systems, including infrastructure and staffing, will be required to improve fever case management.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>ACT Consortium through a grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to LSHTM</institution></funding-source><award-id>ITGBVG01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Staedke</surname><given-names>Sarah G.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the ACT Consortium (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.actconsortium.org/">http://www.actconsortium.org/</ext-link>) through a grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to the London School of Hygiene &#x00026; Tropical Medicine (ITGBVG01).

Subsequently, there has been a strong drive to scale-up use of rapid diagnostic tests for malaria (mRDTs) in areas where microscopy is unavailable or unreliable, with a goal of providing universal access to malaria diagnosis [<xref rid="pone.0170998.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Testing for malaria is now considered one of the central pillars of malaria control, aiming to target effective antimalarials to those with laboratory confirmed malaria [<xref rid="pone.0170998.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], and allowing for improved management of non-malarial fevers as well as reduced selection pressure for resistant parasites [<xref rid="pone.0170998.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Increased testing is also promoted for surveillance purposes [<xref rid="pone.0170998.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], particularly as the burden of malaria has been declining in many countries [<xref rid="pone.0170998.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0170998.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Implementation of rapid testing for malaria is paving the way for other point of care tests to target antibiotic use. Much hope is pinned on diagnostic technologies to turn the tide of antimicrobial resistance around the globe [<xref rid="pone.0170998.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0170998.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Several major challenges to the introduction of mRDTs at scale have been recognised [<xref rid="pone.0170998.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Once mRDTs are in stock, the focus of implementation programs has been on ensuring that all suspected malaria cases are tested with a mRDT prior to prescription of recommended antimalarial drugs. Early experiences with introducing mRDTs highlighted the potential for tests to remain unused, or for negative test results to be ignored and overridden by clinical judgement [<xref rid="pone.0170998.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0170998.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, interventions that have supported the introduction of mRDTs with intensive training and close supervision have increased appropriate malaria case management in Uganda [<xref rid="pone.0170998.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0170998.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and elsewhere [<xref rid="pone.0170998.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0170998.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Reductions in antimalarial prescribing have been as high as 68% [<xref rid="pone.0170998.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However, the impact of introducing mRDTs into routine care for children in areas with intense malaria transmission remains unclear, including effects on antimalarial and antibiotic prescribing.</p><p>The PRIME intervention was designed to improve the quality of care delivered for malaria and other childhood febrile illnesses in Tororo, Uganda by training health workers in public health centers, and ensuring adequate supplies of mRDTs and artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) [<xref rid="pone.0170998.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0170998.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. We conducted a cluster-randomized controlled trial to evaluate the impact of the PRIME intervention on community-level health indicators (published elsewhere)[<xref rid="pone.0170998.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], and treatment of malaria in children under five years, reported here. We aimed to test the hypothesis that inappropriate treatment of malaria would be lower in intervention health centers than in control health centers. We also conducted a mixed-methods process evaluation alongside the main trial to further our understanding about the implementation, mechanisms of effect and context of the intervention [<xref rid="pone.0170998.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Methods</title><p>The trial protocols have been published previously [<xref rid="pone.0170998.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0170998.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].

Of 22 health centers in the study area, two pairs of health centers had substantially overlapping catchment areas; one facility from each pair was randomly excluded. All other health centers were eligible for participation. Twenty government-run health centers (level II and III) were the units of randomization, and were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to intervention or control. Health centers were stratified by level, and restricted randomization was employed to ensure balance on geographical location and cluster size. The trial statistician generated the allocation sequence using random number generation in R version 2.11.1 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.r-project.org/">http://www.r-project.org/</ext-link>), and assigned health centers to study arms. Study personnel enrolled health centers after randomization; allocation was not blinded. Study personnel met with health leaders, health center in-charges, and community representatives to inform them about the study. An information sheet was used to describe the intervention, and verbal consent to participate in the study was obtained from the health center in-charges.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>PRIME intervention</title><p>Development of the PRIME intervention was guided by extensive formative research [<xref rid="pone.0170998.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].

Intervention training delivery started in May 2011 and was completed by 1 July 2011, the start date of the evaluation period. Support for the supplies of mRDTs and AL continued until April 2013.

If eligibility criteria were met, a questionnaire was administered to the caregiver to gather information about the child&#x02019;s illness and their experience at the health center, and the child underwent a clinical evaluation. If the child had a temperature of &#x0003e;38.0&#x000b0;C or a history of fever in the past 48 hours, a finger-prick blood sample was obtained to perform a reference mRDT.

Pre-specified secondary outcomes were: the proportion of children for whom AL was prescribed at the health center; the proportion of children for whom an mRDT was done at the health center; the proportion who were prescribed AL among those with a negative reference mRDT result; and among those with a positive reference mRDT results the proportion who were not prescribed AL; the proportion who were prescribed a non-ACT antimalarial; the proportion who were not prescribed any antimalarial and the proportion who were prescribed antibiotics. Additional outcomes examined included: the proportion of children prescribed other drugs, the mean number of drugs prescribed, and the mean number of antibiotics prescribed.</p></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>We initially planned to interview 10 children and their caregivers in each of the 20 clusters at three different time points. Assuming the proportion inappropriately treated to be 50% in the control group, data from each time point would give 80% power to detect a difference in the proportion inappropriately treated for malaria between the two intervention arms of 24% (or more) at the 5% significance level, assuming a coefficient of variation between clusters of 0.2 and allowing for the stratified design.</p><p>However, data from the first two time points indicated a lower level of inappropriate treatment across both arms than anticipated in the original sample size calculation. Therefore, the sample size required for the third and final time point was increased to 50 per cluster. Assuming the proportion of children inappropriately treated to be 35% in the control group this would give 80% power to detect a difference in proportion inappropriately treated of 12% (or more) at the 5% significance level with coefficient of variation 0.2.</p><p>Trial analysis was done at the cluster level [<xref rid="pone.0170998.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Data from the three time points were analyzed together due to the relatively small sample size for the first two time points. Cluster-level proportions for each outcome were calculated and log transformed to normalize their distributions. Crude risk ratios for the effect of the intervention were calculated by taking the exponential of the difference in the mean of the cluster-specific log proportion between the two arms [<xref rid="pone.0170998.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Stratified t-tests were used to calculate p-values for the crude effect of the intervention, where the within-stratum between-cluster variance was estimated as the residual mean square from a two-way analysis of variance of the log-proportions on stratum and treatment arm, including an interaction term. Finally, 95% confidence intervals (CI) for crude risk ratios, adjusting for stratum, were calculated from this variance using a t-statistic with 16 degrees of freedom, and then applying the exponential transformation. Adjusted analyses for the effect of the intervention on each outcome was also performed, adjusting for child&#x02019;s age and sex using a two-stage approach [<xref rid="pone.0170998.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0170998.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>In further analyses, to assess plausibility of an effect of the intervention, we did a cluster-level analysis to evaluate the association between intervention &#x0201c;dose&#x0201d; (the proportion of health workers at a HC who received training in fever case management) and the proportion of children experiencing the primary and secondary outcomes at that HC, using linear regression. We also investigated the following cluster-level characteristics for associations with the outcomes: mean age of health workers, proportion male health workers, mean education level, mean health worker length of time working at health center, mean number of training workshops attended, and proportion of health workers who received mRDT training. Scores for confidence in malaria case management were calculated as non-weighted aggregates from the questionnaires (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0170998.s002">S2 File</xref>) and also considered as a covariate in this analysis.</p><p>Individual-level analyses investigating differences in ACT prescribing behaviour, comparing children who reportedly had an mRDT performed at the health centers to those who did not were done using logistic regression with random effects to allow for clustering.</p><p>Qualitative analysis of in-depth interviews and open-text questionnaire responses involved reviewing each health worker as a case, situated in the context of their health center, and then coding narratives and text line-by-line to generate lists of repeating ideas which were grouped into emerging themes. These themes were explored in relation to the quantitative findings arising, and vice versa. Analyses were done using Stata version 13 (StataCorp, College Station, Texas, US) and Nvivo version 10 (QSR International).

prescribing</title><p>In 2009&#x02013;2010, when the formative research for the PRIME study was conducted, health centers were experiencing major stockouts of AL, the first-line recommended treatment for uncomplicated malaria, and lacked mRDTs. However, by the the time the PRIME trial began in 2011, a new &#x02018;push&#x02019; delivery system had been implemented nationwide and stockouts of AL became less common. During the trial, mRDTs were generally unavailable in the control health centers but were intermittently delivered across the district (without training), including coinciding with our third round of exit interviews (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0170998.g003">Fig 3</xref>).</p><p>At the times of our exit interviews, the proportion of children tested with an mRDT was higher in the intervention health centers than in the controls (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0170998.t002">Table 2</xref>), but this difference was not statistically significant, and testing varied widely between health centers. Despite the differences in mRDT uptake, in both arms nearly two-thirds of consulations resulted in a prescription for AL. Children were prescribed an antimalarial or antibiotic in 86.4% of the consultations. Antibiotic prescriptions were higher in the intervention than the control arm (56.7% versus 47.1%) but this difference was not significant (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0170998.t002">Table

At health centers where all health workers had attended the fever case management training, the proportion of children tested with an mRDT was 29% higher (an absolute difference), but not statistically significantly so, than in health centers where no health workers had attended training (95% CI: -27%, 85%; p = 0.26). At health centers where health workers scored higher on the questionnaire assessing their confidence and ability to use mRDTs in line with PRIME guidelines, children were more likely to be tested for malaria (an increase in testing of 16.6%, 95% CI: 2.8%, 30.6%; p = 0.02, for each absolute increase of 10% in confidence score) and were less likely to be prescribed AL in the setting of a negative reference mRDT (a decrease in prescribing of 12.9%, 95% CI: 3.7%, 22.0%; p = 0.008, for each absolute increase of 10% in confidence score). Consistent with this, those who had attended the fever case management training had on average a higher score in confidence in following guidelines than those who had not (73.7 compared with 57.8, p = 0.04). Taken together, those who attended the training were more confident implementing fever case management guidelines, and this was related to higher uptake of mRDTs and adherence to negative test results.</p></sec><sec id="sec020"><title>Overall impact of mRDTs on prescribing</title><p>Because mRDTs and AL were available across health centers at the 13 month time point when a majority of the patient exit interviews took place (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0170998.g003">Fig 3</xref>), but they were not always taken up, we were able to explore how use of mRDTs affected prescription of AL across all health centers, independent of study arm assignment. Overall, targeting of AL was better amongst patients who were tested for malaria at the health center (n = 746) than those who were not tested (n = 579, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0170998.t003">Table 3</xref>). Children with a negative reference mRDT who were reportedly tested for malaria at the health center were much lesss likely to be prescribed AL than those who were not tested (18.1% vs 56.4%, p&#x0003c;0.001). However, use of mRDTs appeared to have had less of an impact on antibiotic prescribing. Fewer children with a positive reference mRDT were prescribed an antibiotic if they were tested at the health center than those not tested (44.9% vs 52.9%), but about two-thirds of children with a negative reference mRDT were prescribed an antibiotic regardless of whether they were tested for malaria at the health center. Overall, polypharmacy was common (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0170998.t003">Table 3</xref>). Children who were not tested for malaria at the health center were prescribed more drugs than those who were tested (mean 2.85 versus 2.56, p&#x0003c;0.001), mainly due to higher antimalarial

workers identified mRDTs as the most significant change occurring at their health centers over the past year. At control health centers, where mRDTs were also delivered intermittently, mRDTs were occasionally mentioned. However, resoundingly, the biggest change for control health workers was the stable supply of AL due to the government&#x02019;s new drug delivery (&#x02018;push&#x02019;) system. Some health workers, mostly at control health centers, also mentioned the changes in management of medicines due to the support received from the SURE (Securing Ugandans&#x02019; Rights to Essential Medicines) NGO project, which was active at 19 of the participating health centers.</p><p>At some health centers, staff systematically used mRDTs to test every suspected malaria case. In these health centers, health workers appeared more confident managing patients with negative mRDTs. For example, the in-charge at one intervention health center with high testing rates explained how he consulted a guidebook to manage mRDT negative cases.</p><disp-quote><p><italic>HCW 801 (nursing assistant): Aaa the most important thing I got is when I have mRDT.

<italic>Officer&#x02019;s] office</italic></p></disp-quote><p>However, elsewhere, particularly the larger health centers and the overstretched smaller health centers, mRDTs were used less frequently. In these sites, staff felt that tests were too time-consuming in a context where they were overworked, with inadequate staffing levels. One intervention in-charge, who threatened to withdraw from the project due to the burden of testing and keeping records, described the burden of testing on her team.</p><disp-quote><p><italic>&#x0201c;It has given us it has added on our workload.</italic>
<italic>You know we don&#x02019;t have laboratory assistant, and now you have to test. I am not a lab personnel, I have to go in something which is out of my duties.

And that is why we raised up an alarm the other time.&#x0201d; (HCW 201, midwife, emphasis added)</italic></p></disp-quote><p>mRDTs may not have been a priority for all health center managers, resulting in lower testing rates. At one intervention HCIII, where fewer than 50% children were tested, the project supervision team repeatedly noted that access to the store cupboard was limited in the absence of the in-charge. Here, one of the health workers complained that</p><disp-quote><p><italic>&#x0201c;Some busy days you find</italic>

Half very rarely did mRDTs, not wanting to test without training and left the mRDTs in their boxes. At these facilities, health workers remained of the view that presumptive malaria treatment is the national guideline,</p><disp-quote><p><italic>&#x0201c;Treatment of malaria can also</italic>
<italic>be given to a patient even if there is no mRDT, under national guidelines on management of common conditions.&#x0201d; (HCW 2002, nursing assistant)</italic></p></disp-quote><p>However, the other five control health centers tested over two-thirds of the children during our study. Here, individuals appeared active in wanting to gain skills in using the tests, and after the sporadic supplies of mRDTs from the government were finished spoke of how useful they had found the tests to be for case management.</p></sec><sec id="sec022"><title>Health worker perceptions of the impact of mRDTs on prescribing</title><p>The responses about changes at health centers revolved around a key concern of availability of drugs, which are seen as an essential component of care. In this context, with a history of severe stockouts, medicines were seen as a precious resource. Health workers felt entrusted to provide these commodities to patients, and were happy to have more of them available. A key attractive feature of the mRDT was to ensure that the drugs were not &#x02018;wasted&#x02019;. The tests would ensure that the drugs went to &#x02018;proper illness&#x02019; the &#x02018;needy&#x02019; and those &#x02018;deserving&#x02019; it because their diagnosis was &#x02018;confirmed&#x02019;, &#x02018;definite&#x02019; and &#x02018;proper&#x02019;, as illustrated by this intervention health worker.</p><disp-quote><p><italic>&#x0201c;Use of mRDT has helped in effective management of especially malaria</italic>
<italic>patients in that they are given the <bold>right treatment</bold> after testing not like way back when malaria treatment was on assumption making [for] <bold>those who did not deserve malaria treatment&#x0201d;</bold> (HCW 608, emphasis added)</italic></p></disp-quote><p>The process of rationing, or &#x02018;controlling our number of patients who are taking Coartem&#x02019;, was also appealing to health care workers who saw the test as an arbiter&#x02013;able to assign patients to &#x02018;deserving&#x02019; or &#x02018;undeserving&#x02019; of these drugs. This ability to use (or at times ignore) a biomedical test strengthened health workers&#x02019; authority in two ways: by showing their association with biomedicine and access to its commodities, and by strengthening their ability to grant access of patients to the commodities they desired (medicines). By extension, health care workers reported that this had increased patients&#x02019; confidence in the care they received at health centers. Not only would patients be able to access drugs, which were now more reliably available, but they would only be able to do so after &#x02018;proving&#x02019; that they &#x02018;deserved&#x02019; these medicines.</p><disp-quote><p><italic>&#x0201c;The patients know now before getting</italic>
<italic>treatment <bold>you must be tested to confirm that you have malaria</bold>&#x0201d; (HCW 210, emphasis added)</italic></p></disp-quote><p>Thus, the nature of biomedicine, as a priviledged and somewhat mystified method of managing illnesses, was reinforced through the presence and choice to use mRDTs.</p></sec><sec id="sec023"><title>Patient perspectives of the impact of mRDTs on delivery of care</title><p>From a patient perspective, many who had their malaria status &#x02018;confirmed&#x02019; through mRDTs were, as reported by the health care workers, pleased with their experience. The mRDTs were attractive as a marker of good biomedical care. However, at other times patients were frustrated with being unable to access the care they wished to received, being blocked by the mRDT. The focus on the mRDT and thereby on malaria / not malaria, appeared to draw focus away from other ailments.</p><disp-quote><p><italic>I would have loved it if the</italic>
<italic>health worker had asked me or discussed about the hernia which is bothering the child. <bold>We only talked about the fever</bold>. (Mother at HC6, emphasis added)</italic></p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, health workers too recognised that patients could become discouraged by the insistence on use of mRDTs, as reported by this nurse.</p><disp-quote><p><italic>I am even seeing the numbers of patients, the many patients we have been having, at this moment it is a bit</italic>
<italic>going down. Because now, <bold>we are using the mRDTs to scrutinize them</bold>. They come mostly&#x02013;there are those who come aiming at the ACTs to go keep at their homes. So when you come and you are not given ACT today, you come and you are scrutinized, and you are not given the next day. So you find <bold>people are getting discouraged to come</bold> (HCW 1003, emphasis added)</italic></p></disp-quote><p>Thus, in this context, the introduction of mRDTs was largely seen as positive, and reinforced some of the desirable aspects of providing and accessing biomedical care. The main downsides for health workers were the work load they required and for patients their potential to overshadow their other health care needs.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec024"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this cluster-randomized trial, we found that the PRIME intervention&#x02019;s programme of training workshops and supervision, plus provision of mRDTs and AL when stocks ran low, increased uptake of mRDTs but did not have the desired impact on treatment of malaria. Although a reduction in inappropriate antimalarial treatment of 6% was observed in the intervention arm compared to the control arm, this difference was not statistically significant. In this high malaria transmission setting, we did not see the substantial reductions in antimalarial prescribing that have been observed in other scenarios with similarly intensive interventions but lower levels of malaria [<xref rid="pone.0170998.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0170998.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Concerningly, some patients with positive mRDT results did not receive the first-line antimalarial treatment. These findings demonstrate that diagnostic tests are not a straightforward solution to improving medicines use in all settings.</p><p>Given improved availability of AL and mRDTs in both intervention and control health centers at the time of the exit interviews, differences between study arms may be attributed to the training and supervision component of the intervention, which appeared to improve health worker confidence in testing and restricting antimalarials, supporting the plausibility of effect. However, the limited size of effect may reflect the large proportions of children for whom antimalarial prescription was classifed as appropriate, with three quarters of febrile children testing positive for malaria. This echos previous modelling exercises that have predicted the cost of introducing mRDTs in high transmission areas may outweigh the benefit [<xref rid="pone.0170998.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In addition, although mRDTs can have several operational advantages, they may lack specificity. mRDTs that identify histidine rich protein II (HRP-2), a parasite antigen that may circulate for weeks following successful malaria treatment, may be falsely positive due to recent prior infection [<xref rid="pone.0170998.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In high transmission settings like Tororo, where reinfection is common, a substantial proportion of patients presenting with conditions other than malaria may be over-diagnosed as malaria despite the use of an mRDT [<xref rid="pone.0170998.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0170998.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>Across both trial arms, when mRDTs were used, targeting of AL improved substantially. However, testing rates were highly variable across the health centers in both study arms, reflecting the different contexts and needs of the health centers. Some health centers suffered from extremely poor infrastructure. Staff shortages and competing priorities left many health centers with too few staff working at any one time to allow for routine use of mRDTs. Other health centers benefited from highly motivated staff willing to extend themselves to take on this new technology. In order to increase frequency of testing, mRDTs would have to be supported by substantial improvements in infrastructure, personnel and ongoing supportive supervision, as documented elsewhere [<xref rid="pone.0170998.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Such improvements are likely to require systemic change in health systems rather than to be addressed through single-disease focused programmes.</p><p>Of concern, a surprisingly large number of children with a positive reference mRDT were not prescribed AL. Much of the effort in malaria case management focuses on reducing inappropriate overuse of antimalarial drugs, assuming patients with a positive test will receive an ACT. However, ensuring that patients with malaria receive prompt effective treatment remains a major issue. In our setting, this undertreatment of malaria could not be attributed to ACT stockouts, as has been the case elsewhere [<xref rid="pone.0170998.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], as supplies of AL were stable during the study. Lack of health worker knowledge of guidelines also seems unlikely; in their registers, health workers recorded prescribing AL to over 93% RDT positive cases (data not shown). It is possible that health workers incorrectly interpreted the mRDT results as negative, perhaps not waiting sufficient time for results to develop, or performing tests incorrectly. In many cases, caregivers did not know their child&#x02019;s test results, which could reflect the challenging logistics of integrating even &#x02018;simple&#x02019; and &#x02018;rapid&#x02019; tests into resource and time constrained care scenarios. Finally, it is also possible that health workers witheld AL while the exit interviews were ongoing, knowing that the study team would test and treat patients.</p><p>The observation that antibiotics were so frequently prescribed, to around half of febrile children, is a concern in the context of mounting drug resistance. In other settings, it has been suggested that fewer than one in four febrile children require antibiotics [<xref rid="pone.0170998.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0170998.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. While it is appealing to imagine that adding further point-of-care tests would limit overuse of antibiotics, the tendency to provide at least one antimicrobial to febrile children needs to be taken seriously. This is particularly true in low-resource settings where healthcare may consist of little more than provision of medicines [<xref rid="pone.0170998.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p><p>This study had several limitations. The exit interviews were carried out at three timepoints, aiming to capture prescribing practices over time. However, this design raises several limitations in interpretation. First, given the unexpectedly low level of inappropriate malaria treatment and the different contextual scenarios that arose during the course of the trial, such as delivery of mRDTs to control health centers, it would have been desirable in hindsight to collect data on sufficient numbers of children to allow investigation of a change in the impact of the intervention over time. However, the sample size was not sufficient to allow this interaction analysis. The fact that a majority of our data are from 13 months post-training, however, means the findings presented are likely to be closer to a scale-up scenario than data collected at times of immediate post-intervention attentiveness. Second, slightly different study teams carried out the exit interviews at the different time points, partly due to the larger sample required for the third round of interviews, and thus the conduct of the intervivews across the three rounds may not have been universal. Third, because of changes in health center personnel over time, we were unable to link the exit interview data to specific health worker characteristics for more detailed analyses of explanatory variables such as intervention exposure.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec025"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Although the PRIME intervention did not have the desired impact on inappropriate treatment of malaria, our results suggest that mRDTs have the capacity to improve targeting of ACTs. However, achieving this will require further efforts in supporting infrastructure as well as training and supervision programmes to ensure all eligible patients are tested. Such investments would also reap benefits in supporting the case management of other non-malarial illnesses amongst febrile patients, which is especially important if the specificity of mRDTs is low. In this high malaria transmission setting, benefits of mRDTs in terms of reducing ACT wastage are likely to be small. Rather, the benefit of mRDTs should be viewed in light of broader improvements to fever case management.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec026"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0170998.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>PRIME protocol V1.1, 18 September 2010.</title><p><bold>Original version of the PRIME protocol.</bold> This file is a copy of the original study protocol of the PRIME cluster-randomized trial, which was approved by the overseeing ethics committees.</p><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0170998.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0170998.s002"><label>S2 File</label><caption><title>PRIME protocol V1.7, 15 February 2013.</title><p><bold>Final version of the PRIME protocol.</bold> This file is a copy of the final study protocol of the PRIME cluster-randomized trial, incorporating all amendments approved by the overseeing ethics committees.</p><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0170998.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0170998.s003"><label>S3 File</label><caption><title>PROCESS protocol.</title><p><bold>V1.1, 23 February 2011.
