Although Blacks and Hispanics are 3.4 and 1.5 times more likely, respectively, to develop end stage renal disease (ESRD) than Whites, they are less likely to receive LDKTs. To address this disparity, a new randomized controlled trial (RCT) will assess whether Black, Hispanic, and White transplant patients&#x02019; knowledge, readiness to pursue LDKT, and receipt of LDKTs can be increased when they participate in the <italic>Your Path to Transplant</italic> (YPT) computer-tailored intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>Nine hundred Black, Hispanic, and White ESRD patients presenting for transplant evaluation at University of California, Los Angeles Kidney and Pancreas Transplant Program (UCLA-KPTP) will be randomly assigned to one of two education conditions, YPT or Usual Care Control Education (UC). As they undergo transplant evaluation, patients in the YPT condition will receive individually-tailored telephonic coaching sessions, feedback reports, video and print transplant education resources, and assistance with reducing any known socioeconomic barriers to LDKT. Patients receiving UC will only receive transplant education provided by UCLA-KPTP. Changes in transplant knowledge, readiness, pros and cons, and self-efficacy to pursue LDKT will be assessed prior to presenting at the transplant center (baseline), during transplant evaluation, and 4- and 8-months post-baseline, while completion of transplant evaluation and receipt of LDKTs will be assessed at 18-months post-baseline. The RCT will determine, compared to UC, whether Black, Hispanic, and White patients receiving YPT increase in their readiness to pursue LDKT and transplant knowledge, and become more likely to complete transplant medical evaluation and pursue LDKT. It will also examine how known patient, family, and healthcare system barriers to LDKT act alone and in combination with YPT to affect patients&#x02019; transplant decision-making and behavior.

Transplantation has clear survival and quality-of-life benefits for patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and can reduce national health-care costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Living donor kidney transplant (LDKT) is the optimal form of transplantation since it can occur more quickly than deceased donor kidney transplant (DDKT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and results in better graft survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and better quality-of-life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Because of the deceased donor organ shortage, most patients are now considering whether to receive kidneys from family and friends through LDKT.</p><p>Due to higher rates of diabetes and hypertension, the two primary causes of kidney failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], Blacks and Hispanics are 3.4 and 1.5 times more likely, respectively, to develop ESRD than their White or non-Hispanic counterparts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Despite this, research has shown that, compared to Whites, Blacks and Hispanics are less likely to complete transplant medical evaluation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], be placed on the waiting list or have longer wait times [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], or receive DDKTs and LDKTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Specifically, at 2 years post-wait-listing, approximately 20% of both Blacks and Hispanics had received transplants while 30% of Whites had (OPTN data as of 09/19/2014). Therefore, while increasing the rates of LDKT could increase the quality-of-life and decrease the mortality of all ESRD patients, this approach could have its greatest impact on Black and Hispanic patients&#x02019; lives.</p><p>Research has indicated that all patients, regardless of race, face many barriers to getting a LDKT, including a lack of knowledge about the advantages of LDKT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], confusion about how to find living donors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], concerns about risking a living donor&#x02019;s health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], and fears about the possibility of the transplanted kidney failing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. However, there are additional barriers to LDKT for Black and Hispanic patients. A recent study suggests that Hispanic ESRD patients may have low levels of knowledge about transplant, particular concerns about living donors&#x02019; wellbeing, and logistical barriers in the case of undocumented immigrants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. With Blacks and Hispanics less likely to donate kidneys when they die than Whites, the availability of matching deceased donor kidneys for this racial group is lower [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. For racial/ethnic minorities, unsuccessful completion of transplant medical evaluation and lower receipt of transplants is also exacerbated by lower socioeconomic status, greater levels of occupational insecurity, and more transient healthcare coverage compared to Whites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Mistrust of healthcare providers is more common among Blacks and Hispanics than Whites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], which may affect their trust in physicians&#x02019; recommendations for LDKT and cause suspicion of LDKT itself [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Finally, variation in the availability and quality of a support network for minorities affects transplantation rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p>In a previous trial, our research team designed a set of <italic>Explore Transplant</italic> (ET) print and video education materials to improve patients&#x02019; transplant knowledge and maximize informed LDKT decision-making [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Compared to patients in dialysis centers who received ET with those in centers who did not, after one month, patients in ET dialysis centers were more knowledgeable of transplant, had greater perception of transplant&#x02019;s benefits, and were more likely to be reading and talking to others about LDKT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].&#x02009;One to two years later, more patients in ET dialysis centers were reactivating or starting transplant medical evaluation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p><p>Although the results of this educational intervention were promising, there is evidence that interventions that are individually-tailored to ESRD patients&#x02019; needs and preferences may be even more successful at reducing racial disparities in completion of evaluation and receipt of LDKTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. In this manuscript, we describe the protocol of a new randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test the efficacy of a computerized <italic>Your Path to Transplant</italic> (YPT) educational program on decreasing racial disparities in LDKT. The RCT will determine, compared to a usual care education control group (UC) from the transplant center, whether Black, Hispanic, and White patients receiving YPT increase in their readiness to pursue LDKT and transplant knowledge, and whether they become more likely to complete transplant medical evaluation and pursue LDKT. It will also examine whether YPT&#x02019;s effectiveness in changing LDKT decision-making and behavior is different between Blacks, Hispanics, and Whites. Finally, it will examine how known patient, family, and healthcare system barriers to LDKT act alone and in combination with YPT to affect Black and Hispanic patients&#x02019; transplant decision-making and behavior.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods and study design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Theoretical foundation of YPT</title><p>Guided by the Transtheoretical Model of Behavioral Change (TTM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], one proven approach for health promotion is to individually-tailor education by the level of patients&#x02019; readiness to take certain health behaviors and other decision-making variables, like the patients&#x02019; self-efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. The TTM is particularly well-suited for the development of computer-tailored interventions (CTIs) that can be easily disseminated to entire populations. By utilizing relevant theory, normative databases and empirically-based decision rules, CTIs provide tailoring of the most appropriate information to each participant to guide their change process. This approach allows for thousands of unique combinations of individual feedback messages to be provided based on TTM constructs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].</p><p>CTI feedback provided to patients via coaches and printed reports addresses how a specific patient&#x02019;s knowledge and readiness to take a specific behavior compares to a normative group of patients (normative feedback) or changes over time compared to their own previous data (ipsative feedback). Individually-tailored interventions provide recommendations to educators to guide health conversations optimally that emphasize what is most helpful to the patient, minimize resistance, and emphasize key demographic or socioeconomic factors, if needed. Research has shown that patients who receive education tailored to their level of readiness have double the chance of taking action toward behavior change in the following 6&#x000a0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Design and advantages of YPT</title><p>YPT was developed by Dr. Amy Waterman, creator of the <italic>Explore Transplant</italic> (ET) Patient Education Program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], and experts in TTM behavior change, Drs. Mark Robbins and Andrea Paiva. For several reasons, we anticipate that the YPT educational program may be more effective than usual care education provided by transplant centers (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). A unique and innovative element of YPT is the TTM-based CTI using validated transplant decision-making measures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] that can be delivered in person, via the telephone, and on the computer. First, the computer-generated content within this program is individually-tailored to patients&#x02019; levels of readiness to pursue DDKT and LDKT. In addition to their level of readiness, behavioral guidance is based on TTM constructs (including decisional balance and self-efficacy), addresses their unique gaps in knowledge, and discusses information relevant to any personal challenges patients could be facing to derail them from transplantation. Since the YPT assessment can be given at different time points throughout evaluation, patients&#x02019; changes in knowledge, readiness, and other TTM constructs over time can be assessed and tailored feedback communicated by coaches. Second, the program is delivered over four time points in small increments, recommending patients take small, more manageable steps toward pursuing LDKT. This empowers patients to feel they are making meaningful progress toward LDKT and honors that many ESRD patients experience mental fatigue when too much educational information is provided at one sitting. Third, since the YPT program acknowledges that DDKT and LDKT are two separate treatment options and choices, it addresses patients&#x02019; individual fears and readiness for DDKT and LDKT separately. Finally, the YPT program provides community-based resources and coaching to help overcome socioeconomic and other practical barriers that may derail transplantation.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>

First, based on their level of LDKT readiness, patients will watch one of two 8-minute videos on evaluation day, either a video discussing general advantages to pursuing LDKT or a more advanced video providing practical suggestions for how to find living donors. Second, the patient will be given a one-hour <italic>Explore Transplant</italic> video to review at home with people who help them make important health decisions. The videos include the stories of 20 transplant recipients and living donors and discuss the questions and fears they had before getting a transplant and why they became motivated to pursue transplant. Health professionals on the video and educational fact sheets provide answers to common questions, including specifics about the evaluation, surgery and recovery processes involved with being a transplant recipient and a living donor. The benefits and risks of being a kidney recipient and a living donor are also outlined. This video is closed-captioned for the hearing impaired.</p><p>This program also invites family members and friends to learn with the patient. The patient will receive a <italic>Guide for Family Members and Friends</italic> that provides suggestions about how others could help the patient learn, decide what is best for them, and, potentially, be living donors themselves.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Community resource guide to address socioeconomic barriers to transplant</title><p>A <italic>Community Resource Guide</italic> will also be given to patients to provide them with referrals to services that may help them overcome socioeconomic barriers to transplant. Referral resources include access to dental services, reduced or free childcare or transportation services, and inexpensive housing near the transplant center.

In regards to LDKT, the coordinator discusses how to obtain a LDKT, who is eligible to be a living donor, the available paired donation programs, and what the donor can expect during evaluation and surgery. The patients receive a copy of the PowerPoint slides and a &#x0201c;Patient Education Manual&#x0201d;, that includes additional printed education regarding the transplant and living donation processes, recipient selection criteria, nutrition, and exercise. They also receive education about LDKT including two pamphlets discussing incompatible blood type and kidney transplantation and the UCLA kidney exchange program.</p><p>During their one-on-one evaluations with the transplant coordinator, social worker, nephrologist and/or surgeon, patients have the opportunity to ask additional questions. Additional educational opportunities are also available by phone after evaluation when speaking with their transplant coordinator while completing their final medical tests and tracking their progress on the waiting list.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>RCT overview</title><p>In this study, we will conduct an educational intervention as Black, Hispanic, and White ESRD patients present for and undergo transplant evaluation, and take actions to pursue DDKT and LDKT. This longitudinal, parallel RCT has two treatment conditions with equal allocation, the YPT Intervention and the UC control education conditions (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Patients in both groups will be surveyed prior to presenting at the transplant center (baseline), and at 4- and 8-months post-baseline. Patients in the intervention group will also be surveyed an additional time during their in-person transplant evaluation meeting. Completion of transplant evaluation and receipt of LDKT will be assessed for both groups using medical records 18-months post-baseline.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>

Patients in the intervention (YPT) condition will receive an estimated 1&#x000a0;hour and 15&#x000a0;minutes of additional formal transplant education compared to patients in the UC condition over an 8&#x000a0;month period.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Patient recruitment, eligibility, randomization, and retention</title><p>The records of patients who have recently been scheduled for their evaluation day appointments will be obtained from UCLA-KPTP&#x02019;s clinical database, randomized to a treatment group by a data manager, and uploaded into a patient recruitment and tracking database supported by the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Research staff will contact patients by telephone to be invited to participate in the study. The REDCap recruitment database will include eligible patients&#x02019; names, contact information, demographic data, data on their retention in the study and progress through the survey time points, and their final clinical outcomes at the end of the trial. It will be continually updated by the study research coordinators and a data manager.</p><p>Inclusion criteria for the RCT include: 1) presentation for transplant evaluation at UCLA by calling to make an appointment; and 2) self-identification as either White, Black or Hispanic race/ethnicity. Exclusion criteria include: 1) being under age 18; 2) not being able to speak English; 3) being previously deemed ineligible for transplant at UCLA; 4) being on the wait-list for transplant at a center other than UCLA; 5) pursuing multi-organ transplant; or 6) having no consistent access to a working telephone. After being informed of the risks and benefits of the trial, patients will be asked to give verbal informed consent to participate and have their electronic medical records reviewed. This protocol has been approved by the University of California, Los Angeles&#x02019;s Internal Review Board (#14-000382) and registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (#NCT02181114).</p><p>We will recruit 900 patients at baseline, 450 per treatment group. We estimate a conservative attrition rate of approximately 33%, resulting in a final sample of approximately 600 subjects, 300 in each group. To maximize participation and minimize attrition, we will provide a $10 incentive upon completion of each of the 3 or 4 time points (depending on treatment group), pay for the costs of transplant center parking and provide snacks at evaluation day, and collect alternative contact information at baseline in case of study dropout. We also have the ability to monitor patients&#x02019; progress through transplant evaluation daily using electronic medical records, which will greatly reduce the number of patients who are lost to follow-up.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Survey timepoints</title><p>To begin the trial, we will conduct a 40-minute assessment of patients in the YPT and UC conditions to measure their demographic and clinical characteristics, any socioeconomic barriers to transplant, as well as their baseline DDKT and LDKT knowledge, decision-making, readiness, and self-efficacy. Upon beginning evaluation approximately 3&#x02013;5 weeks later, patients in the YPT condition will repeat components of the survey during a 10-minute assessment. Four and 8&#x000a0;months later, patients in both conditions will complete two more 15-minute surveys to assess how their knowledge, decision-making, and behavior are changing over time. During the final 8-month interview, we also will ask patients questions regarding the cultural competency of their medical providers and other process measures including whether they had made an informed decision as to whether or not pursue DDKT or LDKT, and the overall helpfulness of the education they received.</p><p>For patients in the UC education condition, no additional education or coaching will occur after these surveys are administered. Patients in the UC education condition will receive a $10 gift card and a letter of thanks in the mail after each time point.

During this call, as prompted by bulleted coaching recommendations generated by the YPT computerized program, the coach will discuss the most relevant content to support each patient in completing transplant evaluation successfully and pursuing LDKT. Immediately after the call, the coach will mail each patient a folder containing the informed consent documents, an individually-tailored feedback report generated from their answers to the baseline survey, print DDKT and LDKT educational resources, including a <italic>Community Resource Guide</italic>, and a $10 gift card.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>YPT evaluation day education and coaching</title><p>On evaluation day, 3 to 5&#x000a0;weeks after baseline, patients in the YPT intervention condition will be taken to a private area in the hospital where they will be reassessed to see how their transplant decision-making is changing. Then, the coach will provide 10-minutes of feedback based on any changes in readiness, confidence, and perceived benefits or concerns that have occurred since the initial assessment. Since the focus of this meeting is LDKT, patients also will watch a 10-minute LDKT video appropriate for their level of readiness and a discussion will be held about small steps they could take that honor their stage of readiness to further explore or pursue LDKT (20&#x000a0;minutes total time). At the end of the session, the coach will give the patient a second folder including an individually-tailored feedback report, print educational materials about LDKT, including an <italic>Explore Transplant</italic> video, educational resources to share with their family members and friends, and a $10 gift card. This meeting will take 30&#x000a0;minutes (20&#x000a0;minutes of coaching and 10&#x000a0;minutes for survey assessment).</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>YPT 4- and 8-month education and coaching</title><p>During two additional telephone assessments at 4- and 8-months following baseline, patients will be resurveyed (15&#x02013;20 minutes) to see how their decision-making and behavior is changing and, in the YPT education condition only, surveyed at 8&#x000a0;months about YPT&#x02019;s helpfulness.

All patient interviews will be audio recorded with the patient&#x02019;s consent. For each coach, the first 10 calls will be reviewed to ensure competency, then, afterwards, a randomly selected 10% of their calls will be reviewed by two raters and checked to see if the content and dose of the intervention has been delivered consistently, per protocol. Coaches administering the intervention and coaching to the intervention group will be rated on: 1) their standardized interviewing technique; 2) the consistency of coaching to TTM principles (e.g., effective tailoring to stage of readiness); 3) effective delivery of additional trial components (e.g., addresses socioeconomic status barriers to transplant, cultural competency); and 4) effective communication skills and rapport.

Multiple imputation of missing data will be used for the analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. The alpha level for all tests will be set at 0.05, and random effects models will be used to account for longitudinal measurement and linear regression employed for normally distributed outcomes, logistic regression for binomially distributed outcomes, and Poisson regression for count outcomes. The social, demographic, and other characteristics of patients who refuse to join the study or are never successfully contacted will be compared to those who do not to determine if the patient selection procedure has resulted in a biased sample. A similar analysis will be conducted to compare the patients who drop-out of the study to those who do not to determine if patient attrition has biased the sample.</p><p>To test whether, compared to the UC education condition, Black, Hispanic, and White patients receiving YPT increase in their LDKT readiness, we will first examine the proportion of individuals moving into the Action stage for readiness to accept a LDKT 8&#x000a0;months post-baseline between the YPT and UC conditions. For a more fine grained assessment of change in LDKT and DDKT readiness throughout the study, change by three occasions (baseline, 4&#x000a0;months post-baseline, and 8&#x000a0;months post-baseline) will be examined. To assess differences in transplant knowledge, DDKT/LDKT self-efficacy, and DDKT/LDKT decisional balance, comparisons between the YPT and UC conditions by these three occasions will be made to determine if the intervention increases transplant knowledge, DDKT/LDKT self-efficacy, and DDKT/LDKT decisional balance scales. Finally, differences in the number of small steps toward LDKT and DDKT will be examined at these three time points.</p><p>To determine whether, compared to the UC group, Black, Hispanic and White patients receiving YPT are more likely to complete transplant medical evaluation and pursue LDKT 18-months post-baseline, regression models will be fit with: 1) only the treatment condition as a predictor; 2) race added-in as a covariate; 3) an interaction term between treatment and race. To examine whether the YPT&#x02019;s effectiveness in changing LDKT decision-making and behavior is different between Blacks, Hispanics and Whites, comparisons will be made of proportional forward movement in readiness at 8 months post-baseline between Black, Hispanic and White patients in the YPT condition. Also, Black, Hispanic and White patients will be compared on three occasions (baseline, 4 months post-baseline, and 8 months post-baseline) to determine if access to YPT increases transplant knowledge differently for Black, Hispanic and White patients through this follow-up period and if the intervention has different effectiveness on the increase in proportion of living donors being evaluated for LDKT and increases in the proportion of LDKTs among Black, Hispanic and White patients 18-months post-baseline.</p><p>Finally, to examine how known patient, family, and healthcare system barriers to LDKT act alone and in combination with YPT to affect Black and Hispanic patients&#x02019; decision-making and behavior around LDKT, the direct effects of key modifiable and non-modifiable variables known to affect disparities in receipt of LDKT (e.g., medical mistrust, quality of health insurance, physician recommendation to pursue LDKT) on readiness to pursue LDKT, transplant knowledge, completion of transplant evaluation, and receipt of LDKT will be adjusted for in regression models of YPT&#x02019;s effect on these outcomes for Blacks and Hispanics separately. Then, interactions between YPT and these factors will be added to the models. Specifically, we will model each dependent variable first using the main effects of the barrier variables and of the YPT intervention, and then add two-way interactions between the intervention and the barrier variables. Similar models will be constructed for White patients. Based on these models, we will determine: (1) the estimated magnitude of racial differences between Black, Hispanic and White patients with and without access to the YPT for each outcome, and (2) which patient and care-related variables represent important confounding and modifying effects for explaining racial/ethnic differences in each outcome. These analyses will help elucidate whether the YPT achieves results by attenuating the impact of specific &#x02018;causes&#x02019; of racial/ethnic disparities in LDKT.</p><p>Qualitative analyses will be performed to understand responses to key open-ended questions asked in the survey, particularly those around socioeconomic barriers to patients&#x02019; pursuit of transplant, potential solutions to barriers patients face in their transplant pursuit, and actions patients are willing to take toward LDKT and DDKT. Patients&#x02019; responses will be coded and analyzed to determine themes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec33" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In every transplant center in the country, there are racial disparities in the receipt of LDKTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Active educational interventions to increase Black and Hispanic patients&#x02019; pursuit of LDKT have demonstrated some success [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. For example, in one dialysis center study, compared to their baseline attitudes, Blacks, younger patients, and patients who spent less time on dialysis were significantly more willing to pursue LDKT after receiving a print and video-based intervention compared to patients who did not receive this program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. In transplant center studies, compared with traditional clinic-based education, significantly more patients in a home-based educational intervention condition, particularly Blacks, had living donor inquiries, evaluations, and LDKTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. Further, two important trials are underway that will develop and assess the effectiveness of: 1) culturally sensitive education to improve kidney disease patients&#x02019; early consideration (pre-ESRD diagnosis) of LDKT with and without the assistance of a social worker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]; 2) group- and individual-based LDKT education at patients&#x02019; homes and in transplant centers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. Less interventions aimed at Hispanic patients have been conducted, though a culturally sensitive transplant evaluation process for Hispanic patients providing linguistic support in Spanish and transplant education that focuses specifically on concerns among Hispanic patients was successful in increasing Hispanic patients&#x02019; knowledge of and positive attitudes about living donor transplant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p>While these trials have, or promise to, contribute important evidence about how best to reduce racial disparities in LDKT, a common limitation among them is that they are not tailored to patients&#x02019; individual readiness, self-efficacy, or confidence to pursue LDKT. The proposed YPT RCT is novel because it assesses the effectiveness of an individually-tailored health education intervention and personalized coaching system to reduce racial disparities in LDKT. The findings of this trial will foster greater understanding of how YPT specifically affects White, Black and Hispanic patients&#x02019; LDKT decision-making, knowledge, and behavior.</p><p>Another novel feature of the YPT trial is its ability to examine the impact of socioeconomic factors that may derail White, Black and Hispanic patients&#x02019; pursuit of LDKT. Past studies have demonstrated that patients of lower socioeconomic status are less likely to successfully complete transplant evaluation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. However, these studies have compared the relative effects of few socioeconomic factors simultaneously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>], focused exclusively on factors that are difficult to modify (e.g., type of health insurance or household income) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>], or employed measurement at the neighborhood or census block level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. In YPT, after assessing key, specific barriers and providing support services to address them, we will be able to pinpoint the factors most likely to interfere with evaluation completion and successful LDKT.</p><p>In conclusion, through this trial, we will have developed a computerized <italic>Your Path to Transplant</italic> tailored computer intervention that could be utilized by providers serving ESRD patients in 250 transplant centers nationwide to tailor LDKT education by race/ethnicity and based on the needs of the individual patient. With additional testing in other clinical settings and other patient populations, this YPT program could be used in other healthcare settings including in community nephrologists&#x02019; offices, in dialysis centers, and even on the internet with patients and their families learning at home. Only then can all ESRD patients be assured the opportunity to learn about and pursue the treatment option most beneficial to them &#x02013; LDKT.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-list><def-item><term>ESRD</term><def><p>End-stage renal disease</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LDKT</term><def><p>Living donor kidney transplantation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>YPT</term><def><p>Your Path to Transplant computer-tailored intervention</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>UC</term><def><p>Usual care education (control condition)</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DDKT</term><def><p>Deceased donor kidney transplant</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ET</term><def><p>Explore Transplant</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TTM</term><def><p>Transtheoretical model of behavioral change</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CTI</term><def><p>Computer-tailored intervention</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>UCLA</term><def><p>University of California, Los Angeles</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>UCLA-KPTP</term><def><p>University of California, Los Angeles Kidney-Pancreas Transplant Program</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCT</term><def><p>Randomized controlled trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SRTR</term><def><p>Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MOS SF-12</term><def><p>Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 12</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CAHPS</term><def><p>Consumer Assessment of Healthcare and Provider Systems</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NIH</term><def><p>National Institutes of Health</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IRB</term><def><p>Internal review board</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>REDCap</term><def><p>Research Electronic Data Capture</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ITT</term><def><p>Intent-to-treat</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OPTN</term><def><p>Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network.</p></def></def-item></def-list></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>All authors read and approved the final manuscript, and all authors made intellectual contributions to the design of the trial.
