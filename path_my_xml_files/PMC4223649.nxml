We will compare (a) press needle acupuncture, (b) no treatment and (c) press plaster acupressure in a standardised anaesthetic setting. Seventy-five patients scheduled for laparoscopic surgery to the uterus or ovaries will be allocated randomly to one of the three trial arms. The total observation period will begin one day before surgery and end on the second postoperative day. Twelve press needles and press plasters are to be administered preoperatively at seven acupuncture points. The primary outcome measure will be time from extubation to &#x02018;ready for discharge&#x02019; from the post anaesthesia care unit (in minutes). The &#x02018;ready for discharge&#x02019; end point will be assessed using three different scores: the Aldrete score, the Post Anaesthetic Discharge Scoring System and an In-House score. Secondary outcome measures will comprise pre-, intra- and postoperative variables (which are anxiety, pain, nausea and vomiting, concomitant medication).</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The results of this study will provide information on whether acupuncture may improve patient post anaesthetic recovery.

To continue this trend it is important note that the quality and speed of post anaesthetic recovery is influenced by multiple factors such as the occurrence of pain, postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), paralytic ileus, fatigue and sleep disturbances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Hence, a multimodal approach to prevent and minimise these factors is considered to be essential in order to enhance recovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. These include a series of elements such as providing the patient with thorough preoperative information and education concerning perioperative care, the use of safe and short-acting anaesthetics and optimal dynamic pain relief with minimal use of opioids, management of PONV, enteral nutrition, early mobilization and use of minimal invasive surgery. As a result of optimised anaesthetic protocols, patients might be fully awake earlier and breathe comfortably in the operating theatre [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. As a result of a more rapid recovery, fewer patients arrive in the post anaesthesia care unit (PACU) sedated, and the period during which they are at risk for airway obstruction and hemodynamic instability is reduced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>For achieving an optimised management of postoperative pain and PONV, acupuncture may be a hitherto underestimated option. Interest in the use of acupuncture in anaesthesia leads back to 1971, when James Reston, a <italic>The New York Times</italic> columnist, introduced the western world to the ancient Chinese therapy of acupuncture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Reston underwent an emergency appendectomy in China, and described acupuncture&#x02019;s success in relieving his postoperative pain. From this point on, several scientists started investigating possible effects of acupuncture. Soon, Bruce Pomeranz revealed that an analgesic effect of acupuncture is mediated by the release of endorphins and can therefore be abolished by the administration of naloxone in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Mice deficient in opiate receptors did not experience acupuncture-mediated analgesia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], which confirms the opioid-related mechanism of acupuncture-analgesia. Soon, first articles reported on the benefits of acupuncture anaesthesia in various operative procedures in China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. As a consequence, first attempts were made to implement acupuncture in the anaesthetic framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], for example, as an option for sedation of the patient during tonsillectomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. A new modified method of anaesthesia in open heart surgery combining acupuncture analgesia and controlled respiration was established at the Department of Anaesthesiology in Gie&#x000df;en, Germany [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Since then, general anaesthesia has markedly improved and acupuncture anaesthesia cannot be considered a first-line procedure.</p><p>However, there is evidence that acupuncture is effective in facilitating multimodal approaches in perioperative care. An approved acupuncture effect is the reduction of PONV and antiemetic consumption by stimulation of the acupuncture point PC 6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Recent reviews support the effectiveness of acupuncture regimen in reducing postoperative pain, cumulative opioid consumption or opioid related side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. However, trials are of varying quality and show heterogeneity with regard to the applied acupuncture treatments (acupuncture points used, time point of application). Accordingly, a meta-analysis on the effects of acupuncture on the intraoperative analgesic consumption and quality of anaesthesia revealed inconclusive results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>We aim to investigate the effects of a three-day permanent needle acupuncture treatment, starting in the preoperative phase at seven different acupuncture points only - five of them bilaterally - on a comprehensive set of above mentioned variables important to anaesthetic recovery (which are, preoperative anxiety, improving anaesthetic protocols, awakening, nausea and vomiting, and postoperative pain).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Patients and methods</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>The study is a single-center, partially double blinded, randomised pilot trial comparing (a) press needle acupuncture versus (b) no treatment versus (c) press plaster acupressure in a standard anaesthetic setting of programmed gynaecologic laparoscopic operations. Main outcome measure is the time from extubation to &#x02018;ready for discharge&#x02019; from the PACU. Analysis of all records is performed by blinded evaluators.

According to group allocation, press needles or press plasters will be administered by an independent acupuncturist at the same defined acupuncture points.

Thereby, patients and examiners will be blinded as laid down in the trial of Myazaki and colleagues who showed that neither patients nor therapists nor examiners know if a sharp tip or a blunt knob is located below the plaster. In contrast to Myazaki, patients will be allowed to stimulate their press device, so that an additional acupressure effect may be elicited, thereby enhancing the overall effects.</p></sec><sec><title>Participating trial physicians</title><p>Participating trial physicians are employees of the Multidisciplinary Pain Centre, Department of Anaesthesiology, University of Munich, Germany.

The needles have been provided by the SEIRIN Corporation, Shizuoka City, Japan. The point regimen is based on inquiring national experts. Application of the press needles or press plaster is performed and documented by a licensed medical acupuncturist 12 to 24 hours prior to surgery. Application time is supposed to be 72 to 96 hours. Modification will be allowed, in particular less points according to the patient&#x02019;s reaction during treatment.The patient will be instructed to press the needles or plasters as often as they like, especially when they are suffering from anxiety, pain or nausea and vomiting. Patients are given an illustrated summary of the acupuncture points with the respective key symptoms, for memorization (see Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Stimulation of the press needles or press plasters has to be done at least three times a day, each time at a minimum of four different points, each for about 30 seconds. If the patient is not able to perform the daily manipulation by herself, the trial physicians are required to manipulate instead.

In case of a positive study outcome, further confirmatory studies will be needed. In addition, a standardised clinical procurement, using strictly standardised anaesthesia and standardised acupuncture regimen may impede generalizability of the findings.</p><sec><title>Acupressure as a control procedure</title><p>The investigators have chosen acupressure as a control procedure in this trial as it provides the possibility of blinding both patients and examiners. Successful patient blinding using the press needle/plaster device has been proven by Miyazaki <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Examiners will be blinded too, since they do not know if a sharp needle (acupuncture) or a blunt knob (acupressure) is located below the plaster [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>This special trial design will allow us to assess different needle-specific treatment effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]: on the one hand, using a needle tip, acupuncture will be performed by penetrating the skin causing specific physiologic effects. Those may be distinguished from similar physiologic effects caused by acupressure, on the other hand, which can also be a strong stimulus by touching and kneading the skin, but without penetration. Emotional, hormonal and affiliative responses to touch have already been assured [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. By comparing acupuncture to acupressure, this trial will provide important evidence not only about the importance of the needle stimulus of acupuncture but also about whether acupressure might also bring about a therapeutic benefit in the perioperative setting. This in particular seems to be of interest when taking into account patient populations that are at higher risk of suffering from side effects from local bleeding.</p><p>The use of press needles was also chosen for other reasons. Perioperative treatment has to be practicable, applicable, safe and scientifically approved. The practicability will be given, as press needles have only to be fixed once: for this trial after inclusion, feasible in daily routine along with the anaesthesiologic consent. The chosen acupuncture sites are not within the surgical area. Patients can easily access the needles and press them if necessary. Press plasters are water resistant and sustain up to one week. The safety of acupuncture has been described in depth, suggesting that acupuncture is free of severe side effects and being considered a safe intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Blunt rather than sharp knobs are even less traumatic. There is a small number of trials dealing with the safety of press needles; one long-term observation over one year in cancer patients suggests a ratio of 10% of minor side effects, mostly rashes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Furthermore, press needles are short (1.7 mm) and needling sites are located in a safe distance from inner organs. Thus, severe adverse events such as pneumothorax or injury of inner organs are avoided. The scientific proof was previously subject to other trials, suggesting that it is worth using acupuncture in the perioperative setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Study design</title><p>We have chosen to apply acupuncture or acupressure as interventions in a three-armed double blinded randomised controlled trial.</p><p>First, acupuncture in its philosophic meaning is not primarily supposed to &#x02018;cure&#x02019; illness - the underlying idea is that acupuncture may harmonise <italic>Qi</italic>, which is a Chinese concept of vitality or energy, and other tensions of the human body which can lead to feelings of pleasantness, and the alleviation of respective symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Several trials have shown its use different settings, for example in pain at obstetric delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], chronic pain conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], nausea and vomiting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], seasonal allergic rhinitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], dysmenorrhoea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], and so on. Hence acupuncture is known to alleviate primary symptoms.</p><p>Second, previous trials showed that single acupuncture points exist which are sensitive to alleviate specific symptoms relevant to the perioperative period, such as pericardium 6 (PC 6) in the treatment of postoperative nausea and vomiting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Other reports suggest Governing Vessel 26 (Du 26) may be successful in shock resuscitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] or the area between Large intestine 8 and 10 (LI 8 and LI 10) in acute tonsillitis and pharyngitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Acupressure at Stomach 36 (ST 36) was able to shorten the time to first flatus passage, oral liquid intake, and improve gastrointestinal function in patients after abdominal surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>Third, several trials could already demonstrate its effectiveness in reducing preoperative anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], the amount of anaesthetic medications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] or postoperative pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Most of these trials have been performed using ear acupuncture and only a minority using traditional acupuncture.</p><p>All these key facts regarding acupuncture taken together suggest that it may be a useful adjunct in the perioperative period. Thus, our aim was to develop an effective and easily applicable acupuncture regimen for the complementary support of post anaesthetic recovery. Emphasis should focus on applicability, which is to reduce the number of needling events: therefore we choose the use of press needles in this trial, providing availability of the treatment for the patients during the whole perioperative period. Regarding an effective acupuncture, we have chosen acupuncture points which are supposed to alleviate perioperative symptoms. The decision has been made on the basis of a consensus process taking historic transmission but also scientific knowledge into account.</p></sec><sec><title>Anaesthetic regimen</title><p>The choice of a strictly standardised anaesthetic regimen allows for comparability of all intra- and postoperative measures. The decision to conduct the study within the gynaecologic theatre was on the one hand due to the above mentioned uniform study population, on the other hand driven by the fact that the anaesthetic regimen in this clinic is extended for the use of TCI. TCI systems for dosage of propofol have been available since 1997, were initially developed for adult patients, with the dosage based on the basis of simulated concentration of the drug in the plasma for review: [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. In the following, taking into account the rate at which the drug enters the biophase of other tissues, that is the brain, the systems were adjusted to the concentration in the so-called effector sites. Today, the systems give the possibility to programme the dosage of various intravenous drugs according to different pharmacokinetic models, which, in brief, differ on the basis of research conducted to assess the suggested rates of infusion. The two systems mainly used are the pharmacokinetic models for propofol as established by Marsh [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] and Schnider [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. The Marsh model operates with fixed rate constants, whereas compartment volumes and clearances are weight proportional. The Schnider model was developed during combined pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modelling studies, adjusting according to total weight, lean body mass, and height. It is recommended for the use in effect-site targeting mode for review: [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].</p><p>The time course of plasma/effect-site equilibration is used to describe the rate of removal of drug from the effect-site out of the body. With effect-site targeting, the TCI system manipulates the plasma concentration to achieve the effect-site concentration as rapidly as possible. When the effect-site target concentration is increased, the TCI system briefly increases the plasma concentration to an optimal level above the target effect-site concentration before temporarily stopping the infusion to allow the plasma concentration to decrease to the level of the target effect-site concentration. If the target effect-site concentration is reduced, the system stops the infusion allowing the plasma concentrations to fall, thereby generating a concentration gradient out of the effect-site, until the estimated effect-site concentration has fallen to the new target [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].</p><p>In our believe, the use of TCI is an adequate variable to monitor and compare intraoperative drug consumption when the estimated effect site concentrations is defined <italic>a priori</italic>, and may therefore be helpful in reducing bias from individually administered anaesthetic drugs. To our knowledge, to date, there is no better system which would improve comparability of different study groups.</p><p>This study is a three-armed, partially double blinded, randomised controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of acupuncture on the post anaesthetic recovery period as assessed by the time from extubation to &#x02018;ready for discharge&#x02019; from the PACU. It can be expected to provide valuable new information on the clinical effectiveness of acupuncture improving post anaesthetic recovery parameters, which are a) preoperative anxiety relief, b) perioperative variables of anaesthesia and narcotic guidance, c) the occurrence of postoperative pain and anaesthetic side effects such as PONV or shivering. The comparison between press needle acupuncture involving a sharp needle tip and acupressure will provide important information about a) the physiologic effect of the needle stimulus compared to pressure and its impact on relieving perioperative symptoms and b) if both treatments are useful adjuncts in the routine perioperative care.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Trial status</title><p>The status of the study at the time of first manuscript submission is ongoing, and we had included 50 patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ACU: acupuncture; APU: acupressure; ASA: American Society of Anaesthesiologists; BIS: Bispectral Index; DGAI: German Society for Anaesthesiology; PACU: post anaesthesia care unit; PADSS: Post Anaesthetic Discharge Scoring System; PCA: patient controlled analgesia; PONV: postoperative nausea and vomiting; STAI: State-Trait Anxiety Inventory; TCI: Target Controlled Infusion; TCM: Traditional Chinese medicine.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>All authors declare that they have no competing interests and did not receive any honorarium from SEIRIN&#x000ae; or other partners.
