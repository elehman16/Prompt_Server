Vaginal atrophy occurs due to the loss of steroid hormones, and its major symptoms include vaginal dryness, itching, dyspareunia, and bleeding after intercourse. According to the literature, vitamin E plays a key role in estrogen stability. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of vitamin E suppositories and conjugated estrogen vaginal cream on vaginal atrophy.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>In this clinical trial, 52 postmenopausal women, who were referred to a gynecology clinic in 2013, were recruited and randomly divided into two groups (26 cases per group). One group received 100 IU of vitamin E suppositories (<italic>n</italic> = 26), whereas the other group applied 0.5 g of conjugated estrogen cream for 12 weeks. Vaginal maturation value (VMV) was compared between the two groups before and after the intervention. VMV &#x02264; 55 was regarded as a cut-off point for vaginal atrophy. Treatment success was defined as a 10-unit increase in VMV, compared to the baseline value. Data were analyzed by Friedman test and Mann-Whitney test. <italic>P</italic> value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>The mean VMV in the vitamin E group before the treatment and after 4, 8, and 12 weeks of treatment was 43.78 &#x000b1; 13.75, 69.07 &#x000b1; 22.75, 77.86 &#x000b1; 21.79, and 80.59 &#x000b1; 19.23, respectively. The corresponding values in the estrogen cream group were 42.86 &#x000b1; 14.40, 86.98 &#x000b1; 12.58, 92.65 &#x000b1; 15, and 91.57 &#x000b1; 14.10, respectively. VMV significantly improved in both the treatment groups after the intervention, compared to the preintervention period (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). Treatment success was reported in both groups, although estrogen cream (100%) appeared to be more effective after 4 weeks of treatment, compared to vitamin E suppositories (76.9%) (<italic>P</italic> = 0.01).</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Based on the findings, use of vitamin E suppositories could improve the laboratory criteria for vaginal atrophy and treatment success. Therefore, vitamin E suppositories are suggested for relieving the symptoms of vaginal atrophy, especially in women who are unable to use hormone therapy or cope with the associated side effects.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Conjugated estrogen</kwd><kwd>vitamin E</kwd><kwd>vaginal atrophy</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>I<sc>NTRODUCTION</sc></title><p>Menopause is a natural and important stage in every woman's life.

In general, menopause occurs in women either naturally or due to surgery.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>Menopause is accompanied by different problems such as hot flashes, sweating, depression, sleep disorders, sexual problems, urinary incontinence, and urogenital atrophy. The signs and symptoms of menopause seem to be universal, despite the differences in their incidence in diverse ethnic groups.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Vaginal atrophy is the second most common complaint of menopausal women after hot flashes and is regarded as a bothersome complication.

The sample size was calculated based on the comparison of mean values between the independent groups (error rate of 0.05). Finally, 30 participants were enrolled in each group through simple random sampling.</p><p>The inclusion criteria were as follows: 1) Age range of 40-65 years; 2) amenorrhea for at least 12 months; 3) a 6-week interval since bilateral oophorectomy, accompanied with or without hysterectomy (it is not normally required in menopausal women); 4) normal Pap smear results over the past 3 years; 5) symptoms of vaginal atrophy based on the patient's self-report; and 6) VMV &#x02264; 55.</p><p>On the other hand, the exclusion criteria were as follows: 1) Diagnosis of endometrial or breast cancer or any suspected cancer of the genital system; 2) abnormal vaginal bleeding; 3) conditions such as diabetes, chronic renal disease, arthritis, cardiovascular diseases, and active disease in the liver or gallbladder; 4) use of antihypertensive drugs (considering their effects on reducing vaginal lubrication); 5) vaginal infections; 6) sensitivity to estrogen compounds or vitamin E; and 7) use of hormone replacement therapy 8 weeks before the study.</p><p>Women with the symptoms of vaginal atrophy, who met the inclusion criteria, were introduced to the study. After clinical examinations of the vagina and cervix, the subjects were selected in case no symptoms of infection, wounds, abnormal injury, or discharge were detected.</p><p>Data were collected by using questionnaires.

However, no significant difference was found after 8 and 12 weeks of treatment.</p><p>Vitamin E is a fat-soluble compound,[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] which affects the urogenital system by preventing oxide/peroxide damages in cell membranes by inhibiting granula accumulation. This compound also impacts the levels of luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and testosterone.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] Raymond <italic>et al</italic>. conducted a study to investigate the effect of local conjugated estrogen cream on vaginal atrophy in menopausal women.

They showed a significant difference in VMV before and after 8 weeks of treatment.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Their findings were in agreement with the present study, which could be attributed to the evaluation of age-matched groups and similarities in the used instruments. Further, Constantino <italic>et al</italic>. determined the effectiveness and safety of vitamin E, vitamin A, and hyaluronic acid vaginal suppositories and showed a decline in vaginal dryness, itching, burning, dyspareunia, and inflammation after treatment.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</p><p>Moreover, Das <italic>et al</italic>. studied the changes in uterus and ovaries in mice with vitamin E deficiency. They found that the weight of the uterus and ovaries significantly decreased in the vitamin E deficiency group, compared to the control group.

Moreover, daily use of vitamin E (100 units) for protecting the cervix has been suggested;[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] this could in fact justify the increase in VMV in the vitamin E vaginal suppository group.</p><p>In a study by Ziaee <italic>et al</italic>. on the effects of vitamin E on hot flashes in menopausal women, the percentage of superficial cells did not significantly increase.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Also, McLoren <italic>et al</italic>. performed a study on the effect of vitamin E during menopause. In the mentioned study, vaginal smear rarely changed and no relationship was detected between VMV and symptom improvement. Moreover, the cervix was not stimulated for secretion;[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] the difference could be related to the use of various forms of drugs.</p><p>In vaginal application, some factors such as periodical changes, thickness and opening of the vaginal epithelium, viscosity, and pH of vaginal secretion influence drug absorption.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] In general, the results of this study indicated a significant difference between the two groups in terms of therapeutic response. The percentage of VMI was higher in the group receiving estrogen cream, compared to the vitamin E group.</p><p>According to the literature, estrogen therapy (applied either orally or locally) could increase both tissue collagen and tissue thickness. The major mechanism contributing to this therapeutic effect is the increased level of polysaccharides and hyaluronic acids and maintaining the functional property of vaginal epithelial cells.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Estrogen therapy is the only successful treatment for vaginal atrophy. Considering the presence of estrogen receptors in the urogenital system, the rate of treatment success was higher in the conjugated estrogen group, compared to the vitamin E group after 4 weeks of treatment in the present study. Although estrogen is mostly absorbed locally, some parts are absorbed systemically and stimulate the growth of endometrium.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>Vaginal conditions, hemorrhage, irregular menstrual period, dysmenorrhea, amenorrhea, increased risk of breast and endometrial cancers, cervical sensitivity, cervical discharge, and growth of uterine fibroids are complications associated with conjugated estrogen.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] In conclusion, because the administration of estrogen is the only effective treatment for vaginal atrophy and vitamin E is a nonhormonal treatment, VMV was expected to be lower in the vitamin E group compared to the hormone therapy group.
