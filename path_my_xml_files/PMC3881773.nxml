bacteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref></sup>. Although a multitude
of factors seem to be involved in this process, the most important factors are dietary
acids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref></sup> and intrinsic acids from the stomach<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r03">3</xref></sup>. Currently, the increased consumption of
acidic foods and soft drinks is becoming an important factor for the development of
erosive wear<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref></sup>. Thus, one preventive approach might be the reduction of
the erosive potential of acidic beverages by ions supplementation.</p><p>The addition of calcium, fluoride and phosphate has been shown to reduce the erosive
potential of pure acids and acidic drinks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r01">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r02">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref></sup>. <italic>In situ</italic> studies have shown that
ferrous sulfate reduces the demineralization of enamel in situations of high cariogenic
challenge<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref></sup>. The possibility that ferrous sulfate could be also used
to reduce erosive challenges was arisen based on studies using abiotic models, which
showed that ferrous sulfate was effective on inhibition of hidroxyapatite<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r04">4</xref></sup> and enamel powder<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r05">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref></sup>
dissolution. This prompted to an <italic>in situ </italic>study which was able to show
that a 10 mmol/L ferrous sulfate rinse after an erosive attack followed or not by an
abrasive episode, was able to significantly reduce the wear of dentin blocks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref></sup>. From the practical point of view,
however, it would be much easier if the soft drink were supplemented with ferrous
sulfate, instead of rinsing with a ferrous sulfate solution after the consumption of a
soft drink.</p><p>In this sense, it was conducted an <italic>in vitro </italic>study which demonstrated
that the supplementation of a cola drink with ferrous sulfate at 10 mmol/L was able to
reduce the wear of enamel blocks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref></sup>. In
the present study, an <italic>in situ</italic> model, which closely resembles the
clinical situation, was chosen to investigate the effect of ferrous sulfate
supplementation on the inhibition of the erosion of enamel and dentin blocks caused by a
cola drink.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIAL AND METHODS</title><p>This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Bauru School of Dentistry,
University of S&#x000e3;o Paulo, Brazil (Process 130/2004). Ten adult volunteers (two male and
eight female) with age range between 24 and 31 years old and normal stimulated salivary
flow rate (&#x0003e;1 mL/min) took part in the study after signing an informed, written
consent. The volunteers were not smokers, did not have active carious lesions, did not
receive topical application of agents with high fluoride concentration at least two
weeks prior to the beginning of the study, and did not have systemic diseases, such as
xerostomia or gastroesophageal disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref></sup>. Sample size was calculated based on a pilot study in order to
provide an &#x003b1;-error of 5% and a power of 80%.</p><sec><title>Experimental design</title><p>This study used a randomized design, performed in two crossover phases of five days.
The factors under evaluation were experimental condition in two levels
(Coca-Cola<sup>TM</sup> without ferrous sulfate - control; and
Coca-Cola<sup>TM</sup> supplemented with ferrous sulfate at 10 mmol/L) and dental
substrate in two levels (enamel and dentin). The volunteers wore acrylic palatal
appliances each containing 2 dental slabs of each substrate. A new appliance was
constructed for the volunteers in each phase. The response variable was depth of
surface wear (&#x000b5;m).</p></sec><sec><title>Specimen preparation</title><p>Enamel and dentin slabs (4x4 mm) were obtained from recently extracted, caries free,
unerupted human third permanent molars. All tooth surfaces were used for preparation
of the specimens (crown and root for enamel and dentin, respectively). The enamel
surface of the slabs was ground flat with water-cooled 320-, 600- and 1200-grit
Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> papers (Buehler, Lake Bluff, IL, USA) and polished
with 1 &#x000b5;m diamond spray (Buehler). The same procedure was used for dentin surfaces,
except for 320-grit Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> papers. The complete removal of
cementum was checked microscopically (40x magnification). For allocation of the
samples to the groups, surface microhardness was determined by performing five
indentations in different regions of the samples (Knoop diamond, 50 g, 10 s for
enamel and 25 g, 5 s for dentin, HMV-2000; Shimadzu Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). The
overall range of microhardness was 350-407 KNH for enamel and 59-71 KHN for dentin to
select 40 enamel and 40 dentin specimens. Specimens were allocated to treatments by
stratified randomization according to the mean surface microhardness. All groups
presented similar mean microhardness values (around 388 KHN and 65 KHN, for enamel
and dentin, respectively).</p></sec><sec><title>Palatal device preparation</title><p>Custom-made acrylic palatal devices were made with four sites (6x6x3 mm) recessed
into the polished surface of each appliance. One slab was randomly assigned to each
of the four sites and fixed with wax, totaling two enamel and two slabs. The position
of each slab in the device was randomly determined for each volunteer. In order to
maintain reference surfaces for lesion depth determination, two layers of nail polish
(Risqu&#x000e9;, Niasi, Tabo&#x000e3;o da Serra, SP, Brazil) were applied on the surfaces of half of
the specimens. To minimize the contact between the tongue and the specimens, these
were positioned posterior to the incisive papilla.</p></sec><sec><title>Intraoral phase</title><p>A 1-week lead-in period was used. During this period, and throughout the experimental
phase, the volunteers brushed their teeth with a fluoride-free dentifrice. In this
crossover protocol, the volunteers were randomly allocated to the treatments and
participated in two phases. In the first 12 h of each intraoral phase, specimens were
not subjected to erosive treatment to allow the formation of a salivary
pellicle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref></sup>. On the following
5 days, erosive challenges were made extraorally 4 times a day after the mean meals
and before sleeping. In each challenge, the volunteers were instructed to remove the
appliance and immerse it in a cup containing 150 mL of regular Coca-Cola<sup>TM</sup>
(pH 2.6, Cia de Bebidas Ipiranga, Ribeir&#x000e3;o Preto, SP, Brazil)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref></sup>, containing or not ferrous sulfate at 10 mmol/L (as
FeSO<sub>4</sub>.7H<sub>2</sub>0, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), depending on the
phase. For supplementation of Coca-Cola<sup>TM</sup> with ferrous sulfate, the salt
was added to a 600 mL bottle of freshly opened regular Coca-Cola<sup>TM</sup> once
<italic>per </italic>day, just before the first challenge. After each challenge,
the volunteers were instructed to take one sip of the beverage and to immediately
return the appliance into the mouth. This was done to simulate the clinical condition
of pH drop after consumption of acidic beverages. In addition, it is also probable
that the low pH of the drink induces the activation of dentin-derived matrix
metalloproteinases (MMPs) and saliva-derived MMPs, when the volunteers drink one sip
of the beverage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref></sup>.</p><p>The volunteers were instructed not to consume acidic foods and to wear the appliances
continuously for 24 h but to remove them during meals (4 times a day, 1 h each). In
this period, the appliance was stored in wet gauze. They were also instructed to not
touch the appliance with the tongue in order to avoid abrasion of the
samples<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r09">9</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec><title>Wear analysis</title><p>At the end of day 6, the volunteers stopped wearing the palatal devices. The nail
polish over the reference surfaces was carefully removed and the slabs were removed
from the device. The dentin specimens were maintained wet until the analysis to avoid
shrinkage of collagen fibrils. The enamel and dentin wear was determined in relation
to the reference surfaces by profilometry using a profilometer (Hommel Tester T 1000,
Hommelwerke, VS, Schwenningen, Germany). Five readings were performed on each slab
and the average wear depth was calculated. These profilometric traces were taken from
the reference surface, across the exposed surface. The average wear depth of an
experimental unit was computed by using the 10 readings: two slabs X five
readings.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>GraphPad InStat software version 3.0 for Windows (Graph Pad Software Inc., San Diego,
CA, USA) was used. The assumptions of equality of variances and normal distribution
of errors were checked, using Bartlett and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests, respectively.
Since the assumptions were satisfied, data were analyzed by paired <italic>t</italic>
tests. The significance level was set at 5%.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure 1</xref> shows the mean wear of enamel (A) and
dentin (B) blocks submitted to erosive challenge by Coca-Cola<sup>TM</sup> or

of Coca-Cola<sup>TM</sup> with ferrous sulfate (10 mmol/L) led to a mean wear (&#x000b1;s.e.) of
2.8&#x000b1;0.6 &#x000b5;m, which was significantly lesser (t=2.327, p=0.045) than the one observed for

significantly lesser (t=3.465, p=0.00071) than the one observed for the control group
(4.8&#x000b1;0.8 &#x000b5;m). The <italic>post hoc</italic> calculated statistical power was 84% for

Coca-Cola<sup>TM</sup> with ferrous sulfate at 10 mmol/L significantly reduced the
wear of both enamel and dentin. These findings confirm data obtained <italic>in
vitro</italic> for enamel powder<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r05">5</xref></sup>
and enamel blocks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref></sup>. The wear was
reduced by approximately 2-fold in enamel and 3-fold in dentin. The higher protective
effect of ferrous sulfate on dentin when compared with enamel is consistent with a
previous report<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref></sup>, which evaluated the
effect of a rinse with a solution containing ferrous sulfate at 10 mmol/L on the
reduction of wear of enamel and dentin blocks <italic>in situ</italic>. This difference
may be due to the different composition of enamel and dentin, which may interfere on the
erosive process. In enamel, the initial stage of erosion is characterized by a softening
of the surface due in part to the demineralization of the surface. At this stage of the
process, repair (remineralization) is in theory still possible as the remaining tissue
could act as a scaffold. In a second, more advanced stage, repair is not possible, while
the remaining softened enamel beneath the lost hard tissue is remineralizable<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref></sup>. The mechanisms underlying the
protective effect of ferrous sulfate against enamel erosion are not fully understood. It
has been hypothesized that ferrous sulfate may react with phosphate dissolved from
enamel after the erosive challenge. This ferric phosphate may precipitate on the enamel
surface, thus reducing the surface microhardness values<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref></sup>, which was also observed in the present study (data not
shown). The analysis of the type of compound formed on the surface of dental enamel when
ferrous sulfate is used may be useful to provide new insights into its mechanisms of
action on dental enamel.</p><p>Differently from enamel, erosion in dentin is first apparent at the interface between
inter- and peritubular dentin, and - with increasing exposure time - results in a
hollowing and funneling of the tubules. Finally, the peritubular dentin is completely
dissolved. The innermost sound dentin is then followed by a zone of partly demineralized
dentin until a layer of completely demineralized collagen amounting up to one third of
the total etching depth is reached<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref></sup>. This causes the exposure of a
completely demineralized surface layer containing only organic matrix<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r07">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref></sup>. Dentin contains 18-20% of organic
material and 90% is type I collagen. The presence of a collagen-rich dentin surface
diminishes the diffusion of acids into the tissue and also exhibits buffering
properties, thus minimizing dental erosion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r08">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref></sup>. However, this
organic matrix can be mechanically or chemically degraded, which will facilitate
subsequent demineralization. The chemical degradation of the organic matrix occurs by
the action of MMPs from dentin and saliva<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r06">6</xref></sup>. As a result, the disruption of this collagen layer will increase the
progression of dentin erosion. As it has been shown that some metallic ions can inhibit
the activity of MMPs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref></sup>, it could be
hypothesized that ferrous sulfate added to the soft drink and/or deposited on dentin
(probably as ferric phosphate, as described above for enamel) would inhibit MMPs from
dentin and saliva, since ferrous sulfate has been shown to have this ability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref></sup>. This would slow the rate of erosion
progression by the stabilization of the collagen layer. Details regarding the role of
iron on the reduction of erosive wear in dentin have been published elsewhere<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref></sup>. However, this was not evaluated in the
present protocol and should be confirmed in further experiments. If this hypothesis is
confirmed, the collagen diffusion barrier might have been responsible for the lower wear
found in dentin compared with enamel in the present study.</p><p>In summary, the results of the present <italic>in situ</italic> study, which closely
resembles the clinical situation, confirm previous <italic>in vitro</italic> findings
that the addition of 10 mmol/L ferrous sulfate to Coca-Cola<sup>TM</sup> can reduce its
erosive potential on enamel. In addition, it was also found an even higher inhibition of
dentin wear when compared with enamel. In the present study, drawbacks for the
volunteers, such as tooth staining, were not observed, since the contact of the
supplemented beverage with their teeth was very brief. However, this side effect could
be expected to occur following consumption of the supplemented beverage for a long time.
Other possible adverse effects, such as modification of the taste of the beverage and
toxicity, must be taken into account when beverages are intended to be supplemented with
this ion. The World Health Organization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref></sup> has calculated a Provisional Maximum Tolerable Daily Intake (PMDTI)
of 56 mg/day (0.8 mg/kg/day), although lower levels have been defined in some countries.
Considering a beverage containing 10 mmol/L ferrous sulfate, the maximum volume to be
consumed daily would be around 200 mL only. Thus, it would be interesting to test if
lower ferrous sulfate concentrations would also be effective as well as the combination
of lower ferrous sulfate concentrations with other ions such as, calcium, phosphate and
fluoride, which have also been shown to have promising effects on enamel dissolution.
Additionally, since ferrous sulfate has been shown to reduce enamel and dentin wear
under acidic conditions, but toxicological issues may be a limitation to its addition to
soft drinks, the incorporation of ferrous sulfate to professionally applied dental
products could be a good alternative to take advantage of its beneficial properties on
dental mineral loss.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The supplementation of cola drinks with ferrous sulfate can be a good alternative for
