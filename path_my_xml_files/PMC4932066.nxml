muscles would improve slow vital capacity (SVC). [Subjects and Methods] The subjects of
this study were 20 healthy female students to whom the study&#x02019;s methods and purpose were
explained and their agreement for participation was obtained. The SVC was measured using
spirometry (Pony FX, COSMED Inc., Italy). The intervention used was stretching of the
scalene muscles. Stretching was carried out for 15&#x02005;min, 10 times at per each portion of
scalene muscles: the anterior, middle, and posterior parts. [Results] Expiratory vital
capacity (EVC) and tidal volume (Vt) noticeably increased after stretching. However, there
were no changes in any of the SVC items in the control group. [Conclusion] This study
demonstrated that stretching of the scalene muscles can effectively improve SVC. In
particular, we confirmed that stretching of the scalene muscles was effective in
increasing EVC and Vt, which are items of SVC.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Slow vital capacity</kwd><kwd>Stretching</kwd><kwd>Scalene muscle</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The energy required for the cell survival is produced through the energy metabolism
process, during which oxygen and nutrients react. Therefore, the lungs that supply oxygen
are important for maintaining and improving health<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, lungs movement is dependent on that of surrounding
structures. In particular, movement of the thorax causes movement of the pulmonary function
because the lungs are attached to the thorax. When the thorax expands, the intrapulmonary
pressure becomes lower than the atmospheric pressure, leading to inhalation; when the thorax
contracted, the intrapulmonary pressure becomes higher than the atmospheric pressure,
leading to exhalation<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Contraction of the
diaphragm has the greatest effect on the reduction of intrapulmonary pressure, but the
expansion and contraction of the thorax also influence pulmonary function. Therefore, to
enhance pulmonary function, functions of the major respiratory muscles that directly expand
the thorax and the respiratory support muscles that help thoracic expansion by lifting the
thorax need to be improved. Major respiratory muscles include the diaphragm, intercostal
muscles, and abdominal muscles<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup> that are
involved in resting respiration<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Respiratory support muscles include the sternocleidomastoid (SCM), scalene, trapezius,
pectoralis major, pectoralis minor, and anterior serratus<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>, which are involved in deep, forced breathing<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, if neck muscles are not easily controllable or
the joint range of motion is limited, not only the neck movement but also the thoracic
movement become limited, which weaken respiratory function<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. In relation to this, Legrand et al.<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup> conducted an experiment on dogs and verified that the movement of
SCM and scalene, which are respiratory support muscles, lowered intrapulmonary pressure. In
particular, they reported that the movement of the scalene had greater action compared to
SCM. The SCM appears to have greater effect on thoracic movement because it is attached to
the clavicle and sternum, whereas the scalene muscles are attached to the first and second
ribs<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. In agreement with this, Han et
al.<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup> also reported that stretching
exercises for the neck muscles partially improve pulmonary function. Furthermore, Han et
al.<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup> reported improved pulmonary
function as a result of stretching exercise of the SCM and scalene and strengthening
exercise for the neck muscles in patients with allergic rhinitis. Likewise, Cho et al.<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> also reported improved pulmonary function
with neck muscle stretching and cervical joint motion exercises in stroke patients implanted
with a tracheotomy tube. However, as reported in the study by De Troyer and Kelly<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>, the SCM and scalene are not involved in
resting respiration; on the other hand, Legrand et al.<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that the scalene muscles could be involved in resting
respiration. The scalene muscles consist of the anterior, middle, and posterior muscles. The
anterior scalene is attached to the two-third of the medial point of the first rib and the
middle scalene is attached to the superior surface of the first rib. Thus, the anterior and
middle scalene muscles lift the first rib. The posterior scalene is attached to the dorsal
surface of the second rib; thus, it lifts the second rib<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, if the length of the scalene becomes shorter, the extent
of the lift of the thorax becomes smaller during inhalation, which can decrease the extent
of reduction of intrapulmonary pressure, thereby decreasing inhalation volume. Furthermore,
during exhalation, the lowering of the thorax can be hindered, which decreases the extent of
exhalation, thereby reducing the total ventilation volume. Nevertheless, studies
investigating the correlation between the scalene muscles and pulmonary function are very
rare. In particular, no study has been conducted on the correlation between scalene muscles
and resting vital capacity. Therefore, in this study, the possibility that the relaxation of
the scalene muscles can improve slow vital capacity (SVC) was investigated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects of this study were 20 female students in their 20s who were attending &#x02018;S&#x02019;
University in Busan. None of them had a past medical history of diseases of the nervous
system, musculoskeletal system, or cardiovascular system that could have affected the
results of this experiment. The subjects were randomized into an experimental group of 10
subjects and a control group of 10 subjects who received no treatment. All subjects were
informed of the purpose and methods of the study beforehand and voluntarily agreed to
participate. This study complied with the ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki,
and written informed consent was obtained from all subjects.</p><p>Before applying stretching exercise to the scalene muscles, SVC of every subject was
measured using a digital spirometer (Pony FX, COSMED Inc., Italy) with subjects sitting
upright on a chair. They were instructed to straighten their waist and shoulder, spread
their feet at shoulder width, and at right angle to the ground. Then, they were instructed
to block their nose with a nose clamp and slightly bite into a mouth piece of the measuring
instrument. When ready, they were instructed to inhale slowly to the maximum when the start
message appeared on the monitor while breathing as usual and then exhale slowly to the
maximum, and to breathe as usual. Three measurements were taken, and the average values were
used for analysis.</p><p>After pulmonary function was measured, stretching exercises for the scalene were performed,
in the order of the middle, anterior, and posterior scalene. While manual stretching
exercises of the middle scalene, in the starting position, subjects were instructed to bend
their neck laterally in the opposite direction. Then, the practitioner standing behind the
subject pressed the shoulder with one hand while touching one side of the head and applied a
lateral load with the other hand. For the manual stretching exercise of the anterior
scalene, in the same position, the subject was instructed to bend the neck laterally in the
opposite direction, direct the eyes upwards, and slightly bend the neck posteriorly. In this
position, the practitioner standing behind the subject pressed the shoulder with one hand
while touching one side of the head and applied a load with the other hand laterally and
posteriorly. For manual stretching exercises of the posterior scalene, in the starting
position, the subject was instructed to bend the neck forward and then laterally in the
opposite side, and to look to the side and downward. The practitioner standing behind the
subject pressed and fixed the shoulder with one hand while touching one side of the head and
applied a lateral load with the other hand. For this manual stretching exercise, a
hold-relax technique that involved holding for 6&#x02005;s, followed by relaxing for 4&#x02005;s was
applied, for a total of 10 times. When one exercise was completed, a 5-s resting time was
given. The total duration of manual stretching exercise was about 15&#x02005;min. In the
experimental group, the SVC was measured again after scalene muscle stretching. In the
control group, the SVC was measured again after resting in the sitting position on a chair
for 15&#x02005;min, without treatment.</p><p>The data were analyzed using the IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows (ver. 21.0), and the
significance level was set as &#x003b1;=0.05. First, a test of normality was performed with the
Shapiro-Wilk test. As the normality condition was satisfied, parametric statistical analysis
was performed in this study. To examine homogeneity between the experimental and control
groups before the experiment, an independent t-test was performed. Then, a paired t-test was
performed to examine changes in SVC between the experimental and control groups.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Differences in the general characteristics and SVCs of the experimental and control groups

relaxation of the diaphragm<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, the
roles of respiratory support muscles that lift the thorax can also influence ventilation
volume. De Troyer and Kelly<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>
electrically stimulated the respiratory support muscles originating from the neck of dogs,
examined changes of the thorax and found that the volume of the thorax increased. Muza et
al.<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup> also verified that lung volume
increases when electric stimuli are applied to the SCM of dogs. These results clearly show
that the SCM and scalene which are respiratory support muscles are involved in pulmonary
function. In relation to this, Wilson and De Troyer<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup> assumed that the muscles
involved in the respiratory system could be involved in the expansion of the chest wall. In
particular, because the contracting power of the muscles involved in inhalation is the
driving force behind the opening of the respiratory tract, muscle mass, the maximal active
muscle tension per unit cross-sectional area, and fractional changes in muscle length per
unit volume increase of the relaxed chest wall influence the expansion of the respiratory
tract<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. In other words, if the
inspiratory main and support muscles have many muscular fibers, a large muscular contraction
force per unit area, and a large change in muscle length per unit time, the pressure
expanding the respiratory tract and the inhalation volume increase. Therefore, if the SCM
and scalene have a large volume, a large muscular contraction force per unit area, and a
large change in muscle length per unit time, the thorax is lifted to a greater extent and
the inhalation volume increases. In this regard, Han et al.<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup> also noted that forward head posture could reduce vital capacity,
possibly because of weakness of the accessory respiratory muscles. This means that
respiratory function is related to the functions of the SCM and scalene muscle. To verify
this, Legrand et al.<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup> examined changes in
the length of the SCM and scalene while manually injecting external air into dogs to expand
their lungs. As a result, they found that the SCM and scalene both became short, and the
scalene in particular became shorter. Furthermore, when muscular contraction was induced by
stimulating the two muscles, the rib cage significantly moved toward the head and the
alveolar pressure decreased. Consequently, the more the lengths of the SCM and scalene
changed per unit volume, the more the alveolar pressure lowered. This result experimentally
confirmed that the ventilation volume through thoracic expansion increases when the SCM and
scalene maintain reasonable lengths and the contraction and relaxation are normal. In line
with this, the results of the present study show that the Vt and EVC increased in the SVC.
An increase in Vt means that inspiratory and expiratory volumes increase. The Vt increased
because the stretching of the scalene increased its length, which increased changes in the
contracting muscle length per unit time and accelerated the lifting of the thorax, and the
intrathoracic pressure became lower as a result. Likewise, the EVC increased because the
scalene was relaxed and the descent of the thorax during exhalation became larger, further
increasing intrathoracic pressure. In addition, Han et al.<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup> also mentioned that forward head posture could reduce vital
capacity, possibly because of weakness of the accessory respiratory muscles.</p><p>The results of this study verified that stretching of the scalene improves Vt and EVC, and
this has positive effects on increased SVC. Hence, stretching of the scalene should be
included in the programs for improvement of respiratory functions.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by the Brain Busan 21 project.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="ths"><person-group><name><surname>Jung</surname><given-names>WG</given-names></name></person-group>: The effect of rope-skipping on the health-related physical fitness and
