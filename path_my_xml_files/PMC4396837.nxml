Evidence shows that childhood and adolescent obesity are significantly associated with the presence and clustering of cardiovascular risk factors in childhood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Other childhood clinical consequences include asthma, Type 1 diabetes, low-grade systemic inflammation, sleep apnea, and musculoskeletal disorders, particularly of the lower limbs and feet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Childhood obesity is also associated with a range of functional problems, including pain, discomfort and joint stiffness (particularly in the lower extremities), lower muscular strength, and postural deformities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>Childhood is the most important stage in growth and development. Being overweight or obese during this period can influence movement ability and postural control capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Several studies reported the difficulties encountered by overweight and obese people when executing simple activities in daily living, particularly during weight-bearing tasks such as walking and climbing stairs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. These results suggest a possible link between movement efficiency in the gait cycle and decreased postural stability of obese children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Several studies on the postural control of obese children published evidence of alterations in their postural control ability. These studies focused on the postural stability in obese children when walking or standing in different postures. Obese children displayed a longer cycle duration, lower cadence, lower velocity, and longer stance period than normal-weight subjects during walking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Obese boys spent a significantly larger percentage of time in the double-support and stance phase than their non-obese counterparts during walking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Furthermore, Deforche and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] found that obese boys had slower weight transfer, lower rising index, and larger sway velocity in a sit-to-stand test than non-obese boys. The characteristics of the gait pattern indicate a decrease in dynamic postural stability in obese children. The static postural stability in obese children also decreased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Previous studies show that static postural stability is lower in obese children than in normal-weight children. McGraw <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] examined the sway of center of pressure during standing in obese boys in different vision conditions (that is, full vision, dark, and visual conflict). They found that the maximum displacement of center of pressure and the root mean square of center of pressure displacement in the anterior-posterior and medial-lateral directions tended to be larger for obese boys than for non-obese boys across all conditions. The difference in the measurements in the medial-lateral direction between obese and normal-weight children was most significant. Furthermore, a recent study suggests that obese and normal-weight children use different postural strategies to maintain balance, the consequences of which should be further clarified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>Obese children perform poorly in static and dynamic postural control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The larger body size, larger body mass index, abnormal body fat distribution, and potential neuromuscular disadvantage of obese children can contribute to their postural instability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Several studies of obese children provided evidence of this association between body weight or body shape and postural stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Furthermore, postural control is related to the function of vision, vestibular, proprioception, and neuromuscular control. Several studies previously demonstrated that information from some sensory receptors on obese individuals could be associated with postural instability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. McGraw <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] found that visual conflict induced a more significant alternation of static postural performance in obese children than in their normal-weight counterparts. Several researchers reported a reduction in the sensitivity of plantar mechanoreceptors in obese feet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. This alteration might contribute to the postural instability in the obese group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Obese children show a deficit in proprioception in knee flexion. Such alterations in their proprioception might be associated with decreased postural control in obese children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Moreover, obese children have less relative strength during isokinetic testing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]; the majority of deficits are evident where strength is a major prerequisite of functional movement tasks. Specifically, obese children typically perform poorly in measures of muscular strength that require moving the body against gravity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Abdominal strength and endurance, functional knee strength, and lower extremity strength, power, and endurance are all low in this population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>Weight reduction for obese children is associated with decreased body mass index and body fat, increased physical fitness, and improved movement skills [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Previous studies found that weight loss in obese adults could improve their postural stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Obese children have worse postural stability and neuromuscular control than normal-weight children. However, only a few studies have examined the influence of weight reduction on postural balance among obese children. Recently, Steinberg <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] found that a weight management program could improve static stability and lower potential falling probability of obese participants. However, it is not known whether weight loss interventions influence performance associated with dynamic postural instability and neuromuscular function in obese children.</p><p>Maintaining a stable posture is essential for many daily activities and injury prevention. The poor postural stability of obese children might lead to a higher risk of falling and fractures compared with that of normal-weight children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In addition, childhood is the most important stage of human growth and development. If weight loss increases postural stability and neuromuscular control at this stage, it will benefit daily activities and help to prevent injuries. Therefore, this study attempts to investigate the effect of a 6 month weight management program on postural stability and neuromuscular control among obese children.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>The study design is a single-blind randomized controlled trial that will compare a weight management program with health education.

The postural instability associated with obesity usually results in altered biomechanics strategies designed to improve the person&#x02019;s sense of balance during locomotion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Therefore, three-dimensional motion analysis will be used to measure kinematics and kinetics data, as well as to evaluate dynamic postural stability during different tasks.</p><p>Kinematics and kinetics data will be collected and analyzed using a Vicon Motion Analysis System (Vicon MX-13, Oxford Metrics, UK) with nine infrared cameras that record three-dimensional motion at 200 Hz and coupled with force plates (models 9286AA, Kistler Instruments Corp, Swaziland) that record ground reaction force at 1,000 Hz. The trajectories of 45 retro-reflective markers (14 mm in diameter) will be captured at different landmarks of the subject according to a Plug-in-Gait marker set.</p><p>These biomechanical data will be collected while each participant performs three tasks:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Level walking at normal speed, faster speed, and slow speed</p><p>Normal cadence is the subject&#x02019;s preferred speed.

The center of pressure data will be collected from a force platform (9286AA, Kistler Instruments Corp, Switzerland) using BroWare data collection and analysis software with a sampling frequency of 1,000 Hz in a computer workstation. The subjects will be asked to stand as still and as quietly as possible with arms akimbo and barefoot to eliminate the effects of shoes, socks, and heel height. The required standing time is 30 s. If the participant loses balance in the period (steps to regain balance), he or she will be asked to repeat the test up to a maximum of three times. A 3 min rest will be allowed between two tests. The center of pressure displacement in the medial-lateral and anterior-posterior directions will be used to analyze postural stability.</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="FPar6"><title>Proprioception test of knee and ankle</title><p>This measurement method was reported in our previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Knee and ankle proprioception will be tested using an electrically driven movable frame. During the tests, the participant will sit on a chair with the dominant leg supported by the frame. The leg can be passively moved in a flexed or extended direction at a velocity of 0.4&#x000b0;/s. Once the participant is able to detect the leg motion, he or she will press a handheld stop button and confirm the direction of the motion. The rotation angles of the frame will be determined as the threshold for the detection of the knee and ankle joint.

A customized trapdoor with an 18&#x000b0; tilt angle will be used to generate an ankle inversion perturbation while subjects stand barefoot on the trap doors. The Noraxon EMG system (Noraxon USA Inc., Scottsdale, USA) will be used to collect surface EMG signals from five muscles (rectus femoris, semitendinosus, gastrocnemius, peroneus longus, and anterior tibialis) of the right leg and onset signals at the trapdoor tilting with a sampling frequency of 1,000 Hz. Both feet will be randomly tilted at least seven times to decrease anticipatory effects. The onset latency of the muscles refers to the time interval in milliseconds (ms) between the trapdoor initiation and the first rising front of the EMG burst from the baseline. The EMG onset will be visually determined by an experienced researcher.</p><p>Furthermore, muscle activation will be determined during level walking and stair climbing. The EMG data will be collected from eight lower extremity muscles according to the recommended muscles for gait analysis from Winter and Yack [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]; these muscles are the ipsilateral and contralateral erector spinae at the level of the iliac crest, rectus femoris, vastus medialis, vastus medialis, tibialis anterior, biceps femoris, peroneus longus, and gastrocnemius. The Noraxon EMG system (Noraxon USA Inc., Scottsdale, USA) will be used to collect surface EMG signals from these muscles of the right leg with a sampling frequency of 1,000 Hz. The EMG signals from five complete gait cycles per task will be used in data reduction. Prior to the EMG data collection, maximal isometric contraction data will be gathered for each muscle. The mean EMG amplitude and on-off muscle timing during a gait cycle will be used in the data analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="FPar8"><title>Muscle strength test of knee and ankle</title><p>Muscle strength of the dominant knee and ankle joint will be tested using an isokinetic dynamometer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Participants will perform three maximum concentric contractions for the knee extensors and flexors at an angular velocity of 60&#x000b0;/s. The highest peak torque that indicates muscle strength will be normalized by kilogram of body weight. The dynamic endurance of the knee extensors and flexors will be assessed by measuring 40 repeated maximum isokinetic contractions at an angular velocity of 180&#x000b0;/s. The work in moving from a knee angle of 80&#x000b0; to a knee angle of 10&#x000b0; will be recorded for each contraction. The endurance index is defined as the ratio of the work performed during the last five contractions over the first five contractions. Ankle dorsiflexor and plantarflexor strength will be measured at an angular velocity of 60&#x000b0;/s. Participants will be instructed to push a foot away from themselves and then pull it toward themselves at the maximum velocity for each action. Peak torque will be determined as the highest torque generated from the three trials. Relative peak torque will also be analyzed (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>

Chicago, IL). Data will be presented as the mean and standard deviation in which the distribution of variables is normal.

A linear mixed model, which includes time (as a repeated factor), group, their interaction, and Bonferroni correction for <italic>post-hoc</italic> multiple comparisons, will be used to determine whether a significant time by group effect exists at the baseline, and after 6 months and 12 months.

Previous studies found that physical exercise and a nutritional guidance program have beneficial effects on the anthropometric parameters and cardiovascular risk factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Furthermore, weight reduction in obese children is associated with increased physical fitness and improved movement skills [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. As previously mentioned, maintaining a stable posture is essential for many daily activities and injury prevention. Obese children have poorer postural stability than their normal-weight counterparts, and consequently experience greater difficulty in daily physical activities, leading to a higher risk of falling and fractures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. However, only a few studies have examined the effect of weight management interventions on postural stability and discussed the possible reasons for this in obese children. Postural stability and control are related to the functions of vision, vestibular, proprioception, and neuromuscular control. The larger body size, body mass, abnormal body fat distribution, and potential neuromuscular disadvantage of obese children during this period can contribute to postural instability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Previous studies have found that several sensory receptors in obese individuals could be associated with postural instability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Findings from a recent study show that a 6 month weight loss program for obese children is associated with improved postural stability and decreased potential vestibular stress or disturbances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Moreover, findings from obese adults show that a weight loss program improves static postural stability; the decrease in plantar contact area enables mechanoreceptors to better detect postural oscillations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. As previously mentioned, postural instability in the obese population may be related to larger anthropometric parameters, abnormal body fat distribution, and poor neuromuscular control. To our knowledge, no study has investigated the effects of a weight management program on neuromuscular function among obese children. Therefore, the findings of this study will fill the research gap in question. Furthermore, the possible mechanism of postural instability in obese children may be discussed.</p><p>The strengths of our protocol are as follows: (1) the use of combined physical activity and nutritional intervention in postural stability and neuromuscular function among obese children, which has not been previously described in this population; (2) the relatively long study duration, with an intervention period of 6 months and a follow-up period (with no active intervention) of 6 months, for a total study period of 12 months; (3) extensive follow-up to monitor the effects of the combined physical activity and nutritional intervention on postural stability and neuromuscular function among obese children; (4) evaluation of dynamic and static postural stability using fully three-dimensional biomechanical analysis to determine dynamic postural stability and provide a quantitative analysis of the intervention effect; (5) measurement of the neuromuscular function to provide advanced findings to explain the possible mechanisms of postural instability in obese children; and (6) a comprehensive dissemination plan to ensure the adequate uptake of knowledge generated in this study. However, this study also has several limitations. First, recruitment is limited to prepubescent obese children, and thus the study results may only be valid for prepubescent obese children. The use of a larger sample size will also address the current study&#x02019;s limitation of relying on a relatively small study population and the fact that it is not a multicenter trial. Moreover, we will not compare the efficacy of the weight loss program with that of other weight loss programs because of the limited subject number.</p><p>In conclusion, this study attempts to estimate the effect of weight loss intervention on outcomes, including daily life function, postural stability, and neuromuscular control in prepubescent obese children. The study results may provide evidence to support the beneficial effects of a weight loss management program on postural stability and neuromuscular control, potential vestibular stress or disturbances, and a falling probability of obese children. Further comprehensive research on the weight management program for obese population will be proposed on the basis of the proposed project.</p><sec id="Sec18"><title>Trial status</title><p>Participant recruitment.</p></sec></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviation</title><def-list><def-item><term>EMG</term><def><p>Electromyography</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p>Fenghua Sun and Li-Juan Wang contributed equally to this work.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>LW and FS contributed to the conception and design of the trial, and drafting the manuscript.
