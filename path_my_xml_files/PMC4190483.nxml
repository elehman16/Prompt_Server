Opioid related side effects are dose dependent, and efforts to minimize opioid consumption through peripheral nerve blockade, epidural anesthesia, local anesthetics, and non-opioid medications have been effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Ideally, following THA, analgesic related side effects are minimized to allow early mobilization and recovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>Epidural and peripheral nerve blockade have been used as methods to decrease post operative opiate consumption following THA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Epidural anesthesia is an effective method of pain control. However, muscular blockade can reduce a patient&#x02019;s ability to participate in physical therapy, and the need for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis puts patients at risk for epidural hematoma. Lumbar plexus and femoral nerve blocks have been used as a single shot and continuous infusion for postoperative analgesia following THA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Continuous lumbar plexus blocks have been shown to be effective in reducing pain scores, opioid consumption, and side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. However, trained personal, operating room delays, and post-operative motor weakness have been barriers to routine lumbar plexus block use. The use of a catheter and potential need for monitoring are also barriers to outpatient THA.</p><p>The use of local anesthetics and local infiltration analgesia has been used following THA with mixed results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. A recent level one study compared local infiltration analgesia to a placebo as part of multimodal analgesia following THA and found no benefit in the study group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. This study was also unable to detect a difference between patients with continuous postoperative intra-articular infusion of ropivicaine compared to patients not receiving an infusion. This contrasts with previous randomized controlled trials investigating infiltration analgesia in the setting of THA, which have shown a benefit compared to a control group, and when compared to patients receiving epidural analgesia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>Liposomal bupivacaine is a formulation of local anesthetic approved by the FDA in October 2011 for single-dose infiltration in the surgical site for postsurgical analgesia. Bupivicaine is released from multivesicular liposomes over a period of time, which may result in local anesthetic action for up to 72&#x000a0;hours. This method of delivery has to the potential reduce opioid consumption without the need for a nerve block or catheter placement. To our knowledge, this method of local anesthetic delivery has not been investigated during THA. The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness of liposomal bupivacaine with standard bupivacaine following total hip arthroplasty. We hypothesized that narcotic use and length of stay would be decreased by the use of liposomal bupivacaine. Pain scores have historically been relatively low using narcotic pain control, and therefore were expected to remain unchanged while the use of narcotics was decreased.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>A retrospective chart review was performed on 28 patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty or hip resurfacing who received intraoperative administration of liposomal bupivacaine. A control group of 30 patients who had previously undergone total hip arthroplasty or hip resurfacing and had received intraoperative administration of bupivacaine also underwent a chart review. The study period was from November 2012 to May 2013. Patients received a preoperative analgesic regimen, which typically included 1000&#x000a0;mg of oral acetaminophen, 400&#x000a0;mg of oral celecoxib, 75&#x000a0;mg of oral pregabalin, and 10&#x000a0;mg of oral extended release oxycodone. Exclusion criteria were revision surgery, previous opioid dependence, and surgical approaches other than posterior.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Surgical technique</title><p>All surgical procedures were performed by the senior surgeon (BGD). All patients had total hip arthroplasty or hip resurfacing through a posterior approach. During wound closure all patients underwent injection of liposomal bupivacaine or bupivacaine throughout the hip capsule, external rotators, gluteus medius, gluteus minimus, gluteus maximus, tensor fascia lata, vastus lateralis, and subcutaneous tissues. Intra-operative analgesia was used by anesthesiologists and consisted of fentanyl or hydromorphone as needed for pain control.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Bupivicaine administration</title><p>All patients received an intra-operative local anesthetic injection. The study group received 20&#x000a0;mL (266&#x000a0;mg) of liposomal bupivacaine mixed with 40&#x000a0;mL of 0.25% bupivacaine with epinephrine. The control group received 60&#x000a0;mL of 0.25% bupivacaine with epinephrine. Care was taken to avoid the sciatic and femoral nerves during administration. Both liposomal bupivacaine and bupivacaine are considered part of the standard of care in hip arthroplasty.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Postoperative care</title><p>All patients were allowed to discharge from the hospital when they met discharge criteria. Discharge criteria included adequate pain control utilizing an oral regimen, tolerating oral intake, and ability to self care. Nurses observed patients postoperatively and administered opioid medication as needed for comfort. Patients and nurses utilized ketorolac, hydrocodone, acetaminophen, codeine, fentanyl, hydromophone, extended release oxycodone, and oxycodone for pain control. Physical therapy was initiated within 24&#x000a0;hours following surgery to assist with ambulation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Outcome measures</title><p>Following surgery patients were discharged when they met criteria. Length of stay was recorded in days for all patients. Post operative opioid consumption was recorded for all patients in the hospital. Opioids administered were converted to morphine equivalents for all patients. Opioid use was tabulated as morphine equivalents in the first 24&#x000a0;hours, second 24&#x000a0;hours, and third 24&#x000a0;hours following surgery. Opioid use after 72&#x000a0;hours was not collected. Patients reported their pain on a visual analog scale (VAS) from 0 to 10, where 0 was considered to be no pain at all and 10 was considered to be the worst possible pain. Average pain scores were tabulated for the first 24&#x000a0;hours, second 24&#x000a0;hours, and third 24&#x000a0;hours following surgery. Readmissions related to pain control were recorded.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Statistics</title><p>A chi-squared analysis was used to compare categorical data between groups such as gender distribution. The two-tailed, independent <italic>t</italic>-test was used to assess length of stay, morphine use, and visual analogue scores. An A-priori sample size was calculated for a two-tailed hypothesis utilizing a mean difference in morphine equivalent use of 7&#x000a0;mg with a standard deviation of 8&#x000a0;mg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. A sample size of 34 patients would be needed for a power (beta) of 0.8 and probability level (alpha) of 0.05. A p-value of &#x0003c;0.05 was considered significant.

Recent efforts to use local anesthetics in THA have been limited to peripheral nerve blockade and local infiltration analgesia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Liposomal bupivacaine is a novel method of local anesthetic delivery, and obviates the need for nerve blocks and catheter placement. In the present study, patients treated with liposomal bupivacaine demonstrated decreased length of stay and decreased morphine equivalent use during the first 24&#x000a0;hours following total hip arthroplasty, when compared to a control group treated with standard bupivicaine.</p><p>Given the recent approval of liposomal bupivacaine, there are no similar studies on the use of this delivery method for THA. The results of this pilot study will be used to design a randomized controlled trial. Bramlett et al. investigated the use of a liposomal release bupivacaine during total knee arthroplasty and noted improved analgesia compared to patients treated with bupivacaine infiltration alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The results of the current study mirror the decreased morphine equivalent use in patients treated with liposomal bupivacaine, although we did not detect a significant difference in pain scores between groups.</p><p>There have been recent reports in the general surgery literature examining the effect of liposomal bupivacaine for post operative analgesia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. To our knowledge there is one randomized controlled trial involving liposomal bupivacaine in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. This study involved patients undergoing hemorrhoidectomy and compared liposomal bupivacaine to placebo. This trial demonstrated decreased pain, opioid requirements, delayed time to first opioid use, and improved patient satisfaction in the study group. In this study the reduction in pain lasted 72&#x000a0;hours. The current study differs from this randomized trial in that the control group in the current study received standard bupivacaine, not a placebo.</p><p>The current study is the first description of the use of liposomal bupivacaine for THA in the literature. It compares a similar group of patients, all of which underwent a posterior approach for hip arthroplasty by a single surgeon. It also addresses the clinically relevant question &#x02013; whether liposomal bupivacaine yields improved results compared to standard bupivacaine; rather than comparing liposomal bupivacaine to a placebo or intravenous patient controlled analgesia. Finally, statistically significant differences were found in length of stay and postoperative narcotic use.</p><p>This study has many limitations. The retrospective nature of this study precludes the ability to standardize preoperative and postoperative multimodal analgesia, select patients, and standardize perioperative care, which may have led to undetectable bias between groups. However, the groups were homogeneous in that they consisted of only posterior approach hip arthroplasties, all performed by the same surgeon, thus removing surgeon technique and surgical approach as confounding variables. Second, there were more hip resurfacings in the control group. Third, the average age of arthroplasty patients in this study for both groups is 55&#x000a0;years; this represents a slightly younger patient cohort than many arthroplasty practices. Whether these results can be extrapolated to an older patient population is unknown.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Liposomal bupivacaine administration during total hip arthroplasty appears to decrease the need for opioid use post operatively and decrease length of stay requirements. The results of this study justify the need for a well-designed randomized controlled trial utilizing liposomal bupivacaine as part of multimodal analgesia during THA.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec13"><title>Authors&#x02019; original submitted files for images</title><p>Below are the links to the authors&#x02019; original submitted files for images.<media position="anchor" xlink:href="12891_2014_2255_MOESM1_ESM.tif" id="MOESM1"><caption><p>Authors&#x02019; original file for figure 1</p></caption></media><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12891_2014_2255_MOESM2_ESM.tif" id="MOESM2"><caption><p>Authors&#x02019; original file for figure 2</p></caption></media></p></sec></app></app-group><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>Pacira Pharmaceuticals Inc. has provided funding to support the research of this study.
