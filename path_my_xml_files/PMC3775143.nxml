It is associated with high mortality and morbidity. Candida species is the 3<sup>rd</sup> most frequent causal agent of late onset sepsis in pre-term neonates,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] with an estimated incidence of 1.6-9% in very low birth weight (VLBW) and of 10-16% in extremely low birth weight neonates (ELBW) in the Neonatal Intensive Care unit (NICU)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] with crude mortality of 30-75%.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>]</p><p>Neonatal ICU at our center is a level 3; tertiary care facilities look after extremely preterm infants who are at high-risk for ICI. The incidence rate in our center is 9.7%.</p><p>Up until 2006 when we started using intravenous fluconazole prophylaxis for our VLBW and ELBW infants, it was our observation that the incidence of ICI had dropped significantly, which is in agreement with other results.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>]</p><p>Previous studies showed that anti-fungal prophylaxis reduces the risk of Candida infection in neonates.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] Fluconazole is the most widely used anti-fungal agent for prophylaxis against ICI. Nystatin is another anti-fungal agent that has been used for prophylaxis of ICI in neonate;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] it is readily available, easy to administer.</p><p>We undertook this study to test the hypothesis that oral nystatin is as effective and non-inferior to the intravenous fluconazole against ICI in VLBW and ELBW.</p><p>Maternity and Children Hospital (MCH), Jeddah another tertiary care facility with level 3 NICU collaborated with our center to conduct this study, follow the same study protocol and data collection sheets. The study has been approved by both hospital institutional review board committees.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>A total number of 65 extremely pre-term neonates admitted to our centers were enrolled in the study between February 2011 and February 2012, with gestational age of 30 weeks or less, birth weight of 1200 g or less. By using the SPSS statistical software program random numbers were generated, and neonates were assigned to either arm A or arm B. Neonates in arm A received nystatin suspension at the recommended prophylactic oral dose, that is 1 ml (100,000 IU) every 8 h orally for 6 weeks[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] and neonates in arm B received intravenous fluconazole at the recommended prophylactic dose, that is 6 mg/kg every 72 h at the end of 1<sup>st</sup> week, then every 48 h from 2<sup>nd</sup> week to 6<sup>th</sup> week of life.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>]</p><p>The drugs administration commenced at the end of 1 week of age after obtaining the base line investigations, which include complete blood count (CBC), Transaminases (ALT, AST) serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, blood culture, urine culture and rectal swabs, subsequently have been carried out weekly until the study was over.</p><p>Risk factors for Candida colonization and infection were monitored carefully (broad spectrum antibiotics duration use, duration of Total Parental Nutrition (TPN), date of commencing oral feeding, H2 blockers, central line, corticosteroids and aminophylline).</p><p>The data were collected prospectively looking for the primary end point. The primary outcome was the incidence of ICI in infants receiving either fluconazole or nystatin, and the secondary outcome was the safety and costs of drug administration.</p><p>Neonates who developed a fungal infection proven by blood or urine cultures would be taken off the study and treated with appropriate antifungal medication such as amphotericin B or/and fluconazole at the standard therapeutic dose as recommended.</p><p>Data collecting sheets for every patient as per (data collection performa) were used.</p><p>Written parental or legal guardian consent was obtained for every patient before enrolment in the study.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>All preterm neonates 30 weeks gestation or less, weight 1200 g or less, born in our centers or transferred from other facilities.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Exclusion criteria</title><p>Neonates with severe congenital anomalies, fatal chromosomal anomalies, severe sepsis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, intraventricular hemorrhage, and persistent pulmonary hypertension of newborn, parents&#x02019; refusal for their baby to be enrolled in the study or any other condition to the discretion of the investigators that the neonate may not be able to complete the study.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Sample size and statistical methods</title><p>The null hypothesis to be tested is that the effectiveness and safety of oral nystatin prophylaxis is not equivalent and inferior to the use of intravenous fluconazole prophylaxis in preventing ICIs in high risk VLBW and ELBW versus the effectiveness is not inferior. When the sample size in each group is 25, a two-group large-sample normal approximation test of proportions with a one-sided 0.050 significance level will have 80% power to reject the null hypothesis that oral nystatin and intravenous fluconazole are not equivalent (the difference in proportions, pT &#x02212; pS, is &#x02212;0.150 or farther from zero in the same direction) in favor of the alternative hypothesis that the proportions in the two groups are equivalent, assuming that the expected difference in proportions is and the proportion in the standard group.</p><p>Use of &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test on contingency tables, the standard t test for independent samples and paired comparisons test for repeated measurements for evaluation of non-parametric data the Mann-Whitney U test will be used.

We observed in our infants that 2/34 (5%) patients who develop severe sepsis were in the fluconazole group, but the development of sepsis could be related to multifactor.

Our very restrict use of broad spectrum antibiotics in our unit, early start of enteral feeding, short use of TPN, might have contributed to lower incidence of Candida colonization and infections.</p><p>There are however few limitations to our study, our Candida infection incidence rate is low, and we have a very low colonization rate the gestational age in our sample are relatively higher mean 27 weeks.
