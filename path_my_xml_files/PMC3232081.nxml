Regarding the complexities of sepsis, all aspects of body inflammatory response should be targeted to achieve better management of patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0002">2</xref>).</p><p>Following the initial host and microbial interaction, inflammatory cytokines are released by activated macrophages and CD<sub>4</sub> cells within the first hour after infection. Proinflammatory mediators are counteracted by antiinflammatory molecules such as IL-4, IL-10, and IL1-ra because CD<sub>4</sub> T cells can switch from the production of inflammatory cytokines to production of antiinflammatory cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0003">3</xref>). Immunotherapy must be applied at an early time point during the development of immunodysfunction following trauma or acute onset of infection to ensure that all cellular components of immune system are protected. There is much earlier temporal relationship between inflammation and the onset of organ dysfunction. Mean biomarker levels during 72 hrs were significantly greater in hospital non-survivors. Therefore, inflammatory elements such as TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-1 should be therapeutically targeted and neutralized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0004">4</xref>). In early severe sepsis and septic shock, within the first 3 hrs of hospital presentation, distinct biomarker patterns emerge in response to hemodynamic optimization strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0005">5</xref>). A significant association exists between temporal biomarker patterns in the first 72 hrs, severity of tissue hypoxia, organ dysfunction, and the mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0006">6</xref>).</p><p>Analysis of current immunomodulating strategies indicates that monovalent approaches in isolation are unlikely to restore immunostasis or attain status of complete therapy. It is likely that multiple immunomodulating strategies will be necessary to achieve clinical success owing to complex interplay between pathways. Botanical extracts provides cytoprotective, antiinflammatory, and antimicrobial activities in addition to immunoregulatory activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0007">7</xref>).</p><p>Setarud (IMOD) is a mixture of urtica, carotenoids, urea, and selenium that can regulate TNF-&#x003b1;, interferone-&#x003b3; (IFN-&#x003b3;) and IL-2. IMOD has been patented in Europe with code of WO/2007/087825 for its immunomodulator and anti-TNF-&#x003b1; capacities and improving CD<sub>4</sub> in HIV positive patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0008">8</xref>). The pre-clinical safety studies of IMOD in animals, and phases I trials have been successfully conducted showing optimistic results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0010">10</xref>). As sepsis is an immune mediated disease and IMOD has immunomodulatory properties, in this study its effect in management of patients with severe sepsis was evaluated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S0002"><title>METHODS</title><sec><title/><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>Patients with severe sepsis and APACHE (Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation) score of more than 20 who admitted to general ICU of Sina Hospital of Tehran University of Medical Sciences were enrolled in this study.</p><p>Exclusion criteria were any of the following: age less than 18 years old, pregnancy, lactating women, organ transplant history, and death probability within 24 hrs.</p></sec><sec><title>Treatment protocol</title><p>This study was a randomized open labeled clinical trial that was approved by TUMS review board and registered at Australian Newzeland Clinical Trial Organisation with code number of (ACTRN012607000376448). Twenty patients with severe sepsis and APACHE score of more than 20 were enrolled in this trial. Patients were randomized to receive one of the following treatments: standard treatment for severe sepsis (control group) and standard treatment plus IMOD (IMOD group) for duration of 14 days. The group treated for 14 day with IMOD was selected according to the results of pilot studies and regarding the stability of patient's conditions in the ICU. Of course patients in both group received standard treatment and all were monitored for 28 days. According to last international guidelines, two recommended severe sepsis bundles were implemented as follow:</p><p>Severe sepsis resuscitation bundle, which began immediately not later than 6 hrs after diagnose of severe sepsis. The bundle contained serum lactate measurement, blood cultures before antibiotic administration, improving time to broad spectrum antibiotics, control of hypotension by vasopressors to target central venous pressure, and central venous oxygen saturation. The second bundle called sepsis management bundle began not later than 24 hrs after diagnosis of severe sepsis. The protocol contained administration of low dose of steroids, adequate glycemic control, and prevention of excessive inspiratory plateau pressure.</p><p>Patients in IMOD group received 125 mg (4 ml) of IMOD in 100 ml of DW5% which was infused over 1 hour on the first day. All hemodynamic data were noted during the infusion in order to stop it in the case of any negative hemodynamic deterioration, dermal rash, urticaria and anaphylactic reaction. Then 8 ml of IMOD in 100 ml of DW5% was infused everyday up to 14 days. The time gap between the beginning of treatment with IMOD and the diagnosis of sepsis was also noted to evaluate possible impact of the onset time of IMOD on mortality.</p><p>Demographic data and clinical information were obtained at the beginning (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T0001">Table 1</xref>). Daily acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE), sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA), and simplified acute physiology score (SAPS) were calculated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0011">11</xref>).

As mentioned earlier, the key point of severe sepsis is immune dysfunction suggesting that therapies should overcome immune dysfunction to improve clinical outcome. Several studies evaluated the effect of different treatments on severe sepsis, but failed to improve survival of patients for many different explanations. For example the experimental agents have been ineffective or the dose of experimental agents have been inadequate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0014">14</xref>) or the timing of intervention has not been suitable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0016">16</xref>). In addition, there has been polymorphism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0017">17</xref>) or heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0018">18</xref>) in patients under study. The treatment of sepsis is currently limited to activated protein C and moderate doses of corticosteroids. Activated protein C is associated with increased risk of hemorrhage that limits its use in patients with high risk of bleeding. High cost of activated protein C is another limitation. Previous studies have shown that monovalent therapies by itself could not restore immunostasis in severe sepsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0019">19</xref>), so the need to drugs with polyvalent activity like botanical immunodrugs seems inevitable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0007">7</xref>). Botanical immunodrugs such as Chinese remedy and green tea have been found that dose-dependently attenuate bacterial endotoxin-induced HMGBI release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0020">20</xref>). IMOD is a new herbal-derived remedy which has been already tested for toxicity in animals and found safe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0011">11</xref>).</p><p>Results of this study indicated that TNF-&#x003b1; as the main inflammatory mediator of severe sepsis was reduced by IMOD treatment in comparison to controls. One of the outcomes of reduction in TNF-&#x003b1; would be the decline in many deleterious effects including inflammation, apoptosis, and cytotoxicity. Interestingly, it was found a significant elevation in TTM by IMOD during the treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0009">Fig. 9</xref>). Glutathione is the major low molecular weight thiol in the mammalian and it constitutes the most important antioxidant defense, thus measurement of TTM, allowed to monitor glutathione action. Although, positive effects of IMOD was not found on all biomarkers of inflammation or toxic stress but APACHEE, SOFA, and SAPS as quantitative indices of clinical status were improved by IMOD and mortality rate at the day of 28 was reduced. Improvement of APACHEE, SOFA, and SAPS by IMOD confirms potential of IMOD in alleviation of severity of disease and dynamics.</p><p>Fortunately, IMOD showed no adverse effect on coagulation factors like platelet count, prothrombine time, partial thromboplastin time, fibrinogen, and D-dimer. Hemodynamic instability and anaphylactoid reactions were not observed during infusion that is very important in septic patients who are vulnerable to little hemodynamic changes. Two patients in IMOD group had immune mediated thrombocytopenia which improved after treatment. In one patient under treatment with IMOD, a significant improvement in PaO2/FiO2 ratio was observed. Dose of 125 mg for IMOD that was used in the present study is in the safe dose range and much less than toxic doses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0010">10</xref>) and thus can be increased in future trials. One of limitations of the present study is small sample size but as a matter of fact it is difficult to have large sample size in ICU with critically ill patients because of heterogeneity of patients. In addition, a new study demonstrated that most of studies in ICU have the same limitations and endpoints other than mortality need to be considered when evaluating interventions in critically ill patients. It has been concluded that relatively few of the randomized controlled trials conducted in ICU show beneficial impact of the intervention on the survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0021">21</xref>).</p><p>Taking collectively, it is concluded that that IMOD may be added as a safe adjuvant to standard treatment of severe sepsis. This is the first study showing safety profile and possible antiinflammatory effect of IMOD in sepsis which might be extrapolated to acute respiratory syndrome and shock too. Further clinical trials with larger sample size and higher doses of IMOD are necessary to show exact antiinflammatory and immunomodulatory effects of IMOD in patients with septic shock.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>This study was partially supported by a grant from ParsRus Research Group.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="CIT0001"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Martin</surname><given-names>GS</given-names></name><name><surname>Mannino</surname><given-names>DM</given-names></name><name><surname>Eaton</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The epidemiology of sepsis in the United States from 1979 through 2000</article-title><source>N Engl J Med</source><year>2003</year><volume>348</volume><fpage>1546</fpage><lpage>1554</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">12700374</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CIT0002"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Angus</surname><given-names>DC</given-names></name><name><surname>Linde-Zwirble</surname><given-names>WT</given-names></name><name><surname>Lidicker</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Epidemiology of severe sepsis in the United States: analysis of incidence, outcome and associated costs of care</article-title><source>Crit Care Med</source><year>2001</year><volume>29</volume><fpage>1303</fpage><lpage>1310</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11445675</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CIT0003"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Hack</surname><given-names>CE</given-names></name><name><surname>Aarden</surname><given-names>LA</given-names></name><name><surname>Thijs</surname><given-names>LG</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Role of cytokines in sepsis</article-title><source>Adv Immunol</source><year>1997</year><volume>66</volume><fpage>101</fpage><lpage>105</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">9328641</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CIT0004"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ansari</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Mojtahedzadeh</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Kajbaf</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Najafi</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Khajavi</surname><given-names>MR</given-names></name><name><surname>Khalili</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Rouini</surname><given-names>MR</given-names></name><name><surname>Ahmadi</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Abdollahi</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>How does blood glucose control with metformin influence intensive insulin protocols?
