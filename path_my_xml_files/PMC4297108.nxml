We used type II collagen gel for cell-based construct because it is similar to the component of normal cartilage than type I that has been reported previously.<sup><xref rid="bibr16-1947603512455194" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> At present, this is the first time that PEI/SPIO and GFP double-labeled BMSCs seeded in type II collagen gel has been used for articular cartilage defects repair and <italic>in vivo</italic> MRI tracking.</p><p>Our <italic>in vitro</italic> data revealed that PEI/SPIO was a good choice for tracking BMSCs in cartilage repair. Previously, dextran-coated SPIO, such as AMI225 (feridex), AMI2227 (ferumoxtran), AMI2121 (LUMIREM), and SHU555A (resovist),<sup><xref rid="bibr17-1947603512455194" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="bibr18-1947603512455194" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> acting as the stem cell probe, has some obvious limits. First, dextran-coated SPIO particles alone cannot be internalized into the cytoplasm of nonphagocytic cells. Usually it needs to be mixed with protamine or poly-L-lysine (PLL) so that the surface charge of SPIO is changed from negative to positive.<sup><xref rid="bibr19-1947603512455194" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Second, <italic>in vivo</italic> degradation time of dextran-coated SPIO is too short for cartilage repair tracking, although the longest tracing time was 12 weeks in our previous report.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-1947603512455194" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> In this study, however, we found that the PEI/SPIO had longer <italic>in vivo</italic> degradation time (at least 24 weeks) than the dextran-coated SPIO. However, it was easy to be internalized into BMSCs because of their positively charged surface.</p><p>More important, we established a PEI/SPIO-based protocol to label BMSCs yielding high label efficiency while preserving the functional properties of the labeled cells. Our studies showed that BMSCs can be efficiently labeled with 8 &#x000b5;g/ml SPIO for 24 hours. More than 99% positive rate of Prussian blue staining cells had been found. And neither survival nor proliferation potential is severely impaired in dealing with 8 &#x000b5;g Fe/ml for 24 hours. However, treatment with 10 or 12 &#x000b5;g Fe/ml for 24 hours impaired cell survival and proliferation significantly. This indicates that SPIO concentration and incubation time should be carefully taken into account when developing preclinical strategies relying on SPIO-based cell tracking techniques. We could solve the problem by reducing both the SPIO concentration and the incubation time. Doses of 8 &#x000b5;g Fe/ml for 12 or 24 hours, or doses of 6 &#x000b5;g Fe/ml for 24 hours, results in efficient cell labeling without impairment of cell survival and proliferation potential.</p><p>For MRI detection, significant signal intensity decreases were observed with labeled BMSCs on SET2WI sequences,<sup><xref rid="bibr20-1947603512455194" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> which had the highest percentage of SI change due to its higher sensitivity to iron oxide particles, and a higher cell concentration led to a greater change in the signal intensity, indicating that there was a good correlation between the number of cells and the signal intensity. On the other hand, we found that a good linear correlation between the iron content of cells and optical density of the MR imaging in our study.</p><p>To validate if the SPIO-generated signal was related to originally labeled cells, or that SPIO particles were taken up by host cells, GFP-transfected BMSCs were colabeled with SPIO. Our study confirmed that GFP lentiviral vector and PEI/SPIO could effectively label BMSCs without impairing cell proliferation and differentiation. For the purpose of additional detection, we found that SPIO-positive cells in the cartilage defect by MR imaging while GFP could be found at these regions by histology. The rate of colabeled cells accounted to 60.5%. By doubly labeling the BMSC with GFP gene and SPIO nanoparticles, this study clearly showed that the transplanted BMSC extensively multiply during their survival in the cartilage defect. The finding that the GFP-positive cells contained SPIO nanoparticles, therefore, proves their excessive facility of proliferation in the cartilage defect. At the same time, we excluded the false positives caused by free iron.</p><p>In this present study, we established a joint cartilage defect model of a clinically relevant size (6 mm in diameter and 3 mm in depth) and provided direct evidence that SPIO-labeled BMSCs can be identified in the cartilage defect after cell transplantation and that these cells contribute to the regions of signal loss observed in MR images of knee joint. This was achieved using our minipig model in which BMSCs were GFP and SPIO-positive labeled. With this unique minipig model, we showed excellent correspondence between areas in the cartilage defect that were GFP-positive and SPIO-positive, and we showed that these areas could be related to regions of signal loss observed in MR images of knee joint.</p><p>In summary, we consider PEI/SPIO labeling at optimal low dosages that allows maintaining stable biological features without toxicity to hold great potential for clinically translatable cell tracking using MRI in cell-based cartilage repair. This would show the distribution and diffusion of the labeled cells, thereby elucidating the regenerative mechanisms and providing opportunities to improve current repair strategies.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Acknowledgments and Funding:</bold> The authors thank professor Ai Hua (National Engineering Research Center for Biomaterials, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China) for his generous gift of PEI/SPIO.
