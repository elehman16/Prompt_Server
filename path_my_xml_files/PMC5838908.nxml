After the completion of 12 weeks of treatment period, the FPG levels were evaluated using a glucometer and patients with uncontrolled hyperglycemia (&#x0003e;240 mg/dL) were prescribed rescue medication (metformin tablets).

Data of adverse events (AEs), physical examination findings, vital signs measurements, electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters, and body weight were also collected.

The last available observation of the efficacy parameter was carried forward in the ITT and PP analysis sets (last-observation-carried-forward approach), where postbaseline data were missing. To avoid the confounding influence of rescue therapy on efficacy comparisons, efficacy data collected after initiation of rescue therapy were treated as missing. The mean change from baseline (collected at the screening visit) in HbA1c at week 16 was analyzed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with baseline HbA1c value as a covariate.

The change from baseline in FPG was analyzed using ANCOVA with baseline value of FPG as a covariate and treatment as a main effect. Similarly, the analysis was performed for PPG and body weight.

There were two (1.3%) patients who experienced SAEs in the teneligliptin group (cancer right pyriform fossa and left varicose vein surgery) and both SAEs were considered not to be related to study drug. Most patients (93.7%) treated with teneligliptin did not experience a hypoglycemic event. Studies evaluating other anti-diabetic drugs have reported an association with the occurrence of hypoglycemic events.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] A study conducted by Bodmer <italic>et al</italic>. reported that the use of sulphonylurea and metformin was significantly (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001) associated with the occurrence of hypoglycemic events in patients with T2DM.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Similarly, a recently conducted meta-analysis reported that patients who receive basal bolus insulin have a 33.7% risk of a severe hypoglycemic events, while patients treated with sulphonylurea have a 3.5% annual risk of a severe hypoglycemic event.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] The use of teneligliptin in this study was not associated with any significant changes in laboratory findings (SGPT, ALP, SGOT, serum amylase, and serum calcitonin).</p><p>Consideration of a narrow target HbA1c window, namely, 7%&#x02013;8.5% has provided a comparatively lower response than expected for a DPP4 inhibitor. This may be considered as a limitation of the present study. In summary, patients with T2DM who were treated with teneligliptin in this study showed statistically significant and clinically meaningful reductions in HbA1c levels. Teneligliptin treatment was well tolerated. Teneligliptin treatment has been shown to be effective for patients with T2DM that is inadequately controlled using diet and exercise alone.</p><p>Financial support and sponsorship</p><p>The study was funded by Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Ltd., Mumbai.
