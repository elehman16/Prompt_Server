Paracetamol is as an analgesic and antipyretic; chlorphenamine is an antihistamine; and phenylephrine, a vasoconstrictor and decongestant. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial sought to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a fixed-dose combination of paracetamol, chlorphenamine and phenylephrine in the symptomatic treatment of the common cold and flu-like syndrome in adults.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This study enrolled 146 individuals aged 18 to 60&#x000a0;years who had moderate to severe flu-like syndrome or common cold. After clinical examination and laboratory tests, individuals were randomly assigned to receive the fixed-dose combination (73) or placebo (73), five capsules per day for 48 to 72&#x000a0;hours. The primary efficacy endpoint was the sum of the scores of 10 symptoms on a four-point Likert-type scale. To evaluate treatment safety, the occurrence of adverse events was also measured.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Mean age was 33.5 (&#x000b1;9.5) years in the placebo group and 33.8 (&#x000b1;11.5) in the treatment group. There were 55 women and 18 men in the placebo group, and 46 women and 27 men in the treatment group. Comparison of overall symptom scores in the two groups revealed a significantly greater reduction in the treatment group than in the placebo group (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.015). Analysis at the first 13 dose intervals (&#x000b1; 66&#x000a0;h of treatment) showed a greater reduction of symptom scores in the treatment group than in the placebo group (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05).

When the aetiology is presumably bacterial, treatment is based on the use of antibiotics and medication for symptomatic relief. However, the most common clinical entities, the common cold and the flu-like syndrome, have a viral aetiology, for which symptomatic treatment remains, in most cases, the standard recommendation.</p><p>The common cold is the most frequently encountered disease in medical practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. It affects most adults, on average two to four times a year, and accounts for up to 40% of work absences among the economically active population in the United States [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>This syndrome affects the upper airways, sometimes in association with low-grade fever and systemic symptoms, and usually presents with at least two of the following symptoms: cough, dysphonia, throat discomfort, sore throat, nasal congestion, rhinorrhoea, sneezing, headaches, myalgia and fever [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Symptoms usually peak at 2 to 3&#x000a0;days and have a mean duration of 7 to 10&#x000a0;days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. This definition has been prospectively validated in other studies and is that most frequently used in clinical studies of patients with the common cold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Although most cases are caused by the rhinovirus, other agents may be involved, such as the respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, coronavirus, and influenza and parainfluenza viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Flu-like syndrome is characterized by sudden onset of fever, headache, cough, sore throat, myalgia, nasal congestion, weakness and loss of appetite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Complications, such as pneumonia, otitis and sinusitis, may occur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Some of the medications studied for the treatment of the common cold are antihistamines, anticholinergics, alpha-adrenergic agonists, membrane stabilizers, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, vitamin C, glucocorticoids, zinc, herbal medications and alpha-interferon. Clinical trials of high-dose vitamin C have not found any benefits in the treatment of the common cold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Recent studies of <italic>Echinacea purpurea</italic>, a herbal medicine, did not find any clinical benefits for patients with the common cold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The results of meta-analyses about the efficacy of zinc are contradictory, and there is weak evidence of its benefit in well-designed studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>The symptomatic treatment of the common cold has been evaluated in Cochrane meta-analyses. The first included 32 studies with a total of 8930 patients and investigated the administration of antihistamines in the common cold. Results showed that monotherapy did not improve symptoms in either children or adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The combined use of antihistamines and decongestants may alleviate symptoms in adults, but results are heterogeneous [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Another meta-analysis investigated the use of nasal decongestants in the common cold in 286 adults, and found no benefit for the relief of nasal congestion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Another recent meta-analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] suggests that a triple combination of antihistamine, decongestant and analgesic provided some general benefit in adults and older children.</p><p>Most cases of influenza require the use of drugs for symptomatic relief [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In clinical practice, treatment directed to the aetiological agent is not routine, but became considerably more frequent after the H1N1 pandemic in 2009 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>Therefore, patients continue to use medications that produce symptomatic relief because of the epidemiological relevance and the intensity of symptoms of flu-like syndromes and the common cold.</p><p>This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of a fixed-dose combination of paracetamol, chlorphenamine and phenylephrine in the symptomatic treatment of the common cold and flu-like syndromes by analysing symptom score reductions during and after treatment, duration of symptoms, return to usual activities and adverse events in both groups.</p><p>No other randomized clinical trial (RCT) evaluated the safety and efficacy of this specific fixed-dose combination for the common cold in adults. This was the first RCT conducted in Brazil designed to also assess adverse cardiovascular effects of phenylephrine.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>This phase III, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial enrolled volunteers recruited by means of posters displayed in Hospital de Cl&#x000ed;nicas de Porto Alegre (HCPA) and in primary care centres in the city of Porto Alegre, Brazil, and of ads placed in local newspapers.</p><sec><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>This study included volunteers of both genders, aged 18 to 60&#x000a0;years, with a duration of symptoms no longer than 72&#x000a0;hours. The common cold was defined by the presence of at least two of the following 10 symptoms: sneezing, rhinorrhoea, nasal congestion, headache, myalgia, throat discomfort, sore throat, dysphonia, cough and fever. Symptoms should be moderate to severe on a four-point, Likert-type symptom severity scale (0&#x02009;=&#x02009;no symptoms; 1&#x02009;=&#x02009;mild; 2&#x02009;=&#x02009;moderate; 3&#x02009;=&#x02009;severe). Flu-like syndrome should include fever of at least 38.1&#x000b0;C and moderate to severe headache or moderate to severe myalgia or arthralgia in the Likert-type symptom severity scale described above.</p></sec><sec><title>Exclusion criteria</title><p>Volunteers were excluded from the study if they met any of the following criteria: pregnancy or breastfeeding; known hypersensitivity to any component of the study formulation; use of alcohol or illicit drugs; use of monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors or barbiturates; perennial or seasonal allergic rhinitis confirmed at screening; any current acute disease or uncontrolled exacerbation of chronic disease; clinical evidence of immunosuppression; vaccination against influenza up to 1&#x000a0;week before inclusion; need for antiviral therapy to treat influenza A or B infection; need for antibacterial therapy to treat acute respiratory infection; use of medication to treat conditions acquired before inclusion for a time shorter than two time intervals of administration of these drugs; and participation in another clinical trial less than 1&#x000a0;year before.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size calculation</title><p>For a statistical power of 80%, a random error of 5% and a response rate of 30% in the treatment group in comparison with the placebo group, and a 50% reduction in symptom scores after the second day of follow-up in the placebo group, the sample size was calculated as 132 patients (66 in each group) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].

Overall, 110 patients experienced some type of adverse effect in both groups.</p><p>Mean (&#x000b1;SD) heart rate (HR) was 76.60 (&#x000b1;11.04) bpm in the treatment group and 77.36 (&#x000b1;12.96) bpm in the placebo group at V1. At V2, mean HR was 76.72 (&#x000b1;10.53) bpm in the treatment group and 77.96 (&#x000b1;11.00) bpm in the placebo group. Comparisons of HR variation before and after treatment did not reveal any significant between-group differences (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.834).</p><p>Mean (&#x000b1;SD) systolic blood pressure (SBP) at V1 was 119.22 (&#x000b1;13.09) mmHg in the treatment group and 115.66 (&#x000b1;13.55) mmHg in the placebo group, and this difference was not significant (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.11). At V2, mean SBP was 120.82 (&#x000b1;15.93) mmHg in the treatment group and 114.01 (&#x000b1;12.29) mmHg in the placebo group, and this difference was statistically significant (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.004). Comparison of BP variation before and after treatment did not reveal any significant differences (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.092).</p><p>Laboratory test results did not show any clinically relevant changes in relation to any of the study variables. &#x003b2;-HCG, urinalysis (density, pH, proteinuria, glycosuria, ketonuria, bilirubin, urobilinogen, haemoglobinuria, nitrite, leukocyte esterase) and FBC results were not significantly different between V1 and V2.</p><p>No serious adverse events were recorded during the study, and no patients withdrew from the study due to adverse events. The reasons for exclusion from the sample are shown in Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This was the first randomized, double-blind clinical trial to demonstrate the efficacy of a fixed-dose combination of 400&#x000a0;mg paracetamol, 4.0&#x000a0;mg chlorphenamine and 4.0&#x000a0;mg phenylephrine in reducing flu-like symptoms by means of both objective evaluation of symptoms by the investigators and subjective reports provided by patients. The evaluation of rescue paracetamol use as a dichotomous variable showed that 50.7% of patients in the placebo group versus 25% in the treatment group used the rescue medication. This difference indicates that for every four patients treated with the study drug, one did not take rescue paracetamol (NNT&#x02009;=&#x02009;4). This reduction of the rate of rescue medication use is an index of analgesic efficacy and demonstrates that patients with flu-like symptoms actually seek an alternative form of relief when the medication they are taking is not efficacious. Time to freedom from symptoms was lower in the treatment group than in the placebo group, although the difference did not reach statistical significance.</p><p>The comparison of baseline and final scores revealed that both groups experienced a major reduction in the total symptom score, both as assessed by the investigators and as reported by the patients themselves, a result that may be attributed to the fact that the common cold is a self-limiting disease. The rapid symptom reduction precludes demonstration of any between-group differences at the end of the treatment (48 to 72&#x000a0;hours). Therefore, the fact that treatment group had a statistically significant difference from the placebo group at this time point supports the efficacy of the study drug.</p><p>Evaluation of patient-reported symptom scores (study diary) by ANOVA showed a statistically significant reduction in symptom scores in the treatment group as compared with the placebo groups (p&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.05). This difference of up to 3 points in symptom scores was constant during the first 13 doses and translates into a trend towards a 1.5-day reduction in the total duration of symptoms. If confirmed in larger studies, this finding could have a major impact on the population, given the high annual incidence of flu-like syndrome and the large number of users of over-the-counter medication for symptomatic relief of its symptoms worldwide. After the 13th dose, symptom scores were very low and similar between groups, which confirms the self-limiting characteristic of the disease and made it difficult for patients to assign scores to their symptoms. According to the study protocol, patients did not have to take the medication (either active or placebo) for more than 10 doses (corresponding to 48&#x000a0;hours, or 2&#x000a0;days). This explains the reduction in the number of cases for analysis after the 13th dose.</p><p>Analysis of the HR variation attributable to treatment revealed that the active formulation did not increase HR. Furthermore, treatment did not increase systolic BP. A small between-group difference in this variable was already detectable at baseline. Although not significant, patients in the treatment group had higher baseline mean values (a 4.44&#x000a0;mmHg difference), which may be attributable to randomization. However, all mean values in both groups were within normal limits both at baseline and after treatment. The increase in mean systolic BP attributable to treatment with the active formulation was only 1.6&#x000a0;mmHg; therefore, there was no increase in sensitivity to sympathomimetic agents, and the response after treatment in this group was not more intense than in the placebo group. The absence of patient- or investigator-detected effects on cardiovascular parameters, HR, or SBP suggests that the study drug did not increase cardiovascular risk. Hence, this RCT adds valuable safety data, particularly in regard to the effects of the decongestant agent phenylephrine on blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters.</p><p>Some limitations of this study must be mentioned, including the difficulties of studying a disease such as the common cold, which is self-limited and combines multiple symptoms with a very rapid rate of resolution. The majority of patients were symptom-free by the 7th day after the end of treatment. Moreover, most patients had a low symptom score at randomization, probably because of the generally accepted concept of at-home recovery for flu-like illness. This limitation had a negative influence on identification of severe disease, which, combined with the rapid resolution of symptoms (very low symptom score), reduces the possibility of identifying between-group differences. For these reasons, any statistically significant differences found might be interpreted as having potential for clinical relevance.</p><p>Safety analysis did not reveal any clinically relevant change in any clinical or laboratory variables at the two time points of evaluation, whether within-group or between-group (active vs. placebo). Furthermore, there were no statistically significant between-group differences in treatment-emergent adverse effects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Administration of the study drug at the dose suggested in its package insert was more efficacious than placebo in the symptomatic treatment of the common cold or flu-like illness. The study drug also reduced the frequency of use of rescue medication as compared with placebo, and was as safe as placebo. These findings suggest that a fixed-dose combination of paracetamol, chlorphenamine and phenylephrine may be an effective and safe alternative for treatment of these clinical entities.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ANOVA: Analysis of variance; ECG: Electrocardiogram; FBC: Full blood count; HCPA: Hospital de Cl&#x000ed;nicas de Porto Alegre; HR: Heart rate; MAO: Monoamine oxidase; NUCLIMED: <italic>N&#x000fa;cleo de Investiga&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o Cl&#x000ed;nica em Medicamentos</italic>; RCT: Randomized clinical trial; SBP: Systolic blood pressure; V1: Visit 1; V2: Visit 2; V3: Visit 3.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>This study was funded by the manufacturer of the tested product through a research agreement that included reimbursement of all author expenses.
