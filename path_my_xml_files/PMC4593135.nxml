The majority of patients experiencing LBP are managed in primary care, where first-line care recommendations consist of advice to self-manage and remain active. Internet interventions present a potential means of providing patients with tailored self-management advice and evidence-based support for increasing physical activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/analysis</title><p>This protocol describes a single-blind, randomised controlled feasibility trial of an internet intervention developed to support the self-management of LBP in primary care. Patients are being randomised to 1 of 3 groups receiving either usual primary care, usual primary care with the addition of an internet intervention or an internet intervention with physiotherapist telephone support. Patients are followed up at 3&#x02005;months. Primary outcomes are the feasibility of (1) the trial design/methods, (2) the delivery of the internet intervention and (3) the provision of telephone support by physiotherapists. Secondary outcomes will include exploratory analysis of estimates and variation in clinical outcomes of pain and disability, in order to inform a future main trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics/dissemination</title><p>This feasibility trial has undergone ethical scrutiny and been approved by the National Health Service (NHS) Research Ethics Committee, REC Reference 13/SC/0202.

<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Each year approximately 6&#x02013;9% of the UK population will visit their general practitioner (GP) with LBP, at a cost of around 251 million pounds to the National Health Service (NHS) per annum.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Although acute LBP is often reported as a relatively brief, self-limiting condition,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Henschke <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> showed that around a third of patients presenting with acute symptoms had not recovered at 12&#x02005;months. In studies including all primary care consulters with LBP, up to 52% of patients had poor clinical outcome at 6&#x02005;months,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> and Dunn <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> showed LBP trajectories for primary care consulters appear to remain stable with 69% of patients continuing to report mild to persistently severe pain at 7-year follow-up. Where LBP becomes recurrent or persistent (estimates range widely from 2% to 56%<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), patients are at risk of becoming deconditioned, depressed and immobile, reducing their ability to work and leading to extensive healthcare and societal costs. With regard to disease burden, Hoy <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> recently demonstrated that LBP caused more global disability than any other condition.</p><p>Promoting effective self-management is a key strategy in the care of patients with LBP.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Definitions of self-management vary; however, central components include monitoring of the health condition and effecting the cognitive, behavioural and emotional responses necessary to maintain quality of life, and where possible, reduce symptom-related disability.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Encouraging physical activity and exercise is recommended within LBP treatment guidelines,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> and physical activity is a core component of self-management programmes.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Alongside physical activity, targeting psychological processes such as self-efficacy,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> pain perceptions, expectations and fear-avoidance beliefs may also be important in interventions for LBP.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> For those needing support to regain their self-efficacy, overcome common concerns and regain active lifestyles, GP referral to physiotherapy is common, with UK estimates suggesting 20% are referred to a physiotherapist in the UK.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Recent research suggests caution regarding advice on the pharmacological management of symptoms;<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> concerns have been raised about the effectiveness of paracetamol<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> and oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may not be suitable for patients with contraindications, particularly prevalent in older adults.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> This recent research highlights the important role of non-pharmacological self-management in the care of patients with LBP.</p><p>The majority of patients with LBP will be seen by GPs in primary care.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> GPs&#x02019; consultations with patients are typically short, and after ruling out serious spinal pathology, GPs are unlikely to have the resources or training to deliver optimal evidence-based behavioural support. Interventions delivered over the internet may be well placed to complement time-constrained GPs in providing tailored information, advice and support for self-management.</p><p>Internet interventions are structured programmes that patients engage with by using computers or mobile devices (including tablets), over a set period of time. In addition to providing tailored educational information, they can support self-management by facilitating goal setting, self-monitoring and providing behavioural/symptom-related feedback. Along with heightened interactivity, internet interventions can provide audio and video material, broadening the scope for content beyond traditional paper-based media for delivering LBP-related education and advice.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Internet interventions delivered with &#x02018;live&#x02019; health professional support, which can be minimal, have been shown to be more effective than internet interventions delivered without support.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> However, this is not always the case<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> and removal of health professional time may ensure these interventions can be offered more broadly and cost-effectively, potentially increasing access.</p><p>With all technology-mediated health innovations, it is essential to remain vigilant to how access limitations might exclude certain groups of society. Nonetheless, it is important to reflect on this in light of access to traditional services. For instance, household internet access in the UK is reported to have now reached 84%,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> and is expected to continue to grow. These increasing figures suggest that internet interventions may in fact become more accessible than many traditional face-to-face services, where patients&#x02019; access will be restricted by factors such as availability of transport, childcare and working hours.</p><p>Previous research on internet interventions for back pain has focused almost exclusively on chronic pain and psychological approaches to managing symptoms such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26&#x02013;29</xref> Although results are promising,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26&#x02013;29</xref> sample sizes are small and control groups are commonly either waiting lists or no treatment conditions, thus it is unclear how internet interventions when added to usual primary care might compare to usual primary care alone. GPs see the full spectrum of patients with LBP from acute to chronic/persistent pain. There is a need to explore the utility of internet interventions that have been designed to be broadly applicable for a wide range of patients presenting with LBP. It is also necessary to examine the provision of health professional support for LBP interventions with wider scope. CBT therapists have often been used to provide support for internet interventions specifically for chronic pain.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Physiotherapists are integral members of the LBP clinical pathway in the UK NHS, and are well placed to deliver first-line rehabilitation with specialist skills in assessment and re-enablement to promote active and healthy lifestyles. Thus, physiotherapists may be the most appropriate choice to provide support for a LBP internet intervention targeting primary care patients.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></p><sec id="s1a"><title>Aims and objectives</title><p>We aim to explore the feasibility of providing an internet intervention for patients with LBP in primary care, with and without physiotherapist telephone support (in addition to usual care), compared with usual care alone. The feasibility of physiotherapists delivering limited telephone support for the intervention will also be explored.</p><p>Our objectives are to determine: (1) the feasibility of the trial procedures, including: recruitment of general practices and patients; the appropriateness of screening procedure and the selected measures; patient retention and data completion rates. (2) The acceptability of the internet intervention in supporting patient's use of, and adherence to, the intervention as well as physical activity recommendations, and the experience of patients in the intervention groups (this will be explored qualitatively). (3) The feasibility of physiotherapist telephone support, including: ability to contact patients; physiotherapists&#x02019; adherence to protocol; duration and number of calls made to patients. These objectives should enable decisions about the feasibility of moving to a definitive trial in future, and identify areas where the trial design may need to be modified.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methodology</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Design and setting</title><p>A single-blind, single-centre randomised controlled trial with three parallel arms to explore the feasibility of an internet intervention for patients with LBP in primary care.

Once recruited, GP practice staff identity patients via two methods:</p><p>(1) Patients who have consulted with LBP in the past 3&#x02005;months are identified from practice computerised records of consultations. The timeframe of the search will be extended to 6&#x02005;months if the number of patients identified is limited. Lists of patients identified by the search are being screened by a practice GP who will rule out patients based on aspects of the eligibility criteria that can be determined from patient notes. Practices then send out study packs to the patients deemed eligible at this stage. Study packs include an invitation letter from the GP, a patient information sheet and contact details of the research team should the patient be interested in taking part. This method of identification and invitation of eligible patients is expected to be the main method used by practices.</p><p>(2) Patients are opportunistically identified by GPs in clinics. GPs briefly mention the study to eligible patients in the consultation and provide the patients with a study pack.</p><p>Patients who respond to the research team are further screened by the study manager. The study manager contacts the patient by phone and confirms eligibility by asking if they have current back pain (currently in pain, or have experienced pain in the past 2&#x02005;weeks). Patients are then asked if they are experiencing 1 or more of 12 symptoms indicative of serious spinal pathology or systemic illness. These questions were initially developed for telephone-based musculoskeletal triage, and modified for this trial by the clinicians in the research team.

The randomisation sequence is automatically generated, and a computer-generated algorithm block randomises patients to the trial groups. As the sample size is small, blocking is being used to increase the chance of approximately equal numbers of patients allocated to each group. Patients are stratified by severity (&#x02265;7 on the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). As the software randomises patients, the sequencing will be concealed from the trial team.

Internet provision allows the material to be accessed, and the suggested activities to be carried out wherever is most convenient for the patients. The intervention was developed using the open source LifeGuide software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.lifeguideonline.org)">http://www.lifeguideonline.org)</ext-link>. The core of the intervention is focused on self-regulatory processes including graded goal setting, self-monitoring and tailored feedback to encourage physical activity/exercise increases or maintenance<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2015009524TB2">table 2</xref> for more details of intervention content). The intervention also forms a substantial repository of educational advice regarding pain and LBP-related topics. Throughout, the included educational information has a focus on motivating behaviour change through techniques such as reassuring patients about likely consequences of movement; helping patients interpret mild pain; modelling through patient stories; reinforcing positive behaviour (using automated feedback); and providing simple instructions/demonstrations regarding how to perform various back-specific exercises/behaviours. By combining the above features with in-depth feedback from patients with LBP, the aim was to develop a highly accessible intervention that would support improvements in self-efficacy and have the potential to improve physical function.</p><table-wrap id="BMJOPEN2015009524TB2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Summary table of optional SupportBack module content</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Session number</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Content</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Session 1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">

The aim is to ensure evidence-based suggestions and behaviour change theory are applied in such a way that the intervention fosters autonomy and is accessible and engaging for the target patient group.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> Twenty-two individuals, including 15 patients with LBP recruited from primary care practices and 7 from a local branch of the UK charity BackCare (formerly The National Back Pain Association), took part in interviews, through which they provided detailed qualitative feedback on an early pilot version of the internet intervention. Importantly, in line with the PBA, as well as providing comments on aesthetics and structure/navigation, participants were encouraged to discuss and provide detailed feedback on the content/advice based on their own lived experience of LBP. Elements of the content could then be reframed, or adjusted to ensure messages were not misconstrued. This method also allowed the identification of any areas where participants felt the intervention was &#x02018;stating the obvious&#x02019; and then amend content, as far as possible, adding unique aspects to encourage engagement (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2015009524TB2">table 2</xref> for further details).</p><p>The resulting internet intervention comprises six sessions. Patients are encouraged to access one session per week, to allow them to engage between sessions with the activity goals they have set themselves. Specifically, in the first session, patients are provided with information on how SupportBack will work, including the key rationale underlying the intervention; that keeping active is of primary importance when managing LBP. Likely concerns/potential barriers regarding this primary message are also addressed. The intervention then suggests two forms of activity patients can be supported with each week: walking or gentle back-specific exercises. Patients select one and set goals for the coming week. The recommendations provided are tailored, based on the extent patients report their LBP is obstructing their ability to engage with activities in their day-to-day lives.</p><p>From session 2 onwards, the intervention follows the same format. Patients review their goals from the previous week and are provided with automated tailored feedback and encouragement. They then have the opportunity to amend their goals, increase difficulty or switch to different activities. From session 2, after a patient's goal review, they can choose to explore one of six modules containing information and advice on a LBP-related topic (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2015009524TB2">table 2</xref> for details). Exploration of these information modules becomes part of each broader &#x02018;session&#x02019;. Although patients are advised to work through a session per week, they can view a new session every 3&#x02005;days if they wish. If engaged with as recommended, the intervention would take 6&#x02005;weeks to complete. After the 6&#x02005;weeks of structured sessions, patients will still have access to activity information and LBP-related modules as a static website. The intervention is fully automated and adherence is encouraged through weekly reminder emails containing links back to the intervention. A full development paper will be published describing the process of development in detail.</p></sec><sec id="s2e3"><title>Usual care plus internet intervention plus physiotherapist telephone support</title><p>All patients in this arm also continue to receive usual care as specified above. The SupportBack internet intervention is offered to these patients with the addition of up to 1&#x02005;h of telephone support from a physiotherapist. Trial physiotherapists are experienced musculoskeletal practitioners with spinal expertise. Although support will vary with patient need, it will not exceed 1&#x02005;h in total but could be less and consists of 1 up to 30&#x02005;min phone call followed by 2 up to 15&#x02005;min phone follow-ups over 6&#x02005;weeks. The purpose of the physiotherapy telephone contact is to provide support and encouragement for use of the internet intervention, and to address any concerns in relation to the internet-based content. The physiotherapists are asked to closely adhere to a standardised content checklist for each phone call (available on request to the corresponding author). While they are able to address individual patient concerns, they are asked to avoid additional individualised patient assessment and treatment recommendations beyond the internet intervention content to adhere to protocol fidelity.</p><p>Call 1 (up to 30&#x02005;min) is planned to take place between weeks 1 and 2 after randomisation. In this call, the physiotherapist explores and addresses the patient's understanding and attitudes (eg, belief that activity can be helpful for back pain); engagement with the internet intervention (eg, enquiring how patient has got on with their goals); anticipating barriers (asking what problems patients anticipate in participating in the SupportBack programme). Calls 2 and 3 (up to 15&#x02005;min) are planned to take place between weeks 2 and 3, and between weeks 4 and 5. In these telephone calls, the physiotherapist discusses general adherence; congratulates any adherence behaviour to both the internet intervention and physical activity goals; discusses barriers to adherence and how these might be addressed; encourages commitment to goals for the following week; and addresses any remaining concerns.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Intervention fidelity assessment</title><p>Use of an automated internet intervention will ensure all patients in the intervention arms have access to the same information and advice delivered through this medium. A 2&#x02005;h training session was provided for trial physiotherapists, along with detailed checklists of topics to be covered in each telephone call in order to attempt to maintain treatment fidelity in the telephone support arm. Intervention fidelity will be assessed in this arm by recording all telephone sessions and examining any systematic deviations from the protocol.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Outcomes and measures</title><sec id="s2g1"><title>Primary feasibility outcomes</title><p>The primary outcomes from this feasibility trial are descriptive, relating to the number of practices required to recruit the patient numbers; whether it is possible to recruit the target number of patients and in what time frame, including eligibility and recruitment rate per practice per month; whether problems were encountered with the screening of patients; number of patients withdrawing from the interventions and the trial and follow-up retention rates at 3&#x02005;months. With regard to the internet intervention, the extent of patients&#x02019; usage will be described. The process of physiotherapist support will also be described, along with adherence to the protocol and any significant issues encountered.</p></sec><sec id="s2g2"><title>Additional measures</title><p>Demographic data including gender, age, education, occupation and marital status are collected at baseline. See <xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2015009524TB3">table 3</xref> for full details of measures included. A range of LBP-related measures will be explored including disability, pain, pain-related psychological processes (eg, catastrophising and kinesiophobia), quality of life as well as physical activity. The clinical measures selected align with recommended outcome domains for clinical trials targeting LBP such as physical functioning, pain intensity and health-related quality of life.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> Measures are also included to inform future health economic analysis, for example, health resource use, examine adherence to back-related activities, and explore potential predictors that may affect engagement with the internet interventions (eg, exercise self-efficacy, credibility and expectancy). Patient adherence to the internet intervention will be explored by examining objective intervention usage data automatically collected by the LifeGuide internet intervention. These data will provide detailed information on number of logins, number of sessions accessed, physical activity goals set, module accessed as well as time spent on each webpage.</p><table-wrap id="BMJOPEN2015009524TB3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table&#x000a0;3</label><caption><p>Variables, measures and their characteristics</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/></colgroup><thead valign="bottom"><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Variable</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Measure</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Items</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Details</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Reliability where available</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Administration point, trial arms</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pain duration</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pain duration<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">This single item asks &#x02018;how long it was since you had a whole month without pain&#x02019;.

Nonetheless, adverse events will be recorded and reported to the trial team. Where necessary, the event will be discussed with clinical members of team, and the patient will be referred to their GP.
