To what extent surgery or the anesthetic drugs are attributable for such consequences is difficult to determine as both are inseparable.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT1">1</xref>] Cognitive dysfunction is an impairment of the information-processing abilities of the brain, like attention, perception, verbal abilities, learning and memory and abstract thinking.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT2">2</xref>] Post-operative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is one such subtle cerebral complication that is temporally seen following surgery. It is defined as decline of 20% or more in the cognitive screening scores on at least 20% or more of the psychometric tests performed pre-operatively and 1 week (early) and 3 months (delayed) post-operatively.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT3">3</xref>] Alternatively, deterioration by some criterion number of standard deviation units can be used for its diagnosis. The aged brain is different from the younger brain in several important aspects, including size, distribution and type of neurotransmitters, metabolic functions and capacity for plasticity. For these reasons, the elderly brain is more vulnerable and susceptible to the adverse neurological sequelae of surgery and anesthesia.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT4">4</xref>] Bedford in 1955 first published that anesthesia could have long-lasting amnesic effects. But, the term POCD has appeared only recently, covering a wide range of neuropsychological deviations, ranging from concentration impairment to delirium.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT5">5</xref>] POCD is a condition definedas an abnormality on neuropsychological testing, which can afflict up to 14% of the older than 70 years patients undergoing electivesurgery with no convincingly demonstrated surgical, anesthetic andenvironmental risk factors.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT8">8</xref>]</p><p>POCD after coronary artery bypass graft surgery was depicted to occur in 53% of the patients at discharge, 36% at 6 weeks and 24% at 6 months.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT9">9</xref>] The description of POCD remained contentious and many diverse definitions were put forth in surgical literatures.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT11">11</xref>] According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder, POCD is considered a mild neurocognitive disorder if the patient scores 12 or more points on the Delirium Rating Scale.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT12">12</xref>]</p><p>Risk factors of POCD can be divided into age and co-morbidity dependent and those related to anesthesia and surgery. Cardiovascular, orthopedic and urologic interventions carry a higher risk of POCD. Orthopedic surgeries, particularly those on the hip and knee, are associated with a high incidence of acute POCD as studied by Koch <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT13">13</xref>] Age is a well-established risk factor for the development of both early and delayed POCD, as demonstrated in ISPOCD1.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT15">15</xref>]</p><p>Increasing age and duration of anesthesia, little education, a second operation, post-operative infection and respiratory complications are the risk factors for early POCD at 1 week but only age was a risk factor for late POCD at 3 months.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT18">18</xref>] Acute post-operative pain has also been associated with poorer post-operative cognitive function. The degree of chronic pre-operative pain is however not related to pre-operative cognitive test performance.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT17">17</xref>] History of alcohol abuse in elderly patients has been found to be a risk for post-operative cognitive decline in the domains of visuospatial abilities and executive functions.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT18">18</xref>]</p><p>To what extent anesthesia itself is a causal factor for such deterioration of cognitive performance might be determined by a comparison of the post-operative decline of scores between groups receiving general anesthesia (GA) and regional anesthesia, respectively. In this context, an effort has been made in the present study to compare the cognitive changes in elderly patients undergoing hip and knee surgery following GA and epidural anesthesia (EA), respectively.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>The study was undertaken in a tertiary care hospital of Kolkata during March 2007 and August 2008. It was a prospective, randomized, parallel-group studyrecruiting60 adults of the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I and II, scheduled for hip and knee orthopedic surgery. For the purpose of sample size calculation, the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) component of the Kolkata Cognitive Screening Battery was used. In order to detect a difference of 1.5 in MMSE between the two study groups with 80% power and 5% probability of type 1 error, 29 subjects were required per group. This calculation assumed an SD of 2 in the MMSE score. Thus, 30 patients in each group were recruited. The exclusion criteria includedthose whose MMSE score at screening was &#x02264;23, patients with diseases of the central nervous system, patients with history of consumption of tranquilizers or antidepressants, patients with severe visual or auditory handicap, patients currently diagnosed with alcoholism or drug dependence, history of previous neuropsychological testing, those having a geriatric depression score &#x02265;21, patients undergoing a second procedure even if unrelated and patients of ASA grade III and IV (i.e., with coexisting severe cardiovascular, respiratory, renal or hepatic diseases).</p><p>The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee. All the patients or their caregivers were explained about the purpose of the study and were ensured strict confidentiality, and a written informed consent was obtained from each of the patients prior to the study. They were given the option of not participating in the study if they did not want to.</p><p>All patients were screened using MMSE. Patients with scores fulfilling the inclusion criteria were further tested with the components of the Kolkata Cognitive Screening Battery. Our cognitive screening test battery consisted of category-based verbal fluency tests (fruits and animals), a 15-item version of the object naming test, mental state examination, calculation tests, visuo-constructional ability (which included drawing the circle, diamond, overlapping rectangles and box) and a set of memory tests that consisted of immediate memory, delayed and recognition of a 10-item wordlist. This test battery has already been used and validated by Ganguli and her colleagues in a rural Ballabgarh population in north India and was named the Kolkata Cognitive Screening Battery.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT21">21</xref>] Patients were subsequently randomized into two groups, groups A and B, to receive GA and EA, respectively, representing an equal number in both groups and an equal distribution of sexes. All the patients were pre-medicated with oral diazepam 5 mg 2 h prior to surgery. Patients were monitored with electrocardiography, pulse oximetry and non-invasive blood pressure measurement.</p><p>Patients of group A were pre-oxygenated for 3 min and administered fentanyl (2 &#x003bc;g/kg). Induction was achieved with thiopentone sodium (4&#x02013;6 mg/kg) intravenously till loss of eye lash reflex was observed. Muscle relaxation was acquired with vecuronium bromide (100 &#x003bc;g/kg) and the participants were ventilated with face mask till cuffed endotracheal tube of appropriate size was inserted under direct laryngoscopic visualization. After intubation, its position was confirmed using capnography and chest auscultation and then mechanically ventilated. Patients were subsequently maintained on nitrous oxide (66%) in oxygen and halothane (0.5 MAC), with top-up doses of fentanyl and vecuronium as required. After completion of surgery, the anesthetics were discontinued and the patients were extubated following reversal of neuromuscular blockade with neostigmine (50 &#x003bc;g/kg) and glycopyrrolate (10 &#x003bc;g/kg). Post-operative analgesia was maintained with tramadol (2 mg/kg) intramuscularly on request along with diclofenac sodium (75 mg) intramuscularly twice-daily. In group B patients, under strict aseptic precaution and on infiltration with local anesthetic, a epidural 18G multiorifice catheter was placed 2 cm inside the lumbar epidural space through a 16G Tuohy epidural needle. The epidural space was identified by the loss of resistance technique using saline. A test dose of 3 ml of 2% lignocaine with 1:200000 adrenaline was administered through the epidural catheter port on negative aspiration of cerebrospinal fluid and blood. This was to rule out accidental intrathecal or intravascular placement. On confirmation of proper positioning within the epidural space, intraoperative anesthesia was induced with 16&#x02013;18 ml of 0.5% bupivacaine. Subsequent top-up doses were given according to requirement and duration of surgery. In the post-operative period, analgesia was maintained with intermittent epidural boluses of 50 mg tramadol in 10 ml normal saline at 6-hourly intervals. Catheters were removed after 48 h following surgery. Surgeries were undertaken as a routine procedure and the operated patients were re-evaluated after 1 week using the Kolkata Cognitive Screening Battery as done pre-operatively.</p><p>The study findings were disseminated to the patients and their caregivers in health education sessions to complement the findings of the study.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The collected data were thoroughly cleaned and entered into MS-Excel spread sheets and analysis was carried out. The procedures involved were transcription, preliminary data inspection, content analysis and interpretation. The statistical analyses were carried out using Graph Pad In Stat &#x0201c;version 3&#x0201d; software. Cognitive screening scores were compared between the two groups using Student&#x02019;s unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test, with a Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The two groups were comparable regarding age and sex.

Using the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale revised pre-operatively and post-operatively, cognitive functions did not change significantly in young adult patients after either general or regional vertebral nor in elderly patients who received regional vertebral as compared with the pre-operative levels. Regional vertebral analgesia was observed to be advantageous over GA for elderly patients in terms of a better post-operative neuropsychological functioning.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT27">27</xref>]</p><p>In the Peking University First Hospital study, cognitive function was assessed pre-operatively and 7 days post-operatively using a battery of nine neuropsychological tests in elderly patients.

Also, as there are many risk factors for POCD and all of them were not taken care of, the results may be confounding. It would have been better if we could have extended our study to incorporate social factors related to the research. Despite this limitation, results are believed to be significant, considering that significant number of patients undergoing only orthopedic interventions were recruited in comparison to studies reported in previous literatures.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Future directions of the study</title><p>The target organ for anesthetic drugs is the central nervous system. For years together, we had reason to believe that their effects do not outlive their pharmacological actions and that the function of the brain is restored once the drug gets eliminated. There is a need for compilation of increasing evidence in this direction.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Our study showed a significant statistical difference in cognitive functions in patients undergoing hip and knee surgery following GA or EA. Despite several attempts, no gold standard treatment has been devised for POCD. Numerous techniques have been proposed to minimize the risk and reduce perioperative cerebral damage. Such suggestions are rarely evidence based and merely empirically developed strategies. The main objective is to maintain a stable hemodynamic and physiological state, including ventilation, metabolism and blood chemistry. Hypoxia, hypo or hypercapnoea, hypo or hyperglycemia and alteration of sodium amplify the clinical impact of acute vascular cerebral damage and thus their prevention might have a role in reducing the incidence of POCD.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None
