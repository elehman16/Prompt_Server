The original primary endpoint for this registered trial was CD4 cell count &#x0003c;200 cells/&#x003bc;L.<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> The phases of the analysis are described in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>. The Harvard Institutional Review Board, the Florida International University Institutional Review Board, the Botswana Health Research Unit of the Botswana Ministry of Health, and the Independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board consisting of two members from Botswana (statistician and HIV physician) and three members from the US (two infectious disease physicians from Tufts and Harvard Universities and one epidemiologist from Florida International University), approved the protocols before initiation and monitored the study's performance. The study adhered to the Guidelines for the Protection of Human Subjects of Research of the US National Research Act, the Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research that were created by the Act, and the Belmont Report.

Pregnancy was an exclusion criterion, because it requires prenatal micronutrient supplementation. Using a factorial design, the participants were randomized into four arms and followed monthly for 24 months for supplement dispensation and follow-up.</p><p id="P11">During the baseline visit and every 3 months for 2 years, blood was drawn to measure CD4 cell counts and the study nurse or study physician completed physical examinations and collected the participants' medical history and prescriptions with an emphasis on TB status. Time and duration of IPT was abstracted from medical charts.

The acceptability and adherence to the supplement, as well as the adverse effects and morbidity were documented monthly. Adherence was measured with monthly pill counts and a five-question questionnaire about the frequency of missed doses and the reasons for missing them. To maintain blinding, all the pills were coated with an opaque vanilla flavor to look and taste similarly.

All participants received their routine medical care at the Botswana&#x02013;Harvard Partnership/Florida International University Research Clinic, and any abnormal laboratory values found in the process of research were referred to their physician.

In addition, we have shown previously that supplementation with MVT (vitamin B complex and vitamins C and E) and selenium delayed HIV disease progression and was safe in this population.<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> The rate of extrapulmonary TB was unusually high in comparison with the rate of cases of pulmonary TB, but this is consistent with other studies which found that in HIV/TB coinfection, the cases of extrapulmonary TB are almost double.<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup></p><p id="P26">Other studies of nutritional supplementation among TB patients and HIV/TB coinfection have supported the beneficial effect of selenium supplementation on cases of active TB. Range et al<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> supplemented MVTs, Se and copper with or without zinc in a factorial design to 499 TB patients, of whom 213 (43%) were HIV/TB coinfected and were undergoing TB treatment for 8 months. Compared to placebo, supplementation reduced mortality by &#x0223c;70% in the HIV/TB coinfected group at the end of their TB treatment. In Tanzania, Villamor et al<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> provided a formula with MVTs and selenium to 887 patients diagnosed with TB disease, who were initiating their TB treatment; of these participants, 471 were coinfected with HIV. In this study, MVTs with selenium significantly decreased the risk of TB recurrence by 45% overall and by 63% in the HIV/TB coinfected patients. Supplementation also increased the CD3+ and CD4+ cell counts and decreased the incidence of extrapulmonary TB and genital ulcers in patients who were HIV negative. In contrast, in a research trial in Malawi, Semba et al<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> did not find significant differences on survival in patients with TB regardless of their HIV status, when supplementation of an MVT&#x02013;mineral formula for 24 months was compared with placebo pills.</p><p id="P27">In HIV/TB coinfection, the combined infections have a depressive synergistic effect on immunity and nutritional status and accelerate HIV disease progression.<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> Treatment with micronutrients has an immune-stimulatory effect,<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> especially in areas where micronutrient deficiencies are common.<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> The short-term supplementation with micro-nutrients, however, seems to be less effective in changing disease outcomes than long-term supplementation,<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> which seems to be effective in supporting nutritional status and reversing the metabolic abnormalities produced by the combined infections.<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> While micronutrient supplementation, including MVT and selenium, has improved both HIV and TB outcomes in patients who were either already diagnosed with TB or were HIV/TB coinfected,<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> this is the first clinical trial that showed a significant effect of micronutrients early in HIV disease, prior to treatment, in delaying HIV disease progression<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> and preventing the development of new cases of TB in an ART-na&#x000ef;ve, HIV-infected adult population.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup></p><p id="P28">Several mechanisms of action may be involved in the relationship between nutrients and these infections. Both HIV and TB disease may produce micronutrient deficiencies and rapid weight loss by increasing nutrient demands, altering metabolic mechanisms or by inducing anorexia.<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> In turn, low BMI and deficiencies in nutrients needed to mount adequate immune responses, such as selenium, may lower cell-mediated immunity, an important host defense against both HIV and TB, as well as increase the susceptibility to TB activation and delay or prevent the response to anti-TB treatment.<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup></p><p id="P29">Our studies, as well as those of other investigators, have shown that deficiencies of several micronutrients, such as B vitamins, vitamins C and E, and selenium, are associated with HIV-1&#x02013;related prognosis and mortality in HIV-infected people.<sup><xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup> The evidence from this study supports the public health recommendation of providing low-cost supplementation with selenium and MVT to PLWH in the asymptomatic stages of HIV infection to slow the disease progression and decrease the incidence of TB. Adequate nutritional status is critical at all stages of infection, because malnutrition, as a comorbid condition in infections, weakens the immune response, allowing infections to fester and become fatal.<sup><xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup></p><p id="P30">In agreement with other studies of effectiveness of IPT in this region, our findings suggested that the earlier strategy of 6-month IPT without TST did not provide additional protection to PLWH, once the therapy ended.<sup><xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup> New research by Smith et al<sup><xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup> conducted in Botswana suggests that to increase the benefits and cost-effectiveness of IPT in PLWH, it needs to be targeted on TST-positive, HIV-infected people with CD4 cell counts &#x0003c;250 cell/&#x003bc;L and provided for at least 36 months.<sup><xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>Limitations</title><p id="P31">The study targets a secondary outcome of the original study on the effect of nutritional supplementation on HIV disease progression, including AIDS-defining conditions, of which TB is one of the most devastating. The parent clinical trial study<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> had a strong design, high internal validity, adequate power and adherence to supplementation, and very modest drop-out rates. Randomization of the cohort ensured that the exposure characteristics of the four groups were balanced, including exposure to IPT, TB and other opportunistic infections. Our findings are preliminary and demonstrate the need for a well-designed study on the effect of supplementation on the manifestation of TB disease in PLWH before and after ART. Our results might be generalizable only to other HIV-infected cohorts in resource-limited settings, where TB disease and inadequate nutritional status are endemic, and the initiation of ART is withheld depending on the levels and rate of decline of CD4 cell counts, unless the treatment is clinically indicated.</p><p id="P32">The effect of nutrient supplementation on morbidity and mortality in HIV infection might have been understated, as some participants might have discontinued from the study because of developing other endpoints that might have qualified them for ART before developing TB disease. In addition, participants with the potential for developing active TB might have been lost to follow-up, have died or have become severely ill with other conditions during the time of this research. However, there were no differences in the percentage of participants lost to follow-up in the four arms of the study (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Initiation of ART is recommended after the initiation of TB treatment in cases with a diagnosis of TB disease,<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> and supplementation with micronutrients is not a substitute for early ART; however, it is one more tool for supporting the immune system that it is under the double attack of HIV and TB.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="S16"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="P33">This randomized clinical trial confirmed that micronutrient supplementation of ART-na&#x000ef;ve PLWH, who were early in the disease processes, was safe and reduced TB-related morbidity in Botswana.
