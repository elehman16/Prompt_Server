A major task in medical education is to impart profound physical examination skills. However, recent literature raises concerns over declining abilities of graduates to perform a thorough physical examination [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Factors contributing to this development include a scarcity of good teaching patients, skilled faculty, and time for bedside teaching [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Also, increasing specialisation has led to an over-reliance on technology and a loss of the big picture [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Hence, teaching and accurately assessing basic examination skills may more and more become a challenge in medical education.</p><p>Over the last decades several strategies have been established to secure the quality of physical examination skills training. These include the introduction of standardised patients (SPs) and patient instructors [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], the application of checklists and rating forms [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], the implementation of Objective Structured Clinical Examinations (OSCEs) [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and systematic direct observations of patient encounters [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In practice, however, these tools do not always take effect as intended. E.g., in a study from Taiwan, 22% of final year students reported to have never been observed in a physical examination (36% never by faculty) and 10% felt not yet confident with the procedure [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. </p><p>In our faculty, we evaluate a standardized head-to-toe examination of every third year student immediately after a tutorial over the first five weeks of the semester. However, we frequently receive complaints concerning the fairness of these assessments. Reliability and accuracy of faculty evaluation is indeed known to be low [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Structuring the evaluation by a rating form markedly increases the accuracy of the observations, but does not improve the agreement in the overall assessment [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. This may be due to the fact that the raters' strategies to integrate information are rather individual and that the frame of reference differs between the raters [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Studies from personnel psychology indicate that frame-of-reference training in groups can improve the accuracy in performance appraisal [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The goal of such training is to teach raters to share a common conceptualisation of performance. It thereby imposes more accurate schemes [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. We therefore planned to implement a rater training for the assessment of the physical examination skills.</p><p>Surprisingly, studies on rater training in medical education are scarce and the results are somewhat disappointing. In a small study, Newble and co-workers investigated the impact of training on the ratings of five videotaped physical examinations [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. They gave either no training, performance feedback to the raters in one group, or feedback with additional training, including a discussion of another videotaped encounter, in a third group. There were no notable differences in the re-ratings of the videotapes after two months in either group. Holmboe and co-workers studied the effects of an intensive multi-dimensional rater training on the ratings of videotaped patient encounters eight months after training [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The trained faculty was more stringent and had a smaller range in some of the ratings. More recently, Cook and co-workers investigated the effects of similar but shorter training on interrater reliability and accuracy of mini-CEX ratings in a resident program [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The training did not improve these parameters. </p><p>To test whether a rater training would improve accuracy in our setting we undertook this study. Our setting differs from previous studies in several aspects: </p><p>Firstly, our rating focussed on a defined skill rather than assessing overall performance. Secondly, we standardized the physical examination task and all raters were familiar with the faculty standard. And thirdly, while previous studies relied on videotaped and scripted situations to determine the quality of rating, we had the chance to study real-live encounters between examinees and standardized patients (SPs). This implies that the grading was relevant and that the raters had to announce their decisions face to face to the examinees. For evaluation we videotaped all the exams and let three observers independently grade the students' performance retrospectively. We hypothesised that trained raters would rate more in line with the post-hoc observers, hence, being more accurate. We also sought to assess the effects of the rater training on stringency and the range of the grades. </p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Curricular embedment</title><p>The physical examination skills assessment was part of a course in physical examination to medical students at the beginning of their third year. The goal of this part of the course is to teach the students the basics of the physical examination in general internal medicine. After training the course continues with bedside teaching. The procedure is standardised to a head-to-toe screening physical examination and includes the inspection of head and mouth, the inspection and palpation of the neck, the complete examination of thorax and abdomen, an orientating examination of the vascular system (including measurement of one blood pressure), and the inspection of the limbs. A video explaining the standardised procedure is accessible to all students on the web. Other elements of the physical examination such as the pelvic, the musculoskeletal, and the neurological examination are taught in other parts of the course.</p><p>Training takes place in the first five weeks of the winter semester. It consists of five ninety-minute lectures and the same amount of training with peer examinations in groups of six students instructed by one experienced internist each. The assessment of the students&#x02019; skills is scheduled in the sixth week. The students&#x02019; task is to present the standardised examination with a standardized patient (SP) in a time limit of ten minutes. The raters are physicians selected from the medical departments of the University Hospital. They watch the students&#x02019; performance, give feedback, and rate the performance by assigning a grade (German school grading, see table 1 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="T1">(Tab. 1)</xref>). They do not interfere with the students&#x02019; examination nor do they ask theoretical questions. Each rater assesses six students in a time frame of fifteen minutes per student on two days each. The SPs are healthy students. They are instructed to behave passively and only to comply with coherent commands.</p><p>For this study, twenty-one physicians were chosen to rate the performance of 242 students. All twenty-one raters were familiar with the learning objectives of the course, the free accessible video of the standard procedure on the web, and the feedback code. Eleven out of these twenty-one individuals were randomly chosen to undergo the rater training. For the randomisation, the raters were numbered and then assigned to the groups by numbers derived from a website creating random numbers in a given range. To determine the accuracy of the grading all the examinations were videotaped for further evaluation. Both raters and students gave written informed consent before the study. The study was approved by means of the local ethics committee. The work was carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and the anonymity of all participants was guaranteed.</p><sec><title>Intervention</title><p>The eleven raters chosen for the training were split into two groups (six and five persons per group, respectively) to achieve a smaller group size. The training was scheduled in the end of the week before the skills assessment (Thursday and Friday afternoon, respectively, skills assessment on Monday and Tuesday afternoon). Training was limited to ninety minutes. In a short introduction, the moderator (author GW) stated the goals and the standards of the assessment as well as the rating dimensions (see table 2 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="T2">(Tab. 2)</xref>. The raters were then shown four videos showing different fourth-year students performing the standardised examination with a standardised SP at different levels of competence. The videos were presented in the same order in both training groups. After each presentation the raters were asked to assess the performance using a checklist with seven dimensions (see table 2 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="T2">(Tab. 2)</xref>) and to write down their grades for each item (see table 1 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="T1">(Tab. 1)</xref>). The raters then read out all their grades and for each item the raters with the most different grades were asked to justify their judgement. The ensuing discussions of all participants were chaired by the moderator. After all dimensions had been discussed, the moderator gave feedback featuring the embedded faults of each video. </p></sec><sec><title>Examination skills assessment</title><p>Because the untrained raters were not familiar with checklist forms both the trained and the untrained raters were asked to assign an overall grade for the whole performance of the students (see table 1 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="T1">(Tab. 1)</xref>). Hence, the scoring method of the training was abandoned for the actual assessment. After the assessment each of the tested students was asked to fill in a questionnaire about his or her views on the assessment and to grade his or her own performance. Additionally, the raters were asked to give information on their experience in assessing students, their views on the idea of rater training and on their own performance (see figure 1 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">(Fig. 1)</xref>), and (in case of the trained raters) their satisfaction with the training on a five-point scale. The videos of the examinations were collected from the examination rooms, cut, and the allocation to trained and untrained raters was made anonymous. </p></sec><sec><title>Video-based re-assessment</title><p>All the videotaped examinations were re-evaluated by three observers, one faculty member and two fifth-year students who as a group underwent the same training described above (moderated by author CV). All videotapes were evaluated by global rating at first. Subsequently the observers performed the dimension-evaluation that had been applied in the training concluding with a second overall rating. The observers rated the videos independently of each other and were unaware of the randomisation. The reference rating for the analysis was defined as the median of the three observers' ratings.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistics</title><p>The grades are given as medians with 1<sup>st</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> quartiles. For reasons of graphical presentability the mean &#x000b1;standard error of means (SEM) and &#x000b1;standard deviation (SD), respectively, are used in the figures. The range of the ratings is given as the mean standard deviation per rater &#x000b1;SD. Kendall's coefficient of concordance was calculated for every pair of observers and for all three observers together. The primary outcome measure was the difference between the raters' and the observers' ratings given as absolute value. The determining factor was the training and the studied entity were the students considering that every rater evaluated several students. This model was analysed by generalised estimating equations with exchangeable correlation structures. Parameter estimates <italic>&#x003b2;</italic> with standard errors are presented. Likewise, the effect of experience on accuracy and the effect of the training on grading were investigated using generalized estimating equations.</p><p>For the self-assessment of students, the effect of training on the self-assessed grades as well as on the agreement with the raters&#x02019; grade was analyzed using Mann-Whitney U tests. Moreover, concordance between the raters' grading and the self-assessment was estimated by Kendall's coefficient. To control for multiple tests, we adhered to the following test hierarchy: Firstly we tested the concordance between the three observers using a significance level of 5%. Only if this was significant, we tested whether the training had an effect on the accuracy, again at a significance level of 5%. All the other tests are reported for descriptive purposes only. All analyses were performed using SPSS and R, version 2.15.0 [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.R-project.org">http://www.R-project.org</ext-link>].</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Global results</title><p>All twenty-one raters completed the study. The characteristics of trained and untrained raters are given in table 3 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="T3">(Tab. 3)</xref>. The randomly chosen training group was older and there were more males, and more senior and experienced physicians in this group. Of the 247 students scheduled for the assessment, 242 (98%) completed the assessment, and 218 assessments (90%) were successfully taped on video. 208 students of the latter group (95%) completed the questionnaire. The median of the number of rated students per rater was 11 in each group (4-12 in the untrained and 5-12 in the trained group, respectively).</p><sec><title>Observers&#x02019; ratings and their concordance</title><p>To assess the accuracy of the ratings, the median of the global ratings of the three observers was used as comparison. The difference between this median and the grade of the rater was used to estimate the (lack of) accuracy. To evaluate the adequacy of this, we estimated the coefficient of concordance between the observers, which was 0.70 (<italic>P</italic>=5.84x10<sup>-19</sup>). The concordance was higher between the two student observers (0.90, <italic>P</italic>=6.58x10-<sup>12</sup>) than between the faculty member and the students (0.70, <italic>P</italic>=1.26x10<sup>-4</sup> and 0.73, <italic>P</italic>=1.01x10<sup>-5</sup>, respectively). Sixty-one and 75% of the students' ratings equalled the median of all three raters, respectively, and 30% of the faculty's ratings. The median overall grading [1<sup>st</sup>;3<sup>rd</sup> quartile] of the observers was 2 [1-;2-] (German school grading, see table 1 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="T1">(Tab. 1)</xref>). Comparing the grades among observers, the faculty's median grade [1<sup>st</sup>;3<sup>rd</sup> quartile] was more stringent than the students' grades (2- [2+;3] versus 2 [1-;2-] both). The overall ratings of the observers after assessing the seven dimensions (see table 2 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="T2">(Tab. 2)</xref>) were virtually the same as these ratings and did not enter further analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Effect of training on grading and accuracy, effect of experience on accuracy</title><p>The median overall grading [1<sup>st</sup>;3<sup>rd</sup> quartile] of the trained raters was 2 [1-;2-] and of the untrained raters 2+ [1;2], respectively.

Trained raters were more stringent than their untrained counterparts but did not apply a wider range of grades. These results largely reflect the outcome of previous studies on rater training in a medical context. In the study by Newble and coworkers [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], raters were asked to fill in a rating form and rating quality was measured by the consistency of the raters in assessing five videotaped encounters. Similar to our study, this study focussed on physical examination skills. Despite the rather specific task, the overall consistency was only moderate to acceptable and did not change after the training. The most inconsistent ratings were given in the items "general approach to the patient" and "general observation", indicating that global rating categories (as applied in our study) were more difficult to agree on than more specific categories. </p><p>Holmboe and co-workers studied the effects of a four-day faculty development course on the rating of nine scripted videotaped clinical encounters using a mini-CEX rating form [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The trained faculty members felt significantly more comfortable with their evaluations of real-live encounters in a follow-up survey. After eight months the participants were re-assessed. The trained raters were found to rate significantly more stringent partially with smaller ranges of ratings. The accuracy of ratings was represented by the capability to discriminate three different levels of competence displayed in the videos. This discrimination was good in the trained and untrained raters both before and after the training. Although the approach in this study was fundamentally different to ours, the higher stringency of the trained raters and the lack of evidence for an effect on accuracy very much resemble the results of our study. </p><p>The effects of a rater training on accuracy was more specifically studied by Cook and coworkers [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Eighteen of the thirty-two videos used in the pre- and post-test, respectively, were the same scripted videos used by Holmboe and co-workers. The time span between training and the re-assessment in this study was one month. Accuracy was estimated by discrimination of the mean ratings between the scripted levels of competence, by the frequency with which ratings matched scripted performance, and (because of disagreements with the scripted performance ratings) by a chance-corrected agreement using intraclass correlation coefficients. The rater training had no effect at all on either of these accuracy measures. Notably, the interrater reliability for the ratings in the subcategory "physical examination" was comparably small. This might indicate that it was particularly difficult to achieve an agreement on the performance ratings in physical examination.</p><p>Our study differed to the previous studies on rater training in one decisive point. While the other studies used prepared video scenes to assess rating scores, we investigated real-live student-SP encounters and re-assessed them by video recordings. Re-assessing examinations by videotapes may have an impact on the ratings and has been formerly studied. In a study dealing with an OSCE assessing joint examination skills, the investigators found a moderate interrater-reliability between live and video raters [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The authors point out that the range was similar to previously published interrater-reliability scores of live raters [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. A second study with pharmacy students specifically studied the intra-rater reliability after one month [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The reliability was high; however, due to a higher stringency in the video rating, more candidates would have failed in the post-hoc assessment. A higher stringency in video ratings had already been observed in the first study on joint examinations and in tendency was also present in our study. This effect is most likely due to the fact that an on-scene rater has to announce his judgement face-to-face to the student, while a video observer does not have to take responsibility for his ratings. Announcing decisions face-to-face indeed influences the ratings towards greater leniency [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Since this affected both groups equally in our study, we do not consider it crucial for the interpretation of our data.</p><p>To overcome the problem of low interrater-reliability in rating medical encounters [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], we re-assessed the videotaped encounters by three observers each. Two of the observers were senior students; the third observer was a faculty member. Trained students have been shown to be equally reliable in rating the practical skills of their junior peers than faculty staff [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], [<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Latter studies also show that faculty staff rate more stringently than do student assessors. This was obvious in our study. Hence, by choosing the median of the three observers as the measure for accuracy, the student observers' ratings dominated the re-ratings. This might be a concern in the interpretation of the data. Moreover, the randomisation process in our study skewed the allocation of the raters to the groups: the raters in the training group were older, more likely male, and senior and they were more frequently experienced in testing students. These factors have been shown to have no [<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], [<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] or marginal [<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] influence on ratings. Accordingly, in our study we were also unable to find an influence of the factor "rating experience" on rating accuracy.</p><p>Other concerns might be the size of the study and the type of intervention. To reduce the effect of intra-observer variety we tried to achieve a sample size of at least ten examinees per rater. Due to the size of the students' cohort, the number of raters was therefore limited to a little over twenty. This was also the number of physicians we were able to recruit from the medical departments for the time of the exams. The time limit of the training was related to the time spent for the ratings (ninety minutes on either day). A greater number of raters or more training would not have been feasible in our setting. We also believe that the effort of a more intensive intervention with the chance of a measurable effect on accuracy would not match the benefit. </p><p>However, some other aspects of the study seem noteworthy. Firstly, the time between the training and the exams was relatively short implying that the effect of the training was still present at the time of the ratings. Secondly, the task to be presented by the students was very clear and uniform. Hence, case specificy and contextual factors as sources of rater errors [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], [<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] could largely be eliminated from the experiment. And thirdly, one can also argue that the training indeed had some kind of effect on accuracy. The stringency of overall grading of the trained raters was significantly closer to the observers' gradings and (despite the lack of individual accuracy) can be viewed as more accurate for the group. Consequently, the trained raters were rather less lenient than more stringent. The effect had already been observed in the study by Holmboe and coworkers [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and suggests that the training in a way helped to standardise the raters' frame of reference by assigning a more appropriate range of ratings. However, the idiosyncrasy of processing the observations and converting the judgements to an ordinal scale [<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] within this range obviously remained unaffected. </p><p>The untrained raters also denied the possibility of a halo effect in their ratings more consistently than the trained raters. This might well be a training effect and implies that training may be able to raise the awareness of a cognitive bias. Moreover, the students assessed by the trained raters rather felt incorrectly judged, stating more often that their grading was inadequate. This can easily be explained by the more stringent grades in this group. The observation that despite this difference there was a similarly high concordance between the self-assessment of the students and the raters' gradings in both groups could be due to the fact that the students filled in the questionnaire straight after the announcement of the grade. Hence, although the students in the trained raters' group were more likely discontent with the grading, their self-assessment was strongly influenced by the raters' judgement. </p><p>In conclusion, our study focussed on the curricular assessment of a very specific task, a brief and highly standardised physical examination. Rater training failed to have an impact on the raters' individual accuracy. However, the stringency of ratings was more in line with the observers' assessment when the raters were trained. Moreover, the trained raters were rather aware of a halo effect and their ratees were more likely discontent with their grade. The data suggest that rater training did have some kind of effect but that the idiosyncrasy of judgement in assessing complex medical skills is too strong to be influenced by a single training. The effort of implementing rater training in order to improve fairness of exams may therefore not be effective. Ratings of medical performance, however, should be interpreted with discretion. </p></sec><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors are deeply indebted to Prof. Jana J&#x000fc;nger and Dr. Andreas M&#x000f6;ltner from the Center of Excellence for Assessment in Medicine Baden-W&#x000fc;rttemberg (Heidelberg, Germany) for sharing their expertise during the planning phase and in the statistical evaluation, and for providing video equipment.
