In this study, the development of <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-depleted microfilariae (first stage larvae) to infective third stage larvae (L3) in the insect vector <italic>Simulium damnosum </italic>was analysed.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Infected volunteers in Cameroon were randomly and blindly allocated into doxycycline (200 mg/day for 6 weeks) or placebo treatment groups.

Larval stages recovered from the insect vector had similar levels of reduction of endosymbiotic bacteria. Larval recoveries were analysed longitudinally after treatment to follow the kinetics of larval development.

The number of infections is estimated to be ~ 37 million [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The chronic nature and morbidity of onchocerciasis is associated with microfilariae (first stage larvae; Mf) that migrate through the skin and the eye. When the Mf die, the immune response to the dead larvae can result in dermatitis, skin atrophy and inflammation in the eyes. The latter can progress into reduced vision and blindness. Vector control and mass treatment with ivermectin, a strong microfilaricidal drug which can produce temporary sterility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], have been successfully used to regionally reduce the burden of parasite infection. Due to the resumption of fertility after interruption of ivermectin treatment, the drug has to be administered for many years. Studies in Ghana have identified <italic>O. volvulus </italic>populations that are less responsive to ivermectin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], therefore identification of new drug regimens is required before ivermectin resistance may develop and spread. Ideally a new drug would have macrofilaricidal and/or permanent sterilising activity.</p><p>In recent years, key drug trials have been performed with a new chemotherapeutical approach to anti-filarial therapy, the targeting of the essential <italic>Wolbachia </italic>endobacteria present in many filariae with the antibiotic doxycycline. This approach has resulted in long-term sterilisation of adult female worms in onchocerciasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. More importantly, anti-wolbachial therapy also results in a macrofilaricidal effect in <italic>O. volvulus </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>Doxycycline affects several stages in the parasite life cycle. Embryonic stages from morulae to coiled Mf are the most sensitive to <italic>Wolbachia </italic>depletion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The development from L3 (infective larval stage) into adult worms is also affected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In the mammalian host, Mf are apparently unaffected by the decreased endobacterial load [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. However, the effect of <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-depletion on <italic>O. volvulus </italic>larval development from Mf to L3 in the obligate arthropod vector remains unknown. Arumugam et al. showed that larvae of the rodent filaria <italic>Litomosoides sigmodontis </italic>were dependent upon the endosymbionts for development into infective L3 larvae in the mite vector [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Fewer female worms were able to develop from <italic>Wolbachia </italic>depleted Mf, because of their need of a higher threshold level of endobacteria to survive.</p><p>This study was designed to investigate whether <italic>Wolbachia </italic>endobacteria are essential for the transmission of onchocerciasis. To determine this, we analysed the role of <italic>Wolbachia </italic>in the development of <italic>O. volvulus </italic>Mf into L3 infective larvae in the <italic>Simulium </italic>vector by depleting the endobacteria from the Mf prior to their ingestion by blackflies during a blood meal.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Ethical approval</title><p>This study received ethical clearance from the Institutional Review Board of the Tropical Medicine Research Station, Kumba and was conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975 as revised in 1983, 2000 and 2002.</p></sec><sec><title>Selection of study patients and treatment</title><p>In November and December 2006, participants for the study were recruited in four neighbouring villages in an onchocerciasis-endemic region of South West Cameroon (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Patients for the study were selected from male volunteers, aged 21 to 50 years, after informed consent was signed. Exclusion criteria were abnormal hepatic (SGPT and SGOT) and renal (creatinine) functions, persons with chronic infections and under prolonged medication, alcohol abuse and intolerance to doxycycline. As there was mass treatment with ivermectin in the area in April 2006, all patients were asked whether they took their doses at this time or any time before, but all volunteers answered in the negative. Inclusion criteria were absence of other clinically manifested diseases as assessed by a medical doctor and &#x02265; 10 Mf in skin biopsies. Two bloodless skin biopsies, one from each iliac crest of each participant, were aseptically obtained using a Holth corneoscleral punch. Each biopsy was immersed in 2 drops of 0.9% NaCl solution in a separate well of a labelled 96-well round-bottom microtiter plate. The plates were transported to the laboratory and skin biopsies were incubated overnight at room temperature to allow the emergence of Mf into the saline solution. The Mf were counted using 10-fold magnification of a microscope and the number of Mf were expressed as Mf per skin biopsy.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Study timeline of recruitment, treatment and analysis</bold>.

Thus, the local blackfly population was sexually mature, seeking blood meals, and their river location was essentially free of endogenous <italic>O. volvulus </italic>infections.</p></sec><sec><title>Kinetics of larval development</title><p>To determine the skin microfilarial loads and recovery of <italic>O. volvulus </italic>larvae from flies that had fed on doxycycline or placebo treated individuals, skin biopsies and dissected flies were analysed for developing larvae. Mf were counted and expressed as Mf per skin biopsy. The median number of L1, L2, and L3 larvae collected after fly dissection was calculated per treatment group (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). Because the number of flies that were dissected from each volunteer was different due to different numbers recovered at the biting site and different survival rates in the insectarium, the proportions of each larval stage that developed in each treatment group were plotted against the month of dissection (month post-treatment) to follow the kinetics of larval development (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). A repeated measures ANOVA determined that there was a significant difference in L3 recovery between the 5 measurement time-points (P &#x0003c; 0.001, Pillai-Spur) but no clear interaction between the measurement time-points and the treatment (P = 0.092, Pillai-Spur), although the doxycycline group was different (P = 0.005).</p><table-wrap id="T3" position="float"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Larval recoveries from skin snips and blood-fed black flies of doxycycline and placebo treated volunteers</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th align="center" colspan="2">Mf</th><th align="center" colspan="2">L1/L2</th><th align="center" colspan="2">L3</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><bold>Month</bold><sup><bold>a</bold></sup></td><td align="center"><bold>Doxy</bold><sup><bold>b</bold></sup><break/><bold>n = 7</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Placebo</bold><break/><bold>n = 5</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Doxy</bold><break/><bold>n = 7</bold><sup><bold>c</bold></sup></td><td align="center"><bold>Placebo</bold><break/><bold>n = 5</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Doxy</bold><break/><bold>n = 7</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Placebo</bold><break/><bold>n = 5</bold></td></tr><tr><td colspan="7"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">0</td><td align="center">26<sup>d</sup><break/>(13-80)</td><td align="center">25<break/>(10-76)</td><td align="center">52<break/>(45-157)</td><td align="center">124<break/>(71-155)</td><td align="center">703<break/>(509-1214)</td><td align="center">789<break/>(396-941)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="7"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">1</td><td align="center">42<break/>(32-148)</td><td align="center">83<break/>(31-221)</td><td align="center">29<break/>(3-178)</td><td align="center">33<break/>(7-69)</td><td align="center">281<break/>(150-607)</td><td align="center">313<break/>(226-516)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="7"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">2</td><td align="center">40<break/>(8-92)</td><td align="center">114<break/>(15-192)</td><td align="center">133<break/>(28-524)</td><td align="center">112<break/>(42-294)</td><td align="center">797<break/>(211-1615)</td><td align="center">666<break/>(385-963)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="7"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">3</td><td align="center">13<break/>(7-40)</td><td align="center">27<break/>(10-113)</td><td align="center">678<break/>(167-965)</td><td align="center">390<break/>(90-877)</td><td align="center">709<break/>(335-1070)</td><td align="center">983<break/>(487-1169)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="7"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">4</td><td align="center">9<break/>(2-127)</td><td align="center">63<break/>(9-92)</td><td align="center">397<break/>(103-1218)</td><td align="center">217<break/>(118-625)</td><td align="center">318<break/>(71-593)</td><td align="center">406<break/>(247-542)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="7"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">5</td><td align="center">28<break/>(4-83)</td><td align="center">63<break/>(4-105)</td><td align="center">426<break/>(201-1476)</td><td align="center">575<break/>(388-1128)</td><td align="center">53<break/>(17-320)</td><td align="center">240<break/>(116-504)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><sup>a </sup>Month after treatment (Group 0 is pre-treatment)</p><p><sup>b </sup>Treatment with Doxycycline (200 mg/day) for 6 weeks</p><p><sup>c </sup>At 2 months post treatment only 6/7 doxycycline treated volunteers attended the follow-up meeting</p><p><sup>d </sup>Median (range)</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Depletion of <italic>Wolbachia </italic>from <italic>Onchocerca volvulus </italic>larvae reduces the number of larvae that develop into the infective stage in the <italic>Simulium </italic>vector</bold>.

Other studies have analysed the effects of tetracycline on larval development in the mammalian host.

Therefore, the focus of this study was to analyse whether Mf from <italic>O. volvulus </italic>infected patients who had been treated with doxycycline, and thus had reduced or absent <italic>Wolbachia </italic>levels, could still develop into the infective third stage larvae (L3) in the <italic>Simulium </italic>vector.</p><p><italic>Simulium </italic>flies were allowed to bite <italic>O. volvulus </italic>infected volunteers, then captured, raised in an insectarium and then dissected to count larvae that had developed. Prior to bringing the infected volunteers to the capture site, wild <italic>Simulium </italic>flies were captured and dissected to determine the natural parous, infection and infective rates. The very low infection (0.59%) of the wild <italic>Simulium </italic>flies minimised the chance of an already infected fly feeding on the study volunteers (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).</p><p>Our results show that Mf treated with doxycycline, and therefore depleted of their <italic>Wolbachia</italic>, developed into L3 at a considerably lower rate than Mf from placebo treated patients during the observation period. This was most apparent as a decrease of L3 with a corresponding increase of L1 and L2 seen in the doxycycline group at 3, 4 and 5 months post-treatment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Whether the few remaining L3 with low numbers of <italic>Wolbachia </italic>might be able to establish an infection in humans remains an open question that is technically and ethically impossible to answer for <italic>O. volvulus </italic>infections.</p><p>To support the requirement of <italic>Wolbachia </italic>during larval development, the depletion of the endobacteria was verified by a quantitative PCR assay for the <italic>Wolbachia ftsZ </italic>gene. The PCR results showed a clear reduction of <italic>Wolbachia ftsZ </italic>in the Mf after one month of antibiotic treatment (52% compared to placebo), with Mf from fewer than 50% of volunteer samples even having detectable <italic>ftsZ </italic>at 2, 3, 4 and 5 months post-treatment (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>). In the few doxycycline treated larval samples that had an <italic>ftsZ </italic>signal, there was a clear reduction of the <italic>ftsZ/&#x003b2;-actin </italic>ratio. Because so many of the treated samples were negative for <italic>ftsZ</italic>, the sample size was too small for a statistical test.</p><p>In addition to the above described effect on larval development in the insect vector, depletion of the <italic>Wolbachia </italic>from <italic>O. volvulus </italic>Mf could have two other beneficial effects. One possible benefit is a reduced chance of <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-depleted larvae establishing an infection. This is supported by work with the <italic>L. sigmodontis </italic>murine model of filarial infections and results from the fact that <italic>Wolbachia </italic>increase the number and degranulation of mast cells at the site of infection, resulting in greater vascular permeability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. This effect is linked to the TLR-2 innate immune receptor, which recognizes and is activated by <italic>Wolbachia </italic>molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The second possible benefit is the reduction in pathology in already infected individuals. Mf are the primary inducers of pathology due to their induction of a strong immune response when they die [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Work with animal models and natural animal <italic>Onchocerca </italic>infections have shown the importance of <italic>Wolbachia </italic>in the nematodes for attracting immune cells to the site of infection and more importantly, a reduction in the damage done to the eye when the endobacteria are depleted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>Changes in the number of L3 that developed from <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-depleted Mf did not appear until 3 months post treatment. We hypothesize that whatever products that the endobacteria provided to the nematodes for proper development are stable for two months and had already been produced and made available to the Mf prior to the depletion of the <italic>Wolbachia</italic>. When these Mf are taken up by the vector, they are then able to continue their development until the endobacterial substances are depleted. A better understanding of this phenomenon will be developed as the basis for the requirement of <italic>Wolbachia </italic>by filarial nematodes is elucidated.</p><p>Although not significant, within the placebo group the number of L3 larvae recovered from the <italic>Simulium </italic>decreased over time post-treatment. This could be due to the fall in temperatures (from 28&#x000b0;C to 24&#x000b0;C) in the area at these time points reducing the capacity of the <italic>Simuliae </italic>to support the infective L3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. However, this has to be confirmed in other experiments. The results of a repeated measures ANOVA allowed us to conclude that there was no interaction between the time of measurement and treatment. Nevertheless, there is a significant difference in the L3 reduction observed between the doxycycline and the placebo treated volunteers (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).</p><p>Inhibition of larval development after antibiotic treatment has been observed in several other studies. In a murine model with <italic>L. sigmodontis</italic>, significantly fewer L3 developed in the intermediate host if Mf were depleted of their <italic>Wolbachia </italic>endobacteria with tetracycline treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Furthermore, infection of jirds with <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-depleted L3 resulted in the development of very few female worms, while male worm numbers were unchanged. The few female worms that were able to develop from <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-depleted Mf had endobacteria levels equivalent to control worms indicating that these worms developed from Mf with a <italic>Wolbachia </italic>threshold needed for successful development of the larvae. Thus, the <italic>O. volvulus </italic>L3 that had successfully developed at 4 and 5 months post treatment developed from Mf with the minimum of <italic>Wolbachia </italic>endosymbionts to develop into L3.</p><p>In our study the larvae were not exposed to doxycycline within the insect vector. The treatment occurred before the blackflies had fed on the infected volunteers. Because doxycycline rapidly blocks embryogenesis by <italic>Wolbachia </italic>depletion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], the Mf taken up by the flies during the blood meal could only be those present at the time of doxycycline treatment. Therefore we concluded that <italic>Wolbachia </italic>depletion alone causes the impairment of larval development and is not a direct effect of the antibiotic on the larvae.</p><p>As noted, issues of small sample size arose during some of our analyses. Although a clear difference in the number of L3 that developed between the doxycycline and placebo groups could be seen 4 months post-treatment, the difference was not significant (P = 0.088). Because there was a significant difference seen for this parameter at 3 and 5 months, we are confident that with a larger cohort of volunteers the difference seen at 4 months post-treatment would reach significance. Such a larger study should also take into account the drop in L3 development from pre-treatment to five months post-treatment in the placebo group and be planned during a season or an area where the ambient temperature does not differ by 4&#x000b0;C. A larger sample size would also allow us to perform statistics on the quantitative PCR results. We would like to note that the statistics would only strengthen what we have already seen, i.e. larvae which developed from <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-depleted Mf did not have any or had very low levels of <italic>Wolbachia </italic>as detected by quantitative real-time PCR.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>To our knowledge, this is the first study analysing the effects of antibiotic treatment of <italic>O. volvulus </italic>infected humans on larval development in the insect vector. These findings have epidemiological implications. The results clearly show that depletion of <italic>Wolbachia </italic>not only affects the larval stages and adult worms in the mammalian host, it also has negative effects on larval development in blackflies. The decrease in L3 production, even though it is not 100%, could reduce the transmission potential of blackflies following treatment of communities with doxycycline to control onchocerciasis. Thus anti-wolbachial therapy for filarial infections would have an additive effect of interrupting transmission by 1) blocking embryogenesis, 2) macrofilaricidal activity and 3) reduction of the number of L3 that can be transmitted by blackflies that have fed on infected persons before the Mf have been cleared from the skin.</p><p>A recent report on community-directed delivery of doxycycline for the treatment of onchocerciasis indicated that the delivery of doxycycline for six weeks is achievable. The therapeutic coverage and the compliance treatment rate achieved in this study coupled to the known efficiency of doxycycline demonstrate that mass administration may be used in selected problem areas such as in areas co-endemic for loiasis to control onchocerciasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they
