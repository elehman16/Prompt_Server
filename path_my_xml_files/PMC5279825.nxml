Sonidegib selectively inhibits the growth of Hedgehog pathway-dependent tumors and can treat locally advanced BCC patients who are not candidates for surgery or radiation therapy. The BOLT clinical trials were conducted to evaluate the efficacy/potency of sonidegib in the treatment of advanced BCC or metastatic BCC. The patients were randomized in 1:2 ratios to receive 200 or 800 mg oral sonidegib daily, stratified by disease, histological subtype and geographical region. The primary efficacy analyses showed that 18 patients in the 200 mg group and 35 patients in the 800 mg group show an objective response (Central Review Committee) that corresponds to 43% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 28&#x02013;59) and 38% (95% CI: 28&#x02013;48) in their respective categories. Disease control was found in 93% (39 patients) and 80% (74 patients) of the patients administered 200 and 800 mg sonidegib, respectively. The adverse events were assessed by the Central Review Committee as well as the investigator review team as per the guidelines of National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03. The most frequently found adverse events reported in BOLT trials were muscle spasms, alopecia, dysgeusia (taste disturbance), nausea, elevated blood creatine kinase and fatigue. Comparatively, the patients administered 200 mg sonidegib showed fewer adverse events than those in the 800 mg sonidegib category. Thus, the benefit of using the 200 mg dose of sonidegib outweighs the associated risks and it can be inferred that it would be judicious to choose doses of lesser strength.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>locally advanced basal cell carcinoma</kwd><kwd>metastatic basal cell carcinoma</kwd><kwd>central review</kwd><kwd>investigator review</kwd><kwd>BOLT clinical trials</kwd><kwd>objective response</kwd><kwd>complete response</kwd><kwd>partial response</kwd><kwd>disease control</kwd><kwd>event-free probability</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The history of oncology treatment has been associated with pessimism. The outcome of treatment becomes more uncertain for advanced basal cell carcinomas (BCCs). A majority of the BCCs are simple, but they pose a colossal challenge on reaching an advanced/metastatic stage.<xref rid="b1-ott-10-515" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> It is the most common malignancy responsible for human skin cancer, accounting for almost 80% cases.<xref rid="b2-ott-10-515" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="b3-ott-10-515" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Sonidegib (Odomzo<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Novartis International AG, Basel, Switzerland) appeared as a ray of hope for advanced BCC-affected patients because of a satisfactory benefit&#x02013;risk profile and the shortage of treatments available for this disease.<xref rid="b4-ott-10-515" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Sonidegib is an oral Smoothened (SMO) antagonist, which acts as a Hedgehog pathway inhibitor. It is indicated for the treatment of adults with locally advanced BCC (laBCC) not suitable for surgery or radiation therapy or adults with recurrent laBCC following surgery or radiation therapy.<xref rid="b4-ott-10-515" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Treatment management of advanced BCC</title><p>The incidence of BCCs is increasing by leaps and bounds across nations, particularly in the United States. Thus, scientists working all over the world have focused their attention on finding a successful treatment for advanced BCCs.<xref rid="b5-ott-10-515" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> The aim of the BCC treatment is to remove the tumor without much alteration in the function or physical appearance of the patient&#x02019;s affected area. The features that make advanced BCCs difficult to treat are large tumor size, location, extent and invasiveness of the disease.<xref rid="b6-ott-10-515" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Different treatment options for advanced BCCs, such as electrodesiccation, curettage, cryosurgery, photodynamic therapy or topical agents, did not get the expected success. If there exists the possibility of surgery without deformity or loss of function to the patient for the treatment of advanced BCC, it is considered one of the best options.<xref rid="b7-ott-10-515" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>Radiation therapy has also been used for a long time to treat advanced BCCs and various other tumors. It utilizes high-energy rays, eg, X-rays, and particles, such as photons, electrons or protons, to kill tumor cells. This treatment is particularly useful when the tumor size is very large or on areas where surgical removal is difficult. It is also useful for patients who cannot withstand surgery due to other health reasons such as diabetes, old age, etc.<xref rid="b8-ott-10-515" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><p>The new category of drugs surfacing currently comprises oral agents that act as Hedgehog pathway inhibitors and that are very beneficial for the treatment of advanced BCC. The first-in-class drug in this category was vismodegib (Erivedge; Genentech, Inc., South San Francisco, CA, USA), made by Genentech, which received US Food and Drug Administra(FDA) approval and European marketing authorization the year 2012 and 2013, respectively.<xref rid="b9-ott-10-515" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> A new drug making waves these days, named sonidegib, has also been added in this category.</p></sec><sec><title>Challenges faced by Hedgehog pathway inhibitors</title><p>The failure of cancer drugs to treat diseases after showing their credentials is becoming common nowadays. The drugs are not losing their strength because of any alteration in their structure or way of functioning. The reason is mainly the drug resistance that develops due to change in the drug target.<xref rid="b10-ott-10-515" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Drug resistance influences the treatment of various cancers such as blood cancer and solid tumors that include non-Hodgkin lymphoma, breast cancer, lung cancer and BCCs. The drugs such as vismodegib and sonidegib are also not left untouched by the problem of drug resistance.<xref rid="b11-ott-10-515" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p><p>Vismodegib is affected by both primary and secondary resistances. The reason for primary resistance includes the mutation in SMO at position 497 (G&#x02794;W) in patients, whereby tumors started to grow after 2 months of randomization with vismodegib. The second type of resistance developing in the case of vismodegib use was due to a nonsense mutation in PTCH1 after following 11 months&#x02019; continuous treatment. The mutation in SMO was found to be at position 473 (D&#x02794;Y).</p><p>The mutation that affects the treatment of advanced BCC by sonidegib is located at position 477 in SMO. This mutation at position 477 results in a change in amino acid from aspartic acid to glycine (D&#x02794;G). This change leads to reduced sensitivity to Hedgehog pathway inhibitors and affects drug&#x02013;target binding. The mentioned change is an acquired resistance that annuls the susceptibility of the advanced BCC patients to sonidegib treatment.<xref rid="b12-ott-10-515" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> It is a potential hurdle to durable response in the clinics. Alternate approaches of combining the different Hedgehog pathway inhibitors together to overcome 1 or more resistance can provide extra strength to treatment regimens for advanced BCC.</p></sec><sec><title>Vismodegib</title><p>Vismodegib inhibits the Hedgehog pathway by attaching itself to SMO (a transmembrane protein involved in Hedgehog pathway signal transduction). It is a first-in-class SMO inhibitor approved by the US FDA in January 2012.

The patients had WHO status from 0 to 2.<xref rid="b20-ott-10-515" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> All the patients had given their written consent before their enrollment in the clinical trials. The number of patients not enrolled in the study was 39. Out of these 39 patients, 30 did not qualify in the eligibility criteria, whereas 6 patients retracted by themselves and 3 patients were excluded by the physician. The remaining 230 patients were randomized and administered 2 doses of sonidegib daily in separate groups of 200 and 800 mg, until they had disease progression, incidence of intolerable toxicity, start of another anticancer treatment or withdrawal of consent. The number of patients assigned for 200 and 800 mg doses were 79 and 151, respectively. The patients included in the primary efficacy analysis were 55 for the 200 mg dosage group, whereas for the 800 mg dosage group, the number was 116. Both 200 and 800 mg dosage groups included the patients for the safety analysis as well. All the patients in the 200 mg intent-to-treat population (ie, 79) were used for the safety analysis, whereas for the 800 mg category, the patients used for the safety analysis were 150 out of 151.</p><p>The primary efficacy analysis of sonidegib for the treatment of laBCC was divided into 2 categories, namely, administration of 200 and 800 mg sonidegib (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-ott-10-515">Table 1</xref>). The first category of 42 patients was administered 200 mg of sonidegib daily, whereas the second category of 93 patients was infused with 800 mg of sonidegib once daily. The various end points analyzed were objective response, disease control, duration of tumor response, progression-free survival, etc. The study was assumed to be successful if 30% or more of the patients achieved objective response. The Central Review Committee, after analyzing the BOLT trials, found that 43% patients in the 200 mg category and 38% in the 800 mg category showed objective response. Complete response was shown by 5% patients administered 200 mg sonidegib, whereas no patients administered 800 mg drug showed complete response. Partial response was shown by approximately 38% in both the categories of patients, while disease control was shown by 93% and 80% patients in their respective groups (ie, 200 and 800 mg). The investigator review committee had also analyzed the results of the BOLT clinical trials. Objective response was found to be 67% and 58% in the patients in 200 and 800 mg groups, respectively. Patients in both the groups, ie, 7% patients in the 200 mg group and 13% patients in the 800 mg group, showed complete response. The partial responses were 60% and 45%, respectively, in the mentioned categories. The disease control was also excellent, as analyzed by the investigator review committee, shown by around 93% and 88% patients in the 200 and 800 mg categories, respectively. The results shown by both the analytical groups (ie, central review and investigator review) in the intent-to-treat population were also comparable with those of the primary efficacy patient population.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Safety</title><p>The adverse events were assessed by the central review as well as by the investigator review teams.<xref rid="b19-ott-10-515" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> All the Z events experienced by the patients following the administration of 200 and 800 mg doses of sonidegib were reviewed as per the guidelines of the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03.<xref rid="b21-ott-10-515" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> The adverse events were evaluated from Day 1, when the first dose of sonidegib was administered, until the last dose, which was administered on Day 30.

If we consider both 200 and 800 mg sonidegib doses that were administered to both types of patients, those suffering from laBCC and metastatic BCC, the most common adverse event that led to the discontinuation of the treatment by the patients was muscle spasm (3/79 patients in the 200 mg sonidegib group and 13/150 patients in the 800 mg sonidegib group).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Opinion</title><p>The Hedgehog inhibitors have proved themselves as promising alternatives for patients with advanced BCC who are not amenable to radiotherapy or surgery.<xref rid="b22-ott-10-515" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> The current review is based mainly on BOLT clinical trials conducted across 12 countries all over the world in around 58 centers. It was a double-blind, randomized, phase 2 study to test the efficacy of sonidegib in 2 tolerable doses (ie, 200 and 800 mg) for the treatment of laBCC as well as metastatic BCC. The focus here is on laBCC, which affects many patients across the globe. The patients were analyzed and were assigned to laBCC and metastatic BCC groups as required. The laBCC patients (42 in number) were administered 200 mg sonidegib daily, whereas 93 patients were administered 800 mg sonidegib daily. The percentage of patients who showed objective response was 43% and 38% in their respective categories, which appears to be comparatively good, although complete response was shown by proportionately fewer patients in the 200 mg category and none in the 800 mg category. However, the disease control ratio was quite impressive, ie, 93% and 80%.</p><p>The safety profiles of both 200 and 800 mg sonidegib dosage groups were assessed by following the guidelines of the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03.<xref rid="b21-ott-10-515" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> The frequently found adverse events in the patients were muscle spasms, alopecia, dysgeusia (taste disturbance), nausea, elevated blood creatine kinase and fatigue, which sometimes have led many patients to discontinue their treatment. These adverse reactions were more common in the patients administered 800 mg sonidegib. Drugs such as tizanidine (muscle relaxant) can be recommended to increase the tolerability of patients who show muscle toxicity after the administration of sonidegib. Furthermore, it was found in the study that muscle toxicity and dysgeusia were prominent between the first and third weeks. Hence, drug scheduling and reduced drug strength are recommended.<xref rid="b23-ott-10-515" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></p><p>The emergence or rebound of resistance in the case of vismodegib has already terrified other Hedgehog inhibitors as well.<xref rid="b24-ott-10-515" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Patients who were resistant to vismodegib for the treatment of advanced BCCs have continued the legacy for sonidegib.<xref rid="b25-ott-10-515" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> So, alternate approaches of combining the drugs after assessing the mechanism of resistance developed in the laBCC patients are recommended, which would bypass the hindrance posed in the way of treating this category of patients.
