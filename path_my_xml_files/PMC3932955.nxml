Study participants were randomised to multiple-family intervention (MUFI) or single-family intervention (SIFI) in a parallel design. MUFI comprised a 3-day inpatient programme at the hospital with other families and a multidisciplinary team, follow-up visits in their hometown individually and in groups, organised physical activity twice weekly and a 4-day family camp after 6&#x02005;months. SIFI comprised individual counselling by paediatric nurse, paediatric consultant and nutritionist at the hospital and follow-up by public health nurse in the community. Solution focused approach was applied in both interventions. Primary outcome measures were change in BMI kg/m<sup>2</sup> and BMI SD score (BMI SDS).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>BMI increased by 0.37 units in the MUFI compared to 0.77 units in the SIFI (p=0.18).

The family is the interventional unit and includes the child, parents and in some cases (n=8), a sibling. Children are randomised to either single-family intervention (SIFI) or MUFI. The primary outcome is between-group differences in body mass index (BMI, kg/m<sup>2</sup>) after 2&#x02005;years. Secondary outcomes are between-group differences in physical activity, nutrition, and anthropometrical, metabolic and psychological measures. The trial is designed, conducted and reported in accordance with Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> There has been no deviation from the study protocol other than recruiting in two cycles to obtain sufficient number of participants.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Participants and settings</title><p>The study started in 2009 at the Paediatric Department at Hammerfest Hospital in collaboration with the University Hospital of North Norway (UNN) and the University of Troms&#x000f8;.
