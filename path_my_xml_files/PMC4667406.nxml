Although little is known about their pathophysiology, variable methods have been practiced clinically. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of local anaesthetic injections versus ischemic compression via physical therapy for pain relief of abdominal wall trigger points in women with chronic pelvic pain.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We conducted a parallel group randomized trial including 30 women with chronic pelvic pain with abdominal wall trigger points. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of two intervention groups. One group received an injection of 2&#x000a0;mL 0.5&#x000a0;% lidocaine without a vasoconstrictor into a trigger point. In the other group, ischemic compression via physical therapy was administered at the trigger points three times, with each session lasting for 60&#x000a0;s, and a rest period of 30&#x000a0;s between applications. Both treatments were administered during one weekly session for four weeks. Our primary outcomes were satisfactory clinical response rates and percentages of pain relief. Our secondary outcomes are pain threshold and tolerance at the trigger points. All subjects were evaluated at baseline and 1, 4, and 12&#x000a0;weeks after the interventions. The study was conducted at a tertiary hospital that was associated with a university providing assistance predominantly to working class women who were treated by the public health system.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Clinical response rates and pain relief were significantly better at 1, 4, and 12&#x000a0;weeks for those receiving local anaesthetic injections than ischemic compression via physical therapy. The pain relief of women treated with local anaesthetic injections progressively improved at 1, 4, and 12&#x000a0;weeks after intervention. In contrast, women treated with ischemic compression did not show considerable changes in pain relief after intervention. In the local anaesthetic injection group, pain threshold and tolerance improved with time in the absence of significant differences between groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Lidocaine injection seems to be better for reducing the severity of chronic pelvic pain secondary to abdominal wall trigger points compared to ischemic compression via physical therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00628355">NCT00628355</ext-link>.

There are great difficulties in establishing the primary cause of CPP and in proposing adequate treatment. The conditions that are most commonly diagnosed in women with CPP are constipation, irritable bowel syndrome, interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome, endometriosis, and adhesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In contrast, 10 to 30&#x000a0;% of cases may be originating from the trigger points in the abdominal wall muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. This condition is usually associated with trigger points, which are usually defined as hyper-irritable sites located within a taut band of skeletal muscle or fascia. When compressed, these trigger points cause referred pain, local tenderness, and autonomic changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Despite the variability of the criteria used to diagnose them, they can be located easily by trained observers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Some authors have associated them with the abdominal myofascial pain syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, it may be almost impossible to distinguish between a true nerve entrapment and a myofascial trigger point in the rectus abdominis muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Furthermore, they may also be associated with a visceral pain origin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] such as endometriosis, especially when associated with allodynia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Although little is known about the pathophysiology of the condition, the use of a local anaesthetic has been recommended as an effective technique for the treatment of symptomatic active trigger points [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], including abdominal ones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, few studies have prospectively evaluated the effects of anaesthetic injections into abdominal wall trigger points [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and the clear advantages of this procedure has not been established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Among others, ischemic compression, has been identified as a useful non-invasive method for the treatment of trigger points [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. However, it remains unknown if ischemia actually occurs with this intervention. In our country, non-pharmacological modalities have also been widely used. These are usually preceded by transcutaneous electric nervous stimulation (TENS), only for initial analgesia, as reported in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. To our knowledge, there is no currently available data that shows the superiority of any one method. Thus, the objective of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of local anaesthetic injections versus ischemic compression for pain relief of abdominal trigger points in women with CPP.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design</title><p>This study was a parallel group randomized controlled trial, which utilized blinded outcome assessors, and an intention-to-treat analysis.

The dial of the gauge is calibrated in kg/cm<sup>2</sup>, with a measuring capacity of 5&#x000a0;kg (Instrutherm Ltda, S&#x000e3;o Paulo, Brazil). The algometer was placed perpendicularly on the trigger point, and the pressure was increased gradually (0.1&#x000a0;kgf/s) until the patient reported the first painful discomfort (threshold) and until the maximum stimulus withstood (tolerance). Two measurements were made with an interval of three minutes and the mean value was used for analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Interventions</title><p>Group 1: Local anaesthetic injection of 2&#x000a0;mL 0.5&#x000a0;% lidocaine without a vasoconstrictor, directly and perpendicularly applied into the trigger point.

This pressure was sufficient to cause moderate local pain evoking the referred pain pattern [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. This therapy was applied three times, lasting for 60&#x000a0;s for each session, with a rest period of 30&#x000a0;s between applications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] for four sessions weekly. The compression was preceded by TENS, which delivers electric stimulation lasting for 30&#x000a0;min using a Dualpex 961 device with a frequency of 100&#x000a0;Hz, pulse of 250&#x000a0;&#x003bc;s, and intensity according to the pain threshold of the patient in order to promote initial analgesia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Outcomes</title><p>Primary outcomes: satisfactory clinical response rate (defined by the Health Ministry of Brazil as a VAS reduction of at least 50&#x000a0;% or as a significant subjective impact on daily life activities (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bvsms.saude.gov.br/bvs/saudelegis/sas/2012/prt1083_02_10_2012.html">http://bvsms.saude.gov.br/bvs/saudelegis/sas/2012/prt1083_02_10_2012.html</ext-link>).</p><p>Secondary outcomes: proportion of pain relief ([VAS before and after treatment]/[VAS before treatment]), threshold, and tolerance on the trigger point.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Sample size</title><p>Sample size estimation was based on the differences between proportions in the satisfactory clinical response rate between the two groups.

Based on the results of the interim analysis, the study was stopped early, after including five blocks of six subjects each, because we considered the clinical response rate of intervention 2 to be significantly lower than that of intervention 1, after follow-up. At the time of the interim analysis, 15 subjects were enrolled in each group. Based on the O&#x02019;Brien-Fleming approach group sequential boundary, the significance level for the primary end point was 0.025.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Randomization</title><sec id="Sec13"><title>Sequence generation</title><p>Block randomization, consisting of ten blocks of six subjects each, with three patients in each group of treatment, was generated online (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.randomization.com">http://www.randomization.com</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Control of bias</title><p>The first evaluation and the clinical diagnosis were performed by two experts (OBPN, JCRS) using the criteria developed by Travell and Simons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], in order to recognize active trigger points. A third and fourth researcher, who were blinded to all clinical data except for the location of the trigger point, performed either intervention 1 or 2. An independent observer, who was blind to the previous clinical data and therapy modality, performed the follow-up measurements. A professional who was blinded to all information performed the statistical analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Normal distribution of the data was determined using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Once normal distribution was confirmed, the comparison of quantitative variables between different groups was performed by the <italic>t</italic>-test. When normal distribution was not confirmed, the analysis was performed using the Wilcoxon test. The Chi-square/Fisher&#x02019;s exact test was used, when appropriate, to analyse nominal variables.</p><p>Primary outcome was analysis using generalized linear mixed models. This model was implemented in the SAS program software using the PROC GENMOD. This model estimates the relative risk, independent of time, to verify the relationship between clinical response rate and group. It also estimated the relative risk within each study period. All statistical tests were two-sided. The significance level for the primary end point was adjusted for a single interim analysis to 0.025. Otherwise, we considered P values of less than 0.05 to indicate statistical significance.</p><p>In order to compare the times for each group separately, a nonparametric mixed-effects model for longitudinal data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] was proposed in the analysis of the secondary endpoints. To compare the times for each group separately, we can apply multiple comparisons with Bonferroni adjustment. To compare the groups at each time point separately, the Mann&#x02013;Whitney test, (a nonparametric technique), was used to compare distributions of two or more groups that require no assumptions about the distribution of data. The level of significance was considered as 5&#x000a0;%. The analysis was conducted by the package nparLD using the R software.

However, two patients in Group 1 (local anaesthetic injection) presented with ecchymoses (3.4&#x000a0;cm and 5.1&#x000a0;cm of extension) that resolved spontaneously within 4 and 6&#x000a0;weeks, respectively.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="Sec25"><title>Synthesis</title><p>In the present study, we observed that local anaesthetic injections were superior to ischemic compression, and resulted in progressive improvements in pain relief. Despite the absence of statistical differences with the compression group, we observed that the local pain threshold and tolerance of women submitted to a local anaesthetic injections improved throughout the follow-up period and until the end of treatment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Interpretation</title><p>To our knowledge, this is the first randomized trial demonstrating the superiority of a local anaesthetic for the treatment of the trigger points in the inferior abdominal wall of women with chronic pelvic pain even though this method has been proven to be effective in the treatment of other myofascial syndromes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], and is similar to the effects of the lidocaine patch [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>The effects of acute anaesthesia that are promoted by local anaesthetics are well known, and are believed to occur by interrupting nerve excitation and conduction by direct interaction with voltage-gated Na channels. Reduction of inflammation and activation TRPV1 e TRPA1 might explain long term effects of lidocaine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. However, we observed that, even after the injections were stopped, the pain relief reported by the subjects who received this intervention was significantly progressive. The present study does not permit us to reach precise conclusions about the mechanisms associated with this continued long-term effect. It is likely that this effect can be explained by the affinity of lidocaine with the Na channel, since it is known that the drug has a low affinity for the channels, when they are in the standby mode and demonstrated higher affinity when they are open and/inactivated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The application of anaesthetics may be associated with the occurrence of skeletal muscle tissue or neural damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Nevertheless, muscle injury is usually reversible and tissue regeneration occurs within 4 to 6&#x000a0;weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Although neurotoxicity may justify the progressive effect of local anaesthetic injections, we did not identify other clinical signs during the study period, such as dysesthesia, paresthesia, or sensorimotor deficits that differ from those reported at baseline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Although we tend to associate pain relief to the presence of a local anaesthetic, we cannot overlook the potential effect of dry needling, it has been shown to be capable to evoking antinociceptive effects by segmental modulation. Although this effect seems to be considerable for a few minutes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], it could not completely explain our results. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of the dry needle seems to depend on the integrity of the afferent and spinal cord circuitry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], which may involve supraspinal pain control via midbrain periaqueductal grey activation, among others. Some studies have demonstrated that this is an effective and safe method for the treatment of trigger points [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], which may present with effects similar to placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p>In contrast, even though we had observed a considerable improvement of pain at the trigger points immediately after the ischemic compression (preceded by TENS), this improvement was not maintained until follow-up. Recent literature studies have demonstrated changes in blood flow and cell metabolism at a myofascial trigger point after release with ischemic compression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], and improvement of pain secondary to myofascial syndromes after ischemic compression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. However, the studies did not involve sufficiently long follow-up times for the clearance of the placebo effects of the method. TENS, in turn, has shown positive short-term effects on trigger points, but not during medium or long-term follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. At present, we understand that it is not possible to recommend ischemic compression as a first-line therapeutic modality for the treatment of trigger points of the abdominal wall.</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Limitations</title><p>Although the present results demonstrate the superiority of one of the methods, we have to recognize that the early interruption of the trial is a limiting factor. This may increase the possibility of an alpha error, which favour the overestimation of the effect. Although currently available empirical evidence suggests that early interrupted clinical trials overestimate the effects of new treatments and that the reasons used to justify interrupting the trial are often not sufficiently specified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], after a judicious evaluation by our physician and the ethics committee staff, we believe that interrupting the trial was an ethical obligation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The results of the present study suggest that local anaesthetic injection is superior to ischemic compression for the treatment of abdominal wall trigger points. Since we selectively excluded subjects with comorbidities and other causes of chronic pelvic pain, we cannot confirm that this intervention, compared to those that had been applied by experts, works in the more complex &#x0201c;real-life&#x0201d; setting. Thus, future pragmatic clinical trials are needed in order to confirm the effectiveness of this method in a wider variety of circumstances as well as assess whether it is better compared to techniques such as dry needling or acupuncture, for example.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional file</title><sec id="Sec29"><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="12871_2015_155_MOESM1_ESM.docx"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p><bold>Supplementary material.</bold> (DOCX 493 kb)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>CPP</term><def><p>chronic pelvic pain</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HAD</term><def><p>hospital anxiety and depression scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NSAID</term><def><p>non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TENS</term><def><p>transcutaneous electric nervous stimulation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VAS</term><def><p>visual analogue scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WHOQoL</term><def><p>World Health Organization instrument to assess quality of life</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>Conception and design: OBPN, MLLSM.
