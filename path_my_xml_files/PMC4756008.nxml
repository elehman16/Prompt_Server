exercise approach by comparing and analyzing muscular activities of Ballet movements: the
releve movement (RM) and the demi-plie movement (DM). [Methods] Four types of movements
such as RM vs. heel rise (HM) and DM vs. squat movement (SM) were randomized and applied
in 30 healthy male and female individuals while measuring 10-s lower limb muscular
activities (gluteus maximus [GMa], gluteus medius [GMe], rectus femoris [RF], adductor
longus [AL], medial gastrocnemius [MG], and lateral gastrocnemius [LG]) by using surface
electromyography (EMG). [Results] Significant differences were found in GMa, GMe, AL and
MG activities for DM and in all of the six muscles for RM, in particular when the two
groups were compared (RM vs HM and DM vs SM). [Conclusion] The RM and DM have a greater
effect on lower limb muscular force activities compared to HM and SM and could be
recommended as clinical therapeutic exercises for lower limb muscle enhancement.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Dance movement</kwd><kwd>Lower limb muscle activation</kwd><kwd>Heel rise</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>With increasing age, muscular force reduces owing to degeneration of muscular tissue/joint
or neural lesions<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. In terms of lower limb
muscular force, the gluteus maximus [GMa], gluteus medius [GMe], rectus femoris [RF], and
medial gastrocnemius [MG] play important roles in effective movements upon posture
maintenance during standing and walking. In addition, lower limb muscles that are necessary
for desirable walking provide stability to the knee and hip joints<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, walking
speed and balancing ability decrease as well as simultaneous difficulties in posture
maintenance can occur if patients develop lower limb muscle weakness<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. In order to solve
these problems, the heel rise movement (HM) and squat movement (SM) using self-weight are
applied as exercises to prevent amyotrophy and enhance muscular force of the lower limb in
clinical practice<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Among dance movements
involving stable self-weight, the releve movement (RM) and the demi-plie movement (DM) in
Ballet are basic postures to be maintained by abducting a lower limb and recruiting the GMa,
quadriceps Q, hamstrings, and MG that can be used to sufficiently develop the surrounding
muscles including the Achilles tendon, foot arch, knee, and thigh, as well as the MG in
particular<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Consistently and accurately performing RM and DM can develop the
lower limb strength, maintaining body weight with plantar flexion and thus improving body
balance<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, some studies have reported that a dance program in
patients with Parkinson disease was effective to improve memory, muscular force, and balance
in a large number of patients<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. However,
most of these studies were limited to Ballet majors and patients with Parkinson disease, and
there is no study on the scientific evidence for therapeutic exercise movement and muscular
activity in healthy adults. In this regard, this study was conducted to compare and analyze
lower limb muscle activities with Ballet movements, the RM and DM vs. general movements (HM
and SM) in healthy people in order to suggest new rehabilitation therapeutic exercises
involving dance movements in patients requiring muscular force exercises.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Among healthy undergraduate students of C University in Gyeongsan-si, 30 target subjects (8
male and 22 female) without physical defects and who did not perform any exercises for the
last 6 months and did not have any orthopedic disorder in the lower limb were selected for
this study. The study subjects were fully informed of experimental procedures, and the
subjects provided consent indicating their voluntary participation; and the study was
approved by the Ethics Committee. The subjects were 22.2&#x000b1;1.9&#x02005;years old, were 166.7&#x000b1;7.6&#x02005;cm
tall and weighed 60.7&#x000b1;9.8&#x02005;kg. Among the 30 subjects, 26 were right lower limb-dominant
whereas 4 were left lower limb-dominant. In this study, 6 types of muscles, i.e., the GMa,
GMe, RF, AL, MG, and LG were assessed in order to compare lower limb muscular activities for
4 different movements, i.e., RM vs. HM and DM vs.SM, in healthy adults.</p><p>The ready-postures of RM and DM before starting Ballet movements are as below: Both heels
are in contact each other while holding the foot at 60&#x000b0; at an open-angle, and both knees
face outward while holding external rotation with the knee and ankle joints from the hip
joint<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. The posture assessed is as
below: For RM, the heels are raised as high as possible while holding knee extension at the
ready-posture. For DM, the knee joint faces towards the second toe while holding 45&#x000b0; of knee
flexion at the ready-posture.</p><p>For the ready-posture for general exercises of HM and SM, the natural standing position is
taken with the feet at shoulder width and the feet parallel forward. (The ready-posture for
general exercises (HM and SM) is taken with the feet at pelvic width and the feet parallel
forward like the natural position.)</p><p>For HM, the heels should be raised as high as possible from the natural position. For SM,
the knee flexion should be held at 45&#x000b0; form the natural position. All movements were
assessed with both hands in contact with the bar while the second finger of both hands was
closed. RM and HM were assigned as into one group because both required raising of the heels
as high as possible against gravity while maintaining knee extension but with different
lower limb array positions. Similarly, DM and SM were assigned into one group because both
involved same gravity directional movements but with different lower limb array positions
while maintaining 45&#x000b0; knee flexion<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The test was conducted 2 times by maintaining the posture for total 10&#x02005;s with 30-s rest
intervals<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. The experimental order was
determined randomly. Using surface EMG (LXM5380, LAXTHA, Korea), an EMG signal was given for
10 s. The values at the first and the end of 2 second were excluded, and the value at 6&#x02005;s
was reported for RMS (root mean square) and the mean value of two measurements was used.
(EMG signal was measure for 10s. The values at the first and the end of 2 second were
excluded. And then I chose the value of 6s. The value at 6&#x02005;s was reported for RMS (root mean

using SPSS Ver 20.0. Differences between the two groups, RM vs. HM and DM vs. SM in 6
muscular activities were verified using a paired t-test with statistical significance at p

adults was examined by using EMG. The HM is widely recommended for patients with weak lower
limbs to improve muscular force<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>, and the HM and RM are important for
strengthening the lower limbs to improve medial and lateral MG that are important for ankle
stability<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, the HM and
RM are the same and involve maintaining abduction and extension of the ankle, knee, and hip
joints, while raising heels against gravity. However, in terms of the hip joint, the HM is
performed from the natural posture whereas the RM is performed from the hip abduction
posture; in this regard, the most effective movement in muscular activation among these was
explored. Using EMG, muscular force change was observed with Ballet movements in dance
majors, and muscular activation of GMa, RF, and MG was high and the muscular force of these
muscles was higher than that of the upper limb muscular force<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. The statistically significant values of GMa, GMe, RF, AL, MG and
LG activation at RM and DM were similar to those observed in prior studies.</p><p>The SM is another lower limb exercise that greatly impacted the muscular forces such as the
quadriceps and MG. As the SM and DM involve the same type of closed-kinetic-chain exercises
simultaneously using ankle, knee and hip joint flexion but involve different start
positions, i.e., the natural posture for SM and the abduction posture for DM, they were
performed to determine differences in muscular activation. The result showed that the
muscular activation of GMa, GMe, AL, MG was higher in DM than in SM. This may be because of
the lower limb abduction posture and the straight hip and waist line-maintaining
movement<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. The study conducted by Dong-Cheon<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup> showed that the hip joint enhancing exercise (This study is
muscular activation of hip joint movement (hip adduction and hip abduction).) resulted in
higher activation of GMa and GMe at hip joint adduction posture rather than at abduction
posture. The higher muscular activation at DM than at SM appeared, because the investigator
instructed the subjects to hold the hip and waist line straight by maintaining a slight
posterior pelvic tilting movement, and the hip joint extensor and the abdomen muscles were
activated owing to posterior pelvic tilting maintenance<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. Bennell et al.<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup> reported improvement in lateral and internal rotator muscles that
are important to the hip and lower limb stability after Ballet movement exercise at
abduction. Therefore, the RM and DM are considered to have higher effect lower limb
activation due to posterior pelvic tilting movement at hip joint abduction posture whereas
the HM and SM are considered to have a lower effect than the RM and DM due to hip joint
movement performed at the natural position.</p><p>This study results provide experimental evidence of significantly increased muscular
activation with Ballet movements on the basis of a comparison between RM and DM compared to
the general lower limb movements (HM and SM) through statistical verification. These suggest
that the RM and DM could be used for rehabilitation for patients requiring improvement in
the force of GMa, GMe, RF, AL, MG, and LG in the future.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Kwon</surname><given-names>YJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Park</surname><given-names>SJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>The effect of open and closed chain exercise on lower
