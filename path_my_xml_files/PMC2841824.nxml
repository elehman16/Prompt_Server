Eligible subjects had Fitzpatrick skin types I&#x02013;III and moderate to moderately severe periorbital wrinkles on both sides of their face. Wrinkle severity was assessed using a six-point ordinal photonumeric scale (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig.1</xref>).

After the preconditioning period, subjects were randomly assigned to either the NPP regimen or the tretinoin regimen for 8 weeks of treatment. A computer-generated randomization list was drawn up by the study statistician and was given to the study site for treatment allocation. Prior to study start, 25 self-selected subjects (cohort) on each product regimen agreed to continue treatment for an additional 16 weeks. Written informed consent for participation in this study was obtained from all subjects in accordance with the Helsinki II declaration, and the protocol was approved by an Institutional Review Board (Schulman Associates IRB, Inc., Cincinnati, OH, U.S.A.).</p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Fig 1</label><caption><p>Images illustrating the range of wrinkle severity suitable for study inclusion.

The self-assessed improvements in overall skin appearance, overall skin feel, and eye lines and wrinkles were significantly greater for the NPP regimen group than for the tretinoin group after both 4 and 8 weeks, and for uneven skin texture after 4 weeks.</p><table-wrap id="tbl3" position="float"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Relevant efficacy assessment questions from the self-assessment questionnaire (change from baseline; full study population)</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="center" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Week 4<hr/></th><th align="center" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Week 8<hr/></th></tr><tr><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Question</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Tretinoin regimen</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">NPP regimen</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Tretinoin regimen</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">NPP regimen</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Overall skin appearance</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0&#x000b7;287<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tf3-1">*</xref></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1&#x000b7;211<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tf3-1">*</xref><xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tf3-2">&#x02020;</xref></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1&#x000b7;296<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tf3-1">*</xref></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1&#x000b7;792<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tf3-1">*</xref><xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tf3-2">&#x02020;</xref></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Overall skin feel</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;0&#x000b7;150</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1&#x000b7;360<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tf3-1">*</xref><xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tf3-2">&#x02020;</xref></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0&#x000b7;759<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tf3-1">*</xref></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1&#x000b7;889<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tf3-1">*</xref><xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tf3-2">&#x02020;</xref></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Fine lines/wrinkles</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;0&#x000b7;625<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tf3-1">*</xref></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;0&#x000b7;899<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tf3-1">*</xref></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;1&#x000b7;110<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tf3-1">*</xref></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;1&#x000b7;466<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tf3-1">*</xref></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Eye lines/wrinkles</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;0&#x000b7;651<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tf3-1">*</xref></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;1&#x000b7;206<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tf3-1">*</xref><xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tf3-2">&#x02020;</xref></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;1&#x000b7;337<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tf3-1">*</xref></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;1&#x000b7;975<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tf3-1">*</xref><xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tf3-2">&#x02020;</xref></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Deep wrinkles</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;0&#x000b7;233</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;0&#x000b7;218</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;0&#x000b7;562<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tf3-1">*</xref></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;0&#x000b7;563<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tf3-1">*</xref></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Uneven skin texture</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0&#x000b7;300</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;0&#x000b7;528<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tf3-1">*</xref><xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tf3-2">&#x02020;</xref></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;0&#x000b7;506<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tf3-1">*</xref></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;0&#x000b7;810<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tf3-1">*</xref></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>NPP, niacinamide/peptide/retinyl propionate.</p></fn><fn id="tf3-1"><label>*</label><p>Statistically significantly different from baseline at <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0&#x000b7;05.</p></fn><fn id="tf3-2"><label>&#x02020;</label><p>Statistically significantly different from the tretinoin regimen at <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0&#x000b7;05.

As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Figures 2 and 4</xref>, after 8 weeks treatment the mean improvements in the two cohorts were not significantly different by either expert visual grading of the REAL images or by image analysis of the VISIA CR images. The mean cohort responses were not consistent with those determined in the full study population, as the mean tretinoin response was higher in the cohort than in the full population, while for the NPP cohort the mean response was lower. This is likely to be attributable to the self-selection of the cohort subjects, which was made prior to the start of treatment. Wrinkle severity at enrolment, however, was not significantly different between the cohorts, nor was it significantly different between the cohorts and the full populations. For both regimens, the appearance of facial fine lines and wrinkles continued to improve from 8 to 24 weeks as measured by both visual grading and image analysis (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0&#x000b7;01 for both). Consistent with the 8-week results for the cohort, after 24 weeks of treatment there were no significant differences between the NPP regimen and the tretinoin regimen by either measure (<italic>P</italic>=0&#x000b7;74, <italic>P</italic>=0&#x000b7;77, respectively). There was a statistically significant difference in change in TEWL between the two groups at 8 and 24 weeks (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0&#x000b7;01, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5</xref>). After 24 weeks of treatment, the stratum corneum barrier was not different from baseline in the tretinoin regimen group (<italic>P</italic>=0&#x000b7;47) but was significantly improved in the NPP regimen group (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0&#x000b7;01).</p><p>After 16 and 24 weeks of treatment, the subset of the NPP regimen group exhibited a nonsignificant decrease from baseline in erythema and dryness (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003e;0&#x000b7;21, data not shown). After 16 weeks of treatment, erythema in the subset of the tretinoin regimen group was not different from baseline, but at 24 weeks of treatment there was a significant decrease in erythema. Skin dryness in the tretinoin regimen cohort was not significantly different from baseline after 16 and 24 weeks of treatment.</p><p>In general, subjects in both groups continued to notice an improvement in their skin from baseline based on the self-assessment questionnaire (data not shown). In addition, the NPP regimen subjects did not report any significant irritation after 16 and 24 weeks of treatment; the tretinoin regimen subjects did report significant peeling and flaking at 16 weeks but no significant irritation after 24 weeks (data not shown).</p><p>After 8 weeks, protein analyte changes in the cohort were consistent with those in the full population (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">Table 4</xref>). After 24 weeks, protein changes in both cohorts generally improved relative to 8 weeks. None the less, soluble protein levels remained significantly higher than baseline in the tretinoin regimen group and significantly lower than baseline in the NPP regimen group. Levels of HSA were similar to baseline in the tretinoin regimen group (<italic>P</italic>=0&#x000b7;59) but significantly reduced relative to baseline in the NPP regimen group. Involucrin levels remained not significantly different from baseline following 24 weeks use of the NPP regimen; however, levels of involucrin in the tretinoin regimen group decreased between 8 and 24 weeks, which is consistent with the TEWL and irritation data showing accommodation to tretinoin treatment with longer term use. Overall, the NPP regimen group had significantly lower levels of soluble protein, HSA and involucrin and significantly higher levels of keratins 1, 10 and 11 than the tretinoin regimen group at 24 weeks.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>To our knowledge, this is the first of its kind long-term clinical study comparing a cosmetic anti-ageing regimen against a recognized prescription topical treatment for improving the appearance of facial wrinkling. The NPP regimen, which contained cosmetic ingredients known to affect the appearance of wrinkles, along with moisturizing and skin barrier building components, comparably improved the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles relative to the prescription tretinoin regimen as measured by both expert grading and image analysis in a long-term study, with better tolerability. Improvements in skin texture with topical niacinamide treatment have been reported and linked to enhanced barrier function,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref> and a peptide used in the NPP regimen has been shown to reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles without adverse effects on skin barrier.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref> The beneficial impact of the NPP regimen ingredients is consistent with the results seen for TEWL, protein analyte changes, and the clinical data on erythema and dryness. Multiple studies have established the beneficial effects of niacinamide for improving barrier function of the stratum corneum as measured by TEWL.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> In the present investigation the NPP regimen had less of a positive effect on TEWL at 8 weeks vs. baseline than one would expect from the literature given that all three products contained niacinamide. The muted benefit on TEWL was probably a consequence of the wrinkle treatment product also containing retinyl propionate.</p><p>Another observation is that barrier function restoration and stabilization of stratum corneum repair mechanisms may occur at different rates, as TEWL values in the tretinoin cohort had returned to baseline by week 24 but some marker protein levels had not.</p><p>We recognize that there are limitations in this study. Tretinoin is more irritating to the skin and the products tested in the NPP regimen are more moisturizing. Additionally, while the evaluators were blinded to treatment, the subjects were not which could have affected the subjects' self-assessments. Finally, a larger 24-week cohort group size would have provided more statistical power for more robust conclusions. These limitations notwithstanding, the study data, from both objective and subjective assessments, provided consistent results and showed that the new NPP regimen improved the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles similarly to the tretinoin regimen, with fewer side-effects.</p><p>The results of this study show that the efficacy of a prescription product for improving the appearance of facial fine lines and wrinkles can be achieved with an appropriately designed cosmetic regimen, while providing additional benefits in aesthetics, skin tolerance and potential patient compliance.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors acknowledge the assistance of Karen Driver in the writing and preparation of the manuscript.
