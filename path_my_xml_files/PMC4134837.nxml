Compared with the standard care offered by pharmacists, this enhanced program offered patients closer monitoring of blood glucose levels, counselling about lifestyle, etc. The SugarCare study was funded by a grant but if the care is to continue some other method of financing must be found.</p></sec><sec sec-type="objectives"><title>Objectives:</title><p>This study aimed to measure consumer preference for one of the two types of care offered in the SugarCare study, the control/standard and the intervention/enhanced service; the strength of that preference; and participants&#x02019; willingness to pay (WTP) for their preferred care.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods:</title><p>SugarCare was a parallel groups, control versus intervention, repeated measures design conducted in three areas of NSW, Australia. Patients in the Intervention group (enhanced care) had one initial visit to the pharmacy with six follow up visits over approximately 9 months. At these visits blood glucose was downloaded and patient care issues addressed. At the end of the service, a survey instrument was mailed to the intervention and control participants who were asked to read it and then expect a telephone call within 2 weeks of receipt. Responses were requested over the phone and the survey instrument completed by the researcher. WTP data were collected using a modified payment card method.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results:</title><p>Overall, 44/75 (59%; 47%-70% 95%CI) respondents expressed a preference for Scenario B (the enhanced care) while 31/75 (41%; 31%-52% 95%CI) preferred Scenario A (standard care) however, the difference was not statistically significant. The median maximum WTP was AUD10 for the enhanced care and AUD3.50 for the standard care (p&#x0003c;0.03).</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions:</title><p>While the WTP values expressed were significantly higher for the enhanced care they did not match with the cost providing that diabetes care. Discrete choice analysis has the potential to overcome some of the difficulties encountered with the contingent valuation technique used here.

The cost of managing the disease and its complications is likely to exceed 1billion Australian dollars (AUD) annually in the next decade. Hence diabetes has been identified as a health priority world wide and a national health priority area.<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></p><p>Interventions which have the potential to improve the management of diabetes and delay the onset of its complications have been encouraged because they are bound to reduce costs for the health care system. The literature reports numerous examples of positive health outcomes such as reduced incidence of hospital admissions and medical contacts when pharmacists provide professional types of care in controlled research situations.<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Significant improvements in glycaemic control have also been demonstrated.<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>-<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>Given the potential contribution of pharmacists in Australia, a disease management program entitled &#x02018;SugarCare&#x02019; was conducted as a pilot study by the Faculty of Pharmacy at the University of Sydney. This was done through 9 community pharmacies in one state of Australia, NSW, the most highly populated state.<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Compared with the standard care offered by pharmacists, this program offered patients much closer monitoring of their blood glucose levels, counselling about lifestyle, diet and exercise plus personal encouragement to maintain good habits in these areas.</p><p>In Australia, in order to convince the government of the benefits of professional types of care provided in community pharmacies, evidence of the benefit of a particular program and the value placed upon it must be provided before remuneration for the care is considered. Economic evaluation can be used to provide such evidence but very few economic evaluations have been conducted in relation to community pharmacy based types of care to date<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> and in particular, very few cost benefit analyses. As part of this pilot study, to test a community pharmacy disease management program, a cost effectiveness analysis was conducted from the perspective of the health care system.<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> In this it was found that for the 0.5% reduction in glycosylated haemaglobin (HbA1c) achieved in the study, a key indication of improved glycaemic control, the incremental cost of the care was AUD391 per patient over nine months (AUD43 per month). In addition to the cost effectiveness analysis, a cost benefit analysis (CBA) was conducted from the perspective of the patient in a consumer preference survey and the latter is the focus of this report.</p><sec id="S2"><title>Measuring Consumer Preference</title><p>Several different approaches have been tried in order to incorporate consumer opinion into health care decision making. One approach commonly adopted has been to administer patient satisfaction surveys.<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> However, patient satisfaction surveys have many limitations and provide little help in addressing policy questions. Firstly, patients generally report high levels of satisfaction with the care they receive and thus surveys do not discriminate between types of care.<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Secondly, if patients are asked to value their own care they may not be aware of alternatives and so are not in a position to express a preference for one option over another.<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Thirdly, patient satisfaction surveys do not incorporate the notion of opportunity cost i.e. in order to have more of one treatment or care it may be necessary to have less of another, due to the limitation of health care resources.<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> In other words, a sacrifice may need to be made.</p><p>In contrast, measurement of consumer preference for specific realistic choices can provide health care decision makers with an estimate of the value placed by consumers on particular options, and can incorporate the notion of opportunity cost. In health economics four main methods have been used to elicit consumer preferences. These are the visual analogue scale, the standard gamble, the time trade-off and willingness to pay.<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> The first three have been used within a cost utility framework and generally a utility score is obtained. Willingness to Pay, on the other hand, is used to estimate utility in monetary terms and has been used within a cost benefit framework. According to economic theory, the maximum amount of money a consumer is willing to pay for a product or service is an indicator of the utility or satisfaction that the commodity provides to the individual and offers a measure of what the consumer will sacrifice in order to have the care. In cost benefit analysis, costs are ideally measured as opportunity costs and benefits are measured as the maximum Willingness to Pay (WTP) for the product or care being evaluated and provide a single measure of benefit.<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p><p>Both revealed preference and stated preference techniques have been used within the CBA framework.<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Revealed preference techniques are used to measure observed behaviour, ie the choices consumers actually make in practice and their willingness to pay for those choices. However, such data are not always available. As a consequence, stated preference techniques have been developed to gain some insight into what consumers might do if such a new product were offered. Stated preference techniques rely on hypothetical behaviour in response to a survey instrument in which respondents are asked to place a monetary value on the products or types of care under investigation.<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p><p>The Contingent Valuation (CV) method has been used to assess the stated preference and WTP for a product, service or intervention.<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> The technique is so called because the respondent is asked to consider the contingency that a market exists for the item being valued even though a true market does not actually exist, for example in the publicly funded health care system. Although the technique has been used in more than 40 studies in health<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> (Diener et al 1998 Olsen) there is still no agreed methodology.<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> What is clear, however, is that in line with economic principles, such studies should assess the incremental costs and incremental benefits ie the difference in both cost and benefit between the options being compared.<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> In order to do this, ideally respondents need to be offered a choice, whether real or hypothetical, and asked to express a preference for one option. They then should be asked to express the strength of their preference in monetary terms.<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></p><p>A technique used more recently to elicit consumer preference in health is discrete choice analysis (also referred to in the literature as conjoint analysis, discrete choice modeling, discrete choice experiment, and stated preference discrete choice experiment). Discrete choice analysis is an appealing method to economists because it incorporates the notion of opportunity cost.<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Here consumers are presented with hypothetical scenarios and are asked to choose between products which are described in terms of different attributes. They are asked to trade off the levels of the attributes and the relative importance of these attributes can then be elicited.<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> If cost is added as an attribute then the respondents&#x02019; WTP can be assessed without a direct question being asked.<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> The type of question posed to estimate WTP in discrete choice analysis may be more realistic than asking individuals directly in an open ended or payment card type WTP question.</p><p>However, several objections to the use of WTP techniques in health have been raised.<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> One objection is that, as health care systems in most countries are publicly funded, there is some concern that respondents may assume a user pays system will be introduced if WTP questions are asked. This can lead to protest votes, or zero valuations, even from hypothetical statements.<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Another objection is that, because in a publicly funded health care system people do not pay, a Willingness to Pay question may not seem realistic and may make it difficult for respondents to distinguish between the cost of a product or care and the value they would place upon it.<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p><p>In addition, consumers&#x02019; preferences and WTP values may be strongly influenced by the care they have actually experienced.<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> This situation presents challenges in pharmacy practice research where frequently we may wish to evaluate a new pharmacy service compared with an existing service and incorporate feedback from patients. Invariably studies will involve an Intervention group and Control group but only those in the Intervention group will experience the new service. This study provided an opportunity to explore some of these methodological issues in an Australian context but may have relevance in similar health care systems world wide, and the contingent valuation technique was chosen to elicit consumer preferences.</p><p>The aim of this study was to gather evidence within a health economics framework of the benefit (or disbenefit) of the enhanced diabetes care provided by community pharmacies compared with the standard care provided.</p><p>The first objective was to measure the level of satisfaction patients expressed in relation to the diabetes care they received in the community pharmacy overall and also their level of satisfaction with particular aspects of the care. The second objective was to ascertain which of two types of care patients preferred for their type 2 diabetes mellitus and the strength of that preference compared with other types of care (in relation to their diabetes) with which they were familiar, such as a visit to the general medical practitioner. The third objective was to ascertain how much participants valued the care they preferred in terms of Willingness to Pay for it.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S3"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="S4"><title>The SugarCare Project</title><p>SugarCare was a parallel groups, control versus intervention, repeated measures design conducted in three areas of NSW.

At the first visit patients were asked to complete questionnaires on quality of life, well being and medication use. These questionnaires were completed at the end of the nine months also. All patients were given a Medisense meter (Rx) for the measurement of blood glucose. At each visit to the pharmacy, approximately once a month, the patients downloaded their blood glucose measurements into a computer and received a print out of the readings. The results were discussed and feedback provided. As part of the care any problems identified were addressed by the pharmacist and a medication review was undertaken. A report of this review was sent to the patient&#x02019;s general medical practitioner (GP). Clinical information such as HbA1c, blood pressure, lipids and Body Mass Index were collected at the beginning and end of the project for both Intervention and Control groups.

However, there was a statistically significant difference in the proportion of the Intervention group who valued their preferred care as much as a diabetes medical specialist compared with the Control group [(38%) vs (7%); p&#x0003c;0.005]. Nevertheless, it should be noted that there was a high number of missing responses to this question in both groups.</p><p>The median maximum Willingness to Pay value expressed for preferred care based on the descriptions of Scenario A and Scenario B was significantly higher for Scenario B than for Scenario A (standard care) (AUD10 vs AUD3.50 respectively; p&#x0003c;0.03). There were no significant differences between the Intervention and Control groups in this regard (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>). Income was found to have a positive correlation with WTP values overall but the sample size was too small to test this relationship for treatment or preference groups.</p><p>Thus in terms of the original study aim and objectives, measuring overall satisfaction with care received did not discriminate between the two types of care and would not provide convincing evidence of the value of the enhanced service offered. However, measurement of satisfaction of the different aspects of care certainly revealed a high degree of satisfaction in the Intervention group with the added features in the enhanced care such as measurement and discussion of blood glucose level.</p><p>Measurement of consumer preference also did not discriminate between the two levels of care and was significantly influenced by experience of care received, with the majority of patients choosing the type of care they had received. While the majority of Intervention group could compare the enhanced care to that which they had received in the past and expressed a preference for it, the majority of Control group could not do this or even imagine the service well enough to express a preference for it, despite the lengthy description given. They were satisfied with what they had. Ideally, to overcome the influence of care experienced, a randomized controlled, crossover trial would be conducted to ensure that all participants have experience of the all the services being compared. Given that it is frequently not possible to conduct cross-over studies for clinical, practical or funding reasons, controlling statistically for the influence of care received may be the best option.</p><p>Measurement of the strength of preference compared with other types of care (eg GP or diabetes medical specialist) showed some potential as a technique to help respondents differentiate between costs and values. However, a limitation found was that there were many missing responses to this question, and may indicate that the respondents found the comparison difficult to make.</p><p>Measurement of strength of preference in monetary terms revealed a small but significant difference in overall WTP values with respondents willing to pay more for Scenario B (enhanced care) than for Scenario A (standard care) and there were no differences in values between the Control and Intervention group. It should be acknowledged, however, that the sample size may have been too small to detect such a difference had it been there. Nevertheless, the contingent valuation technique would appear to have the most potential for discriminating between these two alternatives.</p><p>However, a major limitation was noted in the application of the CV technique in that 17/75 (22.7%) respondents gave zero valuations, a high proportion compared with our previous study.<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> The zero valuations may have been protest votes or may merely have reflected respondents&#x02019; limited income and already extensive medical and pharmaceutical costs. Either way, the zero valuations have clearly lowered the average WTP values calculated and may indicate the difficulty of the technique in eliciting monetary values in a publicly funded health care system which truly reflect the strength of respondents&#x02019; preferences for particular types of care. These low values may also have been influenced by the amounts suggested in the instrument which were biased towards the lower end of the range.</p><p>The monetary valuations expressed in this study are much less than the extra cost of providing the care (AUD43 per month) as calculated in the cost effectiveness analysis of the SugarCare project<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> and application of the decision rule in CBA on pure economic grounds would dictate that the intervention should not be funded.<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> However, the cost of the service is in the same range as other interventions currently subsidised by the Australian government, for example a course of drug treatment and the practice of partial subsidization, supplemented by a patient co-payment, is well established in the Australian health care system. Thus the contribution of AUD10 for the enhanced service suggested by participants in this study compared with AUD3.50 for the standard care may be a realistic expectation and is comparable to payment for other services offered.</p><p>Further investigation is required to develop techniques which elicit assessment of incremental benefit but do not at the same time make the exercise too difficult for respondents to comprehend and execute. Discrete choice analysis has the potential to overcome some of the difficulties encountered with the contingent valuation technique, in that consumers can be asked for a non-monetary valuation of a health care intervention or indirectly for their willingness to pay.<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>-<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> Future studies could explore the use of this technique in relation to community pharmacy based clinical interventions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="S17"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Respondents in this study expressed higher WTP values for Scenario B, the description of the enhanced care offered as part of this study, than for Scenario A, the description of the standard care (AUD10 vs AUD3.50) and these values were the same whether the patient had experienced the enhanced care or not. However, these values were low and would not cover the cost of providing the service. Nevertheless they may serve as a useful guide to health care decision makers of the amount patients would be prepared to contribute as a co-payment.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn
