Unfortunately, tympanostomy tube otorrhea (TTO) occurs in as many as half of patients within the first 2 weeks following surgery and more than 80% of patients in the late postoperative period (&#x0003e;1 month).<sup><xref rid="bibr2-0003489415599001" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bibr3-0003489415599001" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Topical antibiotics are commonly administered during and for a short duration after TTP to reduce the rate of early TTO. Though a single intraoperative dose may reduce the rate of TTO, multiple days of therapy may be more effective in the presence of mucoid or purulent effusion.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-0003489415599001" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bibr5-0003489415599001" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> However, the safety and efficacy of perioperative topical antibiotics has not been demonstrated in prospective multicenter clinical trials and remains an unapproved use for these products. Thus, there is a need for robust clinical data to establish the role of perioperative topical antibiotic use that includes the microbiological assessment of baseline effusions by sensitive methods. Furthermore, there is an unmet medical need for an approved, single-dose antibiotic therapy that can be administered by the otolaryngologist during TTP, thereby eliminating the need for repeat otic drop administration by the caregiver, removing compliance issues, and ensuring sufficient drug exposure to effectively treat middle ear effusion (MEE) in pediatric patients requiring TTP.</p><p>OTO-201 (Otonomy, Inc, San Diego, California, USA) is a suspension of ciprofloxacin in a buffered solution containing a glycol polymer, poloxamer 407. At the concentration employed, the poloxamer vehicle exhibits thermo-reversible properties. OTO-201 exists as a liquid at or below room temperature and gels at body temperature. This provides prolonged (1-2 weeks) exposure of the middle ear to ciprofloxacin.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-0003489415599001" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Ciprofloxacin is approved for the topical treatment of acute otitis externa and acute OM in pediatric patients with tympanostomy tubes.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-0003489415599001" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> The purpose of this exploratory trial was to describe the safety and clinical activity of OTO-201 in pediatric patients with bilateral MEE requiring TTP.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="section6-0003489415599001"><title>Methods</title><sec id="section7-0003489415599001"><title>Trial Design</title><p>A double-blind, randomized, prospective, placebo- and sham-controlled, multicenter, Phase 1b clinical trial of OTO-201 administered as a single dose intraoperatively to children with bilateral MEE who required TTP was institutional review board approved. Given this was a pediatric trial, caregiver compliance with the protocol was required as well as written informed consent and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA of 1996) documents before initiation of trial-related procedures. The trial was conducted in accordance with the regulations and guidelines of the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Declaration of Helsinki and current amendments, and the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines</p><p>For patients 4 years or younger, hearing was tested, at a minimum, by distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) in both ears and visual reinforcement audiometry (VRA) in 1 ear at 2 frequencies, using both air and bone conduction to be eligible for enrollment.</p><p>Two dose levels of OTO-201 (4 and 12 mg of ciprofloxacin) were evaluated relative to placebo (vehicle only) and sham (air) in 2 dose cohorts, which were conducted sequentially, and patients were assigned to groups using a 2:1:1 ratio.</p></sec><sec id="section8-0003489415599001"><title>Randomization and Trial Intervention</title><p>Randomization to trial drug within each cohort was stratified by age (6 months to 2 years or &#x0003e;2 years). A permuted-block randomization algorithm was used to generate the patient&#x02019;s randomized treatment assignment, which was deployed via an interactive web-response system. While assignment to dose cohort was not blinded, within each dose cohort, the random assignment to trial drug was double-blind.</p><p>The main inclusion criteria required that patients were male or female, aged 6 months to 12 years, and had a clinical diagnosis of bilateral MEE requiring TTP. Exclusion criteria were: (1) history of prior ear or mastoid surgery, not including myringotomy or myringotomy with tympanostomy tube (TT); (2) designated for any other surgical procedure that would occur concurrently with TTP, such as but not limited to adenoidectomy or tonsillectomy; (3) history of sensorineural hearing loss; (4) history of chronic or recurrent bacterial infections other than otitis media that likely will require treatment with antibiotics during the course of the trial; (5) history of tympanic membrane perforation; (6) history of known immunodeficiency disease; (7) abnormality of the tympanic membrane or middle ear that would preclude precise placement of trial drug or intratympanic injection; (8) topical nonsteroidal otic agents within 1 day of randomization; (9) use of nasal, inhaled, and topical steroids during the trial; (10) any infection requiring systemic antimicrobial or antifungal agents; (11) topical or systemic antimicrobial or antifungal agents; amoxicillin with clavulanate potassium, cefdinir, ceftriaxone, and cephalexin within 3 days of randomization; doxycycline and fluoroquinolones within 7 days; and azithromycin within 14 days of randomization; (12) concurrent use of oral anti-inflammatory agents; (13) history of allergy to ciprofloxacin or any of the components of OTO-201; (14) clinically significant illness or medical condition that in the opinion of either the investigator or medical monitor would prohibit the patient from participating in the trial; (15) use of an investigational drug or device in the month prior to screening; (16) previous exposure to OTO-201; and (17) menarcheal or post-menarcheal female. In addition, for patients 4 years or younger, the patient must complete, at a minimum, DPOAE in both ears and VRA in 1 ear at 2 frequencies.</p><p>Eligible patients were randomized to treatment assignment on the surgery day (day 1), prior to TTP. Qualified medical personnel other than the treating physician prepared all syringes, including sham, to maintain the blind. Before trial drug injection, a MEE sample was aspirated from each ear for culture and to allow sufficient space for the trial drug. OTO-201, placebo, or sham was administered in both ears following myringotomy by an otolaryngologist who was unblinded based on the difference in the appearance of OTO-201 compared to placebo and sham.</p><p>Patients visited the trial center on days 4, 8, 15, and 29 for safety assessments and otoscopic examination. The assessment of TTO for the clinical activity endpoint (a visual external ear exam) occurred on days 4, 8, 15, and 29 by a blinded medical professional who was not present during surgery. A specimen for culture was obtained if TTO in the auditory canal was observed. Patients with otorrhea were eligible for otic antibiotic drop administration if it was determined by the investigator to be in the best interests of the health and welfare of the patient; the patient remained on trial to be monitored for safety.</p></sec><sec id="section9-0003489415599001"><title>Trial Outcomes</title><p>Safety assessments included treatment-emergent adverse events, otoscopy, audiometric testing, and tympanometry. For children able to complete audiometric testing (typically &#x02265;4 years of age), hearing was assessed at baseline, day 15, and day 29. The degree of hearing loss was calculated using the pure tone average (ie, average of the air conduction thresholds measured at frequencies 500, 1000, and 2000 Hz by ear), with hearing loss categorized as normal (0-15 dB), Grade 1 (16-40 dB), Grade 2 (41-55 dB), Grade 3 (56-71 dB), or Grade 4 (&#x02265;72 dB). For children too young to complete conventional audiometric testing, VRA and DPOAE testing was performed at baseline, day 15, and day 29 to assess hearing function. Standard tympanometric assessments performed at screening and days 4, 8, 15, and 29 assessed the volume, mobility, peak pressure, and compliance of the ear canal and middle ear as an objective test of tube patency and middle ear status.</p><p>Standard microbiological cultures were performed on baseline MEE samples as well as on postsurgical TTO samples. If positive, microorganisms were identified by using Bruker matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization&#x02013;time-of-flight (Maldi-TOF) Biotyper.</p><p>Clinical activity of OTO-201 was assessed by the proportion of treatment failures through the day 15 visit and was defined as the first event from among the following: (1) the presence of TTO noted by the nontreating physician during the visual external ear exam on or after 3 days postsurgery (day 4), (2) the requirement for otic antibiotic drop administration in the best interest of the patient as determined by the treating physician during the otoscopic exam, (3) the requirement for systemic antibiotic administration in the best interest of the patient as determined by the treating physician, or (4) loss to follow-up. Other clinical activity endpoints included the proportion of treatment failures at days 4, 8, and 15 and for patients with positive effusion cultures, microbiological eradication (ie, positive or negative) of pre-therapy bacterial pathogens.</p></sec><sec id="section10-0003489415599001"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>The planned sample size was 80 patients, with 40 patients per dose cohort, and 20, 10, and 10 patients receiving OTO-201, placebo, or sham, respectively. For this first in-human trial of OTO-201, the sample size was based on clinical experience relative to trial design and objectives. The trial was not designed to provide adequate power for hypothesis testing related to efficacy; therefore, the analytic focus for clinical activity endpoints was descriptive, and the interpretation was considered exploratory.</p><p>The Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test stratified by age group compared each OTO-201 dose group to the pooled placebo cohorts and pooled sham cohorts groups as well as a single control group consisting of the combined placebo and sham groups across all cohorts. Only the CMH results comparing each OTO-201 dose group to the single control group are reported here. Due to the small sample size, the CMH exact tests and corresponding <italic>P</italic> values also were calculated for the comparisons and are the <italic>P</italic> values quoted in this article. Due to the exploratory nature of the trial, no adjustments for multiple comparisons were made. Unless otherwise stated, the analysis of the treatment failure endpoint was conducted using all randomized patients who received at least 1 dose of trial drug.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="section11-0003489415599001"><title>Results</title><sec id="section12-0003489415599001"><title>Patients and Baseline Characteristics</title><p>A total of 83 patients were randomized between January 8 and June 17, 2013, at 12 clinical sites in the US (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0003489415599001">Figure 1</xref>). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0003489415599001">Table 1</xref> summarizes patient baseline demographics and disease characteristics.

OTO-201 in this relative small group of patients was not associated with loss of TT patency or early TT displacement. For each endpoint considered, there was no apparent dose-dependent relationship, which was expected since the projected middle ear ciprofloxacin concentrations following OTO-201 treatment were anticipated to far exceed the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of pathogens commonly found in MEE.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-0003489415599001" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="bibr9-0003489415599001" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> The pharmacokinetic values that correlate with optimal clinical and microbiologic results as well as prevent emergence of bacterial resistance are enhanced ratios of maximum drug concentration (Cmax) to MIC and area under the concentration curve (AUC) to MIC.
