People with type 2 diabetes typically start monotherapy with biguanides (e.g. metformin) [<xref rid="pone.0190579.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, as the disease progresses, most patients will require combination therapy with one or more oral antihyperglycaemic drugs (OADs), and/or non-insulin injectable antihyperglycaemic drugs, as well as basal insulin or more complex insulin regimens, to compensate for the diminishing insulin secretory capacity [<xref rid="pone.0190579.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Insulin glargine 300 U/mL (Toujeo&#x000ae;, Sanofi, Paris, France [Gla-300]) is a basal insulin, approved in many countries, which has a more stable and prolonged pharmacokinetic profile than insulin glargine 100 U/mL (Lantus&#x000ae;, Sanofi, Paris, France [Gla-100]) [<xref rid="pone.0190579.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The safety and efficacy of Gla-300 compared with Gla-100 was investigated in 1689 participants with type 2 diabetes receiving concomitant OADs in the EDITION 2 (background therapy basal insulin + OAD) and EDITION 3 (background therapy OAD only, insulin-na&#x000ef;ve) studies [<xref rid="pone.0190579.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0190579.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. For those receiving sulphonylureas, use of these medications was stopped prior to randomisation and prohibited during both studies. Results from these studies have shown that Gla-300 provides comparable glycaemic control to Gla-100 with less hypoglycaemia, over 6 months of treatment [<xref rid="pone.0190579.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0190579.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Other than biguanides, which were used by more than 90% of participants, the most common class of OADs in the EDITION 2 and 3 studies was dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor (DPPIVi) therapy. DPPIVi therapy is becoming increasingly popular in the treatment of type 2 diabetes because it is associated with a lower risk of hypoglycaemia compared with sulphonylureas or glinides [<xref rid="pone.0190579.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Previous studies of DPPIVi and basal insulin use in patients with type 2 diabetes have shown that this combination therapy leads to improved glycaemic control compared with basal insulin alone without an increase in hypoglycaemia, and with little or no effect on body weight or insulin dose [<xref rid="pone.0190579.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0190579.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>This post hoc patient-level meta-analysis aimed to assess the combination of DPPIVi therapy with Gla-300, and compared the efficacy and safety of Gla-300 and Gla-100 with or without concomitant DPPIVi use in people with type 2 diabetes in the EDITION 2 and EDITION 3 studies, over 6 months of treatment.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Participants and methods</title><sec id="sec008"><title>Study design and participants</title><p>EDITION 2 (NCT01499095) and EDITION 3 (NCT01676220) were multicentre, randomised, open-label, two-arm, parallel group, treat-to-target phase 3a studies forming part of the EDITION programme. Full study methods and results for these studies have been published previously [<xref rid="pone.0190579.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0190579.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Both studies enrolled adults &#x02265;18 years of age with type 2 diabetes. In EDITION 2, participants on prior basal insulin &#x02265;42 U/day plus OADs with HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x02265;53 to &#x02264;86 mmol/mol (&#x02265;7.0 to &#x02264;10.0%) were enrolled. In EDITION 3, participants who were on OADs (and insulin-na&#x000ef;ve) with HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x02265;53 to &#x02264;97 mmol/mol (&#x02265;7.0 to &#x02264;11.0%) were enrolled. In brief, participants were randomised (1:1) to once-daily subcutaneous injections of Gla-300 (using a modified SoloSTAR&#x000ae; [EDITION 2] or a modified Tactipen&#x000ae; [EDITION 3] pen-injector) or Gla-100 (using a SoloSTAR&#x000ae; pen-injector), administered at the same time each evening. Evening was defined as the period from immediately prior to the evening meal until bedtime. Gla-300 and Gla-100 were titrated to a fasting self-monitored plasma glucose target of 4.4&#x02013;5.6 mmol/L (80&#x02013;100 mg/dL). Appropriate local or national ethics committees approved the study protocols, and both studies were registered with ClinicalTrials.gov and conducted according to Good Clinical Practice and the Declaration of Helsinki.</p><p>Although EDITION 2 and EDITION 3 were conducted in different populations of people with type 2 diabetes, the consistent study designs (as described above) and endpoints allowed a pooled analysis to be performed. For this post hoc analysis of EDITION 2 and 3, the consistency of results was examined across four subgroups of the pooled populations (participants receiving either Gla-300 or Gla-100, with or without concomitant DPPIVi therapy).</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Outcomes</title><p>The pooled analysis of the effect of DPPIVi use was carried out for the following endpoints: change from baseline to month 6 in mean HbA<sub>1c</sub> (% [NGSP units]), percentage of participants achieving HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x0003c;7.0%; daily basal insulin dose (U/kg) and body weight (kg); percentage of participants with &#x02265;1 hypoglycaemic event, hypoglycaemic event rates per participant-year and cumulative mean number of hypoglycaemic events per participant (during the night [00:00&#x02013;05:59 h] or at any time of day [24 h]); and adverse events during the 6-month study period. Confirmed or severe hypoglycaemia combined three American Diabetes Association definitions of hypoglycaemia [<xref rid="pone.0190579.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]: documented symptomatic hypoglycaemia (typical symptoms of hypoglycaemia accompanied by a measured plasma glucose concentration of &#x02264;3.9 mmol/L [&#x02264;70 mg/dL] or &#x0003c;3.0 mmol/L [&#x0003c;54 mg/dL]), asymptomatic hypoglycaemia (no symptoms of hypoglycaemia, but confirmed by a measured plasma glucose concentration of &#x02264;3.9 mmol/L [&#x02264;70 mg/dL] or &#x0003c;3.0 mmol/L [&#x0003c;54 mg/dL]), and severe hypoglycaemia (an event requiring the assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon or other resuscitative actions).</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Data analysis and statistics</title><p>Change in HbA<sub>1c</sub> from baseline to month 6 was analysed using a mixed model for repeated measurements approach. The model included fixed categorical effects of treatment group, visit, treatment-by-visit interaction, randomisation strata of screening HbA<sub>1c</sub> (&#x0003c;8, &#x02265;8%), and study, as well as the continuous fixed covariates of baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub> value and baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub> value-by-visit interaction. Homogeneity of treatment effect across the two trials was also assessed. For hypoglycaemic events, relative risks were analysed using a Cochran&#x02013;Mantel&#x02013;Haenszel method, and rate ratios were analysed using an overdispersed Poisson regression model. Cumulative mean numbers of hypoglycaemic events per participant were evaluated using Nelson&#x02013;Aalen estimates.</p><p>A heterogeneity test was performed to assess treatment effect across DPPIVi use subgroups and p-values were generated using a subgroup-by-treatment interaction.

The HbA<sub>1c</sub> reduction over the 6-month study period was comparable between the Gla-300 and Gla-100 groups, irrespective of concomitant DPPIVi use. Additionally, Gla-300 was associated with a lower risk of experiencing &#x02265;1 confirmed (&#x02264;3.9 mmol/L [&#x02264;70 mg/dL]) or severe hypoglycaemic event than Gla-100, both at night and at any time of day, regardless of DPPIVi use (no significant difference between treatments by subgroup interaction: p = 0.476 and 0.950, respectively). Overall, the results from this analysis suggest that combination therapy with Gla-300 and DPPIVi is efficacious and well tolerated.</p><p>With incretin-based therapies such as DPPIVi becoming increasingly popular in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, it is of clinical importance to assess the efficacy and safety of the combination of DPPIVi therapy with basal insulin. This topic has been addressed in a number of randomised controlled trials that have evaluated the administration of DPPIVi in previously DPPIVi-na&#x000ef;ve patients with type 2 diabetes who were poorly controlled on basal insulin therapy [<xref rid="pone.0190579.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0190579.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, in contrast to the studies considered in this analysis, the basal insulin dose was pre-specified to remain stable in most of these studies [<xref rid="pone.0190579.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], probably because these studies were designed to evaluate the effect of the DPPIVi rather than that of the insulin. Comparisons between results from these studies of DPPIVi use and those from the analysis presented here should therefore be made with caution. The current post hoc analysis adds to the limited body of evidence in this setting, and is the first study to evaluate combination therapy with DPPIVi and the recently approved Gla-300. Only one study by Mathieu <italic>et al</italic>. has investigated the co-administration of sitagliptin (the DPPIVi most commonly used by participants in the EDITION studies in this analysis) with Gla-100 in a treat-to-target trial in people with type 2 diabetes [<xref rid="pone.0190579.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Owing to the treat-to-target design of the EDITION trials, HbA<sub>1c</sub> change from baseline was comparable with Gla-300 and Gla-100, for both the &#x02018;with DPPIVi&#x02019; and &#x02018;without DPPIVi&#x02019; subgroups. This comparable reduction in HbA<sub>1c</sub> (LS mean treatment difference 0.01% &#x02018;with DPPIVi&#x02019; and &#x02212;0.03% &#x02018;without DPPIVi&#x02019;), accompanied by the lower risk of hypoglycaemia with Gla-300 versus Gla-100, was associated with a numerically higher daily insulin dose for Gla-300, regardless of DPPIVi use (note statistical testing was not performed on insulin dose). Differences between the DPPIVi use subgroups were seen in Gla-100-treated participants, with the daily basal insulin dose at month 6 being numerically lower for participants on concomitant DPPIVi therapy compared with those who were not. The results observed in the Gla-100 group are aligned with those of the Mathieu <italic>et al</italic>. study, in which participants receiving sitagliptin required a lower dose of Gla-100 than those receiving placebo [<xref rid="pone.0190579.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In most other studies of the co-administration of basal insulin and DPPIVi, the dose of insulin remained essentially unchanged [<xref rid="pone.0190579.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0190579.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0190579.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0190579.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Nevertheless, it should be noted that differences in the numbers of people in the &#x02018;with DPPIVi&#x02019; and &#x02018;without DPPIVi&#x02019; subgroups (mITT population: with DPPIVi: n = 240; without DPPIVi: n = 1430) in the current analysis limit interpretation.</p><p>As indicated by non-statistically significant treatment-by-subgroup interaction p-values, the lower risk and lower annualised rate of confirmed (&#x02264;3.9 mmol/L [&#x02264;70 mg/dL]) or severe hypoglycaemia (nocturnal [00:00&#x02013;05:59 h, p = 0.476 and p = 0.276; respectively] and at any time of day [24 h], p = 0.950 and p = 0.978; respectively) with Gla-300 versus Gla-100 seen in the EDITION 2 and EDITION 3 studies was observed in this analysis irrespective of concomitant DPPIVi use. The cumulative mean number of confirmed (&#x02264;3.9 mmol/L [&#x02264;70 mg/dL]) or severe hypoglycaemic events was also consistently lower with Gla-300 versus Gla-100, irrespective of concomitant DPPIVi use, both at night and at any time of day. This finding is consistent with most other studies of combination therapy with basal insulin and DPPIVi, which have reported no increased risk of hypoglycaemia in participants who received a DPPIVi plus insulin compared with those who received insulin alone [<xref rid="pone.0190579.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0190579.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In the analysis presented here, the magnitude of the lower risk of hypoglycaemia for Gla-300 versus Gla-100 was generally consistent whether DDPIVi therapy was present or not, although this lower risk for Gla-300 did not achieve statistical significance in the &#x02018;with DDPIVi&#x02019; group, most likely due to smaller sample size and lower power than in the &#x02018;without DPPIVi&#x02019; group. The lower number of participants in the &#x02018;with DPPIVi&#x02019; subgroup, and hence the lower number of confirmed (&#x02264;3.9 mmol/L [&#x02264;70 mg/dL]) or severe hypoglycaemic events (Gla-300: 446 events for &#x02018;with DPPIVi&#x02019; vs 3523 events for &#x02018;without DPPIVi&#x02019;; Gla-100: 807 events for &#x02018;with DPPIVi&#x02019; vs 4390 for &#x02018;without DPPIVi&#x02019;), made it more difficult to observe significant differences between treatment groups.</p><p>Results from this analysis indicate that the concomitant use of DPPIVi therapy had a generally neutral effect on body weight change, with a small increase in body weight (0.3&#x02013;0.8 kg) observed in all subgroups over 6 months of treatment. This is consistent with observations from previous studies of the co-administration of a DPPIVi and insulin [<xref rid="pone.0190579.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0190579.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The adverse event profile was generally similar between treatment groups and DPPIVi subgroups.</p><p>The limitations of this analysis are inherent to the post hoc nature. It should also be noted that the EDITION studies were not designed to address the question posed by this analysis; however, they were designed from the outset to allow data to be pooled for post hoc analyses. There were minor differences between the inclusion criteria in terms of HbA<sub>1c</sub> between EDITION 2 (&#x02265;53 to &#x02264;86 mmol/mol [&#x02265;7.0 to &#x02264;10.0%]) and EDITION 3 (&#x02265;53 to &#x02264;97 mmol/mol [&#x02265;7.0 to &#x02264;11.0]). To address this, the model used to analyse HbA<sub>1c</sub> change was adjusted on the baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub> value. Moreover, participants from both studies had the same background antihyperglycaemic treatments. As mentioned above, the differences in the number of people in the DPPIVi subgroups may have limited data interpretation. Nevertheless, observations from this analysis may help guide combination treatment in people with type 2 diabetes who are on DPPIVi plus basal insulin therapy.</p><p>In conclusion, the comparable glycaemic control with lower hypoglycaemia risk with Gla-300 versus Gla-100 was observed irrespective of concomitant DPPIVi use in this population of people with type 2 diabetes. People with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes receiving a DPPIVi and basal insulin may benefit from Gla-300 therapy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec021"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0190579.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Daily basal insulin dose (U/kg) and change from baseline by visit and DPPIVi subgroup over 6 months of treatment (pooled mITT population).</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0190579.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0190579.s002"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Confirmed or severe hypoglycaemia over 6 months, by DPPIVi use (pooled safety population).</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0190579.s002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0190579.s003"><label>S3 Table</label><caption><title>Adverse events over 6 months of treatment, by DPPIVi use (pooled safety population).</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0190579.s003.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank the study participants, trial staff, and investigators for their participation.
