The prevalence in the United Kingdom (UK) is 16% for 6&#x000a0;to 7-year-olds (with 2.2% classed as severe) and 10.6% for 13&#x000a0;to 14-year-olds (with 1.5% classed as severe) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. AE is associated with a significant economic and psychosocial burden.</p><p>A complex interaction between genetics, environment and immunology define the pathophysiology of AE. There is increasing in vitro and murine-model evidence for the role of IgE in the immunopathogenesis of atopic dermatitis, with higher IgE levels linked with more severe disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. IgE is likely to be of more relevance in paediatric disease than in adult disease, where AE is thought to become less allergen-driven and more &#x02018;autoreactive&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. This study focusses on a paediatric atopic population, to target patients in whom IgE is more likely to be relevant.</p><p>The management of AE includes the identification and elimination of trigger factors, appropriate use of topical treatments, and adequate patient education. When systemic therapy is required, systemic immunosuppressants, such as ciclosporin, azathioprine, and methotrexate, have been used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. However there is limited published evidence in childhood practice to guide clinical use. In addition, most of these drugs are not licensed for use in patients with severe AE in many countries. With the potential for&#x000a0;serious side effects, these drugs are often not recommended for long-term use.</p><p>Omalizumab (Xolair&#x000ae;, Novartis) is the only commercially available anti-IgE antibody. It binds to human IgE, limiting mast cell degranulation and inhibiting the release of inflammatory mediators. It is licensed in the European Union for use in chronic spontaneous urticaria from the age of 12 years, and severe persistent allergic asthma from the age of 6 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Safety data suggests that Xolair&#x000ae; (omalizumab) is well tolerated in children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>Our hypothesis is that anti-IgE will reduce the levels of IgE in children with severe AE and alleviate their symptoms.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Objectives</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Primary objectives</title><p>

Recruitment will be open to participants in the UK who are willing to travel to the central treatment centre for their treatment and follow-up visits.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Intervention</title><p>Each participant will be enrolled for 48 weeks, consisting of a 24-week treatment period and a 24-week follow-up period. A detailed timeline of the study is shown in the Gantt chart in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Figure S3.</p><p>The active treatment is omalizumab (Xolair&#x000ae;) injection, manufactured by Novartis and provided as 150-mg single-use vial. The manufacturer also provided the comparator. Placebo is formulated to be comparable in appearance to the omalizumab and contains all of the same excipients except the drug substance. The dose and dosing frequency of omalizumab (Xolair&#x000ae;) or placebo will be determined by baseline total IgE (range: 30 to 1500 IU/ml), measured before treatment commences, and body weight (kg) at the randomisation visit. The dose of omalizumab (Xolair&#x000ae;) will be calculated using the latest manufacturer&#x02019;s dosing tables (according to the current Summary of Product Characteristics) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The dose of Xolair&#x000ae; (omalizumab) stated on the table, closest to that child&#x02019;s weight and IgE levels, is used. Doses are 75, 150, 225, 300, 450, 525 or 600 mg every 2 or 4 weeks. The equivalent volume for placebo doses will be calculated in the same way. Participants will remain on the same dose throughout the 24 weeks of treatment. Treatment is administered subcutaneously in the deltoid region or the thigh as one to four injections depending on the dose. Anaesthesia using topical local anaesthetic (lidocaine cream) or ethyl chloride spray can be used prior to the injection, according to patient preference.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Randomisation and blinding</title><p>Participants who consent to participate and who fulfil the eligibility criteria are randomly allocated to receive either omalizumab (Xolair&#x000ae;) or placebo in a 1:1 allocation ratio using a secure web-based randomisation system. The allocation sequence is computer-generated by the UK Clinical Research Collaboration (UKCRC)-registered King&#x02019;s College London Clinical Trials Unit in conjunction with an independent statistician. Participants are allocated to treatment group using minimisation with variables IgE (&#x02264;1500, &#x0003e;1500 IU/ml) and age (below 10 years or 10 years and older).</p><p>Blinding is maintained by strictly adhering to established procedures to maintain separation between staff who take outcome measurements and staff who deliver the treatment. All study team physicians, researchers and research nurses involved in primary outcome assessments, as well as participants and their families, are blinded to treatment allocation until the primary analysis is completed. To ensure that these individuals remain blinded to treatment allocation, randomisation details are sent electronically to the independent pharmacy team, and the preparation and administration of the treatment will be restricted to a group of trained clinical staff. Unblinded clinical staff are assigned to collect and then return used vials of active or placebo to pharmacy. Preparation and administration of treatment by unblinded staff will occur in a closed treatment room, separate from the main clinical area. Entry to this room is barred to blinded staff during the preparation and administration of the treatment by unblinded staff. Unblinded clinical staff will not be involved in trial-related primary outcome assessments to minimise the risk of disclosing the allocation of treatment. Staff members who obtain outcome measurements are not involved in any of the steps involving handling of the intervention.</p><p>All patients will be provided with an emergency card with relevant contact details to be carried for the duration of the trial. Code break will be provided in clinically relevant situations to clinicians, by the pharmacy department.</p><p>The study statistician will analyse the data blinded to treatment allocation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Concomitant medications</title><p>Participants may continue to take their conventional treatments for AE during the course of the study. Concomitant AE medications would include topical treatments including any emollients, bath additives, topical steroids, topical calcineurin inhibitors, wet wraps and systemic treatment.</p><p>During treatment with omalizumab (Xolair&#x000ae;)/placebo, the participants/parents will monitor the child&#x02019;s AE at home and, if there is any deterioration, this would trigger the participants/parents to contact the study team to discuss drug doses or a reassessment and modification of therapy. An exacerbation will be identified and managed, and any additional therapy or changes in doses of existing treatment will be recorded.</p><p>Any medication required for any ongoing illness, contraception and any rescue medications will also be permitted and recorded.

The analysis will follow an intention-to-treat (ITT) principle and participants will be analysed in the arm to which they were allocated regardless of subsequent treatment received.

The baseline characteristics (age, gender, objective and subjective SCORAD, Body Mass Index (BMI), asthma (Y/N), food allergy (Y/N), rhinoconjunctivitis (Y/N) and referral source (self-referred/tertiary) of those missing follow-up will be compared to those with complete follow-up.

An overall treatment effect for the objective SCORAD score at 24 weeks will be estimated. A number of sensitivity analyses will be performed to estimate the treatment effect adjusting for use of topical steroids and alternative systemic therapy.

Subjective SCORAD scores will be analysed in a similar manner as for objective SCORAD scores. For all other outcomes we will only adjust for the minimisation variables IgE (&#x02264;1500, &#x0003e;1500 IU/ml), age (below 10 years or 10 years and older) and baseline data (as appropriate).
