This methodologic study explored whether there are differences in the short-, medium-, and long-term incorporation of EPA and DHA into blood plasma and cells with the provision of identical amounts of EPA and DHA, equivalent to 2 oily fish servings per week (or 6.54 g/wk EPA and DHA), either intermittently (i.e., 1 portion twice per week) or continuously (i.e., divided into daily amounts). The study was part of a randomized, double-blind controlled intervention lasting 12 mo, with participants stratified by age and sex. There were 5 intervention groups, 2 of which are reported here: the 2 intermittent portions (2I) and 2 continuous portions (2C) groups. EPA and DHA were measured in plasma phosphatidylcholine, platelets, and blood mononuclear cells (MNCs) at 9 time points. Sixty-five participants completed the study (2I group, <italic>n</italic> = 30, mean age of 49.2 y; 2C group, <italic>n</italic> = 35, mean age of 50.6 y). The incorporation pattern over the 12-mo intervention was different between the 2 groups in all samples (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001, time &#x000d7; treatment interaction). At the end of the 12-mo intervention, the 2C group had higher EPA, DHA, and EPA + DHA in platelets (all <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01) and higher EPA and EPA + DHA in MNCs (both <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) compared with the 2I group. No significant differences were shown for plasma phosphatidylcholine EPA (<italic>P</italic> = 0.1), DHA (<italic>P</italic> = 0.15), EPA + DHA (<italic>P</italic> = 0.07), or MNC DHA (<italic>P</italic> = 0.06). In conclusion, the pattern of consumption does affect the incorporation of EPA and DHA into cells used as biomarkers of intake. The differences identified here need to be considered in the design of studies and when extrapolating results from continuous capsule-based intervention studies to dietary guidelines for oily fish consumption.

There is mounting evidence from intervention studies to increase dietary oily fish consumption to beneficially alter risk factors of disease (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). The benefit of fish consumption is considered to lie with its component n&#x02013;3 PUFAs, EPA and DHA. Indeed, the balance of evidence from intervention studies uses marine-derived n&#x02013;3 PUFAs (i.e., EPA and DHA) as oral supplements, which shows reductions in various disease risk factors (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Although it is assumed that exposure to EPA and DHA delivered either in supplement form or as oily fish will induce the same biologic effects, there are potential differences in both impact of the pattern of consumption of n&#x02013;3 PUFAs from food and supplements and the overall pattern and composition of a diet containing oily fish compared with one supplemented with capsules.</p><p>The provision of EPA and DHA during supplementation studies differs from that of dietary intake, with oily fish being consumed sporadically in most populations. In the United Kingdom, dietary intake data from the National Diet and Nutrition Survey show that, on average, &#x0003c;1 meal containing oily fish is eaten each week, and target dietary guidelines recommend 1&#x02013;2 portions of oily fish per week (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). In contrast, supplements providing EPA and DHA are typically taken daily. This difference in the pattern of delivery of EPA and DHA may alter the uptake and enrichment of EPA and DHA into the blood, cells, and tissues. Most of the evidence on which dietary recommendations are based is derived from supplementation studies, yet a difference in uptake and incorporation could have implications for the interpretation of these data and the subsequent translation to public health advice, which is usually given in terms of portions of oily fish per week.</p><p>The aim of this study was to determine whether there is a difference in EPA and DHA measured in biomarkers of intake when given sporadically compared with a regular amount consumed every day, at doses that reflect typical dietary oily fish intake. This study forms a secondary but prespecified aim of a larger study. The primary outcome of the full study, to elucidate the dose and time response of enrichment of EPA and DHA in plasma fractions, cells, and adipose tissue with intermittent supplementation, has been reported previously (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). We identified that plasma phosphatidylcholine EPA and DHA was the best marker of short-term changes in intake, platelets as a medium-term marker of intake, and blood mononuclear cells (MNCs)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4"><sup>8</sup></xref> as a long-term marker of intake (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Although we also collected other sample types (plasma cholesteryl esters, plasma non-esterified FAs, plasma TGs, erythrocyte membranes, buccal cells, and adipose tissue), we do not report their results here.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title/><sec><title>Study design, participants, and ethics statement.</title><p>This study forms part of a larger study, the design and methods of which have been described previously in detail (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).

This was tested by the provision of capsules with the same weekly dose of EPA + DHA given on 2 random days per week only or given as a continuous regimen, divided equally between all days of the week and measuring the enrichment of EPA and DHA into plasma fractions and cell membranes found previously to reflect short-term (plasma phosphatidylcholine), medium-term (platelets), and long-term (MNCs) dietary intake (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p><p>This study shows that EPA + DHA equivalent to the amount found in 2 portions of oily fish delivered in the continuous regimen for 12 mo leads to a greater enrichment of EPA and EPA + DHA into MNCs and of EPA, DHA, and EPA + DHA into platelets than if the same dose is delivered intermittently on 2 d of the week. However, although there was a trend for a similar finding, this was not statistically significant for EPA, DHA, or EPA + DHA in plasma phosphatidylcholine or for DHA in MNCs in response to the 12-mo intervention.</p><p>Extrapolations are made frequently from the findings of n&#x02013;3 PUFA supplementation studies to public health recommendations for the consumption of oily fish. However, the enrichment of EPA and DHA in response to daily supplements may differ from that in response to the consumption of fish, which is generally sporadic. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to simulate sporadic fish consumption in a manner that is directly comparable with the continuous delivery of EPA and DHA in conventional supplementation studies.</p><p>There have been studies that directly compared short-term (&#x0003c;8 wk) capsule supplementation with oily fish consumption, in which the oily fish forms part of a meal and replaces other dietary items. Elvevoll et al. (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) compared 2 portions/wk cooked salmon, equivalent to 400 g/wk and providing an average of 1.2 g/d EPA and DHA, to cod liver oil providing 3.0 g/d EPA and DHA. The authors found that the increase in serum EPA and DHA was higher after the intermittent pattern in the cooked salmon group, despite its lower provision of EPA and DHA per day. This is in contrast to our study, in which the continuous pattern resulted in higher EPA and DHA in MNCs and platelets. Visioli et al. (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) reported that plasma EPA and DHA after daily provision of 100 g of salmon was comparable with that after a daily fish oil supplement containing more than double the dose of EPA and DHA. Together, these studies suggest that EPA and DHA, when consumed in fish flesh, may be more bioavailable because it is provided in a form that is more favorable for digestion and absorption of fats than EPA and DHA provided as supplements. The form of the supplements, either TGs (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) or ethyl esters (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), may also play a role in the bioavailability of EPA and DHA.</p><p>In keeping with our study design, Harris et al. (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) provided 2 portions of oily fish per week or daily capsules, both of which contained equivalent weekly amounts of EPA and DHA. Their results showed similar proportions of EPA and DHA in plasma phospholipids and RBCs after the 16-wk study. Although this study was smaller than ours (23 participants), it similarly shows no significant difference in the proportion of EPA and DHA in a plasma lipid fraction between the 2 study designs.</p><p>In this study, we report a significant difference in the change in reported n&#x02013;6 PUFA intake between the 2 groups. However, with additional adjustment for this in the statistical model, the results still show the same significant differences in EPA and DHA in platelets and MNCs between the 2 groups. The difference in dietary n&#x02013;6 PUFA is also evident at baseline, whereas the plasma phosphatidylcholine, platelets, and MNCs results show no difference in EPA and DHA amounts between the 2 groups at baseline. Therefore, we conclude that the differences in dietary n&#x02013;6 PUFA intake are not responsible for the differences in EPA and DHA between the 2I and 2C groups at 12 mo in this study.</p><p>Although there was an overall difference in EPA and DHA incorporation over the course of the 12 mo, we show no significant difference in plasma phosphatidylcholine at 12 mo. It is of interest that a difference between the 2I and 2C groups appears to exist for plasma phosphatidylcholine in the first few weeks of the current study (as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>), but this effect diminished over the course of the 12-mo intervention, and indeed, at 12 mo, there were no significant differences in EPA or DHA between the 2 groups. Rather, it was MNCs and platelets that showed significant differences at 12 mo. We showed previously that plasma fractions respond more acutely to changes in EPA and DHA intake (weeks), whereas platelets and MNCs reflect longer-term changes (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Compliance in this study was reported to be high (average of &#x0003e;97% across the 12-mo intervention), and the analyses were adjusted for compliance; however, it is possible that, with the duration of the study, compliance to the capsule intervention fell. This would be expected to be most evident in the plasma phosphatidylcholine results, which reflect shorter-term intake. It is also possible that regular intake of EPA and DHA stimulates a more efficient uptake and incorporation of these FAs, as is seen for other nutrients, such as iron (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>).</p><p>We reported previously similar data for 0, 1, 2, and 4 continuous portions of oily fish (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Here the adjusted mean difference between the 2I and 2C groups is only marginally smaller than the difference observed between groups receiving doses equivalent to 0 and 1 portion of oily fish per week (range of 0.47&#x02013;0.94 &#x000d7; the difference, for EPA, DHA, or EPA + DHA in each of plasma phosphatidylcholine, platelets, and MNCs), supporting a focus in dietary guidelines on the total weekly intake of these FAs. However, the difference between the 2I and 2C groups suggests a benefit of frequent consumption and supports weekly rather than monthly food-based guidelines.</p><p>The results of this study demonstrate that EPA and DHA enrichment of platelets and MNCs is greater when provided as a continuous daily supply compared with the same amount in &#x0201c;portions&#x0201d; provided intermittently over the course of a 12-mo intervention to mimic oily fish guidelines. This finding may have implications for the associated health benefits observed in continuous supplementation studies and suggests that the same dose of EPA and DHA achieved through sporadic oily fish consumption may have a lesser impact on EPA and DHA status. Additional research to determine the differences in bioavailability and incorporation of n&#x02013;3 PUFAs derived from oily fish consumption and from supplements and to further explore the consequences of altering cell membrane composition are warranted. In the future, a portions or intermittent study design, such as we used here, may help bridge the gap between experimental studies and public health advice.</p></sec>
