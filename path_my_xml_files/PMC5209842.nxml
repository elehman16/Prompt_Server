However, 20&#x02013;90% of these individuals lose ADL function and never fully recover. It is currently unknown to what extent occupational therapy (OT) with coaching based on cognitive behavioral treatment (CBT) improves recovery. The same holds for sensor monitoring-based coaching in addition to OT.

All nursing homes will initially provide standard care. At designated time points, nursing homes, successively and in random order, will cross over to the provision of OT and at the next time point, to sensor monitoring-enhanced OT. A total of 288 older individuals, previously living alone in the community, who after a hip fracture were admitted to a geriatric rehabilitation ward for a short-term rehabilitation, will be enrolled.</p><p>Individuals in the first intervention group (OTc) will participate in an OT rehabilitation program with coaching based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) principles. In the sensor monitoring group, sensor monitoring is added to the OT intervention (OTcsm). Participants will receive a sensor monitoring system consisting of (i) an activity monitor during nursing home stay, (ii) a sensor monitoring system at home and a (iii) a web-based feedback application. These components will be embedded in the OT. The OT consists of a weekly session with an occupational therapist during the nursing home stay followed by four home visits and four telephone consultations.

The effects of a hip fracture are serious; one year after a hip fracture, 25% of patients have died and 20&#x02013;90% of older individuals have new Activities of Daily Living (ADL) disabilities, defined as a functional decline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Risk factors for functional decline after hip fracture can be divided into non-modifiable and modifiable risk factors. Non-modifiable risk factors are older age, female gender, living alone, cognitive impairment (dementia) and comorbidities. The modifiable risk factors are activities of daily living (ADL), walking ability, and depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Psychological factors such as low levels of self-efficacy and fear of falling have also been associated with functional decline after hip fracture in older individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>Currently, most multidisciplinary rehabilitation programs for patients after hip fracture concentrate on improving mobility and ADL function but not fear of falling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The evidence on the effectiveness of these rehabilitation programs on the recovery of ADL function is mixed. Exercise interventions have been used to improve physical function (e.g., gait speed, mobilization, balance, and strength), but despite an improvement in physical function, many older persons do not achieve a full recovery of ADL function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. High-intensity (e.g., 4 times a week physical therapy) and intensive extended supervised exercise programs (e.g., during 12&#x000a0;month) had a significant impact on various physical functions, but the cost-effectiveness of these extended programs is unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The main component of effective studies is &#x02018;home-based functional task exercises&#x02019; (e.g., walking stairs, transferring), which results in a modest improvement in physical function post-discharge or at one year after discharge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>Fear of falling may have an important influence on functional recovery after hip fracture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Because of the fear of falling, people feel insecure while moving and performing activities of daily living, and as a consequence, they do less and less. However, for good recovery, performing ADLs is essential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Therefore, for older individuals, mobility is an essential aspect of quality of life and crucial for the preservation of independence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Fifty percent or more of patients with hip fracture suffer from a fear of falling, resulting in a reduction in physical activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Therefore, in order to be successful, rehabilitation programs may need to focus on increasing self-efficacy concerning falls and fear of falling. Additionally, programs should focus on setting realistic goals for increasing the performance of daily activities, change the environment to reduce the fall risk and promote physical activity to increase strength and balance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>To coach patients in modifying their patterns of thoughts (cognition) and activities (behavior) that contribute to the fear of falling, CBT principles can be used, consisting of five steps, which together have been proven effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]: 1) to educate individuals about being physically active and to stimulate physical activity and exercise, 2) to ascertain the amount of movement and physical activity during the day and give feedback, 3) to set realistic goals for the performance of daily activities, 4) to plan these activities, and 5) to evaluate progress.</p><p>New healthcare technologies, such as sensor monitoring, can assist healthcare professionals in coaching more effectively without increasing their time expenditure. The sensors provide an objective continuous measurement of daily functioning and provide automatic feedback via a web-based application [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. This can be combined with the coaching of the daily functions of the client [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Older individuals who had a sensor system in their home during a long period of time appreciated having sensors at home and indicated that the technology supported their ability to live an independent life and contributed to their sense of safety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. However, as far as we know, sensor technologies have not yet been used in the rehabilitation of older patients after hip fracture.</p><p>The aim of the present study is to investigate the effect of sensor monitoring, embedded in a multidimensional OT rehabilitation program, on the recovery of physical ADL function among community-dwelling participants after hip fracture 6&#x000a0;months after the start of the rehabilitation in the nursing home compared to OT without sensor monitoring and to standard care.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design and setting</title><p>The study is a three-phase, cross-sectional, complete design (data are collected from each cluster throughout the trial), stepped wedge, cluster randomized trial (SW-CRT).

</p><p>Six clusters (nursing homes) will be randomized to one of three fixed sequences, each containing the three interventions. All clusters will start with providing standard care (control condition) at the beginning of the study. At predetermined time points, two clusters cross over from the control condition (C) to the first intervention, the OT intervention with coaching based on CBT (OTc). At other predetermined time points, two clusters crosses over to sensor monitoring embedded in an OT intervention based on CBT (OTcsm). The interval between the different time points will be 2&#x000a0;months.

</p><sec id="Sec8"><title>Care as usual (C): rehabilitation provided to all patients included in the study</title><p>After admission to the nursing home, a multidisciplinary assessment including a consultation of the different disciplines begins. The multidisciplinary team in the nursing homes will comprise a nursing home physician, a nurse, a physical therapist (PT) and an occupational therapist (OT). If required, other professionals, such as a dietician or psychologist, will be consulted. Within 48&#x000a0;h after admission to the nursing home, the nursing home physician, together with the nurse, will conduct a comprehensive geriatric assessment and also coordinates wound care, pain management and the mobilization plan. S/he will also coordinate the patient&#x02019;s multidisciplinary care and treatment team. The PT assessment will focus on mobility, muscle strength, balance transfer and walking. The OT assessment will focus on the performance of daily functions and safety at home. After the assessments, a multidisciplinary care and treatment plan will be made together with the patient. All patients will follow the evidence-based multidisciplinary rehabilitation program. Currently, in the Netherlands, the focus of rehabilitation after hip fracture is PT. Patients will be discharged after 3&#x02013;6&#x000a0;weeks, as soon as they are able to function independently or with the assistance of formal or informal care at home. If needed, some of the patients receive rehabilitation at home or at a rehabilitation ward outside of the nursing home, but this is provided to a minority of patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Intervention arm 1: OT with coaching without sensor monitoring (OTc)</title><p>On top of the multidisciplinary rehabilitation, participants in this intervention group will receive an OT intervention with coaching (OTc). The primary role of OT is to optimize performance and engagement in meaningful activities and to improve participation.

As fear of falling is very common in patients after hip fracture, a main aim is to reduce that fear and improve recovery. To coach patients in modifying their patterns of thought (cognition) and activities (behavior) that contribute to the fear of falling, the occupational therapist integrates the following five CBT principles (which have proven to improve fear of falling) in the rehabilitation: 1) to give information and education about the importance of physical activity and daily exercise; 2) to ascertain the amount of movement and physical activity during the day and give feedback 3) to define, together with the patient, realistic goals for the performance of daily activities; 4) to make an activity plan together with the patient and, if needed, practice exercises and daily activities in a safe manner accompanied by the occupational therapist. Patients will select the activities in which fear of falls are experienced that they consider relevant and important to practice; 5) to evaluate progress.</p><p>OT will take place once a week while a patient is still in nursing home. After discharge, the participants receive four home visits by an occupational therapist in the first 4&#x000a0;weeks after discharge, followed by four telephone consultations.</p><p>The first home visit takes place within 2&#x000a0;days after discharge from the nursing home and will cover changing to the environment to reduce fall risk and setting realistic goals for increasing daily physical activities.

The development of the SO-HIP tool is based on the experiences in a preceding proof-of-concept by the University of Amsterdam and Amsterdam University of Applied Science (AUAS) that was started in 2011 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p><p>1) The wearable activity monitor (Pam) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pamcoach.com/">http://www.pamcoach.com</ext-link>) consists of a 3-dimensional accelerometer, 68 x 33 x 10&#x000a0;mm, wirelessly connected to a base unit from which the data are sent to a secure database and a web-based application (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The Pam is worn on the hip and measures the time of all daily activities in minutes per day. We tested the feasibility. Older individuals experienced the pam is extremely easy to use: e.g. easy to clip on a waistband, comfortable to wear during the day and individuals don&#x02019;t have to adjust anything to the device. The Pam measures the acceleration of the body movements and expresses the measured movements in the pam score. The Pam score is an index representing the ratio of energy expended through physical activity to resting metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Sensor monitoring system and web application. <bold>a</bold> Pam sensor. <bold>b</bold> Pam sensor worn on a waist band. <bold>c</bold> Motion sensor, data box, pam sensor. <bold>d</bold> Measured movements per day expressed in a pam score. <bold>e</bold> The number of minutes active movements per day. <bold>f</bold> Visualization of an activity pattern measured by the wireless sensor monitoring system during one month.

In each visit, the progress with regard to physical daily activities will be discussed. A new goal will be set, and a discussion what happened during the week will take place, addressing what was easy, what were difficult activities, and why. (See further coaching details regarding the use of sensor monitoring).</p><p>2) The sensor monitoring system consists of a wireless sensor network with a base unit with 16 simple Benext sensors, covering the main spaces in a house. This system will be placed in the home when the participant is discharged from the nursing home. The sensors are passive infrared motion sensors (to detect motion in a specific area), contact switches (reed) on doors and cabinets (to measure whether doors are opened or closed), energy switch sensors (to measure the use of appliances such as the TV or washing machine), and one float sensor in the toilet (to measure the flushing of the toilet). The activity patterns of the daily functioning of participants are monitored using the wireless sensor monitoring system and are sent to a local base unit and stored in a secured database. These sensor data are analyzed by a computer program, which looks for activities of daily functioning and daily patterns in the data. (e.g., toileting or bathing can be recognized, but more complex activities such as preparing a breakfast, and other kitchen activities will also be recognized by the sensor system). A sequence of binary sensor data indicates the activity with the help of a recognition algorithm. The occupational therapist can use the reports of the sensor data via a secure web application to evaluate the daily functioning of the patient and by doing so appropriately coach the patient in performing daily functions and exercises following the same five steps learned during the nursing home rehabilitation (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).</p><p>The participants in the intervention OTcsm group receive information about the sensor monitoring at the start of the rehabilitation in the nursing home. This information includes a short manual and daily instruction on how to wear the activity monitor. In the week of discharge, the patients receive further information pertaining to the sensor monitoring at home.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Details for the use of sensor monitoring embedded in the OT intervention with coaching</title><p>From the start of the rehabilitation in the nursing home, the patient will wear an activity monitor (see technical details of the SO-HIP tool). The occupational therapist monitors the activities via a secure website and uses the sensor data as feedback for coaching the participant by following the five steps once a week during a coaching session. The sensor data reports can be used in the coaching as objective information about the current state of the amount of movement and activities performed during the day. The sensor data reports form a starting point for discussion about the daily patterns and activities that are important to practice and for making new realistic plans for activities based on the objective reports.

The COPM is a client-centered, occupation-focused outcome measure for the detection of change in perceived occupational performance over time. It is a generic measure suitable for all clients with perceived problems in daily activities. It uses a semi-structured interview format and a structured scoring method. The COPM results in two main scores, Performance and Satisfaction, each out of total of 10. The patient prioritizes up to five problems s/he deems that are the most urgent or important and rates the problems on an ordinary 10-point scale regarding performance (1&#x02009;=&#x02009;not able to do at all and 10&#x02009;=&#x02009;able to do extremely well) and satisfaction (1&#x02009;=&#x02009;not satisfied at all and 10&#x02009;=&#x02009;extremely satisfied). The mean scores will be obtained by summing the ratings for performance and satisfaction and dividing them by the number of prioritized problems. Change in scores can be calculated after a reassessment interval to measure the change in the perception of occupational performance. For evaluation at a later time, the patient rates the performance regarding the prioritized problems outlined in the first interview. The COPM is a standardized instrument, with specific instructions and methods for administering and scoring. The reliability and validity of the COPM have been shown in many studies, and the COPM is widely used as an outcome measure for individuals and interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].

First, the intervention effect can be estimated using between and within cluster comparisons and the professionals are their own controls in the interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. Second, each participating nursing home will have implemented both interventions at the end of the study while in a traditional cluster randomized trial some clusters will have received only a control intervention. This increased nursing homes&#x02019; willingness to participate. Third, in order to provide training in each cluster before the start of the interventions, the staggered start of the interventions makes a better time allowance. The same accounts for the technical support of the tool if needed. Last, because of the crossover from control to OTc and OTcsm and each participant receives only one condition, we may assume that there are no carryover effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>].</p><p>For older adults, the ability to remain mobile is an essential aspect of quality of life and is crucial for the preservation of independence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. An important aspect of the intervention using sensor monitoring is to apply CBT principles. Sensor monitoring embedded in the OT intervention with CBT coaching is expected to have an impact directly at the level of the patient&#x02019;s ability to perform activities in his or her own context. A characteristic of the use of sensor monitoring in an OT intervention is that goals related to daily activities are formulated that are relevant and important to the person and are based on the objective measurement of daily functioning by sensors. The coaching by the occupational therapist will target these particular issues. Our hypothesis is that the person&#x02019;s self-perceived performance in daily activities, measured using the COPM, will alter as a result of the intervention.</p><p>This study will provide new knowledge regarding the combined intervention of CBT coaching by occupational therapists and CBT coaching by occupational therapists using sensor monitoring, enabling older individuals to perform everyday activities and to remain living independently after hip fracture.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ADL</term><def><p>Activities of daily living</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CBT</term><def><p>Cognitive behavioral treatment</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>COPM</term><def><p>Canadian Occupational Performance Measure</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EQ5D</term><def><p>Euroquol, instrument for assessing health related quality of life</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FES-I</term><def><p>Falls Efficacy Scale-International</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IADL</term><def><p>Instrumental Activities of Daily Living</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Katz-15</term><def><p>Katz Index of Independence in Activities of Daily Living</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MDS</term><def><p>Minimal dataset</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MMSE</term><def><p>Mini Mental State Examination</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OT</term><def><p>Occupational therapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OTc</term><def><p>Occupational Therapy with Coaching</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OTcsm</term><def><p>Occupational therapy with coaching and sensor monitoring</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PAM</term><def><p>Physical Activity Monitor</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>POMA</term><def><p>Performance Oriented Mobility Assessment</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PT</term><def><p>Physical therapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SO-HIP</term><def><p>Sensor monitoring embedded in Occupational therapy rehabilitation for patients after Hip-fracture</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SO-HIP tool</term><def><p>Sensor monitoring system used for hip rehabilitation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VAS-SAFE</term><def><p>Visual Analogue Scale for Fear of Falling</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WMO</term><def><p>Medical research involving human subjects act</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by the Netherlands organization Fonds Nuts Ohra, grant number 1401-057, date of registration April 1 2016.</p><sec id="FPar2"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p>The data we will collect in this randomized controlled trial will be made available, from the corresponding author on reasonable request, within the acceptable and existing privacy legislations.
