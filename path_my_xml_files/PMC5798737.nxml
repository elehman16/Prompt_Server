We investigated the cost of the treatment of ureteral stone(s) within 45 days after initial intervention by means of retrospective analysis of the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan. All patients of ages &#x02265;20 years diagnosed with ureteral stone(s)( International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification/ICD-9-CM: 592.1) from January 2001 to December 2011 were enrolled. We included a comorbidity code only if the diagnosis appeared in at least 2 separate claims in a patient&#x02019;s record. Treatment modalities (code) included extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy (SWL; 98.51), ureteroscopic lithotripsy (URSL; 56.31), percutaneous nephrolithotripsy (PNL; 55.04), (open) ureterolithotomy (56.20), and laparoscopy (ie, laparoscopic ureterolithotomy; 54.21). There were 28&#x02009;513 patients with ureteral stones (13&#x02009;848 men and 14&#x02009;665 women) in the randomized sample of 1 million patients. The mean cost was 526.4 &#x000b1; 724.1 United States Dollar (USD). The costs of treatment were significantly increased in patients with comorbidities. The costs of treatment among each primary treatment modalities were 1212.2 &#x000b1; 627.3, 1146.7 &#x000b1; 816.8, 2507.4 &#x000b1; 1333.5, 1533.3 &#x000b1; 1137.1, 2566.4 &#x000b1; 2594.3, and 209.8 &#x000b1; 473.2 USD in the SWL, URSL, PNL, (open) ureterolithotomy, laparoscopy (laparoscopic ureterolithotomy), and conservative treatment group, respectively. In conclusion, URSL was more cost-effective than SWL and PNL as a primary treatment modality for ureteral stone(s) when the possible additional costs within 45 days after the initial operation were included in the calculation.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>cost-effective</kwd><kwd>population-based study</kwd><kwd>National Health Insurance Research Database</kwd><kwd>ureteral stones</kwd><kwd>Taiwan</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>January-December 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="section1-0046958016669015"><title>Introduction</title><p>Ureteral stone is a common disease worldwide with increasing incidence and prevalence.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-0046958016669015" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bibr2-0046958016669015" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy (SWL) and ureteroscopic lithotripsy (URSL) are the 2 most common procedures performed to treat ureteral stones in more developed countries.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-0046958016669015" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Medical expulsion is applicable when the stone size is relatively small.

A recent meta-analysis of 10 articles on the treatment of proximal ureteral stones &#x0003e;10 mm concluded that URSL was more clinically effective than SWL, and the associated risks were not significantly higher; however, cost-effectiveness was not included as a variable.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-0046958016669015" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Cochrane database published their findings in 2012, stating that URSL achieved a higher SFR but with the cost of increased complication rates and hospital stay.<sup><xref rid="bibr13-0046958016669015" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> The cost of lithotripters may not differ between studies because of the oligopoly of the international market by a handful of specialized manufacturers, but the financial cost of hospital days may differ greatly among countries.</p><p>A prospective randomized study from eastern China found that despite having a higher SFR in treating distal ureteral stones, URSL brought upon more complications than SWL and was associated with a higher cost; however, it is worth noting that the average hospital stays of patients in the SWL and URSL groups were 5.4 and 6.6 days, respectively.<sup><xref rid="bibr14-0046958016669015" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> The admission days in this study were astonishingly longer than that reported in other countries and may cause discrepancies in cost evaluation.

This retrospective study revealed superior SFR for ureteral stones less than 1.5 cm treated with URSL compared with SWL. Their decision analysis model demonstrated that when SFR for SWL is less than 60% to 64% or is greater than 57% to 76% for URSL, SWL is not a cost-effective treatment option. Based on these findings, they suggested that careful stratification and selection of stone patients may enable surgeons to increase the cost-effectiveness of SWL. To avoid the inclusion of patients without ureteral stones into the study population due to input of incorrect ICD codes, our inclusion criteria included a treatment code that confirms the original diagnosis of ureteral stone in each entry. We calculated the costs of treatment within 45 days instead of documenting a single procedural fee, because secondary procedures may follow an unsatisfactory primary procedure, which may lead to increased costs within that period.</p><p>Our study showed that URSL was the most cost-effective treatment of choice for ureteral stones if the calculation included the cost incurred by additional treatment up to 45 days postoperatively. Our results supported the previous study by Huang et al<sup><xref rid="bibr5-0046958016669015" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> that compared the overall treatment cost during admission among stone treatment modalities, but that study did not include the costs of additional treatment after primary intervention. Huang et al found that the overall treatment cost was higher in the SWL group without reaching statistical significance (USD 627.1 &#x000b1; 267.3 vs 596.3 &#x000b1; 143.5). After stratification by the location of the stone(s), the overall treatment cost was significantly higher in the extracorporeal SWL group than in the URSL group for patients with upper-third ureteral stones, irrespective of stone size. Our data also revealed that the cost of SWL is significantly higher than that of URSL (USD 1212.2 &#x000b1; 627.3 vs 1146.7 &#x000b1; 816.8) when the costs incurred by postoperative treatment within 45 days of primary intervention were included. In fact, URSL was the least costly primary intervention modality among all the treatment groups when postoperative treatment costs were included in the calculation.</p><p>The management of ureteral calculi has evolved over the past decades with the advent of new surgical and medical treatments. The current guidelines support conservative management as a possible approach for ureteral stones sized 10 mm. More recently, Alevizopoulos et al<sup><xref rid="bibr17-0046958016669015" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> showed that conservative management is clinically effective with a significant cost-benefit, particularly for the subgroup of stones sized 0 to 4 mm, where a need for follow-up scans is in dispute. We separately investigated whether the presence of comorbidities increased the medical costs in patients who received lithotripsy, and the results were significantly positive. Patients with comorbidities have higher medical costs in our study.

The sample size is 28&#x02009;513 patients, larger than previous studies. However, there are several limitations of this study. National Health Insurance Research Database could not provide certain details, such as stone size, location, or stone quantity. The increase in cost may be related to usage of chronic medications but not necessarily complications related to surgery. Therefore, this may be the causes of higher cost in PNL and laparoscopy. However, SWL and URSL might be in a same condition of choice which can be compared.
