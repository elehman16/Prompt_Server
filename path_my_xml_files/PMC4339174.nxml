posture control in Taekwondo club students, that is, balance ability, were investigated.
To that end, changes in the Taekwondo players&#x02019; balance ability resulting from active core
training for eight weeks were examined through fitness and foot pressure. [Subjects] The
present study was conducted with 13 male Taekwondo players of K University in Deagu, South
Korea. Once the experiment process was explained, consent was obtained from those who
participated voluntarily. [Methods] Air cushions (Germany), Jumpers (Germany), and
Aero-Steps (Germany) were used as lumbar stabilization exercise tools. As a method of
training proprioceptive senses by stimulating somatesthesia in standing postures, the
subjects performed balance squats, supine pelvic lifts, and push-up plus exercise using
slings while standing on an Aero-Step and performed hip extension parallel squats (Wall
Gym Ball), and standing press-ups on a Togu using their own weight. The subjects performed
four sets of these isometric exercises while maintaining an exercise time per set at 30
seconds in each session and repeated this session three times per week. [Result] Left grip
strength significantly increased and number of sit-ups, which indicates muscle endurance,
also significantly increased after the eight weeks exercise compared with before the
exercise. The values measured during the sit and reach test, which indicate flexibility,
also significantly increase after the eight weeks of exercise compared with before the
exercise but only in the left foot. [Conclusion] The result of present study suggest that
active core exercise using Slings and Togus can be applied as a very effective exercise
program for enhancing balance, which is an important physical factor for Taekwondo club
students.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Sling</kwd><kwd>Togu</kwd><kwd>Foot pressure</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>In relation to fitness, although power, strength, muscle endurance, agility, and
flexibility have been reported as very important fitness factors in Taekwondo games<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>,
factors that directly affect athletic performance have not yet been established<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.
For Taekwondo players, the importance of balance at landing during kicks or steps takes a
part of fitness factors.</p><p>If vertical jump motions are made frequently in sport activities, the possibility of
injuries developing in the jumper&#x02019;s knees or anterior cruciate ligaments will increase
because of excessive increases in stretching in the knee region and landing motions<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.
The rate of injuries due to kicks including high level jumps is actually exhibiting an
increasing trend.</p><p>In general, the causes of occurrences of sport injuries are attributed to excessive
training, incorrect training methods, issues related to physique, lack of flexibility, and
imbalance of muscle strength<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Proprioceptive senses play an important role in maintaining joint stability. It is known
that although flexibility, muscle endurance, and muscle strength are needed to perform in
high-level sports agilely and accurately, proprioceptive senses act as a very important
factor for continuous and precise performance of sports techniques<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Core stabilization exercises are known to strengthen the deep muscles of the human body
such the local spinal muscle group, the abdominal muscle group, the hip muscles, and the
pelvic muscles<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. The trunk muscles such
as the spinal, pelvic, and abdominal muscles are called the core muscles. These core muscles
generate all the power and motility of the human body. In the case of Taekwondo players,
strengthening these core muscles would improve spinal movement and stability, and greatly
help to improve athletic performance.</p><p>Fitness factors such as the ability to turn quickly, quickness, agility, and balance are
required in Taekwondo games because attacks and defensive maneuvers are made in response to
the movements of opponents, and at least 90% of attacks are made with foot techniques.
Therefore, in the present study, the effects of core training using slings and Togus on the
improvement of postural control in Taekwondo club students that is, balance ability, were
investigated.</p><p>To that end, changes in the Taekwondo club students&#x02019; balance ability resulting from active
core training for eight weeks were examined through fitness and foot pressure.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The present study was conducted with 13 male Taekwondo players of K University in Deagu,
South Korea. The age (mean &#x000b1; standard deviation), height, weight, and body fat percentage of
subjects in the lumbar stabilization group were 20.10&#x000b1;1.60&#x02005;years, 173.00&#x000b1;6.59&#x02005;cm,
70.45&#x000b1;8.01&#x02005;kg, and 10.67&#x000b1;3.23% respectively.</p><p>Once the experiment process was explained, consent was obtained from those who participated
voluntarily. All the subjects understood the purpose of this study and provided written
informed consent prior to participation in the study in accordance with the ethical
standards of the Declaration of Helsinki. Regarding the measurement tools and methods,
height, weight, body fat, and body mass index (BMI) among body components were measured
using a body composition analyzer (Inbody 720, Biospace, Seoul, South Korea), in which
bioelectrical impedance analysis was applied. The distribution of plantar pressure of the
foot was measured using a GPS400 (Italy). The subjects were instructed to stand on the foot
pressure measuring system with bare feet in a comfortable posture and look straight ahead
without any movement. This was used to measure the distribution of plantar pressure of the
foot for 20 sec. in a static, neutral posture.</p><p>Air cushions (Germany), Jumpers (Germany), and Aero-Steps (Germany) were used as lumbar
stabilization exercise tools. As a method of training proprioceptive senses by stimulating
somatesthesia in standing postures, the subjects performed balance squats, supine pelvic
lifts, and push-up plus exercise using slings while standing on an Aero-Step and performed
hip extension, parallel squats (wall gym ball), and standing press-ups on a Togu using their
own weight. The subjects performed four sets of these isometric exercises while maintaining
an exercise time per set of 30 per session, repeated three times per week. The data in the
present study was processed using PASW Statistics for Windows Version 18.0 (SPSS Inc.,
Chicago, IL, USA) program to calculate and schematize the means (M) and standard deviations
(SD) of individual items. Paired sample t-tests were conducted before and after the exercise
program. The statistical significance level was set to 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The basic fitness parameters of the Taekwondo club students are shown in <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Changes in fitness between before and after exercises for eight weeks</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Before</th><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">After</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Grip strength (kg) R</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">39.3&#x000b1;7.1</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">41.8&#x000b1;6.9</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Grip strength (kg) L</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">39.0&#x000b1;7.9</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">43.3&#x000b1;5.3*</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Sit-ups (times)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">26.2&#x000b1;6.2</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">30.2&#x000b1;6.2*</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Vertical jump (cm)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">57.0&#x000b1;12.4</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">62.3&#x000b1;12.2</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Sit and reach (cm)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8.8&#x000b1;7.9</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">13.1&#x000b1;6.3*</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Balance (time) R</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">16.7&#x000b1;16.9</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">27.8&#x000b1;22.0</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Balance (time) L</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">17.4&#x000b1;15.1</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">22.3&#x000b1;21.5</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>*: p&#x0003c;0.05</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap>.

Taekwondo, and many studies related to this are being actively conducted. The present study
was designed to examine changes in the fitness and balance of Taekwondo players resulting
from stability training undergone by the Taekwondo players.</p><p>Since stability in sport situations is completely different from the stability on a stable
surface, motions required become much easier to perform when the center of gravity of the
body is effectively arranged to maintain the balance of a relatively heavy weight on a small
and narrow base of support<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Aktuthota and Nadler<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup> advised that
although diverse terms are used for lumbar stabilization exercises such as core
strengthening, dynamic stabilization, trunk stabilization, muscular fusion, and neutral
spine control, their purpose, which is to improve the functional stability around the
abdomen and pelvis, is the same. They suggested that lumbar stabilization exercises should
be effective when the roles of different muscles are well understood and exercise programs
that fit the characteristics of these muscles are applied. Trunk stabilization exercises
have been mainly used to restore the ability to control muscles and movements in low back
pain patients, musculoskeletal system disease patients, and normal persons<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Whether the core has sufficient power or not, power will be lost at the hip muscles if the
trunk is unstable because the level of core stability is insufficient, and so the body will
supplement the power with power from other muscles, eventually leading to the loss of body
balance<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In a study on changes in loads on muscles and spinal stability made while healthy adults
were performing seven core stabilization exercises, Kavcic et al.<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that abdominal curl, side bridging, and bridging
exercises with leg lifts were very closely related to the activity of the musculus rectus
abdominis.</p><p>Choi et al.<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that the muscle
activity of individual abdominal muscles was significantly increased through lumbar
stabilization exercises performed by 20 healthy adults in crawling positions in four
different environments setups using slings.</p><p>Trunk stability exercises improve body balance and stability. In particular, these
exercises activate the abdominal muscles and the multifidus muscles, which are small muscles
on the spine, simultaneously and in harmony, thereby improving any imbalance of those
muscles necessary to maintain postures<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In a study conducted by Kim et al.<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>,
the rate of weight bearing increased more in their experimental group that performed
exercise to improve lower trunk stability five times per week for three weeks than in their
control group which received general exercise treatment intended to improve balance with
weight loads or weight shift, gait, and muscle strength; the experimental group showed
significant differences in the ability to control balance and gait ability, and exercise to
improve lower trunk stability showed significant positive correlations with balance ability
and gait ability.</p><p>In the present study, active core exercises using Togus were applied to Taekwondo players,
and the effects were investigated. Fitness and foot pressure rates were improved, and this
is considered attributable to the squat and upper/lower extremities, and trunk exercises
performed on a Togu while holding a sling in order to strengthen the core muscles in the
abdomen. This result can be considered to be consistent with the results of a previous study
conducted by Oh et al.<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup> indicating that
the core muscles generate all the power and mobility of the human body, as well as
maintaining balance every time we move, and that the movements and stability of the trunk
can be maximized by repeatedly stretching and strengthening the core muscles.</p><p>In the present study, the foot pressure distribution of the Taekwondo players was improved
in balance through active core exercises using Togus, although the differences were not
significant, which is similar to the case previous studies. Hodges and Richardson<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup> reported the importance of trunk muscles
in performing upper and lower extremity movements while maintaining spinal stability in
standing positions or sitting positions. In the present study, the core muscles of the
Taekwondo players were strengthened by the eight weeks of exercise centering on trunk
muscles, and measurement of the foot pressure in standing positions indicated that balance
was significantly improved.</p><p>Dynamic balance had a positive impact throughout four weeks of core exercise in stoke
patients<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>, and Lee, Park, and Lee<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup> showed results indicating a positive
effects compared with their control group after exercising for two weeks using an Aero-Step
in subjects in their 20s from the general pubic Seo et al<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that a significant effect appeared in terms of physical
fitness of the elderly in an intervention using Swiss ball movement for 12 weeks in elderly
women. The results of the present study were found to be consistent with this.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Markovi&#x00107;</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Misigoj-Durakovi&#x00107;</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Trnini&#x00107;</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Fitness profile of elite Croatian female taekwondo
