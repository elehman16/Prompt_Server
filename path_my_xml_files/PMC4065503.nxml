Clinical phase to determine if topical citicoline is able to delay glaucoma progression, considering perimetric parameters and electro functional tests. Patients were randomized in two groups, OMK1 and OAG. The first group was treated with OMK1 three times per day, plus hypotensive therapy for two months and one month of wash out.

The latter is the most cited in the scientific literature.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Citicoline is a mononucleotide formed by ribose, cytosine, pyrophosphate, and choline, the chemical structure of which corresponds to the 2-oxo-4 aminopirimidina. It is a natural precursor of phosphatidylcholine (PDC), the main component of neuronal and mitochondrial membranes. Citicoline is a water-soluble compound with greater than 90% bioavailability.</p><p>Citicoline in the brain acts primarily as a substrate for the formation of PDC and as an inhibitor of Phospholipase A2 (PLP-A2), thus having a direct action on damaged neuron membrane still viable. Moreover, this molecule has neuromodulatory action mainly dependent on the dopamine system, which provides the rational for use of citicoline in the treatment of Parkinson's disease, as well as in glaucoma, as a major neurotransmitter involved in both retinal and post-retinal signal vision transmission.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Citicoline is currently widely used in addition to the hypotensive therapy for the treatment of glaucoma. It has a neuroprotective effect on RGCs from dying over the long term and a neuroenhancing effect on RGC function in the short term.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>A series of clinical trials have demonstrated improvement on visual field testing, visual evoked potential, and pattern electroretinogram in patients with glaucoma. Furthermore, a very recent study seems to indicate that supplementation with 500 mg of citicoline in oral solution might significantly slow down glaucomatous rates of progression.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>In all these studies, it was administered orally or intramuscularly.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the neuroprotective effect of citicoline eye drops and the benefit of the topical administration.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This study adhered to the Declaration of Helsinki, and it was approved by local ethics committee.</p><p>The study was divided into two phases: The first, experimental, demonstrating the presence of the molecule into the vitreous cavity following topical administration in laboratory animals, the second, clinical (prospective, randomized, controlled, double-blind) to test the effectiveness of this new route of administration in patients with glaucoma. In particular, the primary objective of the clinical phase was the assessment of the potential action of topical citicoline, in addition to hypotensive eye drops, in the maintenance and stabilization of the visual field defects in glaucomatous patients in progression. Secondary objectives included the evaluation of retinal ganglion cell function by pattern electroretinogram (PERG) and optic nerve through visual evoked potential (VEP), and tolerability to the eye drops.</p><p>To exclude any interference of citicoline treatment on animal wellbeing, basic hematological parameters of all animals were investigated and compared with experimental controls and with data already available in the literature. Treatment and experimental handling of animals were done also according with the Italian directive (Decree 116/92). A veterinary surgeon controlled the health status of the animals in order to avoid physical injury, suffering, and distress.</p><p>The experiment was performed on five CD1 mice (weight of each mouse approximately 30 g) so divided:</p><p>

</p><p>The right eye (RE) of each mouse in group A and B was treated with two drops twice-a-day for three days. On the fourth day after sacrificing the animal, the eyes were taken, rinsed in saline, and stored in ice. The RE of control mouse was damaged and not available for further analysis. After aspirating the vitreous with a SGE Analytical Science 100 &#x003bc;L syringe, it was diluted with 20 &#x003bc;L of distilled water. Subsequently, the vitreous was centrifuged and the 50 &#x003bc;L of solution 50% water and 50% methanol were added to the collected supernatant and passed by vortex.</p><p>For the sample analysis, liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was used. Instrumentation employed consisted of triple-quadruple mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems API 3000) equipped with a turbo ion-spray and coupled to an UPLC (Dionex Ultimate 3000 RS). In a preliminary stage, chromatographic separation and mass spectrometry identification has been optimized through the use of a pure grade citicoline standard.</p><p>Once set all instrumental and the analytical parameters to get the best conditions, the results were evaluated respect to the therapeutic range expected. This was achieved by mean of a calibration curve built by deuterated citicoline standard solutions made at fixed concentrations.</p><p>The vitreous was added with an equal volume of water/methanol solution, containing deuterated-citicoline. Then, the sample obtained was processed though the previously described LC-MS/MS system.</p><p>Between tests, the machine had always done white readings to avoid contamination.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Clinical phase</title><p>Inclusion criteria to take part in the study were: Age between 20 and 60 years old, best corrected visual acuity &#x02265;5/10, and diagnosis of progressive open-angle glaucoma (loss of 1 db/year). Glaucoma was defined by glaucomatous visual field defect (Humphrey 24-2 SITA Standard, Carl Zeiss Meditec, Inc) with mean deviation (MD) up to 12 dB, glaucomatous optic disc, and IOP less than 21 mmHg on hypotensive treatment.</p><p>Exclusion criteria were considered as follows: Ocular surgery in the last three months, argon laser trabeculoplasty in the last six months, cataract or maculopathy, hypersensitivity to citicoline, secondary ocular hypertension (i.e. due to steroids), history of ocular disease, changes in systemic therapy affecting IOP, use of statin, pregnancy or nursing, failure to use contraceptive, diabetes, arthritis, use of anticoagulant and lithium.</p><p>The study is supposed to last 24 months. As these patients were progressing, we decided to perform an interim analysis after three months. During this period, patients underwent three visits, at baseline, after 60 days, and after 90 days.</p><p>An additional analysis will be performed after six months.</p><p>Patients were randomized in two groups, OMK1, treated with OMK1 one drop three times a day plus hypotensive drops for two months and one month of wash out, and OAG, treated only with hypotensive drops for three months.</p><p>The randomization was masked to the clinicians and the patients. It was made dividing patients into two groups with similar characteristics including age, refraction, and glaucomatous damage. At baseline and at each visit, a comprehensive ophthalmological examination was performed, including corrected visual acuity, biomicroscopy, indirect ophthalmoscopy, IOP measurement with Goldmann applanation tonometer, perimetry white on white (Humphrey 24-2 SITA Standard), recording of PERG and VEP.</p><p>The following variables were considered:</p><p>

To increase its penetration, it is necessary to relax the intercellular junctions of the corneal epithelium, which is possible through the use of BAK, used for decades in ophthalmic preparations as &#x0201c;drug penetration enhancer.&#x0201d;[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>The experimental study has demonstrated that the ophthalmic solution OMK1 based on citicoline 2% in combination with high molecular weight hyaluronic acid and BAK at low concentration, 0.01%, guarantees the passage of the molecule in the posterior segment, reaching the retina and the optic nerve head: Once in the anterior chamber, the molecule diffuses in the vitreous through the zonula and through the uveoscleral route. Hyaluronic acid has the ability to convey the active ingredient and to increase the contact time in the anterior chamber, thus increasing the absorption through the retina, conjunctiva, and sclera.</p><p>The clinical study showed that treatment with topical citicoline induces, after 60 days of therapy, a significant improvement in the ganglion cell function (increased amplitude and reduced latency of PERG). This improvement was still present after 30 days of discontinuing treatment. In addition, improvements in the ganglion cells function induced a reduction of the delay of post-retinal nerve conduction (although the improvement of RCT was not significant).</p><p>The simultaneous significant improvement in the ganglion cells function together with a reduction of the delay of the post-retinal nerve conduction results in an improvement of nerve conduction over the entire optical pathway (reduction of the latency of the VEP).</p><p>After 30 days of suspension of the treatment, the residue improvement of ganglion cell function no longer causes the reduction of post-retinal nerve conduction delay, which returns to pre-treatment values (RCT values &#x0200b;&#x0200b;similar to baseline). The loss of this effect on post-retinal nerve conduction is reflected on the entire visual pathway (latency of VEP unchanged at 90 days).</p><p>In individual eyes, we observed an improvement of the visual field parameters (MD and PSD). However, as the baseline data were highly variable to reach significant values, it &#x0200b;&#x0200b;is necessary to have a greater sample size, which we will reach at the end of the full study period (24 months).</p><p>In conclusion, this interim analysis shows that topical citicoline seems to have a neuroprotective effect that is independent of pressure-lowering effect due to any hypotensive drops.</p><p>Furthermore, topical administration has several advantages: It's easier to use than other forms (intramuscular and oral), and it contains lower concentration of the molecule because it bypasses the hepatic and renal metabolism; therefore, patients can use it several times throughout the day.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>The authors acknowledge Omikron
