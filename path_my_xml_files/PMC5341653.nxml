Epidural block was obtained with 15 ml of 0.5% ropivacaine (Group I), 15 ml of 0.75% ropivacaine (Group II), and 15 ml of 0.5% bupivacaine (Group III). The onset time, duration, and maximum level of sensory blockade achieved, as well as hemodynamic parameters and any side effects, were noted and treated accordingly.

Ropivacaine is a pure (S)-enantiomer while the latter two are racemic mixtures.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Ropivacaine has similar pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profiles resembling to that of bupivacaine. The onset and duration of sensory block and the overall clinical efficacy of anesthesia have been reported to be comparable to those seen with bupivacaine. However, the degree of motor block may be less with ropivacaine than bupivacaine when used in equal concentrations.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Most importantly, ropivacaine is a pure S (&#x02212;) enantiomer of bupivacaine and thereby less toxic to the cardiovascular and central nervous systems (CNSs).[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>Ropivacaine is easily available in two strengths, i.e., 0.5% and 0.75% for use in epidural anesthesia. Crosby <italic>et al</italic>. showed that 0.5% ropivacaine and 0.5% bupivacaine produced equally effective sensory block for cesarean section with the median duration of sensory block varied between 1.7&#x02013;4.2 h for ropivacaine and 1.8&#x02013;4.4 h for bupivacaine. Among the side effects, 30% patients receiving ropivacaine experienced nausea as compared to 58% of those receiving bupivacaine.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] In another dose finding study, Wolff <italic>et al</italic>. compared epidural ropivacaine (0.5%, 0.75%, and 1%) and 0.5% bupivacaine in patients undergoing hip surgeries and showed that 0.5% ropivacaine and 0.5% bupivacaine were indistinguishable with regard to sensory and motor blocking characteristics while 1% ropivacaine produced a longer duration of analgesia and more intense motor block than 0.5% bupivacaine. However, many patients treated with 1% ropivacaine required treatment for hypotension and bradycardia.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Brown <italic>et al</italic>. compared 0.5% ropivacaine and 0.5% bupivacaine for epidural anesthesia in 45 patients undergoing lower extremity surgery and showed that bupivacaine produced slightly longer duration of motor blockade than ropivacaine but did not find any statistical significant difference in the onset of analgesia or in highest sensory level achieved.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Casati <italic>et al</italic>. evaluated the onset time, duration of epidural anesthesia, and the quality of postoperative analgesia produced by 0.5% levobupivacaine, 0.5% bupivacaine, and 0.5% ropivacaine in 45 patients undergoing total hip replacement surgery in a randomized controlled manner and found the degree of pain relief to be similar in three groups without difference in local anesthetic consumption.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Some studies revealed similar sensory blockade characteristics of ropivacaine and bupivacaine while some revealed lesser duration of analgesia with ropivacaine at equal concentrations.

It has been extensively studied after animal studies indicated that it is less cardiotoxic than equivalent doses of bupivacaine. However, the replacement of widely used bupivacaine with ropivacaine will depend on relative cardiotoxicity and relative anesthetic potency of ropivacaine in humans.</p><p>In our study, the mean onset of sensory block was faster in patients receiving 0.75% ropivacaine as compared to 0.5% bupivacaine and 0.5% ropivacaine. This difference was statistically significant but clinically insignificant. Similar results were shown by Finucane <italic>et al</italic>. in comparison of three doses of ropivacaine (0.5%, 0.75%, and 1%) with 0.5% bupivacaine in patients undergoing hysterectomy.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] However, studies by Wolff <italic>et al</italic>., Brown <italic>et al</italic>., Brockway <italic>et al</italic>., and Chandran <italic>et al</italic>. showed comparable onset of analgesia at all dermatomal levels.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>The duration of sensory blockade (time to two segment regression) was significantly longer with 0.75% ropivacaine than 0.5% ropivacaine and 0.5% bupivacaine which was in accordance with the study by Concepcion <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>Our study indicated that 0.5% ropivacaine produced significantly lesser motor block than 0.75% ropivacaine and 0.5% bupivacaine.

Our result corresponds to other studies by Brown <italic>et al</italic>., Brockway <italic>et al</italic>., and Muldoon <italic>et al</italic>. which proved that bupivacaine produced more motor blockade than ropivacaine at equal concentration.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] But, McGlade <italic>et al</italic>., failed to demonstrate any difference in motor block characteristics of the two drugs.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>This greater degree of differential block with ropivacaine at low concentrations has a clinical advantage in providing analgesia with minimal motor block. This property of ropivacaine holds definitive advantage in situations such as labor analgesia and postoperative pain management where early ambulation is desirable. However, higher concentrations are needed when abdominal muscle relaxation or complete motor blockade of lower limbs is necessary.</p><p>The hemodynamic changes occurring between 10 and 40 min were seen in all the three groups and coincided with the peak effect of epidural anesthesia. There was decrease in blood pressure and heart rate from the baseline in all the three groups after 10&#x02013;15 min.
