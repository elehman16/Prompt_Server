This paper describes the Principles Unite Local Services Assisting Recovery (PULSAR) Specialist Care trial protocol for a recovery-oriented practice training intervention delivered to specialist mental health services staff. The primary aim is to evaluate whether adult consumers accessing services where staff have received the intervention report superior recovery outcomes compared to adult consumers accessing services where staff have not yet received the intervention. A qualitative sub-study aims to examine staff and consumer views on implementing recovery-oriented practice. A process evaluation sub-study aims to articulate important explanatory variables affecting the interventions rollout and outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The mixed methods design incorporates a two-step stepped-wedge cluster randomized controlled trial (cRCT) examining cross-sectional data from three phases, and nested qualitative and process evaluation sub-studies. Participating specialist mental health care services in Melbourne, Victoria are divided into 14 clusters with half randomly allocated to receive the staff training in year one and half in year two. Research participants are consumers aged 18&#x02013;75&#x000a0;years who attended the cluster within a previous three-month period either at baseline, 12 (step 1) or 24&#x000a0;months (step 2). In the two nested sub-studies, participation extends to cluster staff. The primary outcome is the Questionnaire about the Process of Recovery collected from 756 consumers (252 each at baseline, step 1, step 2). Secondary and other outcomes measuring well-being, service satisfaction and health economic impact are collected from a subset of 252 consumers (63 at baseline; 126 at step 1; 63 at step 2) via interviews. Interview-based longitudinal data are also collected 12&#x000a0;months apart from 88 consumers with a psychotic disorder diagnosis (44 at baseline, step 1; 44 at step 1, step 2). cRCT data will be analyzed using multilevel mixed-effects modelling to account for clustering and some repeated measures, supplemented by thematic analysis of qualitative interview data.

This can be seen as a paradigm shift in specialist mental health service delivery, from a focus on ameliorating symptoms to an approach that recognises people&#x02019;s strengths, self-capacity and potential for personal recovery, even in the context of ongoing symptoms or disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The history of the international recovery movement is longstanding and influenced by the consumer movement as well as emerging evidence that challenges more pessimistic assumptions about recovery from severe and persistent mental illness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Note that in this paper we will use the term consumer to refer to a person with a diagnosis of mental illness or who uses mental health services. The impact of this paradigm shift towards recovery can be identified in mental health policy, practice and law in all Australian states and territories, especially in the last 10 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], and is gradually transforming services.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>The development of a recovery orientation in mental health in Victoria</title><p>Since the concept of recovery first emerged from the consumer movement in the 1970s and 1980s, the reorientation of mental health policy and services toward recovery has gained increasing momentum in the Victorian mental health sector [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. At the national level, recovery was first formally endorsed in the 2003&#x02013;2008 Australian National Mental Health Plan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Subsequent developments in the community-managed health sector accelerated the Australian recovery movement over the following decade, including the establishment of early intervention alternatives to inpatient treatment such as the sub-acute Prevention and Recovery Care (PARC) programs. In 2011, the Victorian Government commissioned a framework document supporting the development of evidence-based recovery-oriented mental health services with an emphasis on facilitating personal recovery and dismantling barriers to full participation in community life for people with experiences of mental illness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. This was followed in 2014 by the implementation of a new Mental Health Act in Victoria that established recovery as a fundamental guiding principle in the provision of mental health care. Recovery has thus emerged as a core feature of contemporary reform to mental health service planning and delivery at both the state and national level. Complementing these developments has been an increasing emphasis on the importance of &#x0201c;co-design&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;co-production&#x0201d; to ensure that consumers, families and carers are centrally involved in the design, development and delivery of mental health services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Despite these reforms, the mental health care system still has a long way to go in being responsive to the cultural and linguistic diversity of the Australian population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Little is known about the effectiveness of mental health interventions across people of different cultural and linguistic groups and whether the contemporary emphasis on recovery orientated practice is having the presumed positive impacts on consumers.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>REFOCUS</title><p>The value and efficacy of system-wide transformation to focus on recovery is yet to be empirically established in Australia. In the UK, a staff training intervention (called REFOCUS) promoting personal recovery and enabling organizational change in specialist mental health services has been developed and trialled [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Based on a systematic review and narrative synthesis of existing literature on recovery, the REFOCUS team developed a conceptual framework of personal recovery, which identified five key recovery processes denoted by the acronym &#x0201c;CHIME&#x0201d;: Connectedness, Hope, Identity, Meaning, and Empowerment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. This conceptual framework informed the development of a team-based training intervention for community mental health teams in England that was designed to promote recovery through changes in staff and team skills, knowledge, behaviour, values and relationships with consumers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In a large scale cluster randomized controlled trial (cRCT), the outcomes of usual care plus the REFOCUS intervention were compared with usual care only (control) in 27 community mental health teams delivering services to adult patients with psychotic disorders. The primary outcome, personal recovery as assessed using the Questionnaire about the Process of Recovery (QPR), did not differ between the REFOCUS intervention group and controls, although staff-rated functioning and unmet needs did improve in the intervention group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The authors suggest that implementation was the central challenge, and when high-participating teams were compared with low-participating teams, higher participation was associated with higher staff-reported recovery-promotion behaviour and improved consumer-rated QPR. Challenges in implementing the intervention at the team level included variability in staff participation and adherence to recovery-oriented training procedures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] along with the diluting effects of staff turnover. Participant attrition was higher than anticipated (26% vs 7%) resulting in a reduction in planned statistical power. A further proposed possible reason for the overall lack of difference between the intervention and control group on recovery outcomes is that the 12-month timeframe may have been of insufficient length for the intervention to take effect. On average, patient participants had been using mental health services for more than 15&#x000a0;years, suggesting the possibility of established staff-consumer relationships and entrenched ways of relating to services and problems that may take longer than 1 year to change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>PULSAR</title><p>In the Principles Unite Local Services Assisting Recovery (PULSAR) Specialist Care trial, REFOCUS training materials and the research design have been adapted to enable the testing of the intervention in specialist mental health care services in Australia. The PULSAR staff training intervention aims to train community mental health staff in recovery-oriented practice, so as to embed recovery principles in mental health service delivery in the southern metropolitan region of Victoria, Australia. The PULSAR Specialist Care trial is part of the broader PULSAR research program focused on promoting recovery-oriented practices which also includes the Australian primary care sector [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The study components were co-designed with a consumer academic (VE), and the involvement of PULSAR Lived Experience Advisory Panel (LEAP) created for the project (see <italic>Leadership structure</italic> below) and facilitated by VE. This paper outlines the PULSAR Specialist Care study protocol. The protocol follows the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Objectives</title><p>Using a mixed methods design, the primary objective of the PULSAR Specialist Care study is to evaluate whether adults accessing study cluster specialist mental health services where staff receive the recovery-oriented practice training intervention report superior recovery outcomes compared to adults accessing services where staff have not received the intervention.

</p><p>A cluster randomized design was selected to minimize the threat of contamination between treatment and control groups, as the intervention is administered at the service (cluster) level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], these clusters being specialist mental health care services in Melbourne, Victoria (see Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The stepped-wedge design was implemented for pragmatic and ethical reasons; in addition to allowing the intervention to be staggered across study clusters, the stepped design offers the ethical advantage of enabling all participating clusters to receive an intervention that is predicted to be beneficial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. A mixed method design was utilized for reasons including that the integration of quantitative and qualitative methods provides a richer dataset than can be gained with either approach alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. This in turn allows for a comprehensive and multifaceted evaluation of the project outcomes, as well as further explaining those outcomes and enhancing the project&#x02019;s credibility. The latter is an important consideration in large-scale projects involving multiple stakeholders, as is the case with the PULSAR project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. There are additional benefits to using qualitative and quantitative methods at different stages in the intervention trial; for example, exploratory qualitative techniques were initially used to identify potential obstacles to implementing recovery-oriented practice in service settings and to inform the intervention design, while quantitative methods are used to evaluate the effectiveness of the training intervention. Furthermore, following the intervention trial, qualitative methods are being used to gain a more nuanced understanding of staff experiences of implementing recovery-oriented practices and consumer views of these practices across different settings within Victoria&#x02019;s mental health service system.<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Cluster sites and stratification factors</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Cluster</th><th>Team/service</th><th>Organisation</th><th>Site</th><th>Strata</th><th>Team/service description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Cluster 1</td><td>Crisis assessment &#x00026; treatment team</td><td>Monash Health</td><td>1</td><td>A</td><td rowspan="2">Crisis Assessment and Treatment Teams (CATTs) provide urgent assessment and short-term treatment to people in psychiatric crisis and play a key role in triaging admissions to hospital.</td></tr><tr><td>Cluster 2</td><td>Crisis assessment &#x00026; treatment team</td><td>Monash Health</td><td>2</td><td>A</td></tr><tr><td>Cluster 3</td><td>Mobile support and treatment service<break/>+ Community Care Unit</td><td>Monash Health</td><td>3<break/>4</td><td>B</td><td rowspan="2">Mobile Support and Treatment Teams (MSTs) provide intensive long-term support through assertive outreach to people with prolonged and severe mental illness with associated high levels of disability.<break/>Community Care Units (CCUs) provide medium to long-term residential rehabilitation in a home-like environment.</td></tr><tr><td>Cluster 4</td><td>Mobile support and treatment service<break/>+ Community Care Unit</td><td>Monash Health</td><td>5<break/>6</td><td>B</td></tr><tr><td>Cluster 5</td><td>Community Mental Health Service</td><td>Monash Health</td><td>7</td><td>C</td><td rowspan="2">Community Mental Health Service (CMHS) provide non-urgent assessment, treatment, case management, and continuing care support to people living in the community over varying periods of time.</td></tr><tr><td>Cluster 6</td><td>Community Mental Health Service</td><td>Monash Health</td><td>8</td><td>C</td></tr><tr><td>Cluster 7</td><td>Continuing Care</td><td>Monash Health</td><td>9</td><td>D</td><td rowspan="2">Continuing Care Teams (CCTs) provide non-urgent assessment, treatment, case management, and continuing care support to people living in the community over varying periods of time.</td></tr><tr><td>Cluster 8</td><td>Continuing Care</td><td>Monash Health</td><td>10</td><td>D</td></tr><tr><td>Cluster 9</td><td>PARC &#x02013; Adult<break/>+ PARC &#x02013; Extended</td><td>Mind Australia</td><td>11<break/>12</td><td>E</td><td rowspan="4">PARC services (including youth, adult and extended PARCs) provide short-term residential support and treatment to assist in averting acute inpatient admission or facilitate earlier discharge.</td></tr><tr><td>Cluster 10</td><td>PARC &#x02013; Youth</td><td>Mind Australia</td><td>13</td><td>E</td></tr><tr><td>Cluster 11</td><td>PARC Ermha</td><td>Ermha</td><td>14</td><td>F</td></tr><tr><td>Cluster 12</td><td>PARC Ermha</td><td>Ermha</td><td>15</td><td>F</td></tr><tr><td>Cluster 13</td><td>Community outreach services</td><td>Mind Australia</td><td>16</td><td>G</td><td rowspan="2">Community Outreach Services provide a range of individualized psychosocial support and recovery services.</td></tr><tr><td>Cluster 14</td><td>Community outreach services site 1<break/>Community outreach services site 2</td><td>Ermha</td><td>17<break/>18</td><td>G</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Note.

</p><p>The PULSAR Specialist Care trial will take 4 years to complete, beginning in 2013 and concluding in 2017, see Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. The original study protocol (documented in the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, or ANZCTR) was developed over a period of 18&#x000a0;months in consultation with Chief Investigators (CIs) and an advisory committee comprised of representatives from local specialist and community care organizations, consumers and family/carers, and experts in legal, cultural and educational aspects of mental health service delivery in Victoria. Although minor adaptations have been made to the original protocol, as outlined below, the over-arching two-step stepped-wedge cRCT design remains unchanged and the trial is on target to reach completion within the anticipated 4 year timeframe. All adaptations to the study protocol were considered by, and required the approval of, the appropriate Module Committee governing the relevant aspect of the project (see <italic>Study leadership</italic> section) along with the governing Human Research Ethics Committees.</p><p>The PULSAR training intervention is being delivered to 14 specialist mental health care clusters (see Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>), with clusters randomized to receive the intervention 12&#x000a0;months apart, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.

Staff are ineligible if they are also working in a non-intervention cluster at the time of training (to reduce risk of contamination). Similarly, staff are eligible to participate in the nested qualitative sub-study if currently working at services where the training intervention has been provided; and ineligible if they are either not working at a participating cluster site (even if they have completed the training) or no longer work in a direct service role.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Levels of consumer participation</title><p>In line with the presumption of capacity endorsed by the Victorian <italic>Mental Health Act 2014</italic> and research indicating that participating in research can lead to positive outcomes for people who experience mental health issues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], the project was designed to provide consumer participants with the opportunity to self-select into multiple levels of involvement. Consumers consenting to participation in the cRCT are offered three levels of involvement, see the three streams outlined in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. In the cRCT stream 1, we collect primary outcome recovery-focused data from consumers recruited cross-sectionally via the mail at baseline (T0), end of year 1 (T1) and end of year 2 (T2), see Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. In the cRCT stream 2, we additionally collect secondary and other outcome data assessing mental health and wellbeing, service satisfaction, perceived coercion when accessing services, and health economic impact. This information is collected via face-to-face interviews from participants recruited cross-sectionally at pre or post-intervention. Stream 3 consists of a smaller subset of Stream 2 participants who have a clinical diagnosis of psychosis, e.g., schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or bipolar disorder. Participants in this Stream provide longitudinal data via pre- and post-intervention face-to-face interviews. A pool of research assistants trained in study-specific interview procedures and blinded to intervention status, conduct all Stream 2 and 3 interviews. Consumers who volunteer for the nested qualitative sub-study do not need to participate in the cRCT. Consumer data from the cRCT and qualitative study may be used in the nested process evaluation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Consumer selection criteria</title><p>Consumers are eligible for participation in any study component if they are receiving care from teams in the participating cluster services.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Intervention</title><p>The intervention is a training program delivered to staff teams in participating clusters over two-day workshops (either team or organisational groups) or equivalent hours. The intervention is based on a package of tools promoting recovery-oriented practice in mental health care that were developed by the REFOCUS team [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] and adapted for the Australian public clinical mental health care setting and the MHCSS Sector [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The adaptation of the REFOCUS materials was guided by consultations with: the REFOCUS research team; staff members from participating specialist care organizations in two group sessions based on the Promoting Action of Research Implementation in Health Services (PARIHS) framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]; and LEAP. These consultations aimed to: gauge site readiness for recovery-oriented practice; identify potential facilitators and obstacles to implementing recovery-oriented practice in specialist care settings; examine existing organizational activities or service frameworks that could be modified to support the application of the intervention; determine supervisory strategies that would best facilitate staff uptake of the intervention and ensure the materials were inclusive of consumer issues. The adaptation process was overseen by an advisory committee of representatives from key stakeholder groups to ensure that the content and processes of the PULSAR intervention are sensitive to the Victorian mental health care system as well as the local cultural and legal contexts. Drawing on qualitative analysis of the consultation group transcripts and the advisory committee&#x02019;s expertise, the adaptation process addressed the following issues: &#x02018;How training is delivered&#x02019; (e.g. contextualization of training, training over time, follow-up training and practical tools to keep recovery on the everyday landscape), training content related to REFOCUS elements (e.g. language, listening, common understanding of terms, building on staff strengths) and how staff could access a consumer&#x02019;s choices and preferences differentiating between language and processes, and a concern over the term coaching. Once these adaptations were agreed upon by the advisory committee, the training materials were considered by LEAP and their changes incorporated by the advisory committee.</p><p>The intervention focuses on promoting recovery-based practices to staff that are in addition to standard care, and is comprised of two core components: Recovery-Promoting Relationships and Working Practices.</p><sec id="Sec18"><title>Recovery-promoting relationships</title><p>According to a recovery-oriented framework, the working relationship between staff and consumers is crucial to the process of recovery. The intervention develops and supports this relationship by: assisting teams to develop a shared understanding of personal recovery; exploring existing values held by individual workers and the team; developing skills in coaching; and raising the expectations held by consumers that their values, strengths and goals will be prioritised in their relationships with staff members.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Working practices</title><p>The intervention is centered around three main working practices that form the specific behaviours and recovery supports necessary for building positive, recovery-promoting relationships in mental health care: 1) Understanding values, treatment and support preferences; 2) Assessing and working with strengths; and 3) Supporting goal-striving. Staff are trained to ensure that care planning is based on the consumer&#x02019;s values, preferences, strengths, and personally valued goals.</p><p>The intervention is supported by four implementation strategies: 1) Personal recovery training; 2) Coaching and working practice training; 3) Team manager reflection group; and 4) Team reflection sessions, as well as a set of training materials and compatible working tools. The intervention content and implementation strategies are described in detail in the PULSAR training manual, which is available from the corresponding author upon request.</p><p>After receiving the intervention, staff are invited to take part in monthly hour long PULSAR Active Learning Sessions (PALS) with an experienced PULSAR facilitator to discuss and reflect upon their experiences of delivering recovery-oriented practice in the service setting. The sessions support the practice-based implementation of the intervention through providing an interactive and collaborative learning environment for staff, and ongoing access to PULSAR trainers and training resources.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Intervention modifications</title><p>The delivery of the intervention was modified to account for previously unknown restrictions on the ability of services to release staff for two days of training. In response to these restrictions, the first intervention round for clinical services was developed as a two-day session, with the community services training planned as a separate two-day session in the same week. In addition to the consumer trainer being employed by the project, trainers were sourced from clinical services for the clinical sessions and the community sector for the community sessions. This was anticipated as enabling the inclusion of specialist skills and experience in the delivery of training.</p><p>Training in the second round was planned to be subject to further modifications based on analyses of evaluations of the first round of training by both participants and trainers.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Intervention dosage</title><p>Staff movements are tracked at intervention sites every 3 months from the end of training in order to measure the degree of intervention received or &#x0201c;dosage&#x0201d;. Forms are emailed to site managers every 3 months which requests that site managers list any changes in team members who have or have not undergone the intervention training, including changes to work hours and movements within the organization or externally to other organizations. All employed staff of the services are included as of the end of training census date, whether they were trained with PULSAR or not and whether they were on leave or not. This dosage information will be used in the study analyses.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Control</title><p>The control condition is standard treatment, which is defined as follows:</p><p>Monash Health: routine care as governed by the policies and procedures applicable to Monash Health, and which are consistent with the National Standards for Mental Health Services 2010 &#x00026; Directives as issued from time to time by the Chief Psychiatrist of Victoria and concordant with the Mental Health Act 2014.</p><p>MHCSS: a non-clinical module of care which already has a number of elements concordant with recovery-oriented practice, and which we will be exploring whether can be further improved by the PULSAR intervention.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Measures</title><p>Both quantitative and qualitative data collection occurs in this study, see Tables <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>.

The two sub-scales of INSPIRE are: Supporting personally defined recovery (Support sub-scale; 20 items) and Working relationships (Relationship sub-scale; 7 items). Items in the Support sub-scale are first rated for whether they are important for the consumer&#x02019;s recovery (Yes/No). If rated Yes, the item is additionally rated on either a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (Not at all) to 4 (Very much) or as &#x02018;I do not want support from my worker with this&#x02019;. The Relationship sub-scale is rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (Strongly disagree) to 4 (Strongly agree). The measure is scored by converting the mean of all Likert ratings to a percentage ranging from 0 (low support) to 100 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p><p>The Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale (WEMWBS) is a 14-item scale designed to assess functional and emotional well-being and appraise programs targeted towards the improvement of mental well-being [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The scale is rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (None of the time) to 5 (All of the time), providing a total score ranging from 14 to 70.

This method of identifying potentially eligible participants was developed to ensure consumer confidentiality. The site coordinator was then responsible for overseeing the mailing of survey packs to eligible consumers, which contained a 10-page participant information sheet and consent form (PICF), a 2-page questionnaire comprising the QPR and a simple demographic survey (Stream 1 survey), and two color-coded reply paid envelopes. Participants were instructed to return the signed consent form and questionnaire separately in their respective color-coded reply paid envelopes. This strategy was designed to protect participant confidentiality by ensuring that participant data was returned independently of identifying contact information. A unique matching code was printed on each of the forms to allow subsequent data linkage.</p><p>The original PICF invited participants to consent to one of four levels of involvement in the study and sign and return the form accordingly. Consent levels were as follows:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Level 1 consent refers to a participant consenting to the inclusion of a returned Stream 1 survey into the project.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Level 2 consent refers to a participant providing additional permission for the researchers to access and use relevant routinely collected clinical data.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Level 3 consent refers to a participant being willing to be contacted for a maximum of two project interviews.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Future research consent refers to a participant being willing to be contacted to participate in future research.</p></list-item></list>

The primary mode of recruitment through mail out was modified to a) allow mail outs of letters of invitation to complete and return the Stream 1 survey form to all eligible consumers of the participating services from each cluster site; b) replace the 10-page PICF in the survey pack with a simple one-page consent to be contacted for a face-to-face interview form, thus requiring implied consent only for return of the mailed questionnaire and demographic form; and c) provide a $10 shopping voucher for all returned questionnaires where contact details are provided.</p><p>A range of secondary recruitment strategies to promote consumer response to the mail outs were added and flexibly employed according to the needs of sites. Strategies include, for example, having researchers, including consumer researchers, present at sites to speak about PULSAR; the use of publicity materials such as advertisements, posters or PULSAR-branded materials; and direct contact with clinicians and consumers at participating sites. Considerable care was taken to ensure, as far as reasonably possible, that recruitment strategies were consistent across time points at participating clusters.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec32"><title>Allocation</title><sec id="Sec33"><title>Sequence generation</title><p>Clusters were randomized to receive the intervention at either step 1 or step 2, see Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.

Stream 1 participants can return a completed QPR/demographic survey anonymously in a provided reply-paid envelope addressed to the researchers if they wish. However, they are invited to provide their contact details on a separate one-page &#x0201c;Participant Contact and Consent Form&#x0201d; if they would like to be mailed a $10 shopping voucher. Participants can additionally indicate on the Participant Contact and Consent Form if they are willing to volunteer for other parts of the PULSAR project, such as a face-to-face interview, by signing a &#x0201c;Consent to Future Contact&#x0201d; section.</p><p>In streams 2 and 3 of the cRCT, data are collected in structured face-to-face interviews from a subset of stream 1 consumers who consent to future contact, see Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and earlier section <italic>Levels of consumer participation</italic>. A pool of around 12&#x02013;14 casual research assistants conduct the face-to-face interviews. Prior to conducting interviews, all research assistants attend a compulsory 2 day training workshop facilitated by senior PULSAR researchers. This training is conducted annually prior to commencement of fieldwork each year to train new staff and maintain the skills of continuing research assistants. Training modules include: research interviewing skills; research interviewing from the consumer perspective; risk assessment, including consumer safety, risk management, and distress management; staff safety, including aggression and risk management; communication skills; research ethics; home visit protocols; and blindness. The first two interviews with consumer participants are supervised by a senior PULSAR researcher, and research assistants are provided with verbal and written feedback at the end of each interview.</p><p>Participants who complete a face-to-face interview are required to provide full written informed consent for both the interview and to the researchers accessing routinely collected data using a revised PICF. Study interviews take around 60&#x02013;90&#x000a0;min. At the end of T0 and T1 interviews, participants are asked whether they would be interested in completing a follow-up interview approximately 12&#x000a0;months later (for stream 3). If participants are willing to be contacted regarding the follow-up interview, they are asked to provide their contact details, give an indication of whether they are likely to relocate in the coming year, and provide the contact details of any friend or family member who might be able to pass on letters from the PULSAR project should they no longer be contactable. If participants are not available for a follow-up interview after re-contacting attempts have been made by the researchers, no additional data will be collected. Given that participants are the recipients of the intervention through services provided by trained specialist mental health care staff, no protocol for discontinued consumer participants is necessary.</p><p>All data are recorded on paper forms which are securely stored at the PULSAR administrative site. Procedures to ensure accuracy of data extraction include double entry from selected hard copy forms, range checks and examination of outliers.</p><p>For participants who provide Level 2 consent initially, then later all participants who complete a face-to-face interview, routinely collected medical data is extracted from organization-specific medical records, see Table <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>. All identifiers are removed from the service record data and replaced with a code, enabling re-identification for the purpose of linkage with the participant&#x02019;s interview data.</p><p>The privacy of all participants is safeguarded in accordance with the National Statement on Ethical Conduct in Human Research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. All data is stored on password protected computer systems located within the secure PULSAR administration site. The study data will be stored for a minimum of 7 years, after which time it may be destroyed. Re-identification codes are only accessible to the core research team responsible for data management. It is possible that participant data may be used in a non-identifiable format in future research.</p></sec><sec id="Sec37"><title>Qualitative sub-study data collection</title><p>The nested qualitative sub-study investigates mental health staff experiences of implementing recovery-oriented practices following the PULSAR intervention and the challenges involved within Australian mental health settings; it also seeks to explore consumer views of how their recovery has been supported in services where this staff training intervention has taken place. Two semi-structured interview guides for use in staff interviews and consumer interviews were developed, informed by literature on recovery-oriented practice, consumer and service provider expertise within the PULSAR Qualitative Research Steering Group and consultations with PULSAR&#x02019;s LEAP. These interview guides are used to conduct face-to-face or telephone interviews with mental health staff three to 4 months following the PULSAR training, and with consumers five to 6 months following the PULSAR training. Staff interviews occur prior to consumer interviews on the basis that staff are likely to be aware of their own efforts to implement changes to practice before these become as evident to consumers. Interviews with staff initially explore their understanding of recovery-oriented practice and experiences and challenges encountered in implementing a recovery-oriented framework at a service level. Subsequent interviews will invite participating staff to reflect on the de-identified interview themes, and on facilitators and barriers to implementing recovery-oriented practice in their service settings in an interview or focus group discussion. Similarly, initial face-to-face or telephone consumer interviews focus on their views and experiences of recovery-oriented practice in services where mental health staff have received training, with subsequent interviews inviting consumers to reflect on the de-identified interview themes and on supports for their recovery within and beyond services.</p><p>Sample size for the qualitative sub-study is determined sequentially by qualitative sampling processes to ensure diverse perspectives are sought, and to maximize the richness of data obtained, for which we anticipate at least 20&#x02013;24 staff participants and 20&#x02013;24 consumer participants will be recruited and interviewed from across the specialist mental health care sites. Recruitment strategies rely on staff and consumers opting into the study based on a convenience sampling approach, informed by the current profile of consumers and staff at participating sites. Efforts are made through the use of varied recruitment strategies including flyers and onsite visits by the researchers to ensure that a diverse range of participants are represented in the evaluation. Following the PULSAR intervention in year 2, the selection of sites, specialist mental health staff and consumers to participate in the qualitative sub-study will be guided by the extent and depth of data gathered in the first year (e.g., whether some service types are under-represented; whether consumers on Community Treatment Orders or staff working with these service users have been recruited).</p><p>All qualitative data are audio-recorded (subject to participant consent) or documented in handwritten notes, then transcribed for coding and analysis. Coding will employ both inductive reasoning and an explicit theoretical lens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Thus, qualitative data will be coded and analysed, using a constant comparative method, to identify thematic similarities and differences in participants&#x02019; views within and across participant groups. Further, given the PULSAR intervention is informed by CHIME and the REFOCUS recovery-promoting practices (14,29), this theoretical framework will also be used for coding so as to identify how these concepts and practices are spoken about and understood by participants. All transcribed data are de-identified and along with all other PULSAR data are stored in password-protected files within the restricted access electronic files of the PULSAR site.</p><sec id="Sec38"><title>Process evaluation data collection</title><p>Given that the recovery-oriented practice involves facilitating a process of change, a process evaluation is crucial to offer explanatory variables that may influence the outcome measures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. The nested process evaluation will use quantitative and qualitative data to identify contextual and organisational factors that influence the effectiveness of the intervention.</p><p>The process evaluation will provide additional data relating to clusters, drawing on the PARIHS framework dimensions of evidence, context and facilitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. These data can be examined further in regression and other analyses to estimate the extent to which dimensions of readiness for, exposure to, and engagement in the PULSAR program are associated with differentials in outcome measures. The process evaluation study design adopts the recommendations of Moore et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>] and acts on the advice of Bhanbhro and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>] in ensuring our approach is informed by theory and evidence. The interventions in PULSAR seek to change services&#x02019; orientation to recovery-oriented practice through influencing the behaviour of clinical staff and adapting the systems in which they work. As Chen and Rossi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] suggest, we use a theory-driven evaluation approach which is not dependent on a single outcome measure to confirm or refute the effectiveness of the intervention.</p><p>Following the guidelines provided by Moore et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>], the process evaluation will focus on collecting data that has the potential to surface explanatory variables in the complex path between intervention and outcomes. The theoretically grounded research questions include:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>What is the role of contextual factors (leadership/support for innovation/readiness for change/organisational support for change/commitment to change and perceived supervisor support for recovery orientation practice) on the adoption of the training and patient outcomes?</p></list-item><list-item><p>How does dosage (number of people trained and still working at the facility/number of people attending PALS and still practicing) affect attitude to and uptake of recovery-oriented practice?</p></list-item><list-item><p>What is the role of clinical context (Primary or Secondary Care/Community or Acute) on attitudes to and adoption of the intervention and client outcomes?</p></list-item><list-item><p>What is the relationship between pre-existing engagement in recovery-oriented practice, on attitudes to training, evaluation of training and transfer of training?</p></list-item></list>

Baseline (T0) data collection occurs in the year prior to and 3 months after the step 1 intervention is delivered. The first 3 months after intervention delivery is a period still considered relevant for baseline data collection based on the Kirkpatrick training evaluation model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>] which considers that the embedding of practice change requires a minimum of 9&#x000a0;months after intervention is delivered, including 3&#x000a0;months for consolidation and 6&#x000a0;months for implementation. In the next period called step 1, (T1), data collection occurs during the following 12&#x000a0;months. Then in the next period called step 2, (T2), data collection occurs during the following 12&#x000a0;months. During both T1 and T2 periods, data collection at individual clusters occurs at a minimum of 9&#x000a0;months after the intervention was delivered to ensure embedding of intervention practices and principles, see Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.</p><p>Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize the characteristics of the clusters at baseline and consumer-level variables at time of data collection (see Table <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>).

For each primary and secondary outcome component with missing data, multiple imputation using multivariate regression with factors of age, gender, time, and intervention status will produce 100 estimates. Sensitivity analyses will be performed using this multiple imputation to account for missing data and then re-running the analyses. Sensitivity analyses will also include the intervention dosage variable described earlier.</p></sec><sec id="Sec42"><title>Economic evaluation</title><p>Overall, costs associated with each participant will follow well established health economic principles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>], and cover direct medical costs of illness, plus the labour market effects of illness. Direct medical costs are to be calculated for prescription and other medically recommended non-prescription medications, and hospital and health service contacts. Labour market productivity losses will be imputed using the human capital approach by multiplying reported days off work due to mental illness with an individual&#x02019;s estimated salary using instrumentation devised by this team for a previous health economic evaluation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Using only days off work due to illness to capture labour market costs captures an important aspect of the cost of illness; however, it is noted that the estimates obtained will be conservative and the true cost will be higher than what we obtain because of other effects of illness such as higher rates of non-participation in employment, or underemployment.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec43"><title>Leadership structure</title><p>The PULSAR project adopts a module based advisory structure, overseen by a project steering group chaired by Principal Investigator (PI), Professor Graham Meadows. Four modules guide and monitor the implementation and evaluation of the project which are chaired by different members of the senior research team. The modules include Adaptation, Implementation, Research and Dissemination.</p><p>Based on the REFOCUS project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>], and consistent with the commitment to co-design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], PULSAR is also supported by LEAP, an advisory group comprising people with either lived experience of mental illness or with experience of caring for someone with mental illness. LEAP was established at the commencement of the PULSAR project and continues to meet during the trial. It provides consumer and family/carer perspectives on the project and ongoing feedback and advice on the trial.</p></sec><sec id="Sec44"><title>Specification of safety parameters</title><p>No plans were made for a premature stopping of the trial. Apart from any possible breaches to consumer confidentiality, which are classified as moderate risk, all risks to the safety of consumer and specialist staff are classified as minimal.</p></sec><sec id="Sec45"><title>Safety oversight</title><p>Comprehensive project protocols have been developed to address staff safety, the management of participant distress, suicidal ideation or intent, threat to harm others, and disclosure of previously undisclosed criminal acts. These protocols are readily accessible to all PULSAR research and administrative staff and are reviewed and updated on a continuing basis throughout the trial.</p></sec><sec id="Sec46"><title>Dissemination policy</title><sec id="Sec47"><title>Overview</title><p>PULSAR takes a multi-tiered approach to dissemination to maximize the translation of knowledge into practice. Dissemination avenues will include: publication of a training manual and associated resources; development of online resources to disseminate project materials to interested parties locally and abroad; publication of project protocols and findings from each component of the project in peer-reviewed literature; production of a regular newsletter updating stakeholders on project progress and outcomes; presentations and national and international conferences; local distribution through partner organizations in the community mental health sector in Victoria; and direct communication of project outcomes to key policy makers.</p></sec><sec id="Sec48"><title>Rights</title><p>In relation to copyright issues in dissemination of findings, PI Meadows and CI Slade have agreed to highly accessible publication to maximize dissemination. Specifically, there is no plan to commercialize outputs of this work and so put barriers in the way of use by others. It has been the practice of the multiple research teams involved in the PULSAR proposal to actively seek to make materials widely available as far as possible without cost, and to place barriers in the way of others commercializing such work. For example, the London REFOCUS team have disseminated the REFOCUS intervention in free-to-access booklets and through open access journal articles. The dissemination plan will make the findings widely and readily available along with source training materials.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec49"><title>Discussion</title><p>The PULSAR Specialist Care trial will examine the efficacy of a recovery-oriented practice training intervention for specialist mental health care staff using a two-step stepped-wedge cRCT design. This design is often favoured for such community-based pragmatic trials, as the intervention will eventually be delivered to all participating clusters but can be implemented in stages to manage the practical constraints associated with delivering a large-scale intervention across multiple sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The challenges encountered in the trial are providing valuable insights on how to facilitate staff adherence to the training and hence the embedding of the intervention into participating services, as well as effective methods for engaging and retaining the participation of consumers. A significant contribution of the work will be the production and dissemination of a package of professional training resources to support the implementation of recovery-oriented practice into community-based mental health services. Although the PULSAR materials have been developed according to the needs of the Australian mental health system and the local social, legal and cultural contexts, we anticipate that these resources will be adaptable to other settings and jurisdictions. In line with the approach taken by our UK partner, the PULSAR materials will be made widely and readily available.</p><p>With the current emphasis in mental health policy on refocusing services towards recovery, the results of this trial, including an assessment of clinical, organizational and health economic outcomes, will contribute to the small but growing evidence-base promoting the development of recovery-oriented service frameworks. If successful, it will be the most definitive trial to date in Australia demonstrating that the concept of recovery, and interventions designed to foster recovery-oriented staff behaviour and relationships with consumers, can be operationalized and comprehensively evaluated. Findings, and other information gathered and lessons learned during the trial, will support the continued transformation of the mental health sector towards recovery, ultimately leading to improved outcomes for people with serious mental illness.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ANZCTR</term><def><p>Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CATT</term><def><p>Crisis assessment and treatment team</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CCT</term><def><p>Continuing care team</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CCU</term><def><p>Community care unit</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CI</term><def><p>Chief investigator</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>cRCT</term><def><p>Cluster randomized control trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CSQ</term><def><p>Client satisfaction questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GAF</term><def><p>Global assessment of functioning scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HoNoS</term><def><p>Health of the nation outcome scales</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HREC</term><def><p>Human Research Ethics Committee</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICC</term><def><p>Intraclass correlation coefficient</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LEAP</term><def><p>Lived experience advisory panel</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MASS</term><def><p>Mind Australia Satisfaction Survey</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MHCSS</term><def><p>Mental health community support services</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MST</term><def><p>Mobile support and treatment team</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PALS</term><def><p>PULSAR active learning sessions</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PARC</term><def><p>Prevention and recovery in community</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PARIHS</term><def><p>Promoting action of research implementation in health services</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PI</term><def><p>Principal investigator</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PICF</term><def><p>Participant information and consent form</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PNCQ</term><def><p>Perceived need for care questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PULSAR</term><def><p>Principles unite local services assisting recovery</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>QPR</term><def><p>Questionnaire about the process of recovery</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SOFAS</term><def><p>Social and occupational functioning assessment scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SPIRIT</term><def><p>Standard protocol items: recommendations for interventional trials</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WEMWBS</term><def><p>Warwick-Edinburgh mental well-being scale</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We acknowledge Mr. Umit Agis, A/Prof Jakqui Barnfield, Dr. Joanne Brooker, Ms. Kimberly Buck, Prof David Clarke, Dr. Margaret Grigg, A/Prof Iraklis Harry Minas, A/Prof Brendan Murphy, Dr. Mehmet &#x000d6;zmen and Ms. Christine Thornton.

Participants who are also willing to be contacted for a face-to-face interview (Streams 2 and 3 of the cRCT) indicate their consent by signing a consent to be contacted form and providing their contact details on the same form. Participants who complete a face-to-face interview are required to provide full written informed consent for both the interview and to the researchers accessing routinely collected data using a revised PICF. The project acknowledges that consenting to participate in research is an ongoing process. Project protocols ensure that participants in Streams 2 and 3 are provided with an overview of what their participation involves on each occasion, and are provided with the opportunity to reconfirm their consent at the time of interview/s.</p><p>In the nested qualitative sub-study, a participant information sheet is provided to interested potential participants and informed written consent is obtained from all consumer participants prior to interview. If, at any time over the duration of the project, a participant wishes to no longer participate and/or is deemed by the interviewer to no longer fully understand participation requirements, the research will cease.</p><p>Specialist mental health care staff consent to participate</p><p>Cluster staff who participate in the qualitative sub-study are provided with a participant information sheet and required to provide written informed consent prior to interview and/or focus group.</p><p>Discontinuing participants</p><p>All participants are advised on the consent form/s and by research assistants during face-to-face interviews that they can withdraw from the study at any time.
