Clinical research has shown that blockade of the 5-HT<sub>2</sub> receptor nulls memory impairment during MDMA intoxication. Interestingly, studies have demonstrated that the eCB and the 5-HT system interact. It was hypothesized that MDMA would cause an increase in eCB concentrations together with a decrease in memory performance, and that combining MDMA with a 5-HT<sub>2</sub> receptor blocker ketanserin would lead to a counteraction of the MDMA effects on eCB concentrations and memory.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Twenty healthy recreational polydrug users entered a double-blind placebo-controlled within-subject study. Participants received a pre-treatment (ketanserin 40&#x000a0;mg, placebo) followed 30&#x000a0;min later by a treatment (MDMA 75&#x000a0;mg, placebo). Verbal memory was tested by means of a 30-word learning test. Endocannabinoid concentrations (anandamide (2-AG); <italic>N</italic>-arachidonylethanolamine (AEA)) were assessed in blood at baseline, before (90&#x000a0;min post-treatment) and after cognitive tests (150&#x000a0;min post-treatment).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Findings showed that MDMA impaired memory 90&#x000a0;min post-treatment in the word learning task. This effect was a replication of previous studies using the same dose of MDMA (75&#x000a0;mg) and the same learning paradigm. Contrary to our hypothesis, MDMA did not affect eCB concentrations, nor did ketanserin block MDMA-induced memory impairment. Ketanserin caused an increase in AEA concentrations, 180&#x000a0;min after administration.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Current findings suggest that peripherally measured endocannabinoids are not associated with the verbal memory deficit during MDMA intoxication.

The neurobiological mechanism underlying this impairment has been studied and it was suggested that the MDMA-induced elevation in plasma cortisol concentrations was not related to the observed deficit (Kuypers et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2013</xref>). van Wel and colleagues demonstrated that blockade of the serotonin-2A (5-HT<sub>2A</sub>) receptor, by means of a single dose of ketanserin, prevented the memory impairment after a single dose of MDMA (van Wel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2011</xref>). The detailed neurobiological mechanism behind the MDMA-induced memory deficit has yet to be elucidated.</p><p id="Par3">There is evidence suggesting that the serotonergic neurotransmission system is modulated by the endocannabinoid (eCB) system. Specifically, the CB<sub>1</sub> receptor modulates the excitability of dorsal raphe serotonin neurons (Haj-Dahmane and Shen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2011</xref>), and more relevant in the context of the findings by van Wel et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2011</xref>), 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor activation stimulates the formation and release of 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), an endocannabinoid (Parrish and Nichols <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2006</xref>). The best characterized eCBs are 2-AG and AEA (<italic>N</italic>-arachidonylethanolamine, anandamide), and both of these lipids exert agonist activity at CB<sub>1</sub> and CB<sub>2</sub> receptors. They are synthetized on an &#x0201c;on-demand&#x0201d; basis and crucial in certain forms of neuronal plasticity (Curran et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2016</xref>). Since MDMA acts on the 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor (Erritzoe et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2011</xref>; van Wel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2011</xref>), it can be hypothesized that this also has implications for endocannabinoid concentrations.</p><p id="Par4">Converging data suggest that MDMA and (exogenous and endogenous) cannabinoids interact pharmacologically (Valverde and Rodriguez-Arias <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2013</xref>). Both MDMA-induced conditioned place preference and self-administration in rats are under endogenous tonic control by the endocannabinoid system (Braida et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2005</xref>; Braida and Sala <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2002</xref>). Low doses of THC have been demonstrated to modulate MDMA-induced behavioral effects, decreasing conditioned place preference (Robledo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2007</xref>). In line with this, combined THC-MDMA administration led to synergistic effects on working memory in rats; MDMA in low-to-high doses led to an exacerbation of the THC-induced memory impairment (Young et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2005</xref>). Interestingly, MDMA-induced memory impairment in rats could be blocked with a CB<sub>1</sub> receptor antagonist (Nawata et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2010</xref>).</p><p id="Par5">Together, these data suggest involvement of the endocannabinoid system in MDMA-induced memory impairment. The present study was therefore set up to study the association between endocannabinoid concentrations and verbal memory performance during MDMA intoxication. It was hypothesized that MDMA would cause an increase in eCB concentrations together with a decrease in verbal memory performance. In addition, given the role of the 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor in memory, and its interaction with the eCB system, it was hypothesized that pretreatment with ketanserin, a 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor blocker, would counteract the effects of MDMA on endocannabinoid release and memory.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participants</title><p id="Par6">Participants were 20 healthy polydrug MDMA users (mean (SD) age&#x02009;=&#x02009;21.2 (2.6); 8 females), who previously used ecstasy/MDMA (16.8 (23.2) times) and other recreational drugs (e.g., cocaine, amphetamine, and cannabis). The mean (SD) verbal IQ was 103.9 (4.9) as determined by the National Adult Reading Test on the training session, preceding the test sessions (Bright et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2002</xref>).</p><p id="Par7">Participants were recruited through advertisements in university buildings, via a website (digi-prik.nl), and by word of mouth.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Design and treatments</title><p id="Par8">The study was conducted according to a two-by-two double-blind, placebo-controlled within-subject design with pre-treatment (ketanserin 40&#x000a0;mg or placebo) preceding the treatment (MDMA 75&#x000a0;mg or placebo) by 30&#x000a0;min (Brogden and Sorkin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">1990</xref>; Sharpley et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">1994</xref>).

In addition, participants were familiarized with the procedures, tests, and questionnaires on a training day, preceding actual test days. On the training day, participants were shown the questionnaires so that they knew what they looked like, and they had to run through all tests so that they understood what was expected. The order of the questionnaires and tests was kept the same as on an actual test day. No learning effects were expected on the tests that were used though parallel versions of the word learning test were used so that each test day participants had to learn a new list and no interference was possible.</p><p id="Par12">Participants were requested to abstain from any drug use 1&#x000a0;week before the medical examination until the last test day.

This procedure was repeated three times; immediate scores were summed to comprise the &#x0201c;total immediate recall&#x0201d; score. After a 30-min delay, participants were asked to recall (&#x0201c;delayed recall&#x0201d;) as many of the previously learnt words as possible. Hereafter, participants were given a delayed recognition task containing 30 new words and all the words of the previously shown list.

Based on previous research, it was hypothesized that MDMA would cause an increase in eCB concentrations together with a decrease in memory performance. In addition, it was hypothesized that the combination of MDMA and a 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor blocker, ketanserin, would counteract this endocannabinoid release and the memory deficit. Findings showed that MDMA caused memory impairment in the verbal word learning task. This effect was a replication of previous studies using the same dose of MDMA (75&#x000a0;mg) and the same learning paradigm (Kuypers et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2016</xref>; Kuypers and Ramaekers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2005</xref>). Contrary to our hypothesis, MDMA did not affect eCB concentrations nor did ketanserin block the MDMA-induced memory impairment. Ketanserin caused an increase in AEA concentrations, 180&#x000a0;min after administration.</p><p id="Par31">While preclinical studies have shown an elevation in eCB concentrations (Braida et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2005</xref>; Braida and Sala <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2002</xref>), the present study did not demonstrate a significant increase in plasma eCB concentrations in healthy recreational drug users after a single dose of MDMA. This absence of MDMA effects on eCB concentrations could potentially be attributed to the difference in dosing and dosing schemes with &#x0201c;extreme&#x0201d; dose and dosing schemes in preclinical research exceeding &#x0201c;normal&#x0201d; dose ranges in humans (Easton and Marsden <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2006</xref>; Green et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2012</xref>). In the study of Nawata and colleagues for example, endocannabinoid concentrations were elevated in mice after treatment with MDMA for seven subsequent days. The resulting memory impairment was reversed by a CB<sub>1</sub> antagonist (Nawata et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2010</xref>). The MDMA-induced memory impairment which has consistently been demonstrated in human placebo-controlled studies seems to be unrelated to the endocannabinoid system.</p><p id="Par32">The fact that endocannabinoid concentrations in the present study were assessed at the peripheral level, in blood plasma, could be another potential explanation for the absence of MDMA effects on eCB concentrations. It is possible that peripheral eCB concentrations might not reflect central concentrations accurately and preclinical work has previously shown that AG and AEA concentrations measured at the peripheral (plasma) and central level (cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)) did not correlate significantly (Jumpertz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2011</xref>). While assessing biological parameters at the central level by drawing CSF is invasive, it is very relevant to conduct these measures and to compare central and peripheral markers in a placebo-controlled MDMA study prior to conducting behavioral studies. This information could fine-tune and optimize the timing and scheduling of tests.</p><p id="Par33">While an MDMA effect on eCB concentrations was absent, data of the 2-AG and AEA concentrations, measured at three different time points, suggested time-related differences in concentrations. This motivated an extra statistical analysis including the three time points (9:00&#x000a0;am, 11:30&#x000a0;am, and 12:30&#x000a0;pm). It was shown that 2-AG concentrations increased during the test day and relative to baseline, and that AEA concentrations decreased. Interestingly, preclinical work has shown that endocannabinoids have a diurnal release pattern which is opposite to 2-AG and AEA, with higher AEA concentrations in a selection of brain areas (nucleus accumbens, prefrontal cortex, striatum, and hippocampus) in the dark or &#x0201c;active&#x0201d; phase and high concentrations for 2-AG during the light or &#x0201c;resting&#x0201d; phase (Valenti et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2004</xref>). Although this pattern in rats is opposite to our findings, the fact that eCBs have a diurnal rhythm is interesting. Human research has also shown that eCBs have a specific rhythm and our data are in line with this, with continuously increasing 2-AG concentrations across the morning, peaking in the early- to mid-afternoon, and decreasing AEA concentrations during the day (Hanlon et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2015</xref>; Vaughn et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2010</xref>).</p><p id="Par34">Preclinical studies have in addition also shown that eCB concentrations do not only fluctuate over time but display different release patterns in different brain locations, showing for example higher AEA concentrations during resting phases in CSF and hypothalamus, while these concentrations are low in other brain structures like the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex, both known to play a role in memory (Murillo-Rodriguez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2006</xref>). In addition, preclinical research has demonstrated that AEA plays a central role in memory consolidation, while 2-AG does not (Busquets-Garcia et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2011</xref>). The relation between AEA concentrations and CB<sub>1</sub> receptor density is out of phase and dependent on time of day. In the resting phase, a high CB<sub>1</sub> receptor density together with low AEA concentrations is found in the hippocampus while this pattern is reversed when the animals are awake and active (Vaughn et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2010</xref>). Together, these results suggest that it is relevant to test memory during the morning, when AEA concentrations are high in humans, in addition to other times of the day, when AEA concentrations are lower, and assess the expression of the CB<sub>1</sub> receptor, in a placebo-controlled MDMA study in order to know whether diurnal variations in AEA and CB<sub>1</sub> receptor influence or change the MDMA-induced memory deficit.</p><p id="Par35">Research into the role of eCBs in the MDMA-induced memory deficit in humans is limited by the absence of approved CB<sub>1</sub> antagonists. Rimonabant, a CB<sub>1</sub> receptor antagonist/inverse agonist, which was approved for weight control, was withdrawn from the market, in addition to a suspension of its development, after some adverse clinical psychiatric side effects (Janero and Makriyannis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2009</xref>). Another approach to this problem is to administer THC, a partial CB<sub>1</sub> and CB<sub>2</sub> agonist, or a fatty acid amide hydroxylase (FAAH) inhibitor, an enzyme involved in the catabolism of AEA, and MDMA in combination, since both combinations suggestible lead to an increase in endocannabinoid concentrations (Gobbi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2005</xref>; Pertwee <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">1997</xref>). In animal research, a synergistic disruptive effect of the THC-MDMA combination was shown on memory (Young et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2005</xref>). One human study combining THC with MDMA did not show a change in the drug-induced memory effect of the single drugs on an N-back task (working memory). Interestingly, the subjective effects (e.g., drug strength, feeling high) did increase after the combined administration (Dumont et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2011</xref>). Interestingly, animal research has shown that order is important in these effects. While dopamine concentrations decreased when MDMA was given prior to THC, this change was not present when THC was given before MDMA (Robledo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2007</xref>). In the study of Dumont et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2011</xref>), the first dose of THC (4&#x000a0;mg) was given concurrently with MDMA (100&#x000a0;mg), while the two subsequent doses of each 6&#x000a0;mg followed MDMA administration by 90 and 180&#x000a0;min. Future research could compare the effects of pre- and post-dosing MDMA-treated participants with THC to explore the order effects of the different treatments and reveal whether the effect on eCB concentrations relates to substance-induced memory impairment.</p><p id="Par36">Although ketanserin exerted effects on the behavioral and biological level in the present study, inducing a response speed reduction in the word recognition task and causing an increase in AEA concentrations, it did not counteract the MDMA-induced memory impairment (immediate recall) which is in contrast to a previous study conducted by our group (van Wel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2011</xref>). Findings of a previous study using the same dose (40&#x000a0;mg) of ketanserin suggest that this dose is sufficient to block the 5-HT<sub>2</sub> receptor and potential subjective and/or behavioral effects caused by a serotonergic substance (Vollenweider et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">1998</xref>). However, van Wel et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2011</xref>) used a 50-mg dose and showed a blockade of the MDMA-induced memory impairment. This 22% difference in dose resulted in ketanserin plasma concentrations that were 1.5 times lower than in the previous study. Scrutinizing behavioral data of both studies, it became apparent that memory performance during placebo (&#x0201c;baseline&#x0201d;) was comparable though the MDMA-induced impairment, relative to placebo, was larger in the study of van Wel et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2011</xref>). Performance in the latter study decreased with 29% compared to a 16% decrease in the present study. This apparent smaller decrease in memory performance after MDMA administration in the present study could potentially be attributed to the MDMA concentrations that were 20% lower. Previously, it was shown that MDMA-induced memory failures correlated positively with MDMA blood concentrations (Ramaekers et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2009</xref>). When MDMA was combined with ketanserin, the MDMA-induced decrease in memory performance was reduced with 15% while this was only 8% in the present study. This smaller &#x0201c;gain&#x0201d; in memory performance could then perhaps be attributed to the lower availability of ketanserin and hence a potentially smaller blockade of the 5-HT<sub>2</sub> receptors. While behavioral and biological data showed some effects of ketanserin, proving that it had effects on the central level, these low concentrations in blood were possibly not strong enough to counteract the MDMA-induced memory impairment.</p><p id="Par37">To conclude, current findings suggest that peripheral endocannabinoids are not related to verbal memory impairment during MDMA intoxication.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank Cees van Leeuwen for the medical supervision and Tina Verstappen and Sido van Berlo for collecting the data.</p></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contribution</title><p>KK, JR, MF, and RdlT conceptualized the study; KK collected data; EH, AP, EO, NP, and KK analyzed the data; and EH, MF, RdlT, JR, and KK wrote the article.</p></notes><notes notes-type="COI-statement"><title>Compliance with ethical standards</title><p>The study was performed in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, and its subsequent amendments, and was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the Academic Hospital of Maastricht and the University of Maastricht.
