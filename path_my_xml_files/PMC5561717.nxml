These modalities of treatment are time-consuming and may be associated with scarring in multiple warts. Immunotherapy is emerging as a new modality of treatment which acts on enhancing cell-mediated immunity against human papillomavirus for clearance of both treated and distant warts.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Aims:</title><p>This study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intralesional Vitamin D3 for the treatment of cutaneous warts.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>Patients with multiple warts were selected for immunotherapy. Vitamin D3 (0.2 ml, 15 mg/ml) was injected to the base of warts after injecting with lignocaine (0.2 ml, 20 mg/ml). The injections were repeated 2 weeks apart for a maximum of 4 sessions or until complete clearance, whichever was earlier. A maximum of 2 warts were treated per session and patients were followed up for 6 months after the last injection.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Results:</title><p>Forty-two patients with multiple warts were recruited for the study who completed the 6-month follow-up period and were available for analysis. Of these, 23 had palmoplantar warts, 18 had verruca vulgaris and 1 patient had filiform wart. In total, 33 of 42 patients (78.57%) showed complete response, 6 patients (14.28%) showed moderate response and three patients (7.14%) showed mild response. Recurrence was observed in one patient with the palmoplantar wart. No serious adverse effects were reported.</p></sec><sec id="st5"><title>Limitations:</title><p>Lack of control group was the main drawback in our study.</p></sec><sec id="st6"><title>Conclusion:</title><p>Intralesional Vitamin D3 is safe and effective for treatment of multiple cutaneous warts.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Cutaneous warts</kwd><kwd>intralesional treatment</kwd><kwd>Vitamin D3</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>I<sc>NTRODUCTION</sc></title><p>Warts or verrucae are benign epidermal proliferations of the skin and mucosa caused by human papillomavirus (HPV). Although spontaneous resolution occurs within 2 years in 65%&#x02013;78% of warts, most patients seek treatment of warts as they are cosmetically disfiguring and sometimes painful, especially on the soles.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Local destruction of warts is a commonly employed treatment modality performed by using either topical keratolytics, electrocoagulation, cryotherapy or laser therapy.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] All these modalities of treatment can be painful and may be associated with scarring and frequent recurrences. In addition, destructive modalities are not suitable for the treatment of multiple and refractory warts as they clear only treated lesions and not the distant ones. Hence, to overcome these shortcomings, immunotherapy is being tried widely for the treatment of warts over the last few years. It acts on the basic principle of enhancing the cell-mediated immunity for the clearance of warts.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Various antigens have been tried including measles, mumps, rubella (MMR); tuberculin purified protein derivative (PPD); <italic>Mycobacterium</italic> w vaccine and <italic>Candida</italic> antigen.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>Few studies have been published showing the efficacy of topical Vitamin D3 derivatives in the treatment of warts.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] However, intralesional Vitamin D3 injection was tried first time by Aktas <italic>et al</italic>. for the treatment of plantar warts and reported encouraging results.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Herein, we report the treatment response of intralesional Vitamin D3 injections for the treatment of cutaneous warts.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ATERIALS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>The study was conducted from August 2015 to November 2016 in the Department of Dermatology and Venereology of our institute.

Baseline evaluation was made at the first visit, and the demographic data were recorded in a structured questionnaire designed for this study. A graphical wart map was prepared for each patient; location, number, size and type of wart were recorded on it at each visit. Photographs were taken at each visit to support the recorded data.</p><p>Clinical response was documented by recording the decrease in number and size of warty lesions at each visit i.e., at 2 weekly intervals for 4 sessions and 6 months after the last injection. Complete clearance was considered if all the warts both treated and distant warts resolved completely. Moderate response if there were 50 to &#x0003c;100% reductions in both size and number of lesions, mild response was considered if response was between 1% and &#x0003c;50%.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>Larger warts were considered for the injection. A maximum of 2 warts were treated at each session.</p><p>The injections were repeated at 2 weekly intervals for a maximum of four injections.

These destructive procedures are usually associated with scarring and pigmentation. In addition, some warts are resistant to these treatments and recurrence rate is also high. Hence, immunotherapy is the best available option in treating warts as it boosts the immune system to HPV virus leading to clearance of both treated and untreated warts. Recurrence rate is also low when compared to destructive methods.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Immunotherapy has been tried with various antigens and vaccines such as bleomycin, PPD, MMR, <italic>Candida albicans</italic> and <italic>Mycobacterium</italic> w vaccine.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] In this present study, we used intralesional Vitamin D3 which was a relatively new treatment option for warts. Several studies have been published showing the efficacy of topical Vitamin D for the treatment of warts. Refractory wart in a 41-year-old renal transplant patient was treated successfully with calcitriol solution by Moscarelli <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Rind <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] reported complete clearance of anogenital wart in an infant by calcipotriene ointment. In both case reports, the effect of Vitamin D3 derivatives on warts was speculated to be derived from its potential to regulate epidermal cell proliferation and differentiation and to modulate cytokine production. Recently, it was observed that there is toll-like receptor activation of human macrophages which upregulated the expression of Vitamin D receptor (VDR) and Vitamin D-1-hydroxylase genes, leading to induction of the antimicrobial peptide.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>Aktas <italic>et al</italic>. used intralesional Vitamin D3 for plantar warts. Twenty patients were included in the study, and 7.5 mg of Vitamin D3 injection was given at monthly intervals for a maximum of 2 sessions. They reported complete clearance in 80% of patients at the end of 8 weeks.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] The results were similar with our study as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>.</p><table-wrap id="T3" position="float"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Comparison with select study with intralesional Vitamin D3</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JCAS-10-90-g009"/></table-wrap><p>The exact mechanism of action of Vitamin D in the clearance of warts is not known. Experimental evidence suggests that it has immunomodulatory effects by inhibiting the expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-&#x003b1; and TNF-&#x003b3; mediated through VDR-dependent pathway.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p><p>Various other antigens/vaccines used for immunotherapy and their response rate are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>. The response rate achieved in our study was 78.57% in maximum of 4 sessions which was superior to the results achieved with PPD, Bleomycin, MMR vaccine, <italic>C. albicans</italic> antigen and <italic>Mycobacterium indicus pranii</italic> vaccine. However, treatment with <italic>Mycobacterium</italic> w vaccine was superior to that of Vitamin D3, but the number of sessions was more i.e., 10 as compared to our study which was 4. Hence, higher response rate i.e., 93% reported in the Garg and Baveja study[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] can be attributed to more number of sessions. Furthermore, they reported systemic and local complications such as high-grade fever and redness, swelling, induration and ulcer formation at the injection site. Hence, compared to these adverse effects, we did not experience any serious systemic and local complications which needed medications hence it is very safe procedure than <italic>Mycobacterium</italic> w vaccine.</p><table-wrap id="T4" position="float"><label>Table 4</label><caption><p>Response rate of various antigens/vaccine</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JCAS-10-90-g010"/></table-wrap></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>Intralesional Vitamin D3 injection is an innovative approach for the treatment of warts. It is inexpensive, safe and special value to treat multiple warts in developing countries. Although our study is limited by its small sample size and lack of randomisation, the results are encouraging.
