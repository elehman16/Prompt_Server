Decades of habitual activity patterns, and the sequelae to injury, surgery, disease, and tissue changes, can result in pain and problems with balance and mobility. These challenges often lead to diminished lives, and there are major financial costs from inactivity, falls, and disability (e.g., <xref rid="bibr2-2333721417724014" ref-type="bibr">Carlson, Fulton, Pratt, Yang, &#x00026; Adams, 2015</xref>). Accessible programs that support improved function are important resources for older adults. The Feldenkrais Method (FM) addresses patterns of self-organization to improve mobility. The current study is an assessment of a FM lesson series designed particularly for older adults to improve their flexibility, balance, and mobility.</p><p>The FM is distinguishable from other modalities in several ways. The FM promotes &#x0201c;learning how to learn&#x0201d; (<xref rid="bibr5-2333721417724014" ref-type="bibr">Feldenkrais, 1972</xref>), so that a person does not merely go through motions but learns how to apply processes of inquiry, variation, and discernment to any circumstance. Participants vary movements systematically, constantly differentiating one experience from another, particularly for discovering how to use less effort and find greater ease. Rather than conforming to an absolute or ideal action that might not even be possible for an individual, each person explores what an instruction means in their particular body on a given day, and thus the FM teaches a specific, self-regulated process. Finally, the FM scaffolds integration of lesson discoveries with everyday activity (e.g., turning while sitting, then standing, then walking).</p><p>The FM is an approach in which people move in small, slow ways to find greater ease in everyday activities and discover new (or renewed) movement possibilities. Based in functional principles of psychophysics, perception, learning, and development (e.g., <xref rid="bibr1-2333721417724014" ref-type="bibr">Alon, 1990</xref>; <xref rid="bibr5-2333721417724014" ref-type="bibr">Feldenkrais, 1972</xref>; <xref rid="bibr9-2333721417724014" ref-type="bibr">Hillier &#x00026; Worley, 2015</xref>), Feldenkrais movement lessons can result in both specific changes from a given lesson (e.g., shifting weight during walking) and generalized changes across lessons (e.g., improved balance, sense of comfort and competence, and learning-how-to-learn). Students explore movements slowly and with minimal force to detect small differences. Lessons are carefully paced, include brief rests to consolidate learning, and emphasize self-regulation. Lessons help people identify their preferred patterns (habits) and how to expand repertoire beyond habit. As noted in their content analysis of typical Feldenkrais lessons focusing on balance, <xref rid="bibr4-2333721417724014" ref-type="bibr">Connors, Galea, Said, and Remedios (2010)</xref> found that the method emphasized trunk flexibility and control, and attending to internal experience. Connors et al. indicated that this approach was fully consistent with current motor learning and postural control theories.</p><p>Although there are as yet few thorough studies with older adults, there is a growing body of research showing benefits across the life span from Feldenkrais lessons, including those conducted in a class format (e.g., <xref rid="bibr3-2333721417724014" ref-type="bibr">Connors, Galea, &#x00026; Said, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bibr15-2333721417724014" ref-type="bibr">Ullmann, Williams, Hussey, Durstine, &#x00026; McClenaghan, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bibr16-2333721417724014" ref-type="bibr">Vrantsidis et al., 2009</xref>). For example, <xref rid="bibr16-2333721417724014" ref-type="bibr">Vrantsidis et al.&#x02019;s (2009)</xref> lesson participants improved in gait speed and balance confidence; similarly, <xref rid="bibr15-2333721417724014" ref-type="bibr">Ullmann et al.&#x02019;s (2010)</xref> participants showed better balance and mobility. In a recent review and meta-analysis, <xref rid="bibr9-2333721417724014" ref-type="bibr">Hillier and Worley (2015)</xref> conclude that there are generally positive outcomes across studies, though the effect sizes are usually small for clinically recognized tests such as Timed Up and Go (TUG). Researchers sometimes also ask participants for qualitative descriptions of experiences, and participants report improvements in mobility, balance, dexterity, and awareness.</p><p>This study sought to test outcomes of the systematic and detailed FM curriculum <italic>Moving Forward</italic>, an extension from <xref rid="bibr20-2333721417724014" ref-type="bibr">Zemach-Bersin, Zemach-Bersin, and Reese (1990)</xref>. The lessons foster a range of comfortable movement in daily activities, improved balance, and an empowering attitude about learning. Zemach-Bersin designed the curriculum to provide older people with balance and mobility lessons they could do while seated, and to integrate their learning into standing and walking at the end of each session. Lessons always begin with a self-scan that provides a baseline for comparison throughout the lesson, and conclude with application of content in standing and walking. The specific content across the series includes functions of turning, balance, spinal flexion and extension, shoulder and pelvis mobility, breathing, foot flexibility, face and jaw movement, coming to stand, and walking. Through such lessons, participants might feel less pain, more confidence, return to desired activities, and develop a greater sense of how to manage further movement challenges.</p><p>A central motivation for this research was to test the curriculum in the naturalistic settings for which it was designed, with multiple teachers. Most FM older adult studies (and indeed, most studies of movement lessons in any modality, such as yoga or tai chi) rely on a single teacher, in a single location. While it is simpler to conduct research using a single teacher and location, the efficacy of lessons is nonetheless presumed to generalize across multiple teachers, settings, and schedules; however, almost none of these studies or modalities demonstrate the generalizability. Furthermore, in few if any cases have prior researchers indicated the nature of teacher or assessor training. In the current study, multiple teachers and assessors participated in training prior to assessments and lessons in multiple community centers, and teachers worked from a detailed manual.</p><p>Another motivation was to recruit a larger number of participants than in most prior studies, and testing the same curriculum delivered over 6 versus 12 weeks. The 12-week opportunity arose because one community center could only offer their facility on that basis, and in this study, it was used it as a comparison with the other centers doing 6 weeks. Based on consultations with experienced FM teachers about different schedules, it was hypothesized that taking lessons twice weekly for 6 weeks would yield better outcomes than once weekly for 12 weeks.</p><sec id="section1-2333721417724014"><title>Research Purpose and Hypotheses</title><p>The purpose of the current study was to assess the effects of balance and mobility lessons designed for older adults, using a sizable sample, multiple sites and teachers, and with a randomized control (waiting) group design (exceptions to random assignment are noted in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-2333721417724014">Table 1</xref>). Participants engaged in several standard assessments before the lesson series or waiting period began, and after the series/waiting period was over. Balance, mobility, and interview measures were selected because they have been sensitive to interventions in prior research. Feldenkrais teachers taught two 60-min lessons per week for 6 to 7 weeks, or one lesson weekly for 12 weeks. It was predicted that people participating in the lessons, relative to the waiting group, would show improvement in balance and movement scores, and report improvements specific to their particular activities. In addition, it was predicted that participants in the 6-week series would experience greater improvements, compared with the 12-week series participants.</p><table-wrap id="table1-2333721417724014" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Study Sample Demographic Characteristics.</p></caption><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_2333721417724014-table1"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Characteristic</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Initial sample</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Final sample</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age, median years (range)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">76 (56-92)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">76 (58-92)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3" rowspan="1">Gender</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Female <italic>n</italic></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">108</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">77</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Male <italic>n</italic></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">16</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">10</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">6-week group <italic>n</italic> (% continued)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">83</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">63 (75.9)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">12-week group <italic>n</italic> (% continued)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">41</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">24 (58.5)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3" rowspan="1">Ethnicity (%)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;White</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">97 (78.2)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02014;</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Black</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">8 (6.5)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02014;</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Hispanic/Latino</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">6 (4.8)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02014;</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Asian/Pacific Islander</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">4 (3.2)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02014;</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Other or no answer</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">9 (7)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02014;</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3" rowspan="1">Assistive devices (%)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Cane or walking stick</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">22 (17.7)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02014;</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Rolling walker</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">10 (8.1)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02014;</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Walker</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">4 (3.2)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02014;</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Shopping cart</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">3 (2.4)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02014;</td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives></table-wrap></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="section2-2333721417724014"><title>Method</title><sec id="section3-2333721417724014"><title>Participants</title><p>All procedures were approved as complying with regulations for the use of human participants, by the study&#x02019;s Institutional Review Board.

Those taking more lessons reached farther at the posttest, and showed improved OPTIMAL scores indicating greater ease in a range of everyday movements. There was no lesson effect on the measures of TUG, Tandem Stance, and BSW. For self-identified priorities, the lesson participants reported significantly more improvements than did the waiting control participants.</p><p>While a majority of lesson participants prioritizing balance and/or walking reported improvements in those activities, the full sample&#x02019;s behavior on the BSW, Tandem, and TUG tests did not change as a function of lessons. Most of the sample was close to or at ceiling on the Tandem test (in contrast to, for example, <xref rid="bibr15-2333721417724014" ref-type="bibr">Ullmann et al., 2010</xref>, whose participants sustained much lower times in tandem). In such cases, some researchers have suggested doubling the assessed time in stance to 60 s. While this likely would reduce the number of people performing at ceiling, it is not clear whether it would be sensitive to the changes these lessons engender. Furthermore, <xref rid="bibr15-2333721417724014" ref-type="bibr">Ullmann et al. (2010)</xref> found that FM participants essentially maintained (but did not improve) their TUG performance in contrast to the control participants who showed a very slight increase in timing; the very small changes (Ullmann et al.) or no change (the current study) may indicate that the TUG, too, is perhaps not a useful measure of lesson effects. As <xref rid="bibr9-2333721417724014" ref-type="bibr">Hillier and Worley (2015)</xref> note, even when Feldenkrais studies find objective behavioral lesson effects, they tend to have small effect sizes (e.g., a difference of &#x02264;1 s on TUG).</p><p>This may point to an inherent challenge to assessing change in speed, duration or extent following lessons whose purpose encourages people to find flexibility and mobility by slowing down, reducing unnecessary effort, exploring smaller movements, and identifying what feels comfortable. The FM asks people to recognize that there may be options for better balance and comfort by not reaching so far or moving so quickly, especially during the learning stages of a new self-organization. In the pretest, it was obvious that a number of participants engaged considerable effort, to the point of discomfort and poor balance. Such participants could find that the lessons led them to discover safer, easier movement, and their posttest scores would actually show improvement as a <italic>decreased</italic> reach or <italic>slower</italic> TUG time that was nonetheless more comfortable and safe. Measures such as the TUG, Tandem Stance, and Functional Reach, which are standard in much of the medical literature for assessing balance and mobility, are probably not always the best measures for lessons whose focus is learning better organization.</p><p>It may be useful to assess Feldenkrais outcomes by more fine-grained means, such as by video analysis of movement organization, more detailed interviews, and following participants at intervals throughout the program (e.g., see <xref rid="bibr18-2333721417724014" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2014</xref>, for an example of such qualitative approaches). Teachers in the current study, for example, kept logs of the many spontaneous, detailed comments offered by participants about their weekly improvements not &#x0201c;caught&#x0201d; by the posttest interview. These comments, along with participants&#x02019; reports on self-identified priorities, revealed a variety of experienced changes ranging from reduced pain, to rushing less, to using the whole body to move better.</p><p>People&#x02019;s interview answers were far more nuanced than the OPTIMAL survey alone supported. Participants often qualified an answer with considerable detail about when, where and how their activity was more or less difficult. For example, some described learning a specific, helpful process such as coming to the edge of the chair and shifting weight as a way to prepare to stand (this process was part of every lesson, and was mentioned by many during the posttest interview). Whereas the OPTIMAL is asking about a whole activity such as standing or sitting, lesson participants gave details that showed their attention to qualities, dynamics, and transitions.</p><p>Participants&#x02019; description of changes on items they identified as targets for improvement did not always match their rating scale responses on the targeted OPTIMAL item. For example, some indicated no change on the rating scale for a targeted item, but then described improvements in response to the open-ended question. This suggests that the OPTIMAL may not be the most reliable instrument for assessing this experience for this population, or at least that multiple sources of information will be needed.</p><p>Furthermore, future analyses should account for what people prioritize for improvement, what improvement they report experiencing in that activity, and what the relevant behavioral measures indicate. For example, selecting only those participants in this study who prioritized &#x0201c;balance&#x0201d; for improvement, and looking at their BSW scores, those who reported improved balance indeed showed a significantly wider stance at the posttest than those reporting no improvement. Thus, while certain measures did not reveal lesson effects for the sample as a whole, they may be useful in a more targeted assessment of people&#x02019;s priorities and experiences.</p><p>This study predicted that twice-weekly lessons would yield more effect than once-weekly lessons, but there were no such differences. It is reassuring that the 12-week participants experienced similar improvements. Of greater importance may be the total number of lessons experienced, given the positive correlations between number of lessons attended and improvements on behavioral measures. Compliance was good, with 88% of the lesson group able to attend the eight lessons minimum for analysis; participants expressed enthusiasm about the series, and many asked to repeat it with the waiting group after the posttest.</p><p>This study&#x02019;s results are consistent with those of older adults engaging in some yoga or tai chi programs (e.g., <xref rid="bibr8-2333721417724014" ref-type="bibr">Hakim, Kotroba, Cours, Teel, &#x00026; Leininger, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bibr10-2333721417724014" ref-type="bibr">Huang &#x00026; Liu, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bibr11-2333721417724014" ref-type="bibr">Roland, Jakobi, &#x00026; Jones, 2011</xref>) in which they show better balance and flexibility, as do older adults in some other Feldenkrais programs (e.g., <xref rid="bibr15-2333721417724014" ref-type="bibr">Ullmann et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bibr16-2333721417724014" ref-type="bibr">Vrantsidis et al., 2009</xref>). Feldenkrais <italic>Moving Forward</italic> lessons offer older adults not only balance and flexibility practice, but crucially also principles for exploring and discerning easier movement in any circumstance (such as doing yoga better) that take the learning beyond these specific lessons. Furthermore, this study showed that effects generalized across multiple teachers, settings, and durations, which is promising for application in any community center.</p><p>Limitations of this study include the lack of full randomization to condition, due to a small number recruited at one center, and the scheduling constraints of several other participants. Another limitation is that the behavioral measures, selected for their common use in assessing older adult balance and mobility, may not be the best suited to reveal better organization and ease. Moreover, it would be useful to extend the series to determine ongoing consolidation of experiences. This series offers an economically viable and empowering set of lessons, but it also requires participants to pay attention and remain open to unexpected shifts; 12 lessons are just a start on this process.</p><p>In conclusion, older adults reported improved balance and mobility following this FM lesson series. Self-identified priorities were particularly important for what people felt had improved. Standard measures of movement speed, duration, and extent may miss some of the important progress the FM is designed to foster, and thus additional assessment tools are needed to understand people&#x02019;s priorities and experiences with this distinctive learning process.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The author thanks David Zemach-Bersin, for use of the <italic>Moving Forward</italic> curriculum, consultation on design and measures, and financial support through the Feldenkrais Foundation.
