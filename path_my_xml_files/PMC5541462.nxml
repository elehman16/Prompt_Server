When children are neglected and abandoned or even abused, it may lead to a severe effect on them lasting till lifetime. Several studies have shown such effects of child abuse and neglect although the outcome may vary as a function of the interaction between specific genes and environmental conditions.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Children living in orphanages not only have to face challenges such as malnutrition, crowded living spaces, and lack of parental care which have been shown having a deleterious effect on development[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] but they may also have psychological difficulties such as loneliness, sense of abandonment, and difficulties in identity formation. One study from South Asia found behavioral problems in around 33% orphanage children.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] In another comparative study between 52 adolescents living in an orphanage and 55 nonorphanage residents, it was reported that participants living in the orphanage had significantly higher anxiety, depression, negative self-concept, hostility, and Global Severity Index points than the control group.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Further, children living in orphanages often have low self-esteem.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Yoga is one of the alternatives and complementary medicine interventions, which is noninvasive, safe, as well as cost-effective. It has found to be effective in many clinical health conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, asthma, Parkinson's disease,[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] as well as psychological problems such as anxiety[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and depression.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] In a study with school children, it was found that 10 days of residential Yoga program improved short-term and working memory.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] In another study, 8 weeks of mindful awareness practice 30 min/session, 3 sessions/week showed a significant improvement in cognitive functions.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>However, none of the earlier studies have looked into the effects of a short termYoga intervention on anxiety, depression, and self-esteem in orphanage adolescents and young adults.

On post intervention, it is observed that a significant reduction in anxiety and depression along with a significant increase in self-esteem. Also a significant decrease in the number of the participants having clinical anxiety and depression after 2 weeks of Yoga intervention was observed. During the intervention phase, most of the participants were enthusiastic and motivated. Participants enjoyed the Yoga sessions, and no adverse effects of Yoga practice were reported.</p><p>In one of the earlier comparative studies between Yoga intervention and a control dance group with orphanage children having trauma-related distress, the participants showed significant improvements in symptoms after participation in an 8-week Yoga program as compared to controls.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Apart from this, Yoga is widely used in the adolescent population (nonorphanage) in many health-related conditions and one study with irritable bowel syndrome found 4 weeks of Yoga practice reduces anxiety, depression, pain, and functional disability.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>One possible mechanism behind these findings could be that Yoga improves autonomic functions through influencing neurohormonal mechanisms that suppress sympathetic activity through downregulation of the hypothalamic&#x02013;pituitary&#x02013;adrenal axis.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Reduced sympathetic activity leads to enhanced physical and mental relaxation. This may help in reducing anxiety, depression, and improve self-esteem. It has been reported that active participation in practice and increased physical activity may improve self-esteem[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] by improving perceived physical competence. Structured group physical activity program for the management of depression is a part of the treatment guidelines.</p><p>It is relevant to mention that in our study, we found the prevalence of anxiety is more than the prevalence of depression in this orphanage. One possible reason behind high anxiety levels in this age group may be related to worries about their career and uncertainty about future.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, there are very few studies which have focused on the adolescent population living in orphanages. Therefore, in future, another study may be planned with the inclusion of a randomly assigned control group which can be given an intervention package of only physical exercise and relaxation by a trainer. This will control factors such as increased activity, as well as the interpersonal interaction, influencing the outcome. The blind objective behavioral rating can also be included as an outcome measure in future. Long-term follow-up may also be done to assess whether these children are able to sustain motivation to engage in Yoga once the intervention is over.</p><p>In summary, study results support the earlier findings about the efficacy of Yoga-based intervention in at-risk children and adolescents to significantly reduce anxiety and depression, even with a short-term intervention. More studies are required to explore the feasibility of scaling up such interventions as a preventive public mental measure.</p><p>Future studies should be carried out with larger sample size, proper randomization, and inclusion of an active control group. Duration of intervention should be increased and long-term effect should be studied. The intervention should also include counseling sessions and other components of Yoga such as <italic>Yama</italic> and <italic>Niyama</italic>. Assessment tools may include other robust objective variables such as heart rate variability, muscle strength, cognitive functions, mindfulness, and emotional states.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Two weeks of Yoga intervention may help in reducing anxiety and depression and may improve self-esteem in orphanage adolescents and young adults. However, further randomized controlled studies are required to confirm these findings. The limitations of this study were a short period of intervention and lack of a control group. However, as a pilot study, this research has brought new insights into the potential positive role of Yoga on psychological states in adolescents and young adults living in orphanages.</p><sec
