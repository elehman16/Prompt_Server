The evidence to date indicates that oxidative stress plays an important role in the mechanism of disuse muscle atrophy. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine if long-term radical scavenger treatment with edaravone following an acute stroke prevents the progression of disuse muscle atrophy and improves leg locomotor function in the chronic phase.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> This randomized controlled pilot study was conducted at 19 acute stroke and rehabilitation centers across Japan. Forty-seven ischemic stroke patients with at least leg motor weakness admitted within 24 hours of onset were randomly assigned to receive continuous intravenous infusions of edaravone 30 mg twice daily for 3 days (short-term group) or 10&#x02013;14 days (long-term group). The primary endpoints of the study included the degree of leg disuse muscle atrophy, as measured by the percentage change from baseline in femoral muscle circumference 15 cm above the knee, and the improvement in leg locomotor function, as assessed by the maximum walking speed over 10 m, 3 months after the onset of stroke.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Three-month follow-up was completed by a total of 41 patients (21 in the short-term group and 20 in the long-term group). On admission, there was no significant difference in the severity of stroke or the grade of leg paresis between the two treatment groups. The grade of disuse muscle atrophy and incidence of gait impairment 3 weeks after stroke onset were also similar between the short- and long-term groups. However, disuse muscle atrophy of the paretic and non-paretic legs was significantly less severe in the long-term versus the short-term treatment group (3.6&#x000b1;5.9% and 1.5&#x000b1;6.0% vs 8.3&#x000b1;5.2% and 5.7&#x000b1;6.4%; p&#x0003c;0.01 and p&#x0003c;0.05) 3 months after stroke onset. Additionally, the maximum walking speed over a distance of 10 m was significantly greater in the long-term group (98&#x000b1;67 vs 54&#x000b1;55 cm/sec; p&#x0003c;0.05).</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Edaravone treatment for up to 14 days suppresses the progression of disuse muscle atrophy and improves leg locomotor function to a greater extent than shorter-term treatment in acute stroke patients. This suggests that the management of stroke may be improved with long-term edaravone therapy by providing myoprotective effects that ameliorate functional outcome in the chronic phase.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Adis Data Information BV 2010</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Stroke is a global health problem and is a major cause of death and disability in the adult population.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] One of the most common symptoms of stroke is motor weakness, which can lead to considerable disruption of activities in daily life such as feeding, bathing, dressing, and grooming. During a cerebral infarction, motor tracts in the frontal cortex, the corona radiata, the internal capsule, or the pons are often impaired, resulting in the development of hemiparesis of the lower limbs and subsequent leg locomotor dysfunction during the chronic phase of stroke.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]</p><p>However, leg locomotor dysfunction is not solely attributable to ischemic cerebral damage of motor neuron tracts, but may also be in part due to disuse muscle atrophy of both paralyzed and non-paralyzed legs. Indeed, a small study of healthy older adult subjects demonstrated that 10 consecutive days of bed rest caused substantial losses in skeletal muscle mass and function, particularly in the lower extremities.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] Acute stroke patients with severe hemiparesis or paralysis can remain bedridden for at least 1&#x02013;2 weeks, and are often unable to walk despite weeks of rehabilitation. This extended period in a bedridden state during the acute and subacute phases of stroke is the likely cause of lower limb disuse muscle atrophy in association with leg motor weakness, thus accelerating the development of leg locomotor dysfunction in the chronic phase.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]</p><p>The involvement of oxidative stress in disuse muscle atrophy was first highlighted in the 1990s.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] Although the exact mechanisms of disuse muscle atrophy in humans remain unclear, the evidence to date has established the important role that oxidative stress plays in the development of disuse muscle atrophy.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] The free radical scavenger edaravone is a neuroprotective drug that has been indicated for the treatment of acute stroke since 2001 in Japan, and has been shown to dose dependently improve functional outcomes in patients with acute ischemic stroke.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] Edaravone can donate an electron to a lipid peroxyl radical, which results in conversion to a lipid peroxyl anion.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] Edaravone scavenges free radicals produced by activation of the arachidonic acid cascade during cerebral ischemia-reperfusion, and inhibits the peroxidation of lipids by free radicals.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] Edaravone has been shown to protect the vascular endothelium and reduce damage to neuronal and glial cells by scavenging for free radicals.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]</p><p>In Japan, the recommended duration of edaravone administration is 14 days, but this can be shortened in patients with mild symptoms.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] Early studies indicated that neuronal cells cannot survive for more than several hours after ischemia and that cell-killing events continue for a few days.

However, Unno et al.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] reported that the duration of edaravone therapy affected the functional outcome in acute ischemic stroke patients.

The six patients who did not complete the 3-month follow-up were excluded from the analysis for the following reasons: the development of cerebral hemorrhage during the follow-up period (n = 1); discontinuation of edaravone due to the occurrence of liver disorders during treatment (n = 1); inability to continue the drug infusion for more than 1 day because of heart failure (n = 1); no rehabilitation was performed during the follow-up period due to associated pneumonia and other complications (n = 1); and discontinuation of follow-up for personal reasons (n = 2).

First, edaravone could be administered within 72 hours of stroke onset, but this was restricted to within 6&#x02013;12 hours of onset in studies involving other cerebroprotective agents. Secondly, the infarct size was generally smaller in the edaravone study, which resulted in minor neurologic symptoms such as motor weakness; various higher cortical dysfunctions occurred in other studies that included patients with larger infarcts. Finally, edaravone could be administered for a duration of up to 14 days, compared with 1&#x02013;3 days in other studies such as the SAINT (Stroke Acute Ischemic NXY-059 [Cerovive] Treatment) II trial.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]</p><p>The results of the phase III clinical study on edaravone suggest that the beneficial effects of the drug may also be partly attributable to myoprotective effects.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] Based on this hypothesis, we conducted the present pilot study to determine the myoprotective effects of edaravone in acute stroke patients. In the present study, patients were randomly allocated to edaravone therapy for a 3- or 14-day duration; this latter duration of administration was thought to be sufficient to provide both cerebroprotective and myoprotective effects.</p><p>Disuse muscle atrophy is a phenomenon that is seen in clinical practice when patients are in a long-term bedridden state or during prolonged rest with restricted activity and/or mobility. The atrophy of skeletal muscle arises from the reduction or atrophy of myofibers.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] Although the exact mechanism of onset of disuse muscle atrophy remains unclear, we reported experimental results that indicated a close relationship between oxidative stress and disuse muscle atrophy.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] More specifically, atrophic muscles of rats showed elevated levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and oxidized glutathione, which are both markers of oxidative stress. Furthermore, an increase in the formation of superoxide radical anions (O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>) was indicated by elevated Cu/Zn-containing superoxide dismutase activity in the cytoplasm of atrophic muscle cells, and 12 days of disuse atrophy showed a 2.2-fold rise in xanthine oxidase levels relative to controls. Indeed, histochemical studies using transmission electron microscopy revealed elevated levels of reactive oxygen species such as H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in atrophic muscles.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] Metals such as iron have also been shown to increase oxidative stress in atrophic muscle, and the administration of the iron-chelating agent deferoxamine suppressed the increase in thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and oxidized glutathione in the atrophic muscles of rats.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] In recent years, the role of iron in oxidative stress has attracted close attention in the field of physiology.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]</p><p>Another factor that may be involved in the development of muscular atrophy is the elevation of intracellular calcium ion (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) levels during muscle inactivity.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in the cytoplasm of atrophic muscle cells were approximately 4-fold higher than levels in normal muscle cells. This accumulation of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> during muscular disuse may occur due to ionic disturbances of the cell membrane, which retards cellular removal of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. This resulting elevation of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> may lead to the activation of calcium-dependent proteases, thus leading to the breakdown of muscle tissue.</p><p>In addition to inducing muscle atrophy during disuse, oxidative stress has been shown to be enhanced during recovery from atrophy in rats.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] This suggests that the production of free radicals will continue to occur in patients who are recovering from disuse muscle atrophy. In the present study, the continuous administration of the free radical scavenger edaravone for an extended period of 14 days was beneficial in patients undergoing disuse muscle therapy, many of whom started out-of-bed rehabilitation following several days of bed rest. Therefore, a 2-week treatment period of edaravone appears to be effective during both the period of muscle disuse and the period of recovery of muscle activity.</p><p>The severity of muscle atrophy did not differ markedly between the two treatment groups 3 weeks after stroke onset in the present study, but showed a significant improvement in favor of the long-term treatment group after 3 months. This may be explained by the delayed involvement of apoptosis during the course of disuse muscle atrophy, which eventually leads to muscular cell shrinkage and/or death.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] As a result, the clinical manifestation of muscle atrophy may not become apparent until changes in the muscular intracellular environment have taken place, which may occur over a period of several weeks.</p><p>The limitations of the present study include its small sample size and lack of a placebo or control group (i.e. standard therapy minus edaravone). Another limitation was the inability to independently assess the cerebroprotective and myoprotective effects of edaravone. An experimental study utilizing a rat middle cerebral artery occlusion model reported cellular oxidative damage in the rat brain is evident for at least 7 days.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] Furthermore, the time to blood reflow in humans with cerebral infarction varied according to the occluded blood vessel and stroke subtype.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] These studies suggest the duration of the disturbance caused by oxidative stress varies, and there is a possibility that the observed benefits on disuse muscle atrophy in the long-term group may be partly attributable to a more potent cerebroprotective effect of edaravone. If this is indeed the case, then the widely accepted view that the process of ischemic neuronal cell death is almost completed within 2&#x02013;3 days of stroke onset should be reconsidered, and further clinical research investigating the administration of cerebroprotective agents for longer periods should be conducted.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results of our study indicated that treatment with the free radical scavenger edaravone for 14 days effectively improved both the severity of disuse muscle atrophy and leg locomotor dysfunction in the chronic phase. Based on these findings, the use of antioxidant therapy for as long as possible appears to be warranted to provide the maximal level of both cerebroprotection and myoprotection. Larger, randomized controlled clinical trials are required to confirm the beneficial effects of edaravone in the management of stroke.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This study was funded by a Grant-in-Aid (H-18-Chojyu-Ippan-040) from the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, Japan.
