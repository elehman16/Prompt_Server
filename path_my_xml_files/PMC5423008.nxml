The child is at increased risk for anxiety and depression, behavioural problems such as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and conduct disorder, as well as sub-optimal cognitive development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. There is also an increased risk of physical problems such as asthma and altered immune function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. All this appears to be, at least in part, due to fetal programming. The mother is also more likely to suffer from postnatal depression if she is anxious or depressed while pregnant and her baby is likely to be premature and smaller for gestational age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. These consequences can occur with mild to moderate symptoms of anxiety and depression, not only with severe stress or a clinically diagnosed mental illness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. It is therefore very important both to detect and to help ameliorate symptoms of anxiety and depression in pregnant women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Many women do not want pharmacological interventions at this time, and with less severe symptoms it may not be appropriate. Thus there is a need to find non-pharmacological methods of intervention. Psychological therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy or interpersonal therapy can be effective but these are often not available for the large numbers of women who could benefit.</p><p>There is a large body of research showing that listening to music can alter mood and arousal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In terms of clinical applications, it can, for instance, lessen anxiety before dentistry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and reduce anxiety and depression in older adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. A study with pregnant women who listened to music prior to amniocentesis showed that it reduced both state anxiety and cortisol levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], while an intervention that involved pregnant women learning to sing lullabies during pregnancy was found to aid emotional expression, reduce the amount of self-reported anxiety and contribute to a positive experience during pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Interestingly, animal studies have shown that exposure to music during pregnancy can benefit brain development in the offspring. Chikahisa et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] showed that if mice were played Mozart in the perinatal period it enhanced the learning performance and altered the brain Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor/ Tropomyosin Kinase B (BDNF/TrkB) signaling in the adult offspring. Sheikhi and Saboory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] have shown that exposure of pregnant rats to classical music throughout pregnancy resulted in the offspring having significantly higher cell density in the parietal cortex while Kim et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] have shown that exposure to music during pregnancy increased neurogenesis in the motor and somatosensory cortex of the rat pups.</p><p>In this small pilot study we explored the possibility that listening to original songs specially composed for the prenatal period may reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression in pregnant women over a period of 12&#x000a0;weeks. We used a control condition of sitting quietly and undisturbed, which has been shown in an acute study to reduce anxiety and cortisol levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Proof of efficacy would justify investment into music as an accessible, inexpensive and non-stigmatizing method with potential to improve the mother&#x02019;s mental health and benefit both the mother and child.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p>The study was conducted between March 2014 and August 2015. The Ethics committee at Goldsmiths, University of London, approved this study. Informed consent was obtained online, prior to the start of the questionnaires.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participants</title><p>The women were recruited online via a specially designed website, The Relaxation in Pregnancy Study. The study was publicized on various websites, such as Netmums, and also by leaflets that were distributed in hospitals, ultrasound clinics, baby and toddler groups and coffee shops throughout London, UK. Pregnant women over 18&#x000a0;years from English speaking countries were eligible. Participants were randomized through a blocked design of random sizes using research randomizer. A research associate not involved in the study conducted the randomization. Individual group assignments were placed in opaque sealed envelopes to ensure allocation concealment.</p><p>Two hundred twenty-two participants completed the questionnaires on entry into the study and were randomly allocated to the control or music group (control group 111; music group 111). Their characteristics are shown in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. There were no significant differences between these two groups. Thirty-six of these (control group 16; music group 20) also completed the questionnaires at 12&#x000a0;weeks. The attrition rate was comparable across both groups.

</p><p>Sample size estimations have been made to power the study using G*Power 3.1. An effect size of 0.57 was estimated based on effect sizes of studies involving forms of relaxation on Trait Anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Assuming an effect size of 0.57, and a two-tailed alpha of 0.05, a sample of 50 participants per group was deemed necessary to generate a power of 0.80.</p><p>Both the control and music groups were asked to listen to their assigned audio file for at least 20&#x000a0;min a day and to record each time they had engaged in this activity. Twelve&#x000a0;weeks after each participant had started the study they were prompted to complete the EPDS, and State-Trait Anxiety Index for a second time. Participants were sent follow- up emails every 2&#x000a0;weeks that served as a reminder for the participants to listen to their assigned mp3 files. At the end of&#x000a0;12 weeks, participants were prompted to complete the questionnaire. Participants who had not completed their questionnaire by the deadline were prompted to complete the questionnaire every 5&#x000a0;days past the deadline for a maximum of 3 times.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Materials</title><p>Qualtrics software was used to administer the questionnaires and participants were prompted to complete these via email at the respective time points. Participants received an audio file specific to the assigned group electronically. Both audio files began with a 2&#x000a0;min introduction given via the same speaker; following this, participants were instructed to either sit quietly and undisturbed (control group) or to listen to pre-recorded songs (music group), for 20&#x000a0;min. Composer Jennie Muskett wrote these songs specifically for use during pregnancy. The songs were composed using specific tempos, musical shapes and phrases aimed at inducing a calm state. The music was original and therefore had no previous associations. Use of some of the musical characteristics typical of traditional lullabies, incremental reductions in tempo, and repetition of musical phrases, many of which were derived from motherese, all aimed to further enhance the effect. The song lyrics invited connection with, and visualisation of the fetus and each song addressed various issues relevant to pregnant women. The instrumentation and timbre was intimate, performed vocally and accompanied entirely by acoustic instruments.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Self-report questionnaires</title><p>Symptoms of Trait anxiety, the primary outcome, and symptoms of State Anxiety and Depression, the secondary outcomes, were assessed using self-report questionnaires.</p><sec id="Sec6"><title>Edinburgh postnatal depression scale</title><p>The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale [(EPDS), validated for prenatal use] is a 10 item questionnaire measuring symptoms of maternal depression.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Discussion</title><p>The results of this small study look promising, in that over the 12-week period, participants&#x02019; symptoms of anxiety and depression decreased significantly in the music group and did not change significantly in the control group. It is of note that the baseline scores in both groups are above average [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]; it appears that women with somewhat raised symptoms of anxiety and depression chose to take part in the study.</p><p>There are several obvious limitations to this study. The first is the high attrition rate. This may well be because the investigators had no direct contact with the participants, as all recruitment and follow up was online. It may also be that only some women find listening to music helpful or enjoyable; but an intervention that benefits a subgroup could still be of great value. Though only the music group showed significant reduction in anxiety and depression, the interaction between group and time was not statistically significant using a Mixed Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). This is likely due to the small numbers, and emphasizes the need for a larger study, with personal contact and better retention. We also do not know if other music would be equally effective. The songs used here were specifically composed and designed to have a calming effect.</p><p>Despite these limitations, the magnitude of reduction of the scores in the music listening group is notable, from a mean of 38.5 to 30.6 for Trait anxiety and from a mean of 8.4 to 3.75 for the EPDS. We know that the means of the scores for these questionnaires generally tend to remain quite stable over pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], and reductions of this magnitude could be clinically significant.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Conclusions</title><p>These results do suggest that further research in this area is warranted. Listening to music during pregnancy is a potentially enjoyable, inexpensive and non-stigmatizing intervention that may also be beneficial for the future child.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec11"><title>Additional file</title><p>
