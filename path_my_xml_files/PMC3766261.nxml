Ropinirole, when given in the immediate-release (IR) form, has to be taken three times a day. It is hypothesized that pulsatile stimulation of dopamine receptors in PD may induce motor fluctuation
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Theoretically, motor fluctuation can be avoided by continuous stimulation of the dopamine receptors. Based on this hypothesis, a prolonged-release (PR) formulation was developed.</p><p>Ropinirole PR (RPR) is a once daily formulation of ropinirole that is not inferior to the immediate-release formulation
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In advanced PD patients, once-daily RPR shows significantly greater improvement in parkinsonian symptoms than IR from
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Once daily dosing provides better medication compliance
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and smoother plasma levels than ropinirole IR (RIR)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Therefore, this formulation is regarded as valuable addition to available antiparkinsonian medications
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>However, we have met patients unsatisfied with once daily RPR who had asked for multiple daily dosing in clinics occasionally. As seen in the time window of the ropinirole level from Tompson et al.
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], the nocturnal concentration may be lower in the once-daily RPR than the three times daily RIR. The &#x0201c;off&#x0201d; symptoms between dusk and dawn might be more severe in the once daily RPR dosing than in the multiple daily RIR dosing. In addition, the early morning off duration may be longer in the RPR than in the RIR, since the increasing slope of the plasma concentration is gentler in the RPR. Thus multiple dosing with RPR may provide even better control in some patients.</p><p>Herein, we compared the preference of patients for once-daily versus twice-daily combination of RPR.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Patients</title><p>PD patients between 30 and 80&#x000a0;years of age were eligible for the study. All subjects were taking a stable dose of levodopa and dopamine agonist for at least 4&#x000a0;weeks prior to the screening. They were on dopamine agonist (RIR or pramipexole IR) and were considering changing to RPR due to suboptimal control with levodopa and dopamine agonist therapy, for example, motor fluctuation, dyskinesia, and sleep-related problems.</p><p>There were no limitations on other antiparkinsonian medications as long as the treatments remained stable for at least 4&#x000a0;weeks prior to and throughout the study. Neuroleptics were not allowed in this study. Patients with significant or uncontrolled psychiatric, cognitive, neurologic or other medical disorders; a history of severe dizziness or fainting due to orthostatic hypotension; a recent history or current evidence of drug abuse or alcoholism; a history of severe adverse events related dopaminergic agents; a history of allergic reaction to the similar medications; and a history of heavy metal poisoning were not eligible for the study. Patients were excluded from the study if they had used RPR, or an investigational medication within 4&#x000a0;weeks. We did not enroll patients who were on less than 2&#x000a0;mg of RIR or less than 0.375&#x000a0;mg of pramipexole IR since we could not prescribe a twice-daily dose without splitting the tablet shown in Additional file

The study protocol was approved by Institutional Review Board of the Seoul National University Hospital and the Seoul National University Metropolitan Boramae Hospital and conformed to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients signed an informed consent before participation in this study.</p><p>Subjects were sequentially enrolled into once-daily dosing first or twice-daily dosing first group. Each group received 8-weeks of RPR once daily or twice daily and then without a washout period switched into twice daily or once daily dosing schedules for 8-weeks in an open label fashion (Figure&#x000a0;

RPR comes in even numbered sizes (2, 4, 8&#x000a0;mg/tablets). Therefore, upward adjustment of the RPR dose was made when needed in order not to break the RPR tablets. For example, when RIR was given at 9&#x000a0;mg/d, RPR was given at 10&#x000a0;mg/d. In twice daily dosing, we split the dose of the RPR into two doses and split into unequal doses when needed in order not to break the RPR tablets (for example, 10&#x000a0;mg into 6 and 4&#x000a0;mg, Table&#x000a0;
<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). First dosing of RPR was given with the first dosing of the other antiparkinsonian medications. The timing and dose of the second dosing was based on clinical decision, which was usually in the evening or in the late afternoon at a lower dosage.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Baseline characteristics</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" border="1"><colgroup><col align="left"/><col align="left"/><col align="left"/><col align="left"/><col align="left"/></colgroup><thead valign="top"><tr><th align="left">&#x000a0;</th><th align="left"><bold>QD&#x02009;&#x02192;&#x02009;BID (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;29)</bold></th><th align="left"><bold>BID&#x02009;&#x02192;&#x02009;QD (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;32)</bold></th><th align="left"><bold><italic>P </italic></bold><bold>Value</bold></th><th align="left"><bold>Overall (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;61)</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody valign="top"><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Age (years)<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">60.9&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;9.8<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">61.1&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;8.4<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.925<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">61.0&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;9.0<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Onset age<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">51.7&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;10.8<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">51.8&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;7.0<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.857<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">51.7&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;8.9<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sex (M:F)<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">11:18<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">13:19<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">1.000<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">24:37<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">mUPDRS<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">20.0&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;9.5<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">22.5&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;8.6<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.170<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">21.3&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;9.0<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Hoehn and Yahr stage<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">2.1&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.5<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">2.4&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.7<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.063<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">2.2&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.6<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Ropinirole PR dose after titration<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">8.9&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;5.6<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">11.0&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;5.7<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.128<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">10.0&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;5.7<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">LEDD<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">894.0&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;392.8<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">865.9&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;361.7<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.879<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">879.2&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;373.9<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Epworth Sleep Scale<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">6.1&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;5.5<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">6.2&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;5.9<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.353<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">6.1&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;5.6<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sleep questionnaire<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x02003;&#x000a0;Overall sleep quality<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">3.8&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2.6<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">2.9&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2.7<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.232<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">3.4&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2.7<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x02003;&#x000a0;Nocturnal off-symptoms<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">2.5&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2.8<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">3.4&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;3.7<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.659<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">3.0&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;3.3<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;&#x000a0;Early morning off symptoms</td><td align="left">2.9&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2.7</td><td align="left">3.0&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;3.9</td><td align="left">0.721</td><td align="left">3.0&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;3.8</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>QD, Once-daily;

The dose was titrated until an optimal therapeutic response was achieved or intolerable adverse effects disappeared. The dosing frequency was maintained during the titration phase. Once an optimal dose was achieved, the subject was maintained on that dose for the remainder of the treatment phase. Changes in other antiparkinsonian medications were not allowed. In the second period in each sequence, the titration of RPR was not allowed. However, if the subject complained of intolerable off-symptoms, dyskinesia or adverse effects, early completion was accepted after the last visit earlier than the planned 16&#x000a0;weeks.</p><p>Scheduled study visits were baseline and week 8 and 16. Patients were allowed to make non-scheduled visits when needed. At the baseline visit, all subjects were assessed with the Unified Parkinson&#x02019;s Disease Rating Scale part 3 (mUPDRS) and Hoehn and Yahr stage (H&#x00026;Y) with a medication-on state, sleep questionnaire including overall quality of sleep, nocturnal off symptoms and early morning motor symptom; Epworth Sleep Scale (ESS). In the sleep questionnaire, we used the visual analogue scale ranging from 0 (perfect imaginable quality of sleep) to 10 (worst imaginable quality of sleep).</p><p>After 8 and 16&#x000a0;weeks or at last visit for early completion, all assessments were repeated and the Patient&#x02019;s Global Impressions (PGI) and compliance to the prescribed doses were obtained. Medication compliance was recorded. During each period, mean compliance rates were calculated based on the total prescribed doses and total actually taken doses for all subjects during each period. Adverse events (AEs) and changes in wearing-off and dyskinesias were followed throughout the study. Preference for dosing schedule was asked at the completion of the study. The preference was assessed with a question: &#x0201c;which regimen do you prefer?&#x0201d; Available answers were &#x0201c;I prefer the once a day&#x0201d;; &#x0201c;I prefer the twice a day&#x0201d;; &#x0201c;I do not prefer one treatment over the other.&#x0201d; In addition, the reasons for the preference were also asked.</p><p>If subjects completed the study earlier than the completion of the second treatment period, they were asked for their preferences and evaluated at the discontinuation visit.

In general, it is prescribed as a once daily regimen. When patients switched from once-daily to twice-daily or twice-daily to once-daily, however, their mean mUPDRS, H&#x00026;Y, ESS, sleep quality and AEs were not statistically different. Despite the different dosing frequency, these findings indicate the same dose of RPR had a similar efficacy without an increase in AEs and was not inferior.</p><p>To check for bias of the sequence effect, we analyzed the outcomes based on the order. When the once-daily regimen was administered first (sequence 1&#x02009;&#x02192;&#x02009;2), 51.79% (15/29) of the patients preferred the twice-daily regimen. The proportion of subjects who preferred the twice-daily regimen more was 50% (16/32) when the twice-daily regimen was administered first (sequence 2&#x02009;&#x02192;&#x02009;1). Thus there was no sequence effect. We also did not find a sequence effect in the secondary outcome analysis.</p><p>For PGI-I, 50 patients reported improvement after RPR over the IR form of agonists. Admittedly, the dose was increased from 9.1&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;5.0&#x000a0;mg of the IR form of agonists to 10.7&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;6.2&#x000a0;mg of RPR. It is to be noted that we tried to optimize the medication with the available IR form of agonists balancing many factors such as motor fluctuation, dyskinesia and adverse effects. Therefore, it is definitely a benefit of RPR when the condition of patients&#x02019; improved even with the increased mean daily dose being within tolerance.</p><p>In our study, PD patients preferred the twice-daily regimen to the once-daily regimen (51% vs. 28%). In patients who preferred the twice-daily regimen, their main reasons were decreased severity of off symptoms or dyskinesia and decreased AEs. Especially for wearing-off duration, the PGI-I was significantly higher in twice-daily regimen. Thus, we should consider the twice daily regimen with its reduced severity of symptoms or decreased intolerable AEs for antiparkinsonian medications.</p><p>When patients chose the once-daily regimen, their main reason was improved on quality and decreased off symptoms or dyskinesia. Thus, we should consider the once daily regimen preferentially for young patients who are active workers in the daytime or have diphasic dyskinesia.</p><p>We expected changes in sleep quality and daytime sleepiness between the two regimens. However, there were no significant differences between the once-daily and twice-daily regimens.</p><p>As can be seen in the time window of the ropinirole level from Tompson et al.
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], the nocturnal concentration may be lower in the once daily RPR than the three times daily RIR. The down sloping of the ropinirole level was designed taking into consideration natural dopaminergic stimulation and improvement in nocturnal side effects including insomnia and hallucinations. Additionally, the reason was not fully explained by the time window of the ropinirole level in the steady state. However, multiple dosing of RPR may provide even better control in some patients.</p><p>Although patients showed no differences in their mean mUPDRS, H&#x00026;Y, ESS, sleep quality and AEs, more patients preferred the twice-daily regimen and their main reason was more tolerable off-symptoms. Three of our study patients preferred the twice-daily regimen due to psychological stability, and decreased anxiety due to reduced off symptoms. This finding shows that psychological factors may explain the preference. Patients in this study previously maintained dopaminergic therapy with multiple dosing. They endured off symptoms and have fear of them. Therefore, as an ostensible reason of preference, they chose &#x0201c;more tolerable off-symptoms&#x0201d;, however the real reason would be &#x0201c;decreased anxiety due to reduced off symptoms.&#x0201d;</p><p>In antiparkinsonian medication, once daily dosing may improve compliance and achieve the desired outcome
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Four patients chose the once daily regimen due to convenience. However, almost all PD patients are taking multiple antiparkinsonian medications many times a day. Thus, compliance may not be a big issue especially for advanced PD patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this study, RPR was able to achieve improvement over the IR form of agonists.
