In control clusters, routine vector control activities were performed. The intervention delivered first, LLIN curtains (from July to August 2013) and secondly, water container covers (from October to March 2014). Cross-sectional entomological surveys were carried out at baseline (February 2013 to June 2013), 9 weeks after the first intervention (August to October 2013), and 4&#x02013;6 weeks after the second intervention (March to April 2014).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Curtains were installed in 922 households and water container covers in 303 households. The Breteau index (BI) fell from 14 to 6 in the intervention group and from 8 to 5 in the control group. The additional intervention with LLIN covers for water containers showed a significant reduction in pupae per person index (PPI) (p=0.01). In the intervention group, the PPI index showed a clear decline of 71% compared with 25% in the control group. Costs were high but options for cost savings were identified.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Short term impact evaluation indicates that the intervention package can reduce dengue vector density but sustained effect will depend on multiple factors.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>Aedes</italic></kwd><kwd>Colombia</kwd><kwd>Dengue</kwd><kwd>Long-lasting insecticide-treated nets</kwd><kwd>Public health</kwd><kwd>Randomised controlled trial</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>In Colombia, around 26 million people (55% of the entire population) are at risk of contracting dengue.<sup><xref rid="TRU208C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Transmission has increased over the past two decades and recent outbreaks in 2010 and 2013 had higher case numbers than in previous years.<sup><xref rid="TRU208C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> The estimated economic burden of dengue disease for Colombia is US$292 for ambulatory cases and US$1975 for severe dengue cases.<sup><xref rid="TRU208C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Prevention and reduction of the burden of disease rest upon vector control.

Two groups of clusters were defined: one of 16 and the other of 4. Clusters were randomly allocated within the two groups based on a public raffle.

The design depended on the dimensions and shapes of the water containers. For cylindrical tanks, PermaNet 2.0 circular lids were made by seamstress with an elastic band and waterproof material for fixing. Square and rectangular covers consisted of aluminium frames with a sliding mechanism fixed to PermaNet 2.0 and were made and installed by small to medium enterprises (SMEs).

They were fixed by homeowners with a white string and two nails beneath existing curtains (in some homes) and usually supervised by research staff. At least one door per house and all unprotected and in-use windows were covered. However, it was not possible to cover the openings above windows if present (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="TRU208F2">2</xref>A).</p><p>The second intervention, water container covers, were implemented in the same houses that were previously allocated to curtains, 8 months after baseline surveys.

In addition a t student test, weighted by cluster size was used to estimate CIs of the effect. Differences between three points were considered for the estimation: between baseline and first follow-up (curtains); between baseline and second follow-up (curtains and container covers); and between first and second follow-ups (see Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="TRU208F3">3</xref>). For the first follow-up 20 clusters were included in the analysis.

Baseline data were collected from 1680 (92.1%) houses, first follow-up data for 1572 (86.1%) and 1317 (72.2%) for the second follow-up (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="TRU208F3">3</xref>). For all follow-ups houses were revisited at least three times to maximise participation.</p><p>During the study period the total rainfall was 761 mm; the month with highest rainfall was May (22.4 mm) and the driest was July (9.2 mm). The majority of pupae collected from baseline surveys were <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> from 189 containers of 5745 inspected. Therefore, all immature stages during follow-ups were assumed to be of this species. The majority of breeding sites were found to be indoors; the most common breeding sites were large water containers (2236, 38.9% of all breeding sites) and the most important in pupal production were albercas 1 and 2 which yielded 3006 pupae (69.5% of all pupae collected (n=4327) and low tanks that yielded 349 (8.1%). This trend remained relatively consistent after interventions were introduced and similar in both intervention and control clusters. Breeding sites like discarded and miscellaneous containers did not increase during follow-ups, which coincided with rainy seasons (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="TRU208TB2">2</xref>).

The first intervention with LLIN curtains in windows and doors achieved only an incomplete coverage of other household holes. Nevertheless, a significant reduction in BI in the intervention clusters was encountered when compared to control clusters; differences were not significant for PPI as a proxy for adult vector densities. This could be explained by changes in oviposition site selection.<sup><xref rid="TRU208C26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> Curtains may have produced changes in a small fraction of the adult mosquito population as a physical barrier or as a consequence of the demonstrated repellent and deterrent effects of pyrethroids.<sup><xref rid="TRU208C27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> As incomplete coverage was achieved many mosquitoes may have escaped and successfully oviposture in the most productive container (low water containers) as reflected in the PPI.</p><p>The combination of LLIN curtains with targeted interventions on the main productive water containers showed a significant reduction in vector densities when measured through PPI. If a mosquito was able to escape the effects of the curtains, they would still encounter difficulties in laying eggs and, even if successful, the emerging mosquitoes would be killed by treated container covers. This underlines the importance of combined vector control strategies. According to the computer simulation models developed by Focks et al.<sup><xref rid="TRU208C28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> the pupal density of PPI=0.26 in intervention clusters (compared to a PPI=0.36 in control clusters) was below the threshold of epidemic dengue transmission when considering a temperature of 30&#x000b0;C and a seroprevalence of 66%.</p><p>Our result is similar to a study from Guatemala<sup><xref rid="TRU208C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> where LLIN window curtains alone resulted in a non-significant reduction in dengue vector density but, in combination with a targeted intervention in productive container types, resulted in a significant decrease. Kroeger et al.<sup><xref rid="TRU208C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> found in Mexico and Venezuela&#x02014;where windows could be completely covered with insecticide-treated curtains&#x02014;that these significantly reduced vector densities in intervention clusters, and that there was a clear spillover effect in the contact areas of intervention and control clusters.</p><p>In our study, there were several factors potentially contributing to a reduced effectiveness of the intervention: the continued actions of the vector control programme in both control and intervention clusters; the neglect of many unprotected holes in the walls; peoples' habit of &#x02018;folding&#x02019; the curtains during the heat of the day; and the influx of <italic>Aedes</italic> from the unprotected surrounding areas of the intervention clusters</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Feasibility</title><p>Our study did show that the intervention package was effective in reducing PPI, but the feasibility of any control programme does require additional elements such as people's, satisfaction with the control services, and affordable costs.</p><p>Acceptance was achieved by the use of participatory strategies reported by Garc&#x000ed;a-Betancourt et al.<sup><xref rid="TRU208C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> Partnerships were established among local authorities, vector control services and the community. Satisfaction towards intervention was enhanced as people observed the dead insects below the curtains, which convinced them of its efficacy. This is similar to the findings reported in Hait&#x000ed;,<sup><xref rid="TRU208C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Venezuela<sup><xref rid="TRU208C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> and the Guatemala study.<sup><xref rid="TRU208C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Yet in spite of people's positive perceptions, after some time they forgot about the benefits of the interventions and stopped using them: this means that there is a need for continued encouragement and monitoring of the intervention programme to sustain LLIN coverage which has a coverage-dependent effect on vector densities, as reported by Vanlerberghe et al.<sup><xref rid="TRU208C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup></p><p>Based on the preliminary results of the intervention, vector control staff and local policy makers were very much in favour of continuing the novel vector control tool. National decision makers expressed an interest in financing the extension of the study to larger parts of the city and measuring whether reductions in dengue incidence could be achieved.</p><p>As a general rule, community-based interventions require more time and resources than conventional institution-based interventions because of longer socialisation and negotiation processes that are needed to achieve social participation and to respond to community expectations. The median costs of the intervention package in Girardot were US$48 per household: considerable if compared with similar interventions implemented in other countries. Rizzo et al.<sup><xref rid="TRU208C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> reported a median cost of US$5.31 per household for the same intervention package in Guatemala, excluding the costs of the netting materials that were donated. Baly et al.<sup><xref rid="TRU208C29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> estimated median costs of US$8.84 and US$6.68 per household cover with LLINs in Venezuela and Thailand, respectively, also excluding the costs of the LLIN materials. However, the cost savings by families where dengue cases have been averted are also substantial. A recent study showed that households have out-of-pocket expenditure for dengue prevention of US$13.27 but an indirect cost of US$197.10 for dengue outpatients.<sup><xref rid="TRU208C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Thus, the median costs of the intervention in our study are high, but when compared to local out-of-pocket expenditures or indirect costs, the investment in the described intervention package seems to be warranted.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Limitations</title><p>Our impact evaluation is based on a short observation period; we do not know for how long after a 5 and 12 month observation period the effect will be sustainable. The efficacy, along with other vector control tools, will depend on multiple factors such as appropriate actions of social mobilisation to achieve long lasting behaviours, positive perceptions, perceived effectiveness, durability of materials used for interventions, coverage attained and local contextual and environmental conditions. However, the preliminary results are encouraging for policy makers.</p><p>Baseline and follow-up surveys took longer than initially planned, spreading over 3 months, as some houses were only occupied during holiday seasons, therefore field workers spent extra time revisiting empty houses to ensure participation. This could have biased our results as infestation rates can change according to season. However, our previous study<sup><xref rid="TRU208C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> demonstrated that pupal productivity is independent of rainfall, as no significant differences were found between seasons. Indoor low water container covers alone produce more than 70% of <italic>Aedes</italic> pupae during the wet and dry season and there are very few productive water containers outdoors.</p><p>Working with local seamstresses and SMEs that produced the aluminium frames for covering water tanks was beneficial. However, in the case of the container covers, SMEs were not prepared for such a high workload and resource utilisation. Therefore, frequent interruptions between measuring water container size and installation of covers were the rule.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The results obtained in our study indicate that the intervention package can reduce dengue vector density. However, this success, as well as all vector control tools, will depend on multiple factors. Successful and adequate use of the intervention packages should be enhanced through appropriate social mobilisation to achieve long-lasting behavioural change.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p><bold>Authors' contributions:</bold> JQ and GC conceived the study; JQ and GC designed the study protocol; TGB, DG and LA coordinated field work and data recollection; JQ, CGU, SC, TGB, LA and DG analysed and contributed to data interpretation; JQ drafted the manuscript; HB advised the development and analysis of entomological components; CGU, GC and HB critically revised the manuscript for intellectual content.
