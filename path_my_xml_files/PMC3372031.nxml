Thirty neonates were enrolled from September 2007 to September 2008. The first group received oral rhEPO and Fe and the second, subcutaneous rhEPO and Fe.

Jull et al. has observed that rhEPO found in mother's milk is produced by mammary glands and is secreted into milk.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>] It has been observed that the level of rhEPO is added to mother's milk as standard formula milk under conditions similar to that of the stomach or intestine remaining constant, but rhEPO added to 5% dextrose serum, undergoes digestion.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]</p><p>Erythropoietin has many properties and its receptors are found on liver, endothelial, smooth muscle, placenta, brain and testis cells as well as on cardiomyocytes and erythrocytes.</p><p>We know that blood brain barrier and blood testis barrier prevent the passage of this hormone; it is possible that rhEPO is synthesized in these organs for reasons other than erythropoises.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>] Since 1985, when rhEPO was available in market, it was used in the prevention and the treatment of anemia of prematurity. It has some side effects that were reported in neonates.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]</p><p>According to Ahmadpoor et al. study, rhEPO can decrease incidence of anemia of prematurity and its complications. In Ballin&#x02019;s study,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>] premature neonates received only Fe drops and 6 other neonates were administered Fe drops and rhEPO.</p><p>In the rhEPO group, no complication was reported and serum level of rhEPO and reticulocyte number increased significantly. Ferritin level decreased, but the need for transfusion did not decrease.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>] Although it has been approved that rhEPO plays a role in the prevention of prematurity anemia, but in most clinical trials, rhEPO was administrated intravenously or subcutaneously (IV, SQ). Few studies were carried out to determine the effectiveness of rhEPO in prevention of prematurity anemia and even they had controversial results.</p><p>In this study, we compared the effect of oral rhEPO with subcutaneous rhEPO and investigate its effectiveness in prevention of anemia of prematurity. We have evaluated a simple and more suitable way for prevention of anemia of prematurity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This study is a randomized clinical trial, in which 30 neonates having the qualifications of the study, were studied from first September 2007 to 1st September 2008 in Quaem Hospital in Mashhad (Iran).

In Ohls&#x02019;s study, treatment with oral and IV EPO was effective in preventing the decrease of Hb and HCT to the level of anemia of prematurity (&#x0003c;7 mg/dl) so that neither groups had a Hb less than 7 g/dL in the 4th week after birth.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]</p><p>In the oral EPO group, average of Hb in 4th week was 9.7&#x000b1;1.9 g/dL in the IV EPO group, which shows a significant statistical difference (p&#x0003c;0.001). However we can say that IV EPO was more effective than the oral form. If we notice that in the oral rhEPO group, the Hb level was less than the IV group, we can say that" It is probable that oral rhEPO is as effective as IV rhEPO since the fall in Hb in the two groups in 4th week did not have much difference.</p><p>In our study, similar amount of blood was withdrawn from the two groups before and during the investigation period, but the need for transfusion in the oral rhEPO group was more. We performed blood transfusion on 3 neonates of the oral rhEPO group (20%) and one neonate in the subcutaneous rhEPO group (6%).</p><p>On the other hand, according to various studies showing that 50% of neonates had birth weight less than 500 g, there was a need for multiple transfusions of packed cells. So oral and subcutaneous rhEPO were effective in decreasing the need for blood transfusion.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>] In a prospective study in which 6 neonates did not receive rhEPO, it was shown that rhEPO could not increase erythropoiesis.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]</p><p>Ballin et al. showed that rhEPO mixed with milk and administrated orally could increase erythropoesis in premature neonates. Serum erythropoietin level and reticulocytes could increase the level of ferritin which shows that Fe stores were depleted in order to be used in Hb synthesis.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]</p><p>Similar results were obtained in our study as in the oral rhEPO group, the Hb level at birth and 4th weeks after treatment showed a significant difference. Of course, serum erythropoietin level and reticulocyte count were not obtained in our study. Britten et al. reported that in 6 neonates who received 1000 u/kg oral rhEPO for 10 days, high levels of serum rhEPO two hours after administrating the drug were recognized. Although oral rhEPO increased erythropoesis, but the need to packed cell transfusion did not decrease.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>] These results matches with our results since in our study 3 out of 15 neonates needed packed cell transfusion. A retrospective study was conducted by Ledbetter in order to study the effect of rhEPO on human GI system.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]</p><p>Neonates having a 1250 g birth weight and admitted to their NICU between the years 1993 and 1997, and 260 neonates received rhEPO and another 233 neonates were allocated as a control group. The incidence of NEC following treatment decreased (4.61% compared to 10.76%, p&#x0003c;0.05).</p><p>Gestational age in treated neonates was less than control group (26.8&#x000b1;2.1 compared to 27.6 &#x000b1;2.9 weeks, p&#x0003c;0.05). Birth weight, APGAR of 1st minute and gender prevalence were not different in 2 groups. It was shown that in premature neonates with 500-1250 g birth weight, the incidence of NEC in the rhEPO receiving group was less. Feeding intolerance (residue increase) and vomiting were not observed in neonates receiving oral rhEPO.9 Although in our study the effects on GI system were not investigated but in this study orally EPO prevented prematurity anemia. In this investigation, it was shown that rhEPO administration (400 u/kg) either orally or subcutaneously in the 4th week of birth prevented the incidence of prematurity anemia. However, better results were obtained in the subcutaneous EPO group.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are thankful from Mashhad University of Medical Sciences for supporting this study.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of interest: </bold>None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ballin</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Bilker-Reich</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>ArbeL</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Davidovitz</surname><given-names>y</given-names></name><name><surname>kohelelet</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Enythropoietin, given entrally, stimulates erythroiesis in prematune infants</article-title><source>Lancet</source><year>1999</year><volume>353</volume><fpage>1849</fpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/S0140-6736(99)01222-2</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">10359412</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="R2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Behrman</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Kliegman</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name></person-group><source>Nelson Textbook of Pediatrics Vol-1. 16 ed</source><year>2008</year><fpage>536</fpage><lpage>563</lpage><publisher-loc>WB.
