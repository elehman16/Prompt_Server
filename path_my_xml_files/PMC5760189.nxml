Increasing physical activity has shown some promise as a strategy for improving cessation outcomes. However, initial efficacy studies focused on intensive, highly structured exercise programs that may not be applicable to the general population of smokers. We describe the rationale and study design and report baseline participant characteristics from the Lifestyle Enhancement Program (LEAP), a two-group, randomized controlled trial. Adult smokers who engaged in low levels of leisure time physical activity were randomly assigned to treatment conditions consisting of an individualized physical activity intervention delivered by health fitness instructors in community-based exercise facilities or an equal contact wellness control. All participants received standard cognitive behavioral smoking cessation counseling combined with nicotine replacement therapy. The primary outcomes are seven-day point prevalence abstinence at seven weeks, six- and 12 months. Secondary outcomes include self-reported physical activity, dietary intake, body mass index, waist circumference, percent body fat, and nicotine withdrawal symptoms. Participants consist of 392 sedentary smokers (mean [standard deviation] age&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;44.6 [10.2]&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;years; 62% female; 31% African American). Results reported here provide information regarding experiences recruiting smokers willing to change multiple health behaviors including smoking and physical activity.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Smoking cessation</kwd><kwd>Physical activity</kwd><kwd>Randomized controlled trial</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0010">Despite notable reductions in cigarette use, 15% of the U.S. adult population continues to smoke <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>.

In addition, interventions often suffered from insufficient &#x0201c;dose&#x0201d; of activity, poor adherence to physical activity prescriptions, and lack of sustainable programming. Studies also varied substantially in both cessation treatment (e.g., number of treatment sessions and use of pharmacotherapy) and physical activity parameters (e.g., initiation relative to quit date, intensity, instructional format and location of the exercise) <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.

Although this has allowed for carefully-controlled evaluations of the efficacy of vigorous exercise for smoking cessation, it may not be an optimal strategy to maximize treatment effectiveness in community settings <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Additionally, trials generally have not encouraged participants to engage in short bouts of activity outside of supervised exercise sessions as a way to cope with withdrawal symptoms and urges to smoke, although this is likely to be helpful <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Programs have also not usually provided the resources or skills to optimally maintain long-term adherence to physical activity goals. Finally, access to exercise resources typically has been offered for a short duration and is terminated once the intervention is completed.</p><p id="p0030">Given the potential to more effectively disseminate physical activity programming as an aid to smoking cessation in community settings <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, LEAP was designed to evaluate whether the efficacy of structured leisure-time moderate-intensity physical activity can be enhanced by using a more flexible treatment approach of longer duration (one year). The physical activity intervention included individual fitness instruction, cognitive-behavioral skills training, and delivery of the physical activity intervention in convenient and accessible community-based facilities (YMCAs). Physical activity programming was integrated as an adjunct to standard smoking cessation treatment (behavioral counseling and nicotine patch) and was compared to a wellness intervention that was matched on contact frequency.

Individuals interested in participating completed a brief pre-screen by telephone to determine whether they met basic study requirements based on self-reported age, smoking status, physical activity level, health status, plans to remain in the area for the next year, and current pregnancy or plans to attempt pregnancy. Recruitment was initiated in June of 2004 and continued until May of 2007. Enrollment was stopped at the point when there would not be sufficient time in the funding cycle to complete follow-up assessments. The top three sources for recruiting eligible randomized participants were newspaper ads (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;134), television (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;71), and word-of-mouth referrals (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;71).</p><p id="p0055">Those who passed the phone screen were scheduled for the first of two in-person baseline screening visits. Study procedures were explained, informed consent was obtained, and a baseline assessment was completed, which included demographics and several self-report instruments. Because smoking cessation treatment included nicotine replacement therapy (both groups) and one intervention condition involved physical activity, a medical history and physical examination were performed by a study physician at the second screening visit. The examination included assessment of vital signs and an electrocardiogram. A urine pregnancy test was given to any eligible female participant who had the potential to be pregnant. All participants then underwent a maximal, symptom-limited exercise tolerance test (ETT) to screen for occult coronary artery disease. Individuals with positive ETT results <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref> (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;26) were deemed ineligible and were referred to their personal physician for follow-up. Positive ETT results included &#x02265;1&#x000a0;mm ST segment depression or elevation in one or more leads during maximum exercise or during the recovery period, angina pectoris during exercise, arrhythmia, syncope, or an abnormal blood pressure response to exercise such as hypotension or severe hypertension.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.4"><label>2.4</label><title>Randomization</title><p id="p0060">Eligible participants next attended a Randomization Visit during which laboratory measures (height, weight, body fat, blood pressure) were collected along with a seven-day physical activity recall <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, which was obtained by interview.

Sessions were delivered by bachelors-level health and fitness instructors (HFI) with backgrounds in exercise science or health promotion who were cross-trained to deliver both interventions and trained in cognitive-behavioral counseling strategies. The HFIs were supervised weekly by study co-investigators and monitored for quality control by review of audiotaped sessions.</p><p id="p0070">Participants assigned to the physical activity condition received a combined smoking cessation/physical activity intervention which included 16 face-to-face counseling sessions targeting increased physical activity, 11 telephone counseling sessions, and 11 supportive mailings, for a total of 38 intervention contacts. Except for the seven-week and six-month visits, which were conducted in a university setting, all in-person visits occurred at the YMCA. Participants in the wellness condition received the same smoking cessation intervention plus a general wellness program which included eight face-to-face sessions, 12 telephone calls, and 18 follow up mailings, for a total of 38 intervention contacts, all occurring in a university setting. Although the physical activity and wellness interventions were equated with regard to the number of contacts (38), it is important to note that the number of face-to-face contacts differed between conditions (16 versus eight). To the extent that the type of contact may be associated with the success of the intervention, this could impact study outcomes. Face-to-face sessions lasted 60&#x02013;75&#x000a0;min during the initial four weeks of the program and 60&#x000a0;min subsequently. Phone counseling sessions lasted approximately 20&#x000a0;min.</p><p id="p0075">The face-to-face counseling sessions were conducted on a relapse sensitive schedule and occurred more frequently early in the program with progressively longer intervals between sessions over the course of the year. As shown in the <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Table</xref>, early sessions occurred twice weekly (weeks one and two of the program), then weekly (weeks 3&#x02013;8), bi-monthly (9&#x02013;12), monthly (weeks 13&#x02013;18), and bi-monthly (weeks 19&#x02013;42). The smoking cessation and physical activity/wellness interventions were started simultaneously. The target quit date was scheduled three weeks after the physical activity or wellness intervention began to allow participants to begin mastering one set of behavioral skills before a second set was introduced.</p><p id="p0080">The primary purpose of the telephone contacts was to provide ongoing follow-up in a cost-effective manner by reviewing progress, providing support, and assisting the participant with problem solving and establishing new goals. HFIs used the calls to identify and intervene early on smoking relapse, assess nicotine patch adherence and side effects, provide cognitive-behavioral coping skills, and offer on-going feedback regarding physical activity or wellness goals and to review materials and information delivered during the face-to-face sessions.</p><p id="p0085">Mailings sent to both treatment groups included a quarterly project newsletter as well as pamphlets about smoking cessation topics.

Participants received six weeks of transdermal nicotine, commencing on the date of their quit attempt. A gradual dose tapering strategy was used, with the initial patch dose based on baseline cigarette consumption.

The cessation intervention was delivered primarily during four face-to-face sessions, with brief follow-ups occurring during other in-person and telephone sessions. The first smoking cessation session (during Week 3) occurred one week before the scheduled quit date and focused on preparing to quit and managing the first days as a nonsmoker. In addition to quitting rituals and building support, using the &#x0201c;Five A's&#x0201d; (Anticipate [high risk situations], Avoid, Alter, Alternatives, and Active) were emphasized, as well as self-monitoring of cigarette smoking. The second smoking cessation counseling session (Week 4) occurred one week after the quit attempt and involved providing support and addressed both problem solving and coping with negative emotions. A telephone counseling call occurred approximately four days after the quit attempt to provide support during the acute cessation period. The third counseling session occurred during Week 5 and included problem solving, assessment of patch use, and coping with negative cognitions. The fourth smoking cessation session, which occurred at Week 7 (three weeks after the target quit date), included a review of participants' progress, an assessment patch use, and relapse prevention. Additional topics included in these sessions were medication issues (e.g., adherence, side effects), assertiveness, and building social support.

The physical activity intervention included 1) supervised/planned leisure-time exercise sessions, 2) &#x0201c;lifestyle activity&#x0201d; (activity which occurs in the context of working, transportation, raising children, etc.), and 3) short bouts (&#x02265;10&#x000a0;min) of physical activity, as needed, to manage urges to smoke and other withdrawal symptoms. Each of these types of activity was included to promote cessation through different mechanisms. For example, structured exercise promotes overall fitness levels, which was hypothesized to reduce smoking and facilitate cessation, while lifestyle activity increases overall activity levels, which was similarly thought to aid quitting. Finally, brief bouts of activity were included as a strategy for managing acute cigarette cravings.

consumed a mean of 21 (9.5) cigarettes/day and had been smoking for approximately 23.8 (10.7) years. The majority (56.2%) had tried to quit 1&#x02013;5 times in the past; only 11% had never made a quit attempt. Of those who had made a previous quit attempt, most attributed their lack of success to the urge or need to have a cigarette (73%) and the difficulty in quitting the habit (58%).

Eighty-six percent of participants were in the preparation stage of change for smoking cessation at the time of enrollment, indicating that they were starting to take steps to modify their smoking behavior.

Overall, 63.3% of participants met criteria for overweight, while 32.1% met criteria for obesity. Based on waist circumference, 43% of men and 62% of women exhibited abdominal obesity. Mean (SD) body fat percent was 32.5 (9.6)%. Participants' mean (SD) waist circumference was 96.5 (15.4) cm. Approximately 55% of participants met criteria for abdominal obesity, defined as waist circumference &#x0003e;88&#x000a0;cm for women and &#x0003e;102&#x000a0;cm for men <xref rid="bib87" ref-type="bibr">[87]</xref>.

The proportions of energy intake that came from carbohydrate and protein sources were 47.4% and 15.3%, respectively. Results from the Seven-Day Physical Activity Recall indicated means of 88&#x000a0;min of moderate-, 33&#x000a0;min of hard-, and 3&#x000a0;min of very hard-intensity leisure-`time physical activity per week. Although those assigned to the physical activity intervention had slightly higher levels of baseline activity than those in the wellness condition, differences were not statistically significant (all <italic>p's</italic> &#x0003e; <italic>0.10</italic>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4"><label>4</label><title>Discussion</title><p id="p0240">This study was designed to evaluate the impact of physical activity as an adjunct to standard smoking cessation treatment consisting of cognitive behavioral smoking cessation counseling and nicotine replacement therapy. Although evidence supports the benefits of exercise for alleviating acute nicotine withdrawal and craving among those undergoing temporary abstinence, and one prior trial found vigorous structured group exercise to be associated with increased long-term cessation in women, little is known about whether a more flexible and personalized approach to increasing physical activity improves treatment outcomes.</p><p id="p0245">The recruitment goal for the study was largely achieved, with 98% of the targeted sample size enrolled in the trial. To achieve this sample size, however, the study required a lengthy enrollment period of approximately three years. Furthermore, a high proportion of those who initially expressed interest were excluded or dropped prior to randomization. While many (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;881) were excluded because they did not meet all eligibility criteria, a large number were either active (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;81) or passive refusals (i.e., cancelled or failed to show for a screening visit; <italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1171). Ultimately, only 16% of those who requested more information about the project were randomized to treatment conditions. Although the reasons for the high attrition rate are not readily apparent, the large number of required study visits and focus on multiple domains of health behavior change may have reduced interest among some smokers.</p><p id="p0250">Compared to prior trials of physical activity as an aid to smoking cessation, the sample was relatively diverse with regard to gender (38% male) and race (31% African American). The sample was slightly overrepresented with middle-aged, heavy smokers with a long history of cigarette use. Participants evidenced high levels of both confidence in their ability to quit and motivation for smoking cessation.</p><p id="p0255">By design, the sample was largely sedentary. To be eligible for the study, all participants at baseline were screened to engage in no more than 3 days/week of 30&#x000a0;min of moderate intensity activity and no more than 1 day per week of 30&#x000a0;min of vigorous intensity activity. Prior to intervention, and using a more sensitive assessment tool (the 7-day PAR), only 24% reported that they accumulated the recommended 150&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;minutes of moderate to vigorous leisure-time activity in the prior week. Among US adults in 2005, when data for the current study were collected, 49% of adults reported getting either 150&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;minutes of physical activity per week or 60&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;minutes of vigorous activity <xref rid="bib88" ref-type="bibr">[88]</xref>. Although these estimates were obtained based on different measures and are therefore not directly comparable, they do suggest that participants in the study were slightly less active overall than the general population. Nevertheless, these results indicate that nearly a quarter of participants' baseline activity levels exceeded target levels for the study, despite meeting entry criteria at the time of screening. Although this could reflect behavioral reactivity to the initial phone screen or a desire to increase one's activity in response to enrolling in the study, it also may be because the initial screening instrument consisted of a brief, two-item assessment, whereas subsequent measures were based on a more detailed physical activity interview (i.e., Seven-day Physical Activity Recall). Considering that the interview is likely to be a more valid indicator of physical activity than the brief, two-item screen, some of the participants may have been more active than the target group for this information. We chose not to exclude non-sedentary participants because this would have made our randomized treatment arms non-comparable. Future studies targeting physical activity should consider this issue when assessing eligibility.</p><p id="p0260">Findings regarding the proportion of participants that met criteria for overweight, obesity, and abdominal obesity are generally consistent with characteristics of the general US population at the time the study was conducted. Considering that quitting smoking is typically associated with increases in body weight and body fat, some participants may be at elevated risk for certain health problems due to post-cessation weight gain. Whether physical activity helps to mitigate the amount of weight gain that participants experience will be investigated as a secondary outcome.</p><p id="p0265">The mean score on the CES-D was 12.5 (<italic>SD</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;9.9).

Given the elevated rates of depression in smokers relative to non-smokers <xref rid="bib91" ref-type="bibr">[91]</xref>, <xref rid="bib92" ref-type="bibr">[92]</xref> and the increased prevalence of smoking in patients with a history of depression <xref rid="bib93" ref-type="bibr">[93]</xref>, <xref rid="bib94" ref-type="bibr">[94]</xref>, this finding is not particularly surprising. Notably, 27% of participants scored at or above the cut-off commonly used to identify those with probable depression, a rate that is approximately double that reported in large population samples and cohort studies <xref rid="bib89" ref-type="bibr">[89]</xref>, <xref rid="bib90" ref-type="bibr">[90]</xref>, <xref rid="bib95" ref-type="bibr">[95]</xref>.

Considerable evidence supports the benefits of acute bouts of physical activity for reducing craving and nicotine withdrawal, at least during periods of temporary abstinence. Furthermore, although highly structured, vigorous-intensity activity conducted in a group setting has been shown to increase cessation rates in women out to one year <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, most studies investigating the impact of physical activity have failed to demonstrate long-term effects. LEAP was specifically designed to address many of the limitations associated with prior trials. By providing smokers with personalized instruction delivered in convenient locations in their community, and allowing considerable flexibility regarding the nature, intensity, and frequency of activities that they can choose to engage in, it is hoped that physical activity adherence and maintenance will be increased, thereby enhancing the potential benefits of regular activity for smokers attempting to quit. The results of LEAP will provide important insights about how to most effectively promote physical activity as an adjunctive treatment for smokers attempting cessation.</p></sec><sec id="sec6"><title>Trial registration</title><p id="p0275">ClinicalTrials.gov identifier number NCT00403312.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebib0010"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Jamal</surname><given-names>A.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Current cigarette smoking among adults - United States, 2005-2015</article-title><source>MMWR Morb.
