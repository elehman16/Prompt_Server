Traditional SCS produces tonic waveforms in which pulses are delivered at a consistent frequency, pulse width, and amplitude. New technological developments using alternate waveforms to stimulate the dorsal column and/or aim at new stimulation targets show promising results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Burst stimulation, in particular, is a waveform that delivers groups of pulses at a high frequency and at amplitudes much lower than tonic stimulation; these groups of pulses are separated by a pulse-free period called an interburst interval during which passive repolarization occurs prior to the next burst. This pattern was chosen because this burst waveform mimics naturally occurring neuronal firing in the central nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>The use of the burst waveform in SCS for the treatment of chronic pain was first reported in 2010 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Since that time, reports from multiple, relatively small, clinical studies have shown that burst stimulation provides effective pain control, which, in some patients, may surpass the pain relief provided by tonic stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In these studies, the additional pain reduction during burst stimulation was relatively only marginally smaller compared with tonic stimulation results, but burst stimulation was preferred by a majority of patients in spite of the similar pain-reducing profile. Some evidence indicates that burst stimulation may provide a salvage therapy option for patients who fail to achieve adequate pain control with tonic stimulation or for those in whom the initial efficacy of tonic stimulation is lost over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>A common element in all previous clinical studies is the marked reduction or total absence of paresthesia during burst stimulation. Tonic stimulation is predicated on the use of paresthesiae to &#x0201c;cover&#x0201d; painful areas, and little evidence has been reported for efficacious therapy when tonic stimulation is delivered at subperception levels. Alternatively, burst stimulation appears to produce paresthesia in only a subset of patients, approximately 17&#x02013;25% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], and anecdotal reports indicate that paresthesiae during burst stimulation may be qualitatively different from those experienced during tonic stimulation. Perceptual difference in the patient experience may exert an indirect influence on patient-reported outcomes.</p><p>To date, the mechanisms and clinical effects of the burst waveform have been mainly studied in small cohorts of patients in Europe and Australia over a short duration (e.g., 2&#x02013;4 weeks). Larger, longer-term, controlled clinical studies of the burst waveform are lacking. Burst stimulation has not yet been approved for use in the U.S. Here, we report the study methods for an ongoing multicenter, cross-over, randomized controlled study designed to gain United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for burst stimulation (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT02011893).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Objectives</title><p>Under an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE), the objective of the study (protocol C-12-07 ver 8.28.14) is to demonstrate safety and efficacy for burst stimulation. As such, the study examines burst stimulation compared to the traditional SCS stimulation mode (tonic stimulation). The primary objective of the study is to establish noninferiority of pain intensity after 3&#x000a0;months of burst compared to 3&#x000a0;months of tonic stimulation. Previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] indicated that burst stimulation was preferred by most subjects even when the magnitude of pain relief was similar. Therefore, the primary objective of noninferiority of pain intensity will establish the therapy as comparable for pain relief to traditional tonic stimulation, and secondary objectives (listed below) will examine the superiority of pain relief and other outcomes that may elucidate the patient experience of burst stimulation.</p><p>Secondary objectives are:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>To demonstrate differences between tonic and burst stimulation in responder rate</p></list-item><list-item><p>To demonstrate significant differences in the presence of paresthesia during tonic stimulation and burst stimulation</p></list-item><list-item><p>To demonstrate that pain relief using burst stimulation is superior to pain relief using tonic stimulation</p></list-item><list-item><p>To demonstrate differences between tonic and burst stimulation adverse events</p></list-item><list-item><p>To demonstrate differences between tonic and burst stimulation for quality of life</p></list-item><list-item><p>To demonstrate differences between tonic and burst stimulation for worst pain</p></list-item><list-item><p>To demonstrate differences between tonic and burst stimulation for function</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>Additional analyses will examine these objectives after 12&#x000a0;months of therapy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Trial design</title><p>The study consists of two distinct phases: (1) a 24-week controlled (cross-over) phase during which participants are randomly assigned to one of two treatment sequences of tonic and burst stimulation, each for 12&#x000a0;weeks and (2) an open-label phase during which participants may use either waveform (see Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). With guidance from the FDA, the study employs enrichment strategies aimed at decreasing variability and assessing the efficacy of burst compared to an approved SCS waveform. As such, participants are limited to those who achieve adequate pain relief during a traditional tonic stimulation trial evaluation; all participants use both waveforms in a within-subject cross-over design.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Study design.

</p><p>At up to 20 centers in the U.S., Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval is obtained (refer to its &#x0201c;Declarations&#x0201d; page), and eligible enrolled participants undergo additional screening and participate in a standard SCS trial evaluation using tonic stimulation. Those with a successful SCS trial evaluation are implanted with the Prodigy&#x02122; neurostimulation system (St. Jude Medical, Plano, TX, USA) that can deliver both burst and tonic waveforms. Lead position for the permanent system is determined by placement for optimum paresthesia coverage during the tonic stimulation trial evaluation. After a 2&#x02013;3 week surgical recovery period, participants with the permanent system are randomized to receive one of the two treatment sequences over the subsequent 24&#x000a0;weeks.</p><p>During the control phase, participants use one waveform for 12&#x000a0;weeks then cross over to the other waveform for the remaining 12&#x000a0;weeks. Participants are randomly assigned (1:1) at each study site using computer-generated assignment to receive 12&#x000a0;weeks of tonic stimulation followed by 12&#x000a0;weeks of burst stimulation, or 12&#x000a0;weeks of burst stimulation followed by 12&#x000a0;weeks of tonic stimulation. Participants in both groups complete assessments at 6, 12, 18, and 24&#x000a0;weeks after randomization.</p><p>To enhance participant compliance with the study protocol, a washout period was not employed when participants crossed over. This decision was based on previous reports suggesting that 25&#x02013;80% of patients may fail to comply with the study protocol when asked to undergo periods without stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Assessments occur at a minimum of 6&#x000a0;weeks after changing stimulation modes, which is adequate time to ensure that any after-effects of the previous therapy will not influence the assessment of the current therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>During the open-label phase of the study, participants attend study visits for assessment every 6&#x000a0;months for up to 2&#x000a0;years post randomization. Perceptible differences in paresthesia between the two waveforms are likely, thus neither patients nor investigators are blinded to treatment sequence.</p><p>Any changes to the protocol will be reported to the IRB for each site and to the FDA. The protocol, and this reported version of the protocol conform to the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) guidelines; a copy of the SPIRIT Checklist accompanies this report as part of the supplemental materials (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Participants</title><p>Participants with chronic neuropathic pain of the trunk and/or limbs are invited to consider study participation.

Higher scores indicate a better quality of life.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Pain catastrophizing</title><p>The Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) is a validated scale to assess the quality of thoughts and feelings during pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The PCS includes 13 statements for which participants rate the frequency with which the statement matches their pain experience, from 0 (&#x0201c;not at all&#x0201d;) to 4 (&#x0201c;always&#x0201d;). The scale is self-administered, takes 5&#x000a0;min to complete, and examines three domains: rumination, magnification, and helplessness. A higher score indicates a higher level of catastrophizing.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Disability</title><p>The Oswestry Disability Index 2.1a (ODI) is a validated low-back pain questionnaire that indicates the extent to which a person&#x02019;s functional level is restricted by disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The self-administered questionnaire includes 10 questions and takes approximately 5&#x000a0;min to complete. The questionnaire produces a percentage total score that indicates the degree of disability; a higher percentage indicates a greater disability.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Mood</title><p>The Beck Depression Inventory BDI-II is a 21-question validated assessment that evaluates the intensity of depressive symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The questionnaire takes approximately 5&#x000a0;min to complete. The total score is categorized by minimal, mild, moderate, and severe depression. Higher total scores indicate more severe depressive symptoms.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Pain and paresthesia mapping</title><p>Pain location is documented on a map of the body labeled with different numbered segments.

At the enrollment visit, participants adhering to the initial inclusion/exclusion criteria sign informed consent, complete assessments, and start the VAS Pain Diary. If required of female participants, a pregnancy test is performed. Participants who meet all the inclusion/exclusion criteria after initial assessments and completion of the baseline Pain Diary complete additional assessments and are scheduled for the tonic stimulation trial evaluation period for 3&#x02013;7 days. Participants with a successful trial, defined as a patient-reported pain reduction of at least 50%, proceed to a permanent implant. After a surgical recovery period of 2&#x02013;3 weeks, participants are randomized (1:1 at each site) using an online electronic program provided by St. Jude Medical and the prescribed programming is activated. All participants receive a patient programmer that enables activation of the ON and OFF positions and adjustments to amplitude within the prescribed range.</p><p>During the control phase of the study, participants attend follow-up visits at the mid-point and end of each of the two 12-week phases of treatment. At the 12-week visit, participants cross over to the second stimulation mode of their treatment sequence and continue in the study for an additional 12&#x000a0;weeks (through 24&#x000a0;weeks).</p><p>Participants are programmed to their preferred stimulation mode at the end of the 24-week visit. Subsequently, participants attend follow-up visits every 6&#x000a0;months for up to 2&#x000a0;years. During this open-label phase, participants can request reprogramming and may use either stimulation mode or both, as needed to maintain adequate therapeutic benefit.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Statistical methods and data management</title><p>Data management, including monitoring, is performed by the study sponsor to ensure data completeness and accuracy. Additionally, a noninvestigator physician Steering Committee performs data review and adjudication. As part of standard practice for IDE studies, the FDA conducts occasional audits of the study conduct, data collection, and data management. Study investigators will have access to the data after study closure and will be offered the opportunity to participate as authors on publications. Electronic data capture with appropriate security protocols is used to ensure participant confidentiality during and after the study closure.</p><p>Statistical analyses will be performed using a significance level of <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05, unless otherwise specified, and 95% confidence intervals will be computed. Interim analyses for the primary endpoint will occur when all randomized participants complete the 24-week visit; results of that analysis will be submitted for publication. Analyses of the long-term follow-ups will be reported after study closure.</p><sec id="Sec21"><title>Sample size</title><p>Noninferiority of the VAS score during burst compared with tonic stimulation was assumed to be within a window of 7.5&#x000a0;mm on the 100-mm VAS. Based on earlier reports, the standard deviation of the difference between tonic and burst stimulation VAS scores was assumed to be 18.4&#x000a0;mm. With a type I error rate of 0.05, a minimum sample of 76 participants was required to achieve 80% power to show noninferiority between the two stimulation modes.</p><p>Previous studies indicate that approximately 29% of subjects trialed with tonic stimulation do not receive a permanent implant and an additional 20% of subjects may be lost to attrition by the 6-month visit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Screen failure rates were originally estimated to be at 15%, but after the first 6&#x000a0;months of enrollment the screen failure rate was amended to 22%. Total enrollment communicated with the regulatory bodies was 173 to account for screen failures, trial evaluation failures, and normal attrition [76/.71&#x02009;=&#x02009;108/.80&#x02009;=&#x02009;135/.78&#x02009;=&#x02009;173 (rounding up at each step)].</p><p>The noninferiority margin was set to preserve at least 50% of the expected effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Assuming, based upon enrollment criteria and past literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], the average baseline pain is approximately 75&#x000a0;mm, a 30% improvement in VAS score would be 23&#x000a0;mm. The 7.5-mm margin on the VAS scale would preserve approximately 77% of the effect and would, therefore, be an appropriate margin.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Carryover estimations</title><p>Prior to analysis, measures will be inspected for carryover effects that may be present as a function of time and/or the order of therapy delivery. Carryover effects will be estimated using the within-subject sums of the score from week 1 to week 12 and from week 12 to week 24. An independent two-sided <italic>t</italic> test will test the null hypothesis of equal within-subject sums between the two sequence groups tonic/burst stimulation and burst/tonic stimulation. If the null hypothesis is not rejected at the 0.10 level, then the potential carryover effects are considered negligible. If the null hypothesis is rejected, the subsequent analysis will be carried out on the first-period data only.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Primary analysis</title><p>The primary effectiveness analysis is the 12-week noninferiority of the within-subject difference between tonic and burst stimulation for the mean daily overall VAS score calculated from the diary. The primary analysis will be conducted using the intention-to-treat population to include data recorded at the 12- and 24-week visits for all randomized participants, except as noted below. Missing data will be imputed using the hot-deck or last-observation-carried-forward method, as appropriate. If participants increase their pain medications during the first 24&#x000a0;weeks of the study, assessment of the effect of the therapy mode on pain will be confounded by the influence of additional pain medications. Thus, participants who increase pain medication (other than acetaminophen) after randomization will be considered treatment failures for the interval during which the increase occurred, and that participant&#x02019;s baseline mean daily VAS score will be used for that interval in the analysis. A Z-statistic compared with the standard normal distribution will test the null hypothesis that the within-subject difference for the mean overall VAS score is less than or equal to 7.5&#x000a0;mm.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Additional analyses</title><p>For the control phase of the study, a responder analysis will inspect the proportion of participants achieving a change from baseline of 30% or greater for the overall VAS score during each stimulation mode. If noninferiority of burst stimulation is established in the primary endpoint analysis, the superiority of burst versus tonic stimulation will be tested for the overall VAS score using a one-sided <italic>t</italic> test. The within-subject difference for trunk and limb VAS scores will be inspected using two-sided 95% confidence intervals. The presence of paresthesiae will be compared between the two stimulation modes, and a relative difference of the within-subject experience will be computed. All other measures will be inspected using appropriate descriptive statistics and within-subject comparisons of burst versus tonic stimulation. Additional analyses will also include inspection of results in an intention-to-treat population to include all randomized participants; conservative imputations for missing data or participant withdrawal will be made in a manner appropriate to the measure and pattern of missing data.</p><p>During the open-label phase, type of therapy was chosen by the participant. Appropriate longitudinal statistics will examine long-term outcomes with the device- and participant-selected stimulation modes. Comparative analyses for burst versus tonic stimulation for this phase will be performed if statistically appropriate.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Safety</title><p>The safety profile of both stimulation modes will be characterized using appropriate descriptive statistics (e.g., incidence rates).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec26" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>As the first large randomized controlled study of burst stimulation, the design is intended to provide evidence to support FDA approval of the burst neuromodulation waveform for the treatment of chronic neuropathic pain by establishing noninferiority of burst stimulation to traditional tonic stimulation. The results of this study will provide comparative efficacy and safety for burst stimulation in patients who are candidates for traditional SCS. Additionally, data from this study will provide evidence for the psychosocial and functional outcomes during both stimulation modes. The two phases of this study will facilitate comparisons between the waveforms as well as inspection of preference and long-term usage patterns for up to 2&#x000a0;years when the leads are placed for tonic stimulation. Chronic pain and responses to neurostimulation are both complex sensory phenomena. The ability to have patients experience the control and experimental stimulation modes is a unique feature of this study design, which should facilitate meaningful patient preference assessment.</p><p>The enrichment strategies for this study design confer advantages for our primary aim. The within-subject comparisons help to control variability in the data such that lead location, programming, and other participant-specific variables are held constant. Additionally, only participants who respond to tonic stimulation during the trial evaluation period and are candidates for a traditional SCS system are randomized, which should minimize participant attrition while facilitating comparative efficacy in patients who are known candidates for SCS. Ideal electrode placement for burst stimulation may not be at the site chosen for tonic stimulation, as in the present study. The same might be true of other waveforms; further study is required to address these points.</p><p>Furthermore, participants with marked depressive symptoms are excluded from eligibility in this study. Affective and functional dimensions are reflected in patients&#x02019; impression of change &#x02013; even when a reduction in pain intensity may be considered clinically minimal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Affective disruptions commonly associated with pain may also interfere with an accurate assessment of changes in pain intensity. Our study is intended to provide a comparative inspection of pain during burst and tonic stimulation that is largely independent of affective improvements that may indirectly influence participant&#x02019;s assessment of therapy. We recognize that a minority of chronic pain patients, as few as 14% by some accounts, present without significant depressive symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Excluding participants with depressive symptoms is not expected to limit generalizability, however, because the population included in this design is expected to provide a conservative estimate of pain relief during stimulation. Any direct or indirect benefits to affective function conferred by burst stimulation would be expected to be additive, not exclusive, to the effects on pain. Thus, the results of this study would be expected to approximate, possibly to a lesser degree, the efficacy of burst stimulation for general clinic populations.</p><p>In contrast, our sample of participants with minimal affective disruption is likely to create a &#x0201c;floor effect&#x0201d; whereby comparative improvements in psychosocial outcomes for burst versus tonic stimulation are unlikely to be detectable. Early evidence indicates that some psychosocial domains may be differentially affected during burst stimulation compared to tonic stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]; future studies will be needed to target this aspect of the therapy.</p><p>The cross-over design also imposes some limitations upon the hypotheses that can be addressed with these results. First, the presence of any carryover effects, although not expected, may limit our analysis by reducing the treatment window to the first 3-month period &#x02013; thus leading to a between-subject comparison. Second, we will be unable to statistically assess changes in pain across time without losing the benefits of the within-subject design. Much of the literature for chronic pain treatments focuses on a calculated change in pain from baseline to follow-up. Our study design is not intended for such an analysis and any inspection of the similar results in our study will lead to limited conclusions, at best.</p><p>As with all studies, the design described herein is not without its limitations; however, this study represents the first large randomized controlled trial comparing the burst waveform with previously approved tonic waveforms. Ultimately, we expect to collect and report data leading to FDA approval for the device that can offer both burst and tonic waveforms, leading to individualized therapy strategies through enhanced therapeutic options.</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Trial status</title><p>The study is ongoing.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec28"><title>Additional file</title><p>
