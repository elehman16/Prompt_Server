Stress-related symptoms found amongst many employees include fatigue, burnout syndrome and gastric complaints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] Stress, which is the most common reason for sick-leave absence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], may increase the number of days in sick-leave [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], reduce productivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], and increase the risk of psychiatric disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>Occupationally induced fatigue play a major role in work-related psychological illnesses and research show that insufficient opportunities to recover from work fatigue contribute to stress-related illnesses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. One way of recovering from and/or preventing stress-related illnesses could be through health promoting programs at work places [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] where relaxation techniques are used as a method. Health-care programs, including methods of stress-reduction such as relaxation, may be of such importance it will affect the number of sick-leave days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Finding an effective method that can be implemented at work places might help individuals to find tools to prevent ill health and psychological negative factors. Evidence shows a positive effect on sick leave when health-care programs are implemented at work places [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Unfortunately, research regarding stress-related illnesses is mostly focused on those individuals already suffering, when preventive methods might be the most sufficient way of actually decreasing potential sick-leave absence by increasing general health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>Sick leave from work creates a heavy economic burden on the individual as well as the company, and it puts a mental strain on the person affected, colleagues and so on. There is a need to decrease the number of sick leave, especially those of stress-related character since they account for a large part of the sick-leave cost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>The physiological process of relieving the stress reaction is known as the &#x02018;relaxation response&#x02019; (RR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The relaxation response is attainable at a state of deep relaxation, and is the opposite of the &#x0201c;fight-or-flight&#x0201d; response. Why RR is such an effective remedy to stress symptoms is due to the direct link with parasympathetic nervous system activity where it lowers the heart rate and blood pressure as well as reducing respiratory frequency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In order to successfully elicit the RR response in a stressful situation, it is critical that sensory input and bodily movements are reduced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Unfortunately, many people find it difficult to engage in relaxation exercises that will generate RR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. One effective method to elicit RR is through relaxation in a flotation tank. During flotation-REST (Restricted Environmental Stimulation Technique) an individual lay in a horizontal floating posture immersed in highly concentrated salt water (magnesium sulphate) in a flotation tank. All incoming stimuli are reduced to a minimum during this period (usually 45&#x000a0;minutes), i.e. sound and light, and the water is heated to skin temperature. Flotation-REST has been scientifically investigated and is today considered a well-developed and scientifically proved method used to reduce stress, depression, anxiety, and to increase optimism and sleep quality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Significant pain reduction has also been reported after using flotation-REST technique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. A meta-analysis by Dierendonck and Nijenhuis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] concluded that flotation-REST has positive effects on physiology (e.g., lower levels of cortisol, lower blood pressure and well-being). Flotation-REST appears to be an effective treatment method and more effective than other relaxation techniques included in their study (i.e. muscle relaxation, biofeedback, and meditation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>Earlier research regarding flotation-REST mainly involves individuals with a diverse array of ailment, and so there is a need to further investigate this method when used by working professionals in order to find out if it is a suitable method for preventing stress and stress-related problems in healthy participants.</p><p>The purpose of this study was to evaluate psychological effects in a series of treatments of flotation-REST in healthy participants. Based on previous studies, we hypothesized that beneficial effect on levels of pain, depression, anxiety, stress, energy, optimism and sleep quality would occur.

To maintain a correct water temperature (approximately outer skin temperature, 35&#x000b0;C), heating foil is placed in the lower section of the floating tank, regulated by a thermostat and heated in regular intervals. The door is outwardly opened. The inside of the lower section had ribbed bottom to prevent slipperiness. Between flotation sessions, water is filtered and sterilized with UV-light along with weekly addition of hydrogen peroxide where oxidization occurs. The sterilization of water between flotation sessions takes approximately fifteen minutes. Filters are regularly changed and the inside of the flotation tank is cleaned twice a week in accordance to public health board recommendations.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Procedure</title><p>An agreement was made between the owner of a flotation centre and three managers from three different companies about a health-care program involving flotation-tank treatments. All three companies advertised through intranet correspondence, their company magazines, and through emails, offering all employees to participate in the health-care program. All interested participants were invited to an information meeting at the flotation centre located in Deje in the county of Varmland, Sweden, where they were further informed about the program. Information was given that the flotation-rest program would enable them to participate in a scientific study concerning the effects of this treatment program. Further information was given regarding that the participation was voluntary, confidential, that they would be randomly selected to either experimental group or waiting list, and that they could terminate their participation at any given point. All participants made a verbal informed consent about participating. They were also informed it was possible to participate in the health-care program without participation in the present study. All participants filled out a questionnaire regarding basic facts (age, gender, alcohol consumption, nicotine use) as well as SE, HADS, LOT, VAS and SQ questionnaires. Data was collected by the manager of the flotation center.</p><p>After the introduction and data collection, the enrolled individuals were randomly assigned to either the control group or to the flotation-REST group (a total of 12 flotation sessions). Those individuals that had been randomized to the wait-list control group got the opportunity to later participate in flotation-treatments after the present study was terminated.</p><p>All participants were guided through the flotation centre. Participants in the flotation-REST group booked the 12 awaiting flotation sessions (around two per week for a period of seven weeks) where each session was of 45&#x000a0;minutes duration and 30&#x000a0;minutes to shower and relax afterwards. After the third flotation session a supplementary EDN questionnaire was filled out by the experiment group. After the last flotation-REST session, the questionnaires (i.e., SE, HADS, LOT, VAS, EDN and SQ) were once again answered by the flotation-REST group along with a complementary MAAS questionnaire. All questionnaires were filled out in privacy in a separate room (no staff there) and the participant put their questionnaires in a closed box, that were later transported un-opened to the researchers.</p><p>The control group was scheduled to return 7&#x000a0;weeks later for filling in the scales SE, HADS, LOT, PAI, and SQ again. All persons were treated in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects.

The main findings were significant decreased experienced stress, worst pain, anxiety, and depression - as well as significant increased sleep quality and optimism for the flotation-REST group compared to the control group. In addition, it was found that the dimensions mindfulness and altered states of consciousness, at least to some extent, seemed to be overlapping constructs.</p><p>Flotation-REST treatment could be a valuable tool for increased over-all wellbeing. The effect-size for the performed general MANOVA-analysis showed a large effect, and therefor probably indicating a beneficial effect of real importance. General sleep quality significantly increased after flotation-REST treatment. There was also a significant decrease in experienced stress for the flotation-REST group, which may be a contributing factor to the increased sleep-quality. In order to successfully fall and stay asleep a relaxed and stress-free state is important. There was also a significant decrease in experienced stress for the flotation-REST group, which was directly correlated with increased sleep-quality.</p><p>By having experienced deep relaxation through flotation-REST, it could help a person to find a similar state of relaxation in daily life. Sleep deprivation is known to have negative effects on certain cognitive functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], being a trigger for depression and other psychological diseases, as well as reducing the immune defence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Sleep deprivation has also shown to be a trigger of hypertension, heart disease, and diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], which are all serious health issues. Lack of sleep is also a contributor to sick-leave absence from work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Being able to increase sleep quality and quantity is advantageous on an individual basis and might prevent possible sick leave. There was also a significant lowered energy level over time (for both groups); we have no explanation for this.</p><p>Flotation-REST also decreased the experienced &#x0201c;worst pain&#x0201d; intensity. Decreased pain in participants using flotation-REST has been extensively described in earlier studies e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Participants in this present study were not pain patients, but did however experience some pain in different parts of the body that apparently diminished significantly. It can be assumed that many of the experienced pain were due to muscle tensions, and that the induced relaxation and stress reduction in the tank may be a possible explanation for reducing these pains. There were no decrease in the experienced &#x0201c;normal pain&#x0201d;; maybe such low-intensity pains are more due to other reasons than muscle tensions, and therefor not affected by the deep relaxation in the tank.</p><p>Degree of anxiety and depression did also significantly decrease for the flotation-REST group during the treatment weeks. Depression and anxiety are strong contributors to sick-leave and serious health problems such as high blood pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. In addition, it was concluded that optimism significantly increased for the flotation group, which is a further indication of general wellbeing and psychological health. Flotation-REST treatments seem to enhance wellbeing and could certainly have great value and importance as a health-care method.</p><p>Another new finding was that the dimensions mindfulness (as measured with MAAS) and altered states of consciousness (as measured with EDN) seemed to be partly overlapping constructs. Those individuals who reported higher levels of altered states of consciousness (ASC) during flotation-REST also scored high on MAAS (and thus were open and receptive to here-and-now and had a mindful state in daily life). To our best knowledge, this is the first time the correlation between ASC and mindfulness has been investigated. We have in earlier studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] argued that degree of ASC in the flotation tank is a measure of the relaxation response and a person&#x02019;s ability to feel secure. A recent review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] of empirical studies concludes that mindfulness is closely associated with psychological well-being. Several studies (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] have earlier confirmed the beneficial effects of flotation-REST, and it has been suggested that the deep relaxation and stress reduction is the main contributing factors. From the present study we would also like to suggest that flotation tank treatment facilitates the psychological process of increased mindfulness, but further studies are needed for confirming if such causality exists.</p><p>Many of the participants wrote comments, without being asked to do so, on their individual questionnaires. They continuously emphasized how their pain - which many of them had been having for many years - was practically gone after the 12-session flotation program. They mentioned further how they felt relaxed, slept better, and were over-all happier and healthier. Many of the participants had prior to the floating sessions been using a range of different methods to reduce pain, stress and other individual health issues. Medicines, yoga, massage, and physiotherapy were some of the treatments mentioned, and never had they so successfully been relieved from pain, tension, stress etc.</p></sec><sec id="Sec28" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The results of the present study indicate that flotation-REST may reduce contributing factors to potential stress-related illness as well as increase certain psychological factors in healthy participants. Stress, anxiety, depression, and worst pain decreased and sleep quality and optimism increased in the flotation-REST group compared to the wait-list control group. This technique might increase general health and thus help prevent future sick leave. On an individual basis, sick leave puts a negative strain on the affected. Not only financially but it also tends to generate further negative effects such as lack of career possibilities, confidence, and a decrease of social interactions. Whether or not flotation-REST has positive effects on reduction of sick leave need to be evaluated in further research.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>AK carried out the design of the study, made contacts with the flotation centre, the clinical trial registration and the ethical approvement procedure.
