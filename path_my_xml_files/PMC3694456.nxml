It is known that glycemic control decreases long-term morbidity and mortality. The current standard therapy for T2DM is medical treatment. Several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) performed in obese patients showed remission of T2DM after bariatric surgery. Recent RCTs have shown bariatric procedures to produce a similar effect in non-morbidly and non-severely obese, insulin-dependent T2DM patients suggesting procedures currently used in bariatric surgery as new therapeutical approach in patients with T2DM. This study aims at investigating whether Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is an efficient treatment for non-severely obese T2DM patients in terms of preventing long-term complications and mortality.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The DiaSurg 2 trial is a multicenter, open randomized controlled trial comparing RYGB including standardized medical treatment if needed to exclusive standardized medical treatment of T2DM (control group). The primary endpoint is a composite time-to-event endpoint (cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, coronary bypass, percutaneous coronary intervention, non-fatal stroke, amputation, surgery for peripheral atherosclerotic artery disease), with a follow-up period of 8&#x000a0;years. Insulin-dependent T2DM patients aged between 30 and 65&#x000a0;years will be included and randomly assigned to one of the two groups. The experimental group will receive RYGB and, if needed, standardized medical care, whereas the control group will receive exclusive standardized medical care, both according to the national treatment guidelines for T2DM. Statistical analysis is based on Cox proportional hazards regression for the intention-to-treat population. Assuming a loss to follow-up rate of 20%, 200 patients will be randomly allocated to the comparison groups. A total sample size of <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;400 is sufficient to ensure 80% power in a two-tailed significance test at alpha&#x02009;=&#x02009;5%.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The DiaSurg2 trial will yield long-term data (8&#x000a0;years) on diabetes-associated morbidity and mortality in patients with insulin-dependent T2DM receiving either RYGB or standardized medical care.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>The trial protocol has been registered in the German Clinical Trials Register <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.drks.de/DRKS00004550">DRKS00004550</ext-link>.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><sec><title>Rationale of the trial</title><p>According to WHO data, in 2000 the worldwide prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) was 2.8%, and in 2030 it is expected to rise to 4.4% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Approximately 6 million people in Germany are currently suffering from T2DM, among whom 2 million are insulin-dependent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. A high proportion of these patients already suffer from T2DM-related diseases, such as micro- and/or macrovascular diseases resulting in neuro-, nephro-, retinopathy, myocardial infarction, and stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The treatment of these co-morbidities renders T2DM one of the most expensive diseases in terms of public health expenditure in Germany [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Current guidelines recommend medical therapy for the treatment of T2DM as the gold standard [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. It is known that sufficient glycemic control, defined by the German Diabetes Association and International Diabetes Foundation as HbA1c &#x0003c;6.5%, decreases long-term morbidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Current guidelines with the aim of lowering HbA1c-levels are therefore being reconsidered, owing to the growing number of studies showing an increased mortality rate for patients with lower HbA1c [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>Obesity is considered a risk factor for the development of T2DM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. For patients with class 2 obesity (BMI &#x0003e;35&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>) with co-morbidities and patients with class 3 obesity (BMI &#x0003e;40&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>), bariatric surgery is recommended when conservative attempts do not result in substantial weight loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Existing evidence reports that bariatric surgery not only leads to substantial weight loss, but also to T2DM remission in 42% to 78% of the patients who have undergone RYGB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In addition, T2DM-related diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases, nephropathy, retinopathy, neuropathy, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension, are supposed to be avoided or at least delayed in their progress after metabolic surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In the Swedish Obese Subjects (SOS)-Study 35% of T2DM patients and 19% of patients suffering from preoperative hypertension were still in remission 10&#x000a0;years after surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The beneficial effects of bariatric surgery on T2DM appeared shortly after surgery, and before major weight loss, leading to the hypothesis that weight loss alone is not solely responsible for T2DM remission. In an experimental study, Rubino <italic>et al.</italic> were able to prove that these effects are not dependent on weight loss alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. These findings led surgeons to perform bariatric procedures on non-severely obese patients (overweight and obesity class 1; BMI 25&#x02013;35&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>) suffering from T2DM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. A recent randomized controlled, single-center trial in patients with a BMI of 25&#x02013;35&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> showed T2DM remission in 93% of patients following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and 47% of patients following laparoscopic gastric sleeve resection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The effect of T2DM remission could therefore also be shown in non-severely obese patients.</p><p>This randomized controlled multicenter trial assesses whether bariatric surgery can be used as an alternative in the primary care of T2DM, potentially leading to fewer strokes or cardiovascular death and thus preventing long-term morbidity and mortality well-known in T2DM patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Objective</title><p>The aim of DiaSurg 2 is to investigate the time-to-event of T2DM-induced morbidity and mortality after RYGB compared to medical treatment according to the most current clinical guidelines in patients with insulin-dependent T2DM.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial locations</title><p>The DiaSurg 2 trial will be conducted in 13 German centers which have expertise in bariatric surgery.

A single-shot of antibiotic prophylaxis is given (according to local standards of participating centers). Then a 15&#x000a0;mmHg pneumoperitoneum through the left upper abdomen is created. Next, five trocars are placed in the upper abdomen. The liver retractor is then positioned in the right upper abdomen. Initially, the gastroesophageal junction is identified. Then the stomach is transsected by the use of linear staplers to build a pouch of 4&#x02013;6&#x000a0;cm height and 14&#x02013;16&#x000a0;mm width. The omentum majus can be transected depending on the individual anatomy. At 70&#x000a0;cm from the ligament of Treitz, an end-to-side gastroenterostomy is performed using either a linear or circular stapler. To reconstruct the passage, a side-to-side jejuno-jejunostomy 150&#x000a0;cm from the gastrojejunostomy is performed (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).

Another possible side effect of RYGB is the dumping syndrome. The risk of surgery for non-severely obese diabetic patients is difficult to assess because there are hardly any data.

Assuming a loss to follow-up rate of 20%, 200 patients should be randomly assigned to each intervention group (400 in total). This ensures sufficient power for the intention to treat analysis (ITT) and the complete cases per protocol (PP) analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of the primary endpoint</title><p>Each patient&#x02019;s allocation to the different analysis populations (full analysis set according to the ITT principle, PP analysis set, safety analysis set) will be defined prior to the analysis.

Potential treatment benefit will be assessed by the so-called proportion in favor of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], which is a multivariate permutation test based on pair-wise comparisons of patients. The outcome of Patient X will be said to be better than Patient Y if a decision can be made based on pair-wise comparisons of the components of the prioritized outcome in decreasing order.

Before starting, all participating centers will be personally trained and introduced to all study-specific procedures during a study initiation meeting where the surgical and medical standards are depicted. In addition there will be one video of the standardized operation as an example for each surgeon at the centers. In addition surgeons must have performed at least 20 laparoscopic RYGB to provide sufficient surgical expertise. Regular visits of the participating centers will be performed to check whether the operation is performed as demanded. These visits are planned at all sites depending on the recruitment rate and quality of the data (approximately one visit per site and year). The investigator must allow the monitor to look at all essential documents and must provide support at all times to the monitor. Clinical source data verification (SDV) is planned for all clinical items. The extent of further SDV and/or the frequency of monitoring visits will be adapted for individual centers in case of insufficient quality of data or if common protocol violations are observed. In addition to standard operating procedures, all procedures will be predefined in a study-specific monitoring manual.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Ethical considerations</title><p>The surgical procedure examined in this trial is well established and in current daily use. T2DM is associated with high long-term morbidity and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. In obese patients, bariatric surgery showed a remission of T2DM in 42% to 78% of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In obese patients, mortality of RYGB was about 0.16% to 0.5%, and although the operative risk in obese patients is described, mortality and morbidity rates are expected to be lower in non-severely obese patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Respectively, the operative risk is ethically justifiable considering long-term morbidity and mortality. By comparing conventional medical care to surgical treatment point-by-point, differences in the development of T2DM-associated symptoms are possible. Each individual patient in the intervention group justifiably has the potential to end further insulin treatment for T2DM and thus possibly avoid T2DM-associated co-morbidities. Each patient in the control group will receive standardized medical treatment according to the latest S3 guidelines and thus have no handicap by participating in the study. Participants in the control group will be treated by use of the latest S3 Guidelines set forth by the German Diabetes Association [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. If the study confirms evidence in improving diabetic symptoms in the experimental group and consequently health-insurance funds refund costs for surgical treatment of T2DM, patients randomized within the medical treatment group will be able to switch to the surgery group. Postoperatively, patients will be examined every year for possible side-effects of the surgery, including an assessment of their vitamin and nutritional status.</p><sec><title>Good clinical practice</title><p>The trial is planned and will be conducted and analyzed according to all relevant national and international rules and regulations (ICH-GCP, Declaration of Helsinki 2008).</p></sec><sec><title>Registration</title><p>The trial protocol has been registered with the German Clinical Trials Register (DRKS) under the registration number DRKS00004550.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Surgical treatment of T2DM is a subject that has been discussed in-depth in recent literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. T2DM remission was observed as occurring before substantial weight loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. However, the mechanisms leading to T2DM remission after surgery have not yet been fully understood. Potential explanations include the changed expressions of gastrointestinal hormones, which result in an improved insulin resistance level, and improved excretion of insulin from the beta-cells in the pancreas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Currently, however, there is no single satisfactory explanation for the metabolic mechanisms that lead to T2DM remission after bariatric surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Nevertheless, T2DM remission was observed in a high proportion of obese patients (42-78%) after bariatric surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Thus, bariatric surgery is, to some extent, discussed as being part of the therapy regimen for T2DM which may lead to a paradigm shift in the treatment of T2DM, a disease with high prevalence, severe associated co-morbidities as well as being a huge burden on public health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p><p>Since it is known that good glycemic control decreases long-term morbidity, a substantial reduction of mortality and morbidity can be expected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have focused on diabetes remission, assessed mostly by HbA1c and fasting glucose, showing a remission of T2DM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. However, diabetes-associated morbidity and mortality were not the subjects of those studies because the follow-up period of 12 to 24&#x000a0;months was too short to assess them as endpoints. These studies have proven that the successful implementation of bariatric surgery for the treatment of non-severely obese patients suffering from T2DM is safe and feasible. Since trials on the long-term effects of bariatric surgery on T2DM in a multicenter setting are not available, the present study was designed not to use HbA1c as a surrogate parameter, but as time-to-event of diabetes-associated mortality or morbidity with an appropriate follow-up of 8&#x000a0;years.</p><p>The goal of the study is to assess whether RYGB including standardized medical treatment is superior to exclusive standardized medical treatment of T2DM. Both treatment groups will receive standardized medical treatment according to the latest German S3 guidelines. The endocrinologists at the participating centers agreed on the standardized medical treatment taking the results of the ACCORD study into account [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Aggressive insulin dosage will not be performed in any group. Patients receiving RYGB will need close monitoring of dyslipidemia, hypertension, and hypoglycemia and corresponding adaption of the prescribed treatment postoperatively. To ensure this an additional follow-up is scheduled for these patients at 1&#x000a0;month after RYGB.</p><p>Sample size calculation and the primary endpoint were based on the Steno 2 study by Gaede <italic>et al.</italic>, who showed a reduction from 30% to 20% of diabetes-associated mortality and morbidity in an intensified medical treatment arm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. A further reduction of diabetes-associated morbidity to 10% for surgical treatment was defined as success and used for sample size calculation. To be able to have enough macrovascular complications inclusion and exclusion criteria, for example, microvascular manifestation of T2DM, were adapted to the Steno 2 study to allow for a similar patient population resulting in a study population with high risk to develop macrovascular complications. Although microvascular and macrovascular complications do have different pathogenesis we could use the data from the Steno 2 study to estimate the rate of macrovascular complications in patients with T2DM and microvascular complications at time of randomization. This allows the achievement of sufficient statistical power with a relatively small sample size.</p><p>Macrovascular diseases are assessed as time from randomization to one of the components of the primary endpoint including death from cardiovascular causes, non-fatal myocardial infarction, coronaryartery bypass grafting, percutaneous coronary intervention, non-fatal stroke, amputation, and surgery for peripheral atherosclerotic artery disease. Microvascular diseases will be assessed by corresponding laboratory testing; that is, nephropathy (urine albumin excretion 24-h urine sample), retinopathy (according to the EURODIAB six-level grading scale), and peripheral neuropathy (assessed by biothesiometry of the big toe in both feet plus questionnaire).</p><p>It is not known how long the effects of surgery on diabetes remission or diabetes-associated co-morbidities last, and if or when T2DM will again require intensified medical treatment. First publications show that in a high proportion of patients the effect is long-lasting. Jimenez <italic>et al.</italic> assessed 153 obese patients after a mean follow-up of 35&#x000a0;months. In 75.2% of patients, remission of T2DM was achieved at 12&#x000a0;months, and in 12.1% of the patients T2DM recurred [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Arterburn <italic>et al.</italic> found in 4,434 obese patients having had gastric bypass in a multisite study a median duration of remission of T2DM of 8.3&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. In a further analysis of T2DM incidence, Carlsson <italic>et al</italic>. analyzed 1,658 patients who received bariatric surgery <italic>versus</italic> 1,771 matched obese controls from the SOS study. They found a statistically significant difference namely, that patients who received bariatric surgery were less likely to develop T2DM. The incidence in the control group was 28.4 cases per 1,000 person-years and 6.8 cases per 1,000 person-years in the surgical group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. It remains to be discussed whether the benefits of bariatric surgery on T2DM outweighs the risk of the operation. Conservative therapy, however, also has a mortality rate. It was shown by Sj&#x000f6;str&#x000f6;m <italic>et al</italic>. in an SOS trial involving 4,047 patients receiving bariatric surgery compared to 2,037 matched controls receiving conservative treatment that bariatric surgery reduces mortality in obese patients significantly, with a hazard ratio of 0.76 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>].</p><p>Adjustable gastric banding, RYGB, laparoscopic gastric sleeve resection, biliopancreatic diversion, and duodenojejunal bypass have been used for the control of T2DM in non-severely obese patients. All of them show positive effects in the amelioration of T2DM, while gastric banding seems to be the least and biliopancreatic diversion the most effective treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. In this study RYGB was chosen as the operative technique since it seemed to have the best ratio of risk and benefit in terms of T2DM remission and postoperative mortality and morbidity, for example, severe malabsorption resulting in vitamin and nutritive deficiencies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>In addition to reduced mortality and morbidity, reduced costs can be expected, as assessed by Makary <italic>et al</italic>., who analyzed 2,235 obese patients with T2DM who underwent bariatric surgery. Compared to preoperative annual healthcare costs of $6,376 in the first year after surgery, costs for T2DM treatment increased by 9.7% but decreased in the third year by 70.5%. Makary <italic>et al</italic>. concluded that even with the additional cost of the operation, overall healthcareexpenditure for patients who received bariatric surgery were lower [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>].</p><p>If the present study is successful, it will contribute to a possible paradigm shift in T2DM treatment, which will be the implementation of surgery for the treatment of T2DM. This randomized controlled multicentre trial will assess - for the first time in Europe and in a multicenter setting - whether RYGB is an efficient method to prevent long-term complications in non-severely obese patients with T2DM, and whether it can be used as an alternative in the primary care of T2DM, thereby potentially leading to less strokes or cardiovascular death and thus preventing well-known long-term morbidity and mortality in T2DM patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial status</title><p>Recruitment will begin in Q2 2013.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>BMI: Body mass index; RYGB: Roux-en-Y gastric bypass; T2DM: Type 2 diabetes mellitus.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declared that they have no competing interest.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>All authors contributed to the design of the present study and revised the manuscript critically.
