Patients are randomly assigned to receive an intervention or control. The effect of the intervention can be estimated by comparing outcomes between groups, whose prognostic factors are expected to balance by randomisation.

We compared the intention-to-treat (ITT), as-treated (AT), per-protocol (PP), instrumental variable (IV) and complier average casual effect (CACE) analyses to estimate large (50% improvement over the control), moderate (25% improvement) and null (same as the control) treatment effects.

Since patients&#x02019; prognostic factors are expected to balance by randomisation patients&#x02019; outcomes can be directly compared between groups to infer the effect of a treatment. In many cases, patients may not fully comply with their assigned treatment according to the protocol. Such protocol violation compromises the &#x02018;fair&#x02019; comparison, which is protected by randomisation, and will potentially bias the estimate of treatment effect. Analysing RCTs subject to non-compliance can be challenging. While different analyses have been proposed to deal with non-compliance, the bias of treatment effect estimate is rarely compared among different approaches. Result interpretations also vary depending on the nature of non-compliance and the objective of a trial. Some RCTs, known as pragmatic trials,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1&#x02013;3</xref> are primarily designed to guide clinical practice. Their goal is often to assess whether an intervention will work in routine practice. In contrast, non-pragmatic trials usually focus on the biological efficacy of an intervention. Despite the objective, an analysis that provides an unbiased or less biased estimate of treatment effect is always desirable. In this study, we compare common approaches to analyse non-compliant data in RCTs. The results will provide useful knowledge in choosing optimal methods for different non-compliant scenarios.</p><p>This study was motivated by an RCT that compared the integrated care organised through the Children's Treatment Network (CTN) with the usual care directed by parents for managing children with special healthcare needs.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> The CTN coordinated community resources to deliver comprehensive health services for the target children and their families. The hypothesis was that the target children's health outcomes would improve by receiving integrated, proactive and necessary services tailored for them. While the use of RCTs in assessing CTN-like interventions has been promising, non-compliant rates are generally high in these trials. This is largely due to the complexity of implementing multidisciplinary interventions in real-life settings.</p><p>Intention to treat (ITT), as treated (AT) and per protocol (PP) are common approaches to analyse non-compliant data in RCTs. The ITT analysis is considered as the gold standard<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> but can be problematic for some scenarios.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Multiple methods are often recommended for analysing RCTs with substantial non-compliance.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7&#x02013;9</xref> A literature review<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> randomly selected 100 RCTs published in high impact journals in 2008. Of 98 RCTs which reported non-compliance, 46 employed variations of PP analyses in addition to an ITT analysis. Another class of methods to deal with non-compliance includes instrumental variable (IV) and complier average causal effect (CACE) approaches.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11&#x02013;15</xref> A conceptual difference among all these methods is that the ITT, IV and CACE approaches estimate treatment effects by preserving randomisation or accounting for potential confounding, but the AT and PP approaches do not. There are also other proposed approaches to correct for non-compliance in RCTs,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> for example, G-estimation and inverse probability weighted estimators. However, these methods have not been widely adopted. Therefore, we only included the ITT, AT, PP, IV and CACE methods in our comparison.</p><p>Very few studies have compared these five methods on the bias of estimating treatment effects. Bang and Davis<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> had compared ITT, AT, PP and IV methods. They showed that ITT and IV analyses were biased in certain non-compliant cases. However, the authors did not include CACE analysis in their comparison and did not consider the situation where there was no crossover between treatment groups. This scenario is common when a new intervention is only accessible to patients who are offered it. In another study, McNamee<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> compared ITT, AT, PP and IV analyses and concluded that an ITT analysis was not always biased towards the null while AT and PP analyses were generally biased. Sheng and Kim<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> investigated the effect of non-compliance on ITT analysis of equivalence trials and showed that non-compliance did not always favour the null hypothesis, that is, no difference between treatment groups. Hertogh <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> concluded that the IV method could give insight into confounding by non-compliance in RCTs.</p><p>Most of the previous studies did not consider different associations of non-compliant behaviours with patients&#x02019; conditions. For example, patients with certain characteristics may always reject a new intervention. Also, there are partial non-compliant cases where patients receive parts of the intervention even if they did not fully comply with the protocol. In our simulation study, we considered additional non-compliant scenarios that were not considered by previous studies and compared the five common methods by the bias of estimate, the mean square error (MSE) and 95% coverage of the true value. Our objectives were to compare the performance of different approaches in analysing non-compliant RCT data and make recommendations on optimal approaches under specific scenarios.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Simulation framework</title><p>In the CTN trial, over 50% of the children randomised in the CTN group did not fully comply with the intervention for various reasons. Primary and sensitivity analyses showed that the effect of the CTN was not significant but the estimates varied in direction, magnitude and precision.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> This observation prompted us to further investigate the impact of non-compliance on estimating treatment effects.</p><p>On the basis of the CTN setting, we simulated hypothetical RCTs where patients were randomly assigned to the intervention or usual care by a 1:1 allocation ratio. The parameters for generating hypothetical patients were estimated from the CTN trial. We simulated different non-compliant scenarios by varying three factors: (1) the type of non-compliers, (2) the randomness of non-compliance and (3) the degree of non-compliance. Our simulation framework is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2014005362F1">figure 1</xref>.

Always-takers will always receive a new intervention even if they are not offered it. Two scenarios were considered. In one scenario, we assumed that non-compliers were either never-takers or always-takers, which mimicked the situation where patients were able to get the intervention elsewhere even if they were not offered it. In the other scenario, we assumed that non-compliers were only never-takers, which mimicked the situation where the intervention was only accessible to patients who were offered it. In addition, we assumed that the intervention and usual care were the only treatment options.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Randomness of non-compliance</title><p>Non-compliant behaviours could be random or dependent on patients&#x02019; conditions. In particular, we considered six scenarios of dependent non-compliant behaviours that were studied by McNamee<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>:

We assumed that good condition represented an outcome score of at least 0.5 SDs above the group mean under usual care (assuming that a high score was a better outcome). Poor condition represented an outcome score of at least 0.5 SDs below the group mean under usual care. When there were no always-takers, only scenarios C and E were considered.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Degree of non-compliance</title><p>Degree of non-compliance referred to the proportion of interventional components that a patient did not receive according to the protocol. The simplest case was all-or-none where compliers received 100% of the intervention and non-compliers received none of it. For multifaceted interventions, patients were likely to receive some components of the intervention even if they did not fully comply with the protocol. In addition, patients might only receive parts of the intervention because of the intervention fidelity. For example, a systematic review showed that many interventions of integrated care did not actually deliver all services as planned due to complexity of implementation.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Conversely, we also use the term &#x02018;degree of compliance&#x02019; for the proportion of interventional components that a patient received according to the protocol. Non-compliance and compliance are used throughout this paper.</p><p>All-or-none and partial non-compliance were considered in our simulation. For all-or-none case, we considered two compliance levels: all components (d=1) or none (d=0) of the intervention. A study reported that non-compliance rate could be as high as 30&#x02013;40% for a treated population.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Therefore, we randomly selected 30% of patients to receive a treatment opposite to what they were assigned for. For partial non-compliance, we considered four compliance levels: none (d=0), one-third (d=1/3), two-thirds (d=2/3) or all (d=1) components of the intervention. These four levels have been studied in a previous simulation study.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Simulation procedures</title><p>We employed a modified simulation model from the previous study.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Let Y<sub>1</sub>&#x000a0;and Y<sub>0</sub> be a pair of counterfactual outcomes for a patient if he or she were in the intervention and the usual care groups, respectively. In practice, we can only observe one of the counterfactual outcomes because we can never observe both outcomes for any patient at the same time. Thus, causal inference is often made at population level instead of patient level. By adopting a marginal view, we define the causal effect for the treatment of interest (&#x003b4;) as<disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen2014005362ueq1.jpg" position="float"/></disp-formula>where &#x003bc;<sub>1</sub> and &#x000b5;<sub>0</sub> were the means of Y<sub>1</sub> and Y<sub>0</sub>, respectively.</p><p>We chose &#x000b5;<sub>0</sub>=59 to be the effect of usual care. The effect of usual care was estimated from the CTN trial with an SD of 10. For the effect of treatment (&#x000b5;<sub>1</sub>), we chose three different cases: &#x000b5;<sub>1</sub>=89 for a 50% improvement over the usual care; &#x000b5;<sub>1</sub>=74 for a 25% improvement over the usual care and &#x000b5;<sub>1</sub>=59 for no difference from the usual care. Each case was simulated separately. We then generated individual patient&#x02019;s counterfactual outcomes through a normal distribution:<disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen2014005362ueq2.jpg" position="float"/></disp-formula></p><p>Thus, good condition was defined for a patient with Y<sub>0</sub>&#x0003e;64 (half SDs above the group mean under usual care) and poor condition was defined for a patient with Y<sub>0</sub>&#x0003c;54 (half SDs below the group mean under usual care). A group indicator Z&#x000a0;(1=intervention and 0=usual care) was generated for each patient from a Bernoulli distribution with equal probability of 0.5 of being assigned to either group. The observed outcome for a patient was calculated by<disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen2014005362ueq3.jpg" position="float"/></disp-formula>where d<sub>i</sub> was the degree of treatment compliance with the protocol for patient i.

Using the same MCID, we chose to simulate 500 participants in each hypothetical trial. We estimated the SE of the treatment effect to be 1.53 from the CTN trial. Based on this estimate, at least 816 simulations were needed to produce an effect estimate within 1% accuracy of the MCID by the standard formula.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> To have sufficient power, we chose to generate 1000 simulations per scenario.

That was because the standard IV estimator was sensitive to non-compliant rates. For example, when non-compliant rate was equal between groups, the denominator was zero and the estimate became undefined. When never-takers and always-takers were considered, the ITT and IV approaches generally had a better 95% coverage than the other approaches. When there were only never-takers, the PP approach had the best 95% coverage. For a large treatment effect, the ITT approach had zero 95% coverage. Overall, the results from comparing the MSE and 95% coverage were consistent with those from comparing the bias of estimates.</p><p>In the sensitivity analysis, we compared the impact of using a cut-off of 80% or 100% to dichotomise compliant patients. The results showed that dichotomising patients by a cut-off of 80% resulted in less biased estimates than dichotomising patients by a cut-off of 100%. For a null treatment effect, the treatment estimates obtained by applying a cut-off of 80% were less biased than those obtained by directly analysing patients on the observed degree of compliance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>Through simulation, we compared different methods of analysing non-compliant RCT data. Our results showed that the ITT approach was the most optimal when estimating a null effect since it provided an unbiased or the least biased estimate in different scenarios. This result was consistent with the general opinion that the ITT estimate is conservative towards the null. However, for the case of a large or moderate treatment effect, the ITT approach was much more biased than the other approaches. When patients&#x02019; non-compliant behaviours were purely random, the AT, PP, IV and CACE approaches all provided unbiased estimates. For other non-compliant scenarios that we considered, the choice of optimal method varied. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2014005362F3">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref> summarises the choices of methods under different scenarios to produce an unbiased or less biased estimate.</p><fig id="BMJOPEN2014005362F3" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;3</label><caption><p>Choosing optimal analyses for different non-compliant scenarios.

Scenario E: patients with good conditions will always reject the intervention. A good condition was defined to have an outcome score at least 0.5 SDs above the group mean under usual care. A poor condition was defined to have an outcome score at last 0.5 SDs below the group mean under usual care. In addition, it was assumed that the intervention and usual care were the only treatment option.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen2014005362f03"/></fig><p>Although the ITT method is the most commonly reported analysis, other analyses of non-compliant data may provide a better estimate. Thus, understanding the extent of bias for different analyses is important when choosing an optimal approach and interpreting the results. Our results are limited by a number of factors. First, we did not consider specific prognostic factors in the simulation. Adjusting for prognostic factors may improve the estimation of treatment effect. However, we did consider different associations between patients&#x02019; outcomes and non-compliant behaviours. Second, we assumed that the clinical effect of an intervention was proportional to the degree of compliance. This linear association might not represent all real-life situations. Third, we did not consider missing data in the simulation and assumed that non-compliers&#x02019; outcomes were still collectable. Alternatively, imputation techniques can be applied to handle missing data.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Finally, we only simulated a subset of general non-compliant scenarios. Thus, our findings may not be generalisable to other scenarios.</p><p>Despite the limitations, our study has several strengths. The simulation framework was built on three key factors of non-compliance: the type of non-compliers, the randomness of non-compliance and the degree of non-compliance. These three factors were not considered simultaneously in previous studies. We generated a total of 60 scenarios by varying non-compliant factors and the magnitude of treatment effect (ie, null, moderate or large). The findings will help investigators choose the optimal approaches when dealing with similar non-compliant problems. Our results also confirm some previous findings. For example, the ITT analysis was unbiased if the treatment effect was zero.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> All estimates were unbiased if non-compliance was independent of patients&#x02019; outcomes and the IV estimate was also unbiased when non-compliance was symmetrically dependent on patients&#x02019; outcomes.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> In addition, we found that the PP estimate was unbiased when there were only never-takers. While the real impact of non-compliance on estimating treatment effect is difficult to generalise, we have compared the performance of common analyses under specific non-compliant scenarios. The results highlight the value of employing multiple approaches to analyse non-compliant data. Our work has considered additional non-compliant scenarios that were not considered by previous studies. It also contributes to the quality assessment of research evidence generated from RCTs subject to non-compliance and provides basis for a more complex evaluation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our simulation shows that the ITT analysis under non-compliance is considerably biased when an intervention has a large effect over the control. Alternative analyses can provide unbiased or less biased estimates. For RCTs subject to non-compliance, we make some suggestions for the choice of analyses under specific scenarios to minimise the bias of estimated treatment effect. Our study also informs the design of further investigations on the issue of non-compliance in RCTs.
