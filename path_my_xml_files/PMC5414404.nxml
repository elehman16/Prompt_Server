The samples were selected using simple random sampling and they were assigned into two groups: The conventional treatment group (treatment as usual) (30 patients), and visit and active treatment (30 patients). In the intervention group, there were ten follow-ups by a face-to-face visit over 12 months, and six follow-ups by phone call in control group.

Doing active intervention, that is, periodic and active visit to suicide attempters, it is attempted to evaluate current status of the patient and stabilize it to reduce stress and perform better treatment and to prevent suicide in these patients by improving harmful mental and environmental conditions as well as appropriate physician and psychologist and social worker visit. Some evidence suggests that it is possible that planning for follow-up in suicide attempter patients can be effective in the prevention of suicidal attempts. However, since few studies have been done in this regard, current study aims at investigating impact of active visit and treatment in the prevention of recurrent suicidal attempts (more than once) and its relationship with demographic characteristics of the patients. In summary, current study attempts to compare active visit and treatment of patients in a periodic manner with treatment as usual, in the prevention of recurrent suicidal attempts.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study design and participants</title><p>This study was a randomized, controlled clinical trial which was carried out on 2013-2014.

All participants provided written informed consent.</p><p>Subjects were selected from hospitalized patients in Noor Hospital's Emergency Center (Isfahan, Iran). Inclusion criteria included: 1. Ability to communicate with the patient, 2. The patient's conscious acceptance for inclusion, 3. Lack of threatening condition that requires another immediate intervention (such as the urgent need for surgery), 4. Lack of developing dementia or severe cognitive impairment DSMIV-TR criteria that were detected during the initial interview. Exclusion criteria included: 1. Stopped cooperation and relationship after informed patient's acceptance, 2. Change in the address of the patient's location. 3. Death due to causes other than suicide (according to forensic detection).</p><p>A total of 77 individuals screened. Finally 60 subjects met all inclusion and no unmet criteria.

In the first meeting, two groups completed demographic questionnaire containing following information and features: (Name, age, marital status, education level, employment status), number of previous suicide attempts, economic, social, and family problems, examining the need for intervention by a psychologist, psychiatrist, social worker and hospital emergency. In control group, the patients were recommended to refer to psychiatry Emergency unit, in case there were suicidal thoughts so that they are referred to psychologist, psychiatrist, social worker and hospital emergency, if necessary. Second questionnaire which included information on the patient's previous problems, new potential problems, status of hope, desire and motivation to life, suicidal thoughts, plans, planning and their attempt for suicide was completed for them within 6 months in months 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 following their repeated suicide attempts via phone call. In the intervention group, there was ten face-to-face visit of the patients in weeks 2, 4, and months 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, and 12 after the suicide attempt, and at each visit, they completed the second questionnaire. In this group, intervention was performed as correcting thinking, inefficient thought recognition (such as all or nothing thinking that blocks problem solving method), cognitive therapy techniques, expressing empathy for the patient, talking about desperate thoughts in dealing with problems and providing guides to improve hopefulness and self-confidence in patient, improving social communications, coping with problems, enjoying the life, acceptance of the problems, and attempt to change the patient's expectations in coping the problems (using the techniques of Acceptance and Commitment Technique), training distractibility in time of suicidal thoughts, and the patient was referred to a psychologist or social worker, if needed. In this group of patients, a psychiatric history, depending on existing psychiatric disorders was prepared and drug treatment program was started by the Assistant Executive, and in order to improve adherence to medication treatment of patients and treatment acceptance, measures were taken.</p><p>The questionnaires were constructed by the responsible author in collaboration with the professors from Department of Psychiatry, and then the validity was confirmed by a number of professors of psychiatry (N = 10).

Findings in the current work showed recurrent suicide attempters are significantly lower in intervention group following inclusion in the study (2 vs. 6). Although these findings were not found to be significant, they are somehow consistent with findings by Motto and Bostrom[<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and De Leo <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and Fleischmann <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] which indicate that the face-to-face meeting and follow-up in suicidal patients could somehow be useful in recurrent suicide attempt. On the other hand, nonsignificant findings in our work and the study by Hassanzadehn <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] indicate that although findings were not significant in both works, since no repeated attempt was observed in second 6 months of the year in our work, and considering findings in previous studies[<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref><xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref><xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] and reduced repeated attempt in active visit and treatment group in the current study, it is assumed that such difference may get significant in longer follow-up. Various techniques of psychotherapy such as supportive cognitive therapy, learning the correct way to solve a problem and how to correct thinking, technique of acceptance of problems rather than trying to change them (Commitment and Acceptance Technique) were trained in the intervention group which was effective in the prevention of suicidal attempts[40-43] and it was consistent with studies by Nordentoft <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] (that used the dialectic behavioral therapy). In that study included in intervention group (66.7%) and 22 patients included in control group (73.3%) were females, and such difference in terms of sex was statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> = 0.001). In the study conducted by Cederke <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and Suominen <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] the number of women was more than men. Perhaps the reason for higher willingness of women to participate in the study and follow-up is their higher need to get the surveillance than men. In our study, most of suicide attempters were female, single or divorced, the college-educated, unemployed and with a history of chronic psychiatric disorders. In the study conducted by Kapur <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and Cederke <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] the majority of recurrent suicide attempters had a history of chronic psychiatric disorders. Thus, it may supports that recurrent suicide attempts occur in people with low social support.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Hence, supportive psychotherapy and referral to social worker may be useful in reducing recurrent suicide attempt.</p><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Limitations</title><p>One limitation in the current study was its one-year period. It is recommended to consider longer periodes for follow-up and active treatment in recurrent suicide attempters. The other limitation was identical intervention performer and evaluator. Although it was due to establishing a better medical relationship, it is suggested to select two separate people in the future works for enhancing reliability of the results. Lack of precise discrimination of various psychotic disorders underlying suicide was the other limitation in this work. Their precise discrimination may provide more detailed results.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, findings in the current work show that active visit and treatment in patients with recurrent suicide attempt may significantly reduce suicidal thoughts and increase life expectancy and hope and decrease recurrent suicide attempt. Considering no recurrent suicide attempt was observed in patients since month 6 after active visit and treatment, it is necessary to consider longer period for follow-up and evaluation to assess impact of active visit and treatment in effective prevention of recurrent suicide attempt.</p><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-6" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgement</title><p>Cooperation of Ms. Shahzeydi (Psychologist of Department of toxicology) and Noor Medical Center's Toxicological Department officials and nurses who helped us in conducting this research is sincerely appreciated.</p></ack><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Fleischmann</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Bertolote</surname><given-names>JM</given-names></name><name><surname>Wasserman</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>De Leo</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Bolhari</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Botega</surname><given-names>NJ</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Effectiveness of brief intervention and control for suicide attempters: A randomised controlled trial in five countries</article-title><source>Bull World Health Organ</source><year>2010</year><volume>86</volume><fpage>657</fpage><lpage>736</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><source>WHO.
