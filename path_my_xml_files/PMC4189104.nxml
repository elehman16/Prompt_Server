We aimed to assess whether intermittent montelukast is better than placebo for treatment of wheeze in this age group. Because copy numbers of the Sp1-binding motif in the arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase (<italic>ALOX5</italic>) gene promoter (either 5/5, 5/x, or x/x, where x does not equal 5) modifies response to montelukast in adults, we stratified by this genotype.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We did this multicentre, parallel-group, randomised, placebo-controlled trial between Oct 1, 2010, and Dec 20, 2013, at 21 primary care sites and 41 secondary care sites in England and Scotland. Children aged 10 months to 5 years with two or more wheeze episodes were allocated to either a 5/5 or 5/x+x/x <italic>ALOX5</italic> promoter genotype stratum, then randomly assigned (1:1) via a permuted block schedule (size ten), to receive intermittent montelukast or placebo given by parents at each wheeze episode over a 12 month period. Clinical investigators and parents were masked to treatment group and genotype strata. The primary outcome was number of unscheduled medical attendances for wheezing episodes. Analysis was by intention to treat.

Reasons for these inconsistent results could be the substantial heterogeneity in treatment effect in young children with wheeze,<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> and that the response to montelukast is limited to a subgroup of children.</p><p>Studies of adults with asthma suggest that heterogeneity in response to montelukast is partly determined by a polymorphism in the arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase (<italic>ALOX5</italic>) gene promoter.

Eligible children were aged between 10 months and 5 years and had had two or more previous episodes of wheeze, at least one of which was physician-confirmed, and at least one of which had happened in the preceding 3 months. We excluded children if they had a pre-existing respiratory vulnerability such as cystic fibrosis, sickle-cell disease, severe developmental delay with feeding difficulty, history of neonatal chronic lung disease, or structural airways disease. Children were also excluded if they had been enrolled in a therapeutic trial in the previous 3 months or were taking continuous oral montelukast at the time of enrolment. To represent the overall population of young children with wheeze, and in line with the population in our previous trials,<xref rid="bib4 bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4,16</sup></xref> we did not exclude children receiving continuous inhaled corticosteroid therapy. The study was approved by the UK National Health Service Multicenter Research Ethics Committee (reference number 09/H1102/110), by local institutional review boards, and by the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (21313/0024/01-0001); the UK Medicines for Children Research Network supported the study. An independent data and safety monitoring committee not involved with patient enrolment reviewed adverse events. Written informed consent was obtained from the parent or guardian of each child enrolled in the study.</p></sec><sec id="cesec40"><title>Randomisation and masking</title><p>Participants were allocated to either a 5/5 or 5/x+x/x <italic>ALOX5</italic> promoter genotype stratum, then randomly assigned (1:1), via a permuted block schedule (size ten) developed by the manufacturer (Novalabs, Leicester, UK), to receive montelukast or placebo (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>). Clinical investigators and parents were masked to treatment group and genotype strata. Placebo and montelukast were packaged as identical granules in identical sachets labelled with participant number only. Emergency code break was allowed in cases of a suspected severe adverse reaction when knowledge of patient allocation could have affected clinical management of a study participant, in the case of a suspected unexpected severe adverse reaction, and in any other circumstance in which the principal investigator considered that an emergency code break was indicated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="cesec50"><title>Procedures</title><p>At enrolment, parents completed a structured questionnaire administered by research study personnel, which asked about previous wheeze, present treatment, and risk factors (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>). Saliva from each child was collected with the Oragene OG-250 collection kit in combination with the CS-1 saliva collection kit for young children (both manufactured by DNA Genotek, Ottawa, ON, Canada) and transferred to Queen Mary University of London (London, UK) for analysis. The simple sequence-length polymorphism in the promoter region of <italic>ALOX5</italic> (rs59439148) was genotyped as described previously.<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> Alleles were classified according to the number of simple repeats (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>), and children were identified as belonging to either 5/5 or 5/x+x/x strata.</p><p>Parents were advised to commence the trial drug at the onset of each viral cold or wheezing episode over the 12-month study period. Parents continued all other drugs prescribed by their managing clinician (including bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids), and completed a diary of symptoms, medicine use, adverse events, and medical attendance for each day the trial drug was given (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>). Investigators asked parents by telephone survey about usage of trial drug, use of oral corticosteroid rescue therapy, and medical attendances at two-monthly intervals during the 12-month study period (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>). Parents who could not be contacted received a maximum of two letters offering continued involvement in the study. When parents could not be contacted for two successive phone calls, parent and child were regarded as withdrawn from the study. Medical attendances for wheeze were independently verified by study investigators by contact with the managing clinician.</p><p>Urine was obtained from asymptomatic children at baseline. Urine was transported on ice, and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C within 1 h of collection. We analysed urinary leukotriene E<sub>4</sub>&#x02014;the final urinary metabolite of cysteinyl leukotriene production&#x02014;by high-performance liquid chromatography&#x02013;tandem mass spectrometry (ABI SCIEX 4000 QTRAP, Framingham, MA, USA), as previously described (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>).<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> Concentrations were expressed in proportion to urinary creatinine. We excluded samples with a urinary creatinine concentration of less than 0&#x000b7;1 mg/mL because correction is inaccurate in very dilute samples.</p><p>We monitored children for adverse events with a diary card report and telephone follow-up. Hospital admission for exacerbation of wheeze, acute lower-respiratory-tract infection, acute febrile illness, febrile convulsion, gastroenteritis, and exacerbation of eczema were not classed as serious adverse events in the trial protocol.</p></sec><sec id="cesec60"><title>Outcomes</title><p>Our primary outcome was the number of unscheduled medical attendances for wheezing episodes. Such attendances were defined as those to a family doctor, an asthma nurse or similarly trained health-care professional, an accident and emergency department, hospital via accident and emergency (hospital admission), or any combination of these. Secondary outcomes were duration of hospital admission, number of wheeze episodes, duration of wheeze episodes, number of courses of oral steroids per year, proportion of children receiving oral corticosteroids, use of trial drug, time to first unscheduled medical attendance, and time to first unscheduled attendance by site of medical attendance. We did a prespecified subgroup analysis that assessed unscheduled medical attendances for wheeze episodes by <italic>ALOX5</italic> promoter genotype strata (5/5 and 5/x+x/x). Other prespecified subgroups for analysis were multitrigger and episodic wheeze at baseline, use of either continuous inhaled corticosteroids or no inhaled corticosteroids at baseline, and the alternative genotype grouping of 5/5+5/x and x/x.</p></sec><sec id="cesec70"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The trial was powered to detect a difference in the number of unscheduled medical attendances for wheeze episodes between participants in the intervention and control groups, and to detect differential responsiveness to montelukast in the 5/5 stratum compared with the 5/x+x/x stratum, with the assumption that montelukast leads to a 60% reduction in attendances in the 5/x+x/x stratum, and a 20% reduction in the 5/5 stratum. With use of data from the UK General Practitioner Research Database, with courses of oral steroids as a proxy for unscheduled medical attendances for wheeze episodes, we estimated a mean of 0&#x000b7;76 [SD 1&#x000b7;22] such attendances per year. Because data follow an overdispersed Poisson distribution, we used Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/software/bugs/" id="interrefs30">WinBUGs</ext-link> (version 1.4) to estimate required sample sizes. 1050 children were needed to detect a 33% drop in unscheduled medical attendances for wheeze episodes, with a power of 90% at a significance level of 5%, with a 6% loss to follow up. A 33% drop in attendances equates to an attack rate of 0&#x000b7;51 for the treatment group. The clinical significance of these changes is that roughly four children would need to be treated to prevent one unscheduled medical attendance. Because a sample size of 1200 provides just more than 80% power at the 5% significance level to detect an interaction between treatment and <italic>ALOX5</italic> genotype, 1300 children needed to be recruited, assuming a 6% dropout. Interim safety analyses were done at 6-monthly intervals. Efficacy analyses were done at the end of the trial.</p><p>For each child, we analysed unscheduled medical attendances for wheeze episodes and episodes of viral cold with a Poisson regression model. For each episode of wheeze and viral cold, duration of hospital admission, and number of symptom days were also analysed with Poisson regression models. We included follow-up time for each child as an exposure variable and a random effect fitted for each child to account for overdispersion or when episode was the unit of analysis. Follow-up time was based on time from randomisation until either the 12 month end of trial date or date of last phone call.</p><p>For unscheduled medical attendances for wheeze episodes, we assessed the differential effect of treatment in predefined subgroups by inclusion of an interaction term. Proportions of patients who had any unscheduled medical attendance, or those receiving oral corticosteroid rescue therapy, were analysed with logistic regression. We analysed time to first unscheduled medical attendance with Cox regression models. All models were fitted on the available case population with modified intention-to-treat principles and included fixed effects for stratification factor and treatment. We did a per-protocol analysis that excluded any children randomised not according to schedule and that corrected for those randomised under the incorrect stratum. Parents who withdrew their children from the study and provided permission to use their data were included in the analysis to the point of withdrawal. Parents who withdrew their children and did not provide permission for their data to be used were excluded from the analysis. Because we anticipated few missing data, no imputation of missing data was done. All analyses were two-sided with a 5% significance level. Results are presented as incidence rate ratios (IRRs), odds ratios (ORs), or hazard ratios (HRs) as appropriate, with corresponding 95% CIs. To assess the effect of <italic>ALOX5</italic> genotype on urinary leukotriene E<sub>4</sub>, data were first log<sub>10</sub> transformed to normalise distribution. Groups were compared with either ANOVA and Dunnett's multiple comparisons test, or with <italic>t</italic> test using GraphPad Prism version 6.00 for Windows (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA).

Baseline demographic characteristics were similar between treatment groups. The per-protocol analysis included 1297 children. 11 children were excluded who had been incorrectly randomised and the strata was corrected for two children who were randomised with incorrect strata. There were no major differences in baseline variables between children in the placebo and montelukast groups or between the two genetic strata (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>).

There was no significant difference in urinary leukotriene E4 between the 5/5 and 5/x genotypes, or the 5/5 and 5/x+x/x genotypes (data not shown).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="cesec100"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our findings show that intermittent montelukast treatment, although not associated with side-effects, did not reduce unscheduled medical attendances for wheeze episodes in children younger than 5 years. These results are in line with those of Bacharier and colleagues,<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> who reported that intermittent montelukast in young children with wheeze does not increase the proportion of episode-free days or decrease the proportion of children who need urgent medical care, and with those of Valovirta and colleagues<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> who noted that intermittent montelukast does not reduce the number of wheeze episodes culminating in need for unscheduled medical care or rescue oral corticosteroids. Use of oral steroid rescue therapy in our study was much lower than unscheduled medical attendances for wheeze episodes. We postulate that this finding shows a change in UK prescribing practice in view of studies reporting oral steroids to be ineffective in acute wheeze in young children.<xref rid="bib4 bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4,16</sup></xref> We recorded a reduction in use of oral corticosteroid in children given montelukast, but in the context of present UK prescribing practice, the clinical significance of a change in this indirect marker of wheeze severity is unclear. Our results differ to those from Robertson and colleagues<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> who, in a subgroup analysis, showed that intermittent montelukast is effective in reducing unscheduled use of health-care resources in children aged 2&#x02013;5 years. To resolve these contradictory findings, we did a meta-analysis of trials of intermittent montelukast for unscheduled medical attendances for wheeze episodes (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>). Findings of this meta-analysis showed no benefit of a 12 month period of intermittent montelukast therapy on unscheduled medical attendances for wheeze (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>). This outcome suggests that intermittent montelukast is not an effective treatment strategy for treatment of young children with a history of two or more episodes of wheeze (<xref rid="box1" ref-type="boxed-text">panel</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, the 95% CI of the IRR for unscheduled medical attendances for wheeze excluded a 33% reduction in such attendances. However, the fewer unscheduled medical attendances in the montelukast group, albeit non-significant, suggests heterogeneity of treatment response&#x02014;a characteristic of previous studies in young children with wheeze. For example, response to continuous inhaled corticosteroids is most favourable in the subgroup of white males with an unscheduled medical attendance for wheeze in the previous 12 months and aeroallergen sensitisation.<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> Furthermore, in Bacharier and colleagues' study,<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> intermittent montelukast, despite having no overall benefit, reduced the area under the curve for wheezing score in children with a positive asthma predictive index, defined as four or more wheezing episodes with at least one diagnosed by a doctor, and one or more major criteria of parental asthma, doctor-diagnosed dermatitis, allergic sensitisation to one or more aeroallergen, or at least two minor criteria of allergic sensitisation to milk, egg, or peanuts; wheeze unrelated to colds; and blood eosinophils greater than 4%.<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> We did not stratify by asthma predictive index because Meyer and colleagues<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> reported that no clinical variable predicts response to continuous montelukast in wheeze in young children, and blood sampling, in our experience, greatly reduces the willingness of parents to enter their infants into a therapeutic trial. Furthermore, use of parental-reported diagnosis for disorders such as eczema overestimates physician-diagnosed disease.<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> As such, we cannot exclude montelukast responsiveness in children with a positive asthma predictive index. However, our prespecified subgroup analyses showed that neither the pattern of wheeze nor use of inhaled corticosteroids was associated with montelukast response, although our study was not powered for these interactions.</p><p>In adults with asthma, heterogeneity in response to montelukast is associated with a polymorphism in the <italic>ALOX5</italic> promoter.<xref rid="bib14 bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14,15</sup></xref> In line with these studies in adults, we recorded a 20% reduction in unscheduled medical attendances for wheeze in children in the montelukast group with the 5/5 <italic>ALOX5</italic> promoter genotype, and no effect of intermittent montelukast in those with the 5/x+x/x genotype. The montelukast-responsive genotype (5/5) in the present study is, however, different from our a-priori hypothesis, as suggested by the 5/x+x/x grouping from Lima and colleagues' study.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> But other studies in adults report montelukast responsiveness of the 5/5 genotype. For example, Telleria and colleagues<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> reported decreased asthma exacerbations and improved lung function in adults with the 5/5 genotype who were given montelukast, and Drazen and colleagues<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> showed that ABT-761 (a 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor) improved lung function in adults with the 5/5 genotype, but not in those with the x/x genotype. We sought support for a differential response to montelukast between genotypes by measurement of urinary leukotriene E<sub>4</sub>.<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> In the only study in children to date, Mougey and colleagues<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> measured urinary leukotriene E<sub>4</sub> and identified <italic>ALOX5</italic> polymorphism status in 270 6&#x02013;17-year-old children with poorly controlled asthma enrolled into a 6 month (negative) trial of acid-reflux treatment. Children with the x/x genotype (73% of whom were receiving montelukast) had significantly higher concentrations of urinary leukotriene E<sub>4</sub>, worse forced expiratory volume in 1 s, and a trend for poorer asthma control than those with the 5/5+5/x genotypes.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> Similarly, we recorded increased urinary leukotriene E<sub>4</sub> in children with the x/x genotype compared with those with the 5/5 or 5/5+5/x genotypes. These data provide support for a differential response to montelukast between 5/5 and x/x genotypes; however, they do not explain a differential response between the 5/x and 5/5 genotypes. We postulate that differences in production of cysteinyl leukotriene between 5/x and 5/5 genotypes might be shown during children's wheeze episodes when cysteinyl leukotriene production is increased.<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref></p><p>These data do not support the routine use of intermittent montelukast for wheeze in children aged 10 months to 5 years.

We therefore sought to establish the efficacy of intermittent montelukast in young children with wheeze. Because young children with wheeze exhibit marked heterogeneity in response to montelukast, and in adults, copy numbers of the GGGCGG Sp1 binding motif in the arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase (<italic>ALOX5</italic>) gene promoter (either 5/5, 5/x, or x/x, in which x does not equal 5) are associated with heterogeneity in montelukast response,<xref rid="bib14 bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14,15</sup></xref> we stratified the trial by 5/5 and 5/x+x/x genotypes. Our findings show that intermittent montelukast is no better than placebo for reducing the need for unscheduled medical attention in young children with a history of clinically severe wheeze. Evidence suggested that children with the 5/5 genotype might be responsive to intermittent montelukast treatment. For clinicians, these data suggest that intermittent montelukast should not be routinely used to treat wheeze in young children.
