Copeptin and NSE levels were measured from serum samples collected 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 168 hours after birth from 75 term neonates diagnosed with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) and treated with therapeutic hypothermia for 72 hours. In addition, serum copeptin levels after birth were measured from 10 HIE diagnosed neonates, who were randomized to the normothermic arm of the TOBY cohort. All neonates underwent neurodevelopmental assessment using the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development-II at two years of age. Copeptin levels were highest at 6 hours after birth and steadily decreased, whereas the highest NSE levels were measured at 24 hours after birth. The biomarker levels correlated with blood-gas parameters (base excess, pH and lactate) at 6 and 12 hours after birth. Copeptin and NSE levels in the early postnatal period were significantly higher in neonates with poor outcome compared to those with favorable outcome at two years of age. Furthermore, in the TOBY cohort, copeptin levels were significantly lower in hypothermic compared to normothermic neonates. To conclude, copeptin and NSE measured in the early postnatal period are potential prognostic biomarkers of long-term neurodevelopmental outcome in term neonates diagnosed with HIE and treated with therapeutic hypothermia.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERC-2013-AdG 341116</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kaila</surname><given-names>Kai</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>Funding of work and materials for serum biomarker analyses was provided by the European Research Council (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://erc.europa.eu/">https://erc.europa.eu/</ext-link>) grant number ERC-2013-AdG 341116 (KK).</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="3"/><table-count count="1"/><page-count count="11"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>The relevant data are within the paper and at Dryad at the following DOI: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.387n8">10.5061/dryad.387n8</ext-link>.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>The relevant data are within the paper and at Dryad at the following DOI: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.387n8">10.5061/dryad.387n8</ext-link>.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is a significant cause of mortality and morbidity, occurring in 1.5 out of 1000 infants in developed countries [<xref rid="pone.0184593.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Therapeutic hypothermia was shown to improve neurological outcome, and is now the standard method of care for infants with HIE [<xref rid="pone.0184593.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, at least half of these infants still have an unfavorable outcome, and putative adjuvant therapies are widely studied [<xref rid="pone.0184593.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. There is pressing demand for reliable biomarkers to guide early clinical decisions, and to help counsel parents. Useful and reliable biomarkers of outcome after HIE would need to have high specificity and sensitivity, to be of use in clinical settings, and to be readily available for fast assays within the time window of therapeutic decisions.</p><p>Studies focusing on early biomarkers are being carried out using a wide range of approaches. For instance, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a promising tool to predict outcome, but its availability is limited [<xref rid="pone.0184593.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Moreover, the timing of an MRI scan usually exceeds the immediate postnatal period. Amplitude-integrated EEG is also used for prognosis, but its predictive value is modest [<xref rid="pone.0184593.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. As cerebrospinal fluid samples are not feasible for routine use, and saliva or urine samples have not been widely studied, serum samples remain the most reasonable source of putative novel biomarkers of neonatal HIE. Several prognostic biomarkers of HIE have already been investigated and, in light of available data [<xref rid="pone.0184593.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0184593.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], neuron-specific enolase (NSE), a glycolytic enzyme from neurons and neuroendocrine cells, appears promising.</p><p>In this study, we have investigated copeptin, the biochemically stable C-terminal fragment of prepro-arginine vasopressin (AVP), as a novel biomarker to predict long-term neurodevelopmental outcome after birth asphyxia, with parallel comparative assays of NSE. Copeptin has been found to be predictive in several conditions affecting the brain, such as stroke and traumatic brain injury [<xref rid="pone.0184593.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0184593.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Notably, AVP is released from the pituitary to the circulation following activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA-axis) in response to stressful stimuli [<xref rid="pone.0184593.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In line with the pronounced fetal endocrine activation at birth, extremely high copeptin concentrations in the neonate blood have been found after vaginal birth [<xref rid="pone.0184593.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and copeptin levels are further elevated following birth asphyxia [<xref rid="pone.0184593.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0184593.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The specific aim of this work was to study the levels of, and relationship between, NSE and copeptin concentrations as well as blood acid-base parameters in the early postnatal hours in infants with HIE treated with therapeutic hypothermia, and to examine the data in relation to neurodevelopmental outcome at two years of age. The material in this study also permitted examining the effect of therapeutic hypothermia on serum levels of copeptin.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Study design and patients</title><p>The study was conducted at a tertiary neonatal unit of the 1<sup>st</sup> Department of Pediatrics at Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary. Ethical approval was obtained from the Hungarian National Ethics Committee for Medical Research (TUKEB 591/KO/2004 and TUKEB 11790-2/2016/EKU 0235/16). Informed consent was obtained from all parents of the neonates who were enrolled in the study. 110 term neonates diagnosed with birth asphyxia born between 2005 and 2011 were included in the study. Of the 110 neonates, 35 were excluded due to no or shortened period of cooling (n = 22), congenital malformation (n = 1), sudden infant death syndrome (n = 1), subdural bleed (n = 1), intrauterine growth restriction (n = 1), prematurity (n = 4), and no follow-up (n = 5), leaving 75 neonates for the final analysis. Clinical criteria for diagnosing moderate-to-severe HIE, and treatment with moderate whole-body cooling were defined as follows: (i) at least one of the following: continued need for ventilation at 10 mins after birth; 5 minute Apgar score &#x02264; 5; pH &#x0003c; 7.0 or base excess (BE) &#x02264; -16 mmol/L within 60 min after birth, and (ii) altered level of consciousness, and at least one of the following: hypotonia, abnormal reflexes, or seizures [<xref rid="pone.0184593.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].

For the analyses on the effect of cooling on copeptin levels we used data from an additional 10 normothermic neonates from 2005&#x02013;2006 who were randomized to the non-cooled group in the international TOBY trial [<xref rid="pone.0184593.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].

Blood samples were then centrifuged/separated, and all of the serum samples, including those from the TOBY trial, were immediately frozen and kept at -80&#x000b0;C until analysis. On average, four samples per patient were collected and analyzed. In total, 453 and 452 serum samples were analyzed for copeptin and NSE, respectively. Copeptin and NSE concentrations were measured by the B.R.A.H.M.S. KRYPTOR Compact PLUS (Thermo Scientific) in November 2015. Considering the remarkable biochemical stability of copeptin [<xref rid="pone.0184593.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], we have no reason to assume that the biomarker concentrations would be significantly affected by long-term storage at -80&#x000b0;C.

The main aim of this work was to test the utility of copeptin and NSE as prognostic biomarkers of HIE in a cohort of asphyxiated neonates treated with therapeutic hypothermia for 72 hours.</p><p>Our study was carried out in a tertiary care center with exclusively ex-utero infants, which precluded blood sampling immediately after birth, but the data obtained from the 6<sup>th</sup> to the 168<sup>th</sup> postnatal hour showed a progressive decline in the serum copeptin concentrations in the study population, indicating that the majority of AVP/copeptin is released at birth, but taking into account the approximately 30 minute half-life of copeptin [<xref rid="pone.0184593.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], a significant amount of AVP/copeptin release is still ongoing during the hours and days after birth in these HIE-diagnosed neonates. In a study by Schlapbach <italic>et al</italic>. the median copeptin concentration in the umbilical cord blood serum of asphyxiated neonates was 919 pmol/l [<xref rid="pone.0184593.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and in the present study the median at six hours after birth 314 pmol/l, further demonstrating that the bulk AVP/copeptin release occurs at birth.

Notably, the serum levels of both biomarkers showed a robust, statistically significant correlation with blood-gas parameters (negative base excess, low pH, and high lactate) at 6 and 12 hours after birth.</p><p>The most important finding in the present study is that high levels of both copeptin and NSE are predictive of poor outcome at two years of age. Moreover, using the two biomarkers in combination showed an even higher level of accuracy in the ROC curve analysis. To our knowledge, this is the first study of copeptin and long-term neurodevelopmental outcome, while several previous studies have looked at the relationship between NSE levels and neurodevelopmental outcome [<xref rid="pone.0184593.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0184593.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0184593.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0184593.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], with promising but also some conflicting results. Nagdyman <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0184593.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] state that NSE concentrations did not supply reliable information about neurodevelopmental outcome after birth asphyxia, whereas other studies have reported that serum NSE levels have predictive capacity for poor outcome [<xref rid="pone.0184593.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0184593.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0184593.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Considering the fact that both high copeptin and high NSE concentrations were predictive of poor neurodevelopmental outcome, it is no surprise that a significant correlation between copeptin and NSE levels was found at all time points studied.</p><p>The present study population, which included samples from the original TOBY trial [<xref rid="pone.0184593.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], provided us also with the unique opportunity to examine the effects of therapeutic hypothermia on copeptin concentrations after birth. We have already shown [<xref rid="pone.0184593.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] that there were no differences in NSE levels between these normothermic and hypothermic neonates. Interestingly, copeptin levels were significantly higher in normothermic neonates compared to hypothermic neonates at 6 hours after birth, indicating that therapeutic hypothermia decreases the peripheral release of copeptin. This is in agreement with the fact that AVP neurons are intrinsically thermosensitive and hypothermia seems to inhibit their activity [<xref rid="pone.0184593.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0184593.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Given the protective role of the fetal HPA-axis activation during birth [<xref rid="pone.0184593.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0184593.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], this raises the important question, to be analyzed in further studies, of whether the hypothermia induced decrease in AVP secretion is beneficial.</p><p>Although both biomarkers were predictive of poor long-term outcome in these neonates, we propose that copeptin is a more promising, clinically relevant biomarker for several reasons. First of all, the physiological mechanisms of fetal AVP release during birth, and birth asphyxia, are well understood [<xref rid="pone.0184593.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. A massive surge of AVP release takes place during normal vaginal birth in response to activation of the fetal HPA-axis, and this release is further accentuated by various kinds of stressors [<xref rid="pone.0184593.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0184593.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0184593.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], including birth asphyxia [<xref rid="pone.0184593.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0184593.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Furthermore, in a very recent paper, Wellmann <italic>et al</italic>. showed that even a few contractions induced by exogenous oxytocin before primary cesarean section are enough to increase the copeptin concentrations in the umbilical cord serum of the neonate, indicating that AVP release is directly linked to transient periods of hypoxia [<xref rid="pone.0184593.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Secondly, the time course of AVP/copeptin release, with highest levels measured in umbilical cord serum followed by a progressive decline in serum concentrations, is an advantageous property of an early biomarker, assisting in clinical decisions regarding treatment of asphyxiated neonates already in the first hours after birth. In contrast, in the present and in previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0184593.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0184593.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0184593.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], NSE levels peaked several hours or even a day after birth, at which point initial clinical decisions have already been made. Finally, a practical advantage of copeptin is that it is already widely used as a biomarker of various pathophysiological states in adult patients [<xref rid="pone.0184593.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], and therefore this approach can be easily adapted to neonatal intensive care units.</p><p>To conclude, in this study both copeptin and NSE were identified as promising prognostic biomarkers of neurodevelopmental outcome after HIE. The prognostic value of these biomarkers and their combination needs to be validated in a prospective, independent, large multicenter study, including umbilical cord serum samples and samples collected within the first 12 hours of life, which is a realistic time frame also in many tertiary neonatal units. Furthermore, future research should aim at analyzing the samples within a year of collection to exclude possible effects of long-term storage on biomarker concentrations. Using these serum biomarkers may turn out to be useful in the prediction of the long-term consequences of hypoxic ischemic insult, in assistance in clinical decision making, in selecting patients for further neuroprotective trials, in monitoring the progress of the disease, and in counseling the parents [<xref rid="pone.0184593.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0184593.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].
