Study 1 (phase 1a) comprised both single ascending dose (SAD) and multiple ascending dose (MAD) experiments in healthy subjects, whereas study 2 was performed in ESRD patients on hemodialysis.</p><p id="p0035">Study 1 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled dose escalation study. In the SAD part, ASP3325 was administered as a single dose in the dose range of 1 to 600 mg. There were a total of 12 cohorts, each with 6 subjects who received ASP3325 and 2 who received placebo. The study included healthy Japanese male and female subjects and 2 cohorts of Caucasian subjects receiving 10 or 100 mg ASP3325 or matching placebo. The study medication was administered under fasting conditions. Finally, 1 cohort received 100 mg ASP3325 or matching placebo under fed conditions. The study was completed with an end-of-study visit (follow-up examination) on day&#x000a0;7.</p><p id="p0040">In the MAD part, healthy Japanese male and female subjects were administered ASP3325 or placebo as multiple doses, at doses of 10, 30, and 100 mg 3 times daily for 7 days. The study medication was administered 5 minutes after completion of a meal. In each cohort, 8 healthy subjects received ASP3325 and 4 subjects received placebo. The study was completed with an end-of-study visit on day 13 (follow-up examination) after final discharge.

The study subjects consumed standardized meals with known phosphorus and calcium content during hospitalization. Urinary phosphate excretion was measured in both studies, whereas fecal phosphorus excretion was measured only in the MAD study. The study and data collection were conducted at Sumida Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.</p><p id="p0050">Study 2 (phase 1b) was conducted in hyperphosphatemic ESRD patients undergoing hemodialysis and was a randomized, 2-arm, open-label study to evaluate the pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and safety of multiple oral dosing of ASP3325 100 mg 3 times daily before or just after each meal for 2 weeks. Twenty subjects with a serum phosphate level of&#x000a0;&#x02265; 6.0 and&#x000a0;&#x0003c; 10.0 mg/dl after washout with phosphate binders, and an increase of&#x000a0;&#x02265; 1.5 mg/dl from the first day of the washout period, were randomized to the before-meal or after-meal group in a 1:1 ratio. The washout period lasted 1 week, and it was extended to a maximum of 2 weeks if not all phosphate-related inclusion criteria were met. Blood samples were collected at day 1, day 3, day 5, day 8, day 10, day 12, day 15, at the follow-up examination, and at the time of discontinuation.

Diarrhea and vomiting were TEAEs reported in&#x000a0;&#x02265; 2 subjects (n&#x000a0;= 2, each). Permanent discontinuation caused by TEAEs was reported in 2 subjects (10.5%). All of these events were mild or moderate in severity and were considered related to the study drug. No notable safety concerns were identified in vital signs, clinical laboratory evaluations, or electrocardiograms.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>Discussion</title><p id="p0135">The present study is the first to report on the efficacy and safety of a specific NPT-IIb inhibitor (ASP3325) for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia in ESRD patients. Although no concerns were raised in terms of safety and tolerability, ASP3325 failed to influence the primary efficacy assessments, namely, urinary phosphate and fecal phosphorous excretion in healthy subjects and serum phosphate levels in ESRD patients. ASP3325 also failed to reduce other biomarkers of disordered phosphate metabolism; for example, the mean FGF23 level increased rather than decreased, as would have been expected if intestinal phosphate absorption were reduced.<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> Thus, it is unlikely that ASP3325 is able to effect downstream benefits of FGF23 lowering in ESRD patients, which were associated with improvements in cardiovascular outcomes as shown in a <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis of the Evaluation of Cinacalcet HCl Therapy to Lower Cardiovascular Events (EVOLVE) study.<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref></p><p id="p0140">The lack of efficacy of ASP3325 sharply contrasts with a preceding nonclinical study that demonstrated a robust effect in mitigating hyperphosphatemia in several rat models.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> Studies in mice harboring a deletion of the <italic>Npt2b</italic> gene indicate that NPT-IIb&#x02212;mediated phosphate transport accounts for up to 50% of total intestinal phosphate reabsorption, and that <italic>Npt2b</italic> gene ablation mitigates hyperphosphatemia in mice with renal failure.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> Differences in intestinal phosphate transport among species could therefore possibly explain our negative clinical findings. Indeed, the relevance of NPT-IIb in human intestinal phosphate transport has not been proved, and data on its expression level and localization in the human small intestine are scarce. Insufficient drug exposure may be another reason, but is contradicted by pharmacokinetic simulations indicating intestinal drug exposure exceeding the inhibitor concentration above 90% (IC90, derived from <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic> studies) in the ESRD patient study. The lack of ASP3325 specificity should also be considered, especially because inhibition of the renal transporters NPT-IIa or NPT-IIc could offset a reduction of urinary phosphate excretion in healthy subjects because of the systemic absorption of ASP3325. However, the inhibition of these transporters would be expected to decrease serum phosphate levels in the healthy volunteers, and it cannot explain the null findings in ESRD patients in whom renal elimination of phosphate is typically negligible. Unpublished <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic> data also confirmed the specificity for NPT-IIb without relevant inhibitory effects on NPT-IIa or NPT-IIc. Finally, the lack of target engagement in the intestine remains a possibility; intestinal target engagement has not been proved and is critical for efficacy, because NPT-IIb expression in enterocytes is luminal, and its inhibition with ASP3325 does not warrant systemic exposure. Nevertheless, the physicochemical properties of ASP3325 did not indicate impaired intestinal solubility as a potential reason for insufficient target engagement.</p><p id="p0145">Nicotinamide is a marketed drug with anti-inflammatory and cholesterol-lowering properties, which also reduces serum phosphate levels in hemodialysis patients.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> A postulated mechanism of action involves negative transcriptional regulation of NPT-IIb. Such a mechanism is inconsistent with our findings, which failed to demonstrate a role of NPT-IIb in the regulation of serum phosphate. The phosphate-lowering capacity of nicotinamide may therefore be attributed to other pleiotropic effects.<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> Alternatively, the possibility remains that nicotinamide offers a superior target engagement as compared to ASP3325.</p><p id="p0150">Importantly, inactivating mutations of the <italic>NPT-IIb</italic> gene in humans cause a syndrome termed pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis that is predominantly characterized by interstitial lung calcifications.<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> These patients have normal serum phosphate levels, presumably due to compensatory renal mechanisms. To date, there are no reported cases of pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis with severe impairments in renal function to support the assumption that NPT-IIb becomes progressively more important when normal homeostatic mechanisms are no longer operational (e.g., in renal failure). Our results indicate that NPT-IIb plays a small or negligible role in humans under such circumstances.</p><p id="p0155">Currently marketed phosphate binders have several disadvantages, such as a large pill burden and low drug adherence,<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> gastrointestinal side effects,<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> and risk of metal accumulation.<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Clinical experience further suggests a maximum achievable reduction in serum phosphate level of approximately 2.0 mg/dl, which invariably leads to persistent hyperphosphatemia in many ESRD patients. The fundamental premise of any NPT-IIb inhibitor is to overcome these limitations and ultimately to improve hyperphosphatemia management. The current results cast a shadow on the future prospects of NPT-IIb inhibitors.</p><p id="p0160">The present study has some limitations inherent to phase 1 studies, including a relatively small sample size and short treatment duration. The sample size and 2-week treatment duration in ESRD patients should nevertheless be sufficient to detect a clinically relevant pharmacodynamic signal based on the dynamics of phosphate transport, and as evidenced in previous clinical studies with phosphate binders.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Finally, the study involving ESRD patients was limited by its open-label design and lack of a control arm. The strengths of the present study include a thorough evaluation of the total body phosphorus balance in healthy subjects (i.e., standardized food intake with known phosphorous and calcium content, urine excretion, fecal excretion, and serum level) under standardized conditions in a residential setting.</p><p id="p0165">In conclusion, the role of orally administered NPT-IIb inhibitors for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia is uncertain and merits further investigation. It will be critical to establish whether our findings are compound specific or can be generalized to other development candidates.</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>Disclosure</title><p id="p0170">TEL and RAS are employees of Astellas Pharma Europe BV.
