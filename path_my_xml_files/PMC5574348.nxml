function, cognitive function, and self-expression of the elderly with dementia, and then
identify the influencing factors on self-expression in sub-factors of dependent variables.
[Subjects and Methods] Forty elderly persons were divided into two groups: intervention
group (n=20) and control group (n=20). The interventions were applied to the subjects 3
times a week, 50 minutes per each time, for a total of five weeks. We measured the jamar
hand dynamometer test for grip strength, the jamar hydraulic pinch gauge test for
prehension test, nine-hole pegboard test for coordination test, and Loewenstein
Occupational Therapy Cognitive Assessment-Geriatric Population for cognitive function, and
self-expression rating scale for self-expression test. [Results] The task-oriented
activities promoted hand function, cognitive function (visual perception, spatial
perception, visuomotor organization, attention &#x00026; concentration) and self-expression of
the elderly with early dementia, and the factors influencing the self-expression were
cognitive function (visual perception) and hand function (coordination). The study showed
that the task-oriented program enabled self-expression by improving hand function and
cognitive function. [Conclusion] This study suggested that there should be provided the
task-oriented program for prevention and treatment of the elderly with early dementia in
the clinical settings and it was considered that results have a value as basic data that
can be verified relationship of hand function, cognitive function, and
self-expression.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Dementia</kwd><kwd>Hand function</kwd><kwd>Task-oriented activities</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>In an aging society, dementia is one of the most serious social diseases that can occur to
anyone. Since family, society, and the nation have to care for patients with dementia, it is
critical to have appropriate preventive measures and early treatment of dementia. However,
the degradation of cognitive functions in elderly patients with dementia is difficult to
differentiate from that due to the normal aging process. In addition, the progress of
symptoms is slow, which exacerbates the situation. Currently, no effective treatments have
been found to recover the degradation in cognitive functions at the same level prior to the
onset of the disease<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, a study on
various intervention measures to prevent the progression of symptoms is now needed to depart
from the medical treatment-oriented services whereby dementia is only approached from the
perspective of treating the disease. The statistics show that the severity of dementia in
South Korea is classified into very mild (28.9%), mild (39.2%), moderate (18.5%), and severe
(13.5%) in which very mild and mild dementia account for 68% of all dementia patients.
Although elderly patients with mild dementia will gradually lose interest in hobbies and
intellectual activities and will also experience some problems in instrumental daily
activities, they are able to perform appropriate self-expressions needed for basic daily
activities and to satisfy one&#x02019;s needs. However, as symptoms develop into moderate and severe
levels, patients with dementia will have problems with social activities and experience
decreased ability to work. These symptoms will be accompanied by more aggressive behavior
and easily excited changes in character, thereby incurring excessive medical costs and
increasing the care-giving burden on family members. Accordingly, early interventions
beginning with mild dementia could alleviate and prevent problematic behavioral changes in
character and emotions, and the degradation of cognitive functions and the performance of
daily activities, thereby delaying the development into severe dementia and improving the
quality of life for the individual<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Early
intervention can also prevent the family from making personal sacrifices due to long-term
care-giving, which leads to physical fatigue, depression, anxiety, and limitations on their
interpersonal and social activities. It can also alleviate social and economic burdens by
reducing the national public funding provided to dementia patients. As described above, the
most critical point in the prevention and management of elderly patients with mild dementia
is early diagnosis and intervention.</p><p>A task-oriented activity is a task-specialized strategy<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup> that takes into consideration the patient&#x02019;s learning ability and
helps patients with dementia to achieve goal-oriented tasks, rather than performing simple
and repetitive actions. Meaningful tasks are selected based on the patient&#x02019;s individual
characteristics, and practical and familiar tools are used<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Furthermore, such activities can improve concentration,
expressiveness, thinking ability, and social behaviors by increasing execution abilities
appropriate for specific tasks and environments, thereby inducing activation of cognitive
functions and stimulating an undamaged part of the brain<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Hands are responsible for 30% of all brain activities. Through
touch and experiencing various objects directly, much information is delivered to the
brain<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition to stimulating and
drawing on the brain&#x02019;s functions, the hands also play an essential role in social
interactions as symbols of communication and a means of expression. A single nerve cell that
is responsible for hand movements is connected to another 1,000 to 3,000 nerve cells to
induce interactions between the nervous system and the cerebral cortex, which is the higher
center responsible for developing and strengthening new synapse networks<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. That is, hand movements affect the motor
region in the cerebral cortex that requests active processing of sensory information as well
as activation in the cognition-related region<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. If visual, auditory, tactile, and proprioceptive senses are
employed appropriately within a given task activity based on the plasticity of the neural
networks in the brain, it can help patients to recover their motor ability<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup> or learn new motor functions. Thus, a
task-oriented activity that employs the hands as instrumental functions can improve the hand
functions of elderly patients with dementia. This will also improve their cognitive
functions through the thinking process where attention, understanding, judgment, and
cognition are needed, which are all essential for completing tasks. Moreover, a
task-oriented activity can embody internal desire, motivation, and thoughts in patients with
structured themes, while taking a retrospect of their past life, thereby inducing empathic
environments and spontaneous stories<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Thus, the present paper conducted a study on a task-oriented activity that actively
facilitates self-expression by stimulating brain functions and activating cognitive
functions as a thinking process to complete tasks through repetitive hand activities that
were productive and creative as well as intimate and familiar. The purpose of the present
study was to apply the task-oriented activity program to elderly patients with mild dementia
to determine its effect on self-expression and, consequently, identify the factors that
affected self-expression.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects in this study were elderly patients, 70&#x02005;years or older, with mild dementia who
agreed to participate in the study after providing fully informed consent. The selection
criteria of the subjects were as follows: a score on the global deterioration scale (GDS) of
4 or lower, no visual and auditory disabilities, a mini-mental state examination-Korea
(MMSE-K) score in the range of 18 to 21 points, and the ability to follow the researcher&#x02019;s
instructions. For the experimental group, selection criteria were those who consented not to
participate in other physical and cognitive activity programs within the institution during
the research period. The present study divided 40 elderly persons into a program group
(n=20) who performed the task-oriented activities and a control group (n=20). The activities
were performed three times a week for 50 minutes for five weeks, resulting in a total of 15
activity performances. The gender make-up in the task-oriented activity program group was 14
females and six males, and the age range was 80 to 85&#x02005;years old. The chronic diseases
included three of diabetes mellitus, four of hypertension, and one of low back pain. The
gender make-up in the control group was 16 females and four males, and the age range was 80
to 85&#x02005;years old. The chronic diseases were two of diabetes mellitus, seven of hypertension,
and three of low back pain.</p><p>For the grip-strength test, the JAMAR hand dynamometer was used. This test measured changes
in the hands&#x02019; grip force after trauma or disease. The measured postures were shoulder joint
adduction, elbow joint flexed at 90&#x000b0;, forearm in a neutral position, wrist extension at
0&#x02013;30&#x000b0;, and ulnar deviation at 0&#x02013;15&#x000b0;. The measured value was the mean of the three
measurements and its unit was in kilograms (kg). If the subjects felt tired, 30 seconds of
rest was given between measurements. The dominant hand was measured first. For the
prehension test, a pinch gauge (JAMAR hydraulic pinch gauge) was employed. This test
measured the muscle strength of the fingers via a three-jaw pinch by making the index and
middle fingers in opposition to the thumb, a tip pinch in which the tips of the index finger
and thumb are in contact with each other, and a lateral pinch in which the thumb opposes the
lateral side of the index finger to make a key-gripping shape. The measured postures were
shoulder joint adduction, elbow joint flexed at 90&#x000b0;, forearm in a neutral position, wrist
extension at 0&#x02013;30&#x000b0;, and ulnar deviation at 0&#x02013;15&#x000b0; while sitting in a chair. The measured
value was the mean of the three measurements and its unit was in&#x02005;kg. If the subjects felt
tired, 30 seconds of rest were given between measurements. The dominant hand was measured
first. For the coordination test, a nine-hole pegboard test was conducted. The used tools
were a wooden stick (32&#x02005;mm in length and 9&#x02005;mm in diameter) and a wooden plate with nine
holes (a gap of 15&#x02005;mm and a 3 &#x000d7; 3 array of holes). In this measurement method, the subjects
inserted nine wooden sticks in each of the nine holes one at a time and then removed the
nine sticks one at a time, regardless of the order of insertion and removal. The completion
times were measured. The dominant hand was measured first. For the cognition test, the
Loewenstein Occupational Therapy Cognitive Assessment-Geriatric Population (LOTCA-G) was
conducted. The measured items consisted of 24 items: orientation (two), visual perception
(four), spatial perception (three), motor praxis (three), visuomotor organization (six),
thinking operations (two), memory (three), and attention and concentration (one). The score
of each item can range from one to four, with the exception of the orientation items whose
score ranges from one to eight. The higher the score, the better the cognitive functions.
For the self-expression test, the self-expression rating scale was conducted. The items
consisted of 20 questions: verbal self-expression (nine questions), vocal self-expression
(seven questions), and non-verbal self-expression (four questions). In the present study,
they were modified to passive attitude (eight questions), relational attitude (five
questions), and emotional attitude (three questions). The scale was scored from one point to
five points. The higher the score, the worse the self-expression. In reverse, the lower the
score, the better the self-expression.</p><p>The task-oriented activity program consisted of: 1) large motor activities using both
hands, stretching, grasping and releasing; 2) small motor activities using both hands,
stretching, grasping/gripping, releasing, and manipulating; and 3) self-expression
activities that expressed one&#x02019;s own thoughts and emotions naturally through stretching,
grasping/gripping, releasing, manipulation, and the use of both hands.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>A difference in hand functions before and after the activities showed that the experimental

requests, which improves cognitive functions and stimulates the brain by facilitating a
thinking process needed to perform a task. In addition, by using suitable tasks that
positively affect the hand functions of elderly patients with dementia, the frequency of
hand use and sensory awareness are increased. The purpose of the present study was to apply
the task-oriented activity program to elderly patients with mild dementia to determine its
effect on self-expression and, consequently, identify the factors that affected
self-expression.</p><p>The task-oriented activity program improved the hand functions (grip strength, prehension,
and coordination) of elderly patients with mild dementia. The large motor activities, such
as bouncing a ball on a parachute, throwing a bean bag, striking bowling pins, stacking
cups, and four-season background color stamping, improved hand gripping and picking ability
by naturally stimulating dynamic and stable movements of global muscles. The small motor and
self-expression activities, such as making paper fans, wall-hanging props, mosaics,
multi-purpose racks, masks, eco bags, and self-portraits, plaster molding, body painting,
and pantomime, improved the sophistication and delicacy of hand movements by controlling the
materials&#x02019; properties, direction, and intensity through local muscle-oriented activities.
Previous studies on the hand functions of elderly patients with dementia reported that both
their cognitive functions and hand functions degraded, as their physical movements were
decreased due to weakened muscle strength and myoatrophy<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Roland<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>
reported that when hand movements such as simple flexion and extension of the right index
finger were performed, blood flow increased in the primary motor and somatic sensory areas
of the cerebral hemisphere on the opposite side, and hand functions improved by the
continuous finger movements due to an increase in blood flow in the premotor and motor
association areas in both cerebral hemispheres. Furthermore, horticultural therapy, a
repetitive task activity where tactile stimulation and somatic sensations are most strong,
improved grip strength and prehension, while hand knitting improved micro movements of the
fingers, which support the results of the present study. The previous studies improved the
functional use of the hands by inducing repetitive hand movements, whose attributes were
mostly related to a single task. In contrast, the present study improved hand function by
providing new experiences through various task activities where the level of difficulty
could be controlled. Furthermore, large motor activities induced stability in the trunk and
upper limbs to affect facilitation of hand functions at the distal end.</p><p>The task-oriented activity program improved the cognitive functions of elderly persons with
mild dementia (visual perception, spatial perception, visuomotor organization, and attention
and concentration). The present researchers demonstrated the task activities for each
session, and the subjects practiced the activities once or twice to increase their
understanding and participation in the activities. The final results of the tasks were shown
to the subjects first while explaining the task goals, processes, and methods to facilitate
the motivation of the training and perception of the tasks. At the final stage, the subjects
had time to recollect past episodes among the task activities and share their stories and
empathic support. Furthermore, as the present program progressed from small motor to
self-expression activities, cognitive functions and self-expression were emphasized further
by letting the subjects recollect past experiences and perform task activities along with
delicate hand functions. Previous studies on cognitive functions of elderly persons with
dementia reported that brain functions only improved by increasing the agility of the
fingers or movements that at least maintained the fingers. This is because a considerable
part of the brain&#x02019;s cell tissue is involved with motor nerves that move the fingers and
effect their sensation<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, hand
movements stimulated the frontal lobe, thereby affecting mental functions to a high level.
Furthermore, other studies reported that expressive media activities, such as making a human
facemask, face painting, or doll making, improved memory registration and recollection,
attention and concentration, calculation, and verbal and visuospatial abilities in the
sub-areas of cognitive functions<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>, while
a variety of artistic task-oriented activities supplemented the cognitive deficiency of
elderly persons with dementia and helped vague thoughts and feelings to go away, which
support the results of the present study<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Accordingly, the present study&#x02019;s activity program of small motor
and self-expression tasks facilitated cognitive and execution functions by using various
materials for small motor tasks that recalled past experiences and memories, thereby
inducing the elderly patients with dementia to express his/her thoughts and feelings,.</p><p>The task-oriented activity program improved the self-expression of elderly persons with
mild dementia. The subjects in the present study made an effort to express their thoughts
and feelings by recollecting episodes such as past memories, experiences, feelings, and
reminiscences through task activities such as making a facemask of a favorite person,
expressing vocabulary using body movements, drawing a favorite place on an eco bag, and
making a clay self-portrait while looking at themselves in the mirror. Initially, the
subjects were unfamiliar or unnatural with regard to task expression, but as the session
continued, the subjects became more confident about their task outcomes, expressing, &#x0201c;Is it
pretty?&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;Isn&#x02019;t it excellent?&#x0201d;, or &#x0201c;Please take a picture of this!&#x0201d; At the final stage, the
subjects shared their stories with other subjects about their task outcomes. Previous
studies on the self-expression abilities of elderly persons with dementia showed that group
art therapy through painting caused appropriate movements in global and local muscles of
both hands to facilitate brain activation, and promoted self-expression and communication
abilities by expressing images and reflecting natural internal feeling, thoughts,
mindfulness, and experiences<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Kim<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>claimed that group art therapy with a
recollection technique, such as making a wish, and recalling childhood memories or happy
years from the past, improved visual and verbal self-expression ability, while a structural
recollection technique, such as drawing a picture of one&#x02019;s childhood, making fish in the
sea, or decorating fruit trees together, was also successful in terms of self-expression
with an empathic attitude and mind that naturally recollected past days, which also support
the results of the present study<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Accordingly, the task-oriented activity program based on memory and reminiscence in the
present study helped the elderly people with mild dementia to come up with past memories,
experiences, and recollections to facilitate task activities, and promoted self-expression
through a natural and flexible thinking process by sharing their stories and empathizing
about task outcomes.</p><p>The factors that affected the self-expression of the elderly people with mild dementia were
coordination of the right hand in hand functions and visual perception in the cognitive
functions. The task activities in each session of the present study required the use of both
hands in most cases, and induced an increase in fine coordination, particularly with the
small motor activities, thereby improving performance and the completion of tasks. The
self-expression tasks mainly focused on making or drawing to express the subjects&#x02019; thoughts
or feelings. As sessions progressed, the outcomes of the task evolved from two dimensional
to three dimensional, resulting in integrating visual perception functions. A study by
Chung<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup> presented that coordination
trained through large motor activities facilitated activities that required
micro-manipulation, and using the hands actively processed various sensory information,
thereby activating not only motor-related regions in the cerebral cortex but also cognitive
and perception functions efficiently. Jang<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup> also reported that activities of drawing objects of various shapes
were effective to induce restrained emotions of elderly people with dementia, and to prevent
vague feelings and thoughts and cognitive deficiency, which support the results of the
present study. Thus, the task-oriented activity program in the present study increased the
coordination and visual perception of elderly people with mild dementia, thereby positively
affecting the visual and spatial expression of their thoughts and emotions. Furthermore,
memory and attentive concentration among the cognitive functions of elderly people with mild
dementia deemed to affect the recollection of task order, experiences, and memories from the
past to express the outcome of the task, although the result was not statistically
significant. In future studies, repetitive studies that prove a functional relationship
between other cognitive components that can affect the self-expression of elderly people
with dementia are needed. Thus, the task-oriented program in the present study improved the
hand and cognitive functions of elderly people with mild dementia to enable their
self-expression. In conclusion, the task-oriented program is proposed as an intervention
program for the prevention and treatment of clinical dementia, and valuable as foundational
data that can verify a relationship between hand and cognitive functions and the ability for
self-expression.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Jang</surname><given-names>IM</given-names></name><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>KB</given-names></name><name><surname>Roh</surname><given-names>HJ</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Prevalence and risk factors of dementia and MCI in
