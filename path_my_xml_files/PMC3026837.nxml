To address this gap, candidate biomarkers of microbicide pharmacodynamics and safety were evaluated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of tenofovir gel, the first microbicide to demonstrate significant protection against HIV acquisition.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>30 women were randomized to apply a single daily dose of tenofovir or placebo gel for 14 consecutive days. Anti-HIV activity was measured in cervicovaginal lavage (CVL) on Days 0, 3, 7, 14 and 21 by luciferase assay as a surrogate marker of pharmacodynamics. Endogenous activity against <italic>E. coli</italic> and HSV-2 and concentrations of immune mediators were quantified in CVL as candidate biomarkers of safety. Tenofovir levels were measured in CVL and blood.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A significant increase in anti-HIV activity was detected in CVL from women who applied tenofovir gel compared to their endogenous anti-HIV activity in genital tract secretions on Day 0 and compared to activity in CVL from women in the placebo group. The activity correlated significantly with CVL concentration of tenofovir (r&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.6, p&#x0003c;0.001) and fit a sigmoid E<sub>max</sub> pharmacodynamic model. Anti-HIV activity in CVL from women who applied tenofovir persisted when virus was introduced in semen, whereas endogenous anti-HIV activity decreased. Tenofovir did not trigger an inflammatory response or induce sustained loss in endogenous antimicrobial activity or immune mediators.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Tenofovir gel had no deleterious impact on soluble mucosal immunity. The increased anti-HIV activity in CVL, which persisted in the presence of semen and correlated with tenofovir concentration, is consistent with the efficacy observed in a recent clinical trial. These results promote quantified CVL anti-HIV activity as a surrogate of tissue pharmacodynamics and as a potential biomarker of adherence to product. This simple, feasible and inexpensive bioassay may promote the development of models more predictive of microbicide efficacy.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00594373">NCT00594373</ext-link>

Initial <italic>in vitro</italic> studies of PRO 2000 gel suggested promising activity against HIV-1 and HSV-2, but the microbicide failed to provide significant protection against infection in large-scale efficacy studies. Studies conducted in the presence of seminal plasma and with postcoital sampling may provide a biological rationale for this lack of protection <xref rid="pone.0016475-Keller1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0016475-Keller2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0016475-Patel1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0016475-Keller3" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. We found that 14 daily applications of 0.5% PRO 2000 gel did not result in any significant inflammatory response or loss in endogenous antimicrobial activity of genital tract secretions <xref rid="pone.0016475-Keller2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. However, while sufficient biologically active drug to inhibit HIV and HSV-2 infection was retained in cervicovaginal lavage (CVL) collected following gel application <xref rid="pone.0016475-Keller1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0016475-Keller3" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, the antiviral activity was markedly reduced when virus was introduced in seminal plasma, reflecting interference by seminal proteins with the antiviral activity of PRO 2000 <xref rid="pone.0016475-Patel1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Moreover, the recovered concentration of PRO 2000 and the antiviral activity in CVL collected following sex were significantly diminished compared to CVL collected post-gel application in the absence of sex <xref rid="pone.0016475-Keller3" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p><p>Tenofovir (TFV), an acyclic nucleotide analogue developed for the treatment of HIV, has been formulated as a 1% gel and has advanced as an antiretroviral microbicide for prevention of HIV acquisition. Preclinical studies demonstrated <italic>in vitro</italic> activity against HIV and safety in cell culture, explant and animal models <xref rid="pone.0016475-Rohan1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. TFV effectively blocked transmission of SIV or SHIV in non-human primate models when given as pre- or post-exposure prophylaxis systemically or when applied as an intravaginal gel <xref rid="pone.0016475-Parikh1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0016475-Cranage1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. TFV did not disrupt human epithelial cell tight junctions, induce an inflammatory response <xref rid="pone.0016475-Mesquita1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, or increase the susceptibility of mice to genital herpes following seven daily vaginal applications of gel in preclinical safety studies <xref rid="pone.0016475-Wilson1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. These results contrast with findings obtained from the same safety models with nonoxynol-9 and cellulose sulfate, which increased susceptibility of mice to HSV-2 infection and disrupted tight junctions in a dual chamber model, resulting in increased migration of HIV across an epithelial barrier <xref rid="pone.0016475-Wilson1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p><p>Early clinical studies support the safety and efficacy of TFV vaginal gel. A 14-day course was well tolerated in abstinent and sexually active HIV-negative and HIV-positive women <xref rid="pone.0016475-Mayer1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. In a subsequent Phase II study of 200 sexually active HIV-negative women who applied 1% TFV or placebo gel daily or up to two hours before sex for six months, no statistically significant differences in the development of genital symptoms or in renal function were observed between the groups <xref rid="pone.0016475-Hillier1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Most importantly, a recently completed Phase IIb study, CAPRISA 004, found that 1% TFV gel was effective. In CAPRISA 004, women were instructed to insert one dose of TFV or hydroxyethylcellulose placebo gel within 12 hours before sex and a second dose as soon as possible within 12 hours after sex. HIV incidence in the TFV gel arm (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;445) was 5.6 per 100 women-years compared to 9.1 per 100 women-years in the placebo gel arm (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;444), indicating a 39% reduction in HIV infection (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.017) <xref rid="pone.0016475-AbdoolKarim1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. These promising results support larger efficacy trials. The optimal dosing regimen (daily or coitally-dependent) and delivery system (gel or ring) will require further clinical studies. The development of predictive biomarkers of efficacy will therefore become a critical tool for evaluating different dosing and delivery options and for advancing new products and combinations to clinical studies.</p><p>Building on this background, we evaluated the anti-HIV activity of TFV and concentration of drug in CVL obtained from women during a 14-day study of vaginal TFV gel. In contrast to PRO 2000, which acts luminally, TFV is active only after permeating target cells, where it is phosphorylated to tenofovir diphosphate (TFV-DP). TFV-DP has a long intracellular half-life (&#x0003e;95 hours), which reflects the low permeability of charged nucleotides and low rate of intracellular dephosphorylation <xref rid="pone.0016475-Delaney1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0016475-GarciaLerma1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Thus, the pharmacodynamics (PD) of TFV gel might best be measured by challenging vaginal or cervical tissue <italic>ex vivo</italic> with HIV. However, the limited feasibility of collecting biopsies in clinical trials and the variability in susceptibility of female genital tract tissue to HIV renders this a difficult strategy. An alternative approach is to measure the anti-HIV activity in CVL, which reflects the biological activity of TFV as well as the endogenous antimicrobial activity of female genital tract secretions. Extracellular drug, which may correlate with intracellular concentrations, also could provide a reservoir to protect immune cells in tissue and those that are recruited into the genital tract that may play a critical role in the expansion of the small founder population of infected cells <xref rid="pone.0016475-Haase1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p><p>We also expanded safety studies of TFV by examining the impact of 14 daily vaginal applications of 1% TFV gel on endogenous antimicrobial activity and soluble mediators of mucosal defense. Female genital tract secretions provide endogenous activity against viral (HIV and HSV) and bacterial (<italic>Escherichia coli,</italic> Group B streptococcus and <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>) pathogens <xref rid="pone.0016475-Keller2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0016475-Valore1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0016475-Hein1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0016475-John1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0016475-Venkataraman1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0016475-Levinson1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0016475-Shust1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. This endogenous antimicrobial activity may serve as a biomarker of a healthy genital tract mucosal environment and could be developed as a bioassay to evaluate microbicide safety <xref rid="pone.0016475-Keller2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Microbicides that trigger a loss in endogenous antimicrobial activity could facilitate HIV infection or HSV replication within the genital tract. Additionally, an inflammatory response to microbicides could enhance HIV acquisition through the recruitment and activation of HIV target cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0016475.s002">Checklist S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0016475.s001">Protocol S1</xref>.

Concentrations of immune mediators were log-transformed, where appropriate. Random effects linear regression was used to estimate the effect of treatment and time on average post-baseline marker levels, while also adjusting for baseline (Day 0) levels. Treatment arm was represented in the model as an indicator variable (X&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1 if assigned to TFV arm, 0 if placebo), baseline marker level was represented as a continuous value, and day of treatment (day&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;3, 7, 14, or 21) was represented as a categorical variable. The interaction between treatment and day was also examined for each marker. Subjects contributed up to four follow-up measurements (days 3,7,14, and 21) for analysis, therefore a subject-specific random intercept was used to account for the expected positive correlation between marker levels from the same individual. Parameter estimates and standard errors were based on maximum likelihood estimates. P-values for the fixed effects of treatment and day were generated based on the t-statistic and Kenward-Roger adjusted degrees of freedom. Type 3 tests for the overall effect of day (categorical) were computed as a summary and p-values presented. The <italic>a priori</italic> primary markers of interest in this study (anti-HIV and anti-HSV activity) were evaluated with no adjustment of the p-value for multiple testing. However for the analysis of all 22 candidate biomarkers of safety, we set a more conservative alpha level of 0.01 to identify statistically significant treatment effects and to account for multiple hypothesis testing. In the case of safety biomarkers, we wanted to retain the null hypotheses, therefore the use of a more stringent Bonferroni p-value adjustment threshold (p-value &#x0003c;0.0023) for testing 22 independent immune markers would likely be non-conservative, resulting in false negatives.</p><p>Spearman&#x02019;s correlation coefficients (SCC) were calculated to determine if antimicrobial activity correlated with concentrations of immune mediators and to determine if anti-HIV activity in CVL samples correlated with CVL TFV levels.

These encouraging findings also underscore the need for more predictive biomarkers of microbicide PD and safety for future clinical trials, which will likely become more complex as we strive to achieve higher levels of protection with alternative dosing, varying formulations, and combinations of drugs. The current study indicates that TFV gel does not interfere with soluble mucosal immunity, a biomarker of safety, and that measurement of anti-HIV activity and drug levels in CVL may provide simple and inexpensive assays of PD (drug activity) and PK (drug distribution and clearance) near or at the site of drug action. Measurements of PK and PD in CVL are directly applicable to drugs that act luminally or for products in which the intracellular and extracellular drug pools are in equilibrium. Importantly, results obtained in this study suggest that this approach may also provide insight into drugs such as TFV, which is only active after intracellular modifications and for which the low permeability of the intracellularly charged nucleotide leads to accumulation of phosphorylated drug with a long half-life in the intracellular pool.</p><p>The anti-HIV activity in CVL samples collected after gel use provides a direct measurement of the bioactivity of extracellular drug, which may serve as a reservoir to protect newly recruited immune cells. The importance of this is highlighted by non-human primate studies, which illustrate the central role of these cells in the establishment of infection. Virus crosses the mucosal epithelial barrier within hours to establish a small founder population of infected cells <xref rid="pone.0016475-Haase1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. This founder population then undergoes local expansion during the first week of infection to generate sufficient virus and infected cells to disseminate and establish a systemic infection. Because the number of immune targets within the vagina and cervix is relatively small and spatially dispersed, recruitment and activation of additional target cells is critical to the establishment of infection. Thus, it is important that a sufficient reservoir of extracellular drug be available to block infection of recruited target cells.</p><p>The current study did not include biopsy sampling, but PK data obtained in recently completed clinical studies should provide data to determine whether concentrations of drug in intracellular tissue and extracellular compartments correlate. If this proves true, then CVL sampling could be added to clinical trials and may provide a more realistic and reproducible approach than biopsies for measuring PK and PD in clinical trials. These highly feasible assays could also provide an objective measure of adherence to gel product. The need for better markers of adherence is underscored by the suboptimal results and relatively high false-positive rate for polypropylene applicator staining observed in this study and by the low sensitivity of this technique reported in a previous study <xref rid="pone.0016475-Austin1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. The high degree of interobserver variability suggests that staining of polypropylene applicators is not an effective method of determining compliance among participants enrolled in microbicide trials.</p><p>An unanticipated finding in the CAPRISA 004 trial was the observation that TFV gel provided 51% protection against HSV-2 (Q. Abdool Karim, unpublished data). Prior <italic>in vitro</italic> assays indicated that TFV inhibits HSV only at relatively high concentrations with IC<sub>50</sub> &#x0003e;100 &#x000b5;g/ml (B. Herold, unpublished data), which is consistent with the absence of any increase in the anti-HSV activity of CVL obtained from women in the TFV group when compared to the women in the placebo group. The concentrations of intracellular TFV-DP achieved in CAPRISA 004, however, may have been of sufficient magnitude to protect against HSV-2 infection.</p><p>The persistence of drug and higher levels of anti-HIV activity in CVL obtained at the last study visit (36&#x02013;181 hours post last gel application) may reflect the prolonged half-life of extracellular TFV within the vaginal lumen or release of dephosphorylated drug from intracellular stores (either within cervicovaginal tissue or within the lumen) back into the extracellular luminal space, either via tissue and then into the lumen or into the lumen directly from luminal cells. Both epithelial and immune cells efficiently phosphorylate TFV, and a half-life of several days has been demonstrated <italic>in vitro</italic> in both cell types <xref rid="pone.0016475-Delaney1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. The extent to which TFV-DP is dephosphorylated has not been well established. However, the observation of increased anti-HIV activity in these samples suggests that even in the setting of intermittent gel application, there may be sufficient bioactive drug within the genital tract to provide some protection against HIV infection. The extent of antiviral activity needed for protection, however, is not known.</p><p>Additional limitations of the current study are that it was of short duration and was conducted among sexually abstinent women. Sexual activity may alter the PK and PD of candidate microbicides. In the only postcoital study of microbicide PK and PD, we found that less PRO 2000 was recovered in CVL after sex, which in combination with diminished PRO 2000 activity in the presence of seminal plasma proteins, may have contributed to the loss in antiviral activity <xref rid="pone.0016475-Keller3" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. While semen does not interfere with the antiviral activity of TFV in cell culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016475-g003">Fig. 3</xref>), sexual activity may impact the PK and PD, depending on the timing of gel application and frequency of sex. For example, if gel is applied shortly prior to intercourse, a substantial proportion may be lost due to leakage before or during sex. This may have little impact in the context of consistent daily gel application, but could result in insufficient drug in the setting of intermittent use and frequent sexual exposure. In addition, given that the volume of semen could be as large as the volume of gel within the vagina, the addition of semen may have a substantial dilutional effect on TFV concentrations within the lumen, even if there is no effect of semen on TFV activity, per se. Thus, additional postcoital sampling studies would provide important insights into optimal dosing frequency and may support the postcoital dosing design used in the CAPRISA 004 trial.</p><p>It is noteworthy that while the anti-HIV activity in CVL obtained from women in the TFV group persisted when virus was introduced in human semen, the endogenous anti-HIV activity observed in women who received placebo was significantly reduced. Similar results were observed with postcoital CVL obtained in the absence of PRO 2000 gel application <xref rid="pone.0016475-Keller3" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Possibly, specific enzymes and/or proteases or the high pH of semen inactivate, degrade, or interfere with protective immune mediators present in the female genital secretions resulting in a reduction in endogenous antimicrobial activity.</p><p>In addition to identifying potential biomarkers of microbicide PD and adherence, the current study also suggests that measurements of endogenous antimicrobial activity and immune mediators in CVL may provide additional insights into microbicide safety. We observed no increase in proinflammatory cytokines or chemokines or loss in protective immune mediators or endogenous antimicrobial activity. Although our relatively small sample size may limit our ability to detect subtle changes in concentrations of immune mediators, our results are consistent with the safety of TFV gel demonstrated in the CAPRISA 004 study. While chemokines may block viral entry by binding to CCR5 and contribute to endogenous anti-HIV activity, increases in their expression may paradoxically facilitate infection by increasing target cell availability. This notion is supported by primate studies in which SIV induces the release of MIP-3&#x003b1; in the epithelium, which triggers the release of MIP-1&#x003b2; by plasmacytoid dendritic cells, resulting in subsequent recruitment of CD4+T cells and the generation of a microenvironment conducive to transmission <xref rid="pone.0016475-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>.</p><p>In summary, this work supports the inclusion of quantified anti-HIV activity and drug levels in CVL as biomarkers of PD and PK and soluble mucosal immune mediators and endogenous activity as surrogate markers of safety in early clinical studies. The anti-HIV activity in CVL should be measured with virus introduced in medium and in semen to ensure that the activity is preserved under conditions that more closely simulate what happens during transmission. Ideally, postcoital sampling should be performed as well. Results of these relatively simple assays applied in small clinical studies are consistent with the findings of safety and efficacy of TFV in the CAPRISA 004 study and the finding of safety, but lack of efficacy, in two large PRO 2000 clinical trials.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0016475.s001"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0016475.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0016475.s002"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0016475.s002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank CONRAD and Gilead for providing study product and applicators.
