Pharmacokinetic samples were collected through 24 hours post-dose on days 1 and 28. Multiple pharmacodynamic endpoints were explored with oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT), serum lipid profiles, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for assessment of whole body visceral and subcutaneous fat, maximal aerobic capacity test and muscle 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) for estimation of mitochondrial oxidative capacity.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>SRT2104 was generally safe and well tolerated. Pharmacokinetic exposure increased less than dose-proportionally. Mean Tmax was 2&#x02013;4 hours with elimination half-life of 15&#x02013;20 hours. Serum cholesterol, LDL levels and triglycerides decreased with treatment.

The pre-clinical safety of SRT2104 has been investigated in the bacterial reverse mutation assay (AMES test), mouse lymphoma and mouse micronucleus genetic toxicology models, and in safety pharmacology studies in rats and dogs. SRT2104 was not genotoxic and was not associated with adverse central nervous system, cardiovascular system, or pulmonary effects in these preclinical safety and pharmacology studies. In vitro studies in human liver microsomes and cultured hepatocytes suggest that SRT2104 does not inhibit CYP1A, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, or significantly induce cytochrome P450 isoforms CYP1A and CYP3A4.</p><p>SRT2104 was well tolerated and safe in young healthy volunteers for up to 7 days dosing of 0.03&#x02013;3.0 g/day <xref rid="pone.0051395-Hoffmann1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.

Volunteers were enrolled between 01 Oct 2009 and 5 Feb 2010. Doses of 0.5 and 2.0 g or matching placebo were administered once daily for 28 consecutive days. The selection of the doses investigated in this study was based upon safety and pharmacokinetic data obtained from a previous clinical study involving SRT2104 <xref rid="pone.0051395-Hoffmann1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Suitability of participants was defined on the basis of a medical history, physical examination, vital signs, electrocardiogram and laboratory measurements. Subjects were required to have normal fasting glucose levels (4.4 to 6.0 mmol/L) at screening and a body mass index of at least 18 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and no greater than 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Subjects were ineligible if they had a history of any chronic disease or any clinically significant illness within 3 months of study entry, including any history of renal or liver impairment and/or any endocrine, inflammatory, cardiovascular, gastro-intestinal, neurological, psychiatric, neoplastic or metabolic disease which in the opinion of the investigators could risk subject safety or interpretation of the results. Subjects were deemed ineligible if they participated in any clinical trial with an investigative medicinal product within the past three months prior to the first dose in the current study, had been exposed to more than three new chemical entities within 12 months of enrollment, or used other concomitant medications and herbal products in the previous 3 months that in the opinion of the investigator could interfere with the study procedures or compromise subject safety. Additional exclusions included: women of childbearing potential and non-sterile men, unless they agreed to use acceptable method of contraception; history of alcoholism or drug abuse (including a positive pre-study drug/alcohol test at screening); use of tobacco or nicotine products; history of complications when donating blood or known relative inaccessibility of veins for venipuncture; donation of blood within three months of enrolment; history of significant drug or other allergies. Participants were asked to maintain their usual level of physical activity for the duration of the study.</p><p>Twenty-four participants were planned to 3 parallel treatment arms (SRT2104 0.5 g/day, SRT2104 2.0 g/day, or placebo) and were randomized in a 1&#x02236;1&#x02236;1 ratio to provide evaluable data from 8 subjects in each of the 3 dose panels [see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0051395.s001">Methods S1</xref> for subject random allocation sequence and un-blinding procedures]. There was no formal calculation of power for this study. A sample size of 8 subjects per group was chosen based on feasibility to allow preliminary characterisation of the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of SRT2104 in the elderly population. In addition, a series of pharmacodynamic measures (see below) were included as secondary endpoints to preliminary assess the potential biological activity of the compound in humans.</p><p>Subjects participated in the study for approximately 79 days and underwent 2 screening visits, 2 inpatient visits, 7 outpatient visits and 8 telephone call visits (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0051395.s004">Figure S1</xref>). Subjects were screened during the 21 days prior to receiving their first dose of study drug (or placebo). They were admitted overnight as inpatients on the evenings prior to dosing on Days 1 and 28 for intense pharmacokinetic assessment. Subjects also returned to the clinical unit as outpatients on Days 7, 14 and 21 for weekly safety visits. Additional telephone safety assessments were made approximately on Days 3, 5, 10, 17, 20 and 24. The end of dosing follow-up visit was performed approximately 35 days following the first dose of SRT2104 or placebo. An additional follow up safety telephone call (defined as the last subject's last assessment) was made to each subject approximately 30 days following his or her final dose of SRT2104 and/or placebo.</p><p>During the treatment phase of the study (days 1 to 28 inclusive), test material (SRT2104 or placebo) was supplied as 250 mg capsules and was administered at approximately the same time every morning, approximately 15 minutes following consumption of a standardized meal (Ensure Plus&#x000ae;, a high energy, high protein liquid meal replacement product providing approximately 650 kcal with approximately 30% of calories derived from fat). Subjects were not permitted to consume additional calories for at least 1&#x02013;2 hours after dosing, although water was permitted <italic>ad libitum</italic>. Subjects were also instructed to refrain from caffeine and alcohol for 24 hours prior to screening and during assessments visits. The test material was administered within the investigation clinical unit on the days when serial pharmacokinetic sampling was performed (days 1&#x02013;2 and 28&#x02013;29) and at home on the remaining days (days 3&#x02013;27). A diary card was provided to volunteers to confirm daily consumption of the standardized meal, as well as time of dose and number of capsules taken. Missing doses were recorded.</p><p>At every visit (including at screening and follow-up), blood and urine samples were collected for clinical laboratory assessments (general blood biochemistry, full blood count, coagulation parameters and urinalysis). On the same days, physical examination, vital signs (resting pulse rate, respiration rate, temperature, and blood pressure readings), pre- and post-dose 12-lead ECG and a review of adverse events (AE) and any medications received were also performed. Safety evaluations were based on the incidence, severity and type of AEs and clinically significant changes from baseline in physical examination findings, vital signs or clinical laboratory results.</p><p>The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, London (UK), the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA; EudraCT number 2009-011918-21) and the Research Ethics Committee of Berkshire, Reading, UK (REC reference number 09/H0505/96). The study was registered on the public database ClinicalTrials.gov (reference number NCT00964340) and was conducted at The National Institute for Health Research (NIHR)-Wellcome Trust Imperial College Clinical Research Facility [formerly known as Sir John McMichael Clinical Research Centre (SJMC), Imperial College, London, UK] in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) and Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines. Written informed consent was obtained from each subject prior to the performance of any study-specific procedures. Subject's ability to consent was confirmed by medically qualified professionals of the study team.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Bioanalysis and pharmacokinetic data analysis</title><p>Pharmacokinetic samples were collected through 24 hours post-dose on the first and last day of the dosing period (immediately prior to dosing and at 15, 30 minutes and 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12 and 24 hours post-dose). Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis were collected in pre-labelled lithium heparin heparin Vacutainers for pharmacokinetic analysis (&#x0223c;4 mL per draw). Each sample was separated by centrifugation at 1500&#x000d7;g and 4&#x000b0;C for 10 minutes. Two equal aliquots of plasma were transferred to polypropylene vials labelled identically to the original blood sample and stored at approximately &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C for subsequent analysis of plasma SRT2104 concentration. The bio-analysis was performed by Simbec Research Ltd, Merthyl Tydfil, South Wales, UK. Pharmacokinetic parameters for SRT2104 were derived from non-compartmental methods using WinNonLin v5.2 (Pharsight Corporation, Mountain View, CA, USA). SRT2104 concentrations were quantified in all subjects above a limit of quantification [LOQ]&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.5 ng/mL. Actual blood sample collection times were used in the analysis. The maximum SRT2104 plasma concentration (C<sub>max</sub>) and the corresponding time of peak plasma concentration (T<sub>max</sub>) were taken directly from the individual plasma data. The mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0&#x02013;24 hours (AUC<sub>0&#x02013;24</sub>), the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from zero to time AUC(<sub>0-&#x003c4;</sub>) (where &#x003c4; is the time of the last measurable concentration) and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from zero to infinity AUC(<sub>0-&#x0221e;</sub>) were calculated by the linear trapezoidal rule. The terminal phase elimination rate constant (K<sub>el</sub>) was determined from the slope of the concentration-versus-time data plot during the log-linear terminal phase by regression analysis and the t<sub>1/2</sub> was generated by dividing ln2 by the elimination rate constant K<sub>el</sub>. The accumulation ratio (R) was calculated as the ratio of day 28 to day 1 AUC<sub>0&#x02013;24</sub>.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Pharmacodynamic data analysis</title><sec id="s2c1"><title>Modified Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (mOGTT)</title><p>The oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) allows identification and monitoring of individuals with impaired glucose tolerance and to evaluate the pharmacological effects of glucose lowering agents <xref rid="pone.0051395-DECODE1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0051395-He1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. A mOGTT was performed at baseline and on day 29 to assess the pharmacodynamic effects of SRT2104 (or placebo) on glucose, insulin and C-peptide levels. On both occasion, after an overnight fast, subjects were asked to drink a standard glucose beverage containing 75 g of glucose. Blood sample were drawn 10 min before and just prior to the subject consuming the beverage. Additional blood samples were drawn at 10, 20, 30, 60, 90, 120 and 180 minutes after the subject had consumed the glucose beverage. Plasma level of glucose, insulin and C-peptide were measured at each time point. The maximum glucose level (Gmax) was determined, and the area under the plasma glucose concentration&#x02013;time curve (AUCgluc) was calculated using the trapezoidal rule. AUCgluc60 was defined as the area under the curve from 0 to 60 min after glucose ingestion, the period during which plasma glucose concentration increases. The effects of SRT2104 (or placebo) on glucose, insulin and C-peptide levels and relative AUCs were calculated in each subject as the differences between values at baseline (screening) and after 28 daily administrations of the test material.</p></sec><sec id="s2c2"><title>

Weighting of the pedal device during the exercise period was adjusted to be equivalent to 10&#x02013;15% of lean body mass, as calculated with a height, weight and gender algorithm, using the formula of Hume <xref rid="pone.0051395-Hume1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. <sup>31</sup>P MR spectra were acquired with a &#x0201c;pulse-acquire&#x0201d; sequence. Each spectrum was generated by averaging 8 free induction decays (FID) acquired with a 2 s repetition time, which resulted in a 16 s time resolution per spectrum. Free induction decays were acquired with a dwell time of 0.5 ms and 1024 readout points. Spectra were analyzed using the AMARES routine of the jMRUI software package <xref rid="pone.0051395-Naressi1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. After manual phase-correction of the spectra, the PCr resonance peak was fitted to a Lorentzian lineshape to calculate tissue concentration. Intracellular pH was determined from the chemical shift of PCr and inorganic phosphate, and the value of ADP was calculated as in Vanderthommen et al. 2003 <xref rid="pone.0051395-Vanderthommen1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>.</p><p>Analyses of <sup>31</sup>P MRS measures of the T<sub>1/2</sub> for ADP and PCr recovery (seconds) in the gastrocnemius muscle after exercise were assessed as changes from baseline to Day 27 using an ANCOVA model with treatment group as a factor and baseline as a covariate.

The data were acquired using a 3D spoiled gradient echo sequence with partial Fourier acquisitions (VIBE) <xref rid="pone.0051395-Rofsky1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. The imaging volume consisted of contiguous 3D slabs (voxel size of 1.4&#x000d7;1.4&#x000d7;5 mm3) acquired in a single 15 s end-expiration breath-hold (repetition time&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;7 ms; echo times TEs&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;2.45, 3.67 ms; flip angle&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;10&#x000b0;; 450 mm field-of-view; GRAPPA factor 2). The most inferior slab was positioned at the pubic symphysis and the most superior slab surpassed the top of the lungs. Fat-only images in the abdomen were manually segmented into intra-abdominal adipose tissue (IAT) and abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT). The abdominal area was defined by using anatomical landmarks (top of the femoral heads to the bottom of the right lung) <xref rid="pone.0051395-Thomas1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. All images were anonymized and blinded to time point, but not to subject in order to facilitate matching anatomical landmarks, and sent to a third party (Vardis Group Inc, London), who derived the adipose tissue volumes using Slice-O-Matic (Tomovision, Montreal, Canada) software. Analysis of compartmental fat distribution was performed for subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), visceral adipose tissue (VAT), and the ratio of SAT:VAT, using an ANOVA model with treatment group as a factor.</p></sec><sec id="s2c4"><title>Maximal Aerobic Capacity Test</title><p>A stepwise incremental exercise test was performed on a cycle ergometer (Monarch 874E, Monark Exercise AB, Vansbro, Sweden) <xref rid="pone.0051395-Medicine1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. All participants were familiarized to the test procedure on a separate occasion prior to testing. Participants were seated in a standardized position. The test started with unloaded cycling, subjects were asked to maintain a cadence of 50 revolutions per minute (rpm), if the subject could not achieve 50 rpm they were encouraged to cycle as fast as the could (but not less than 40 rpm). Every two minutes the external load on the cycle ergometer was increased by 0.5 kg, this equated to a 25-Watt increase in workload at 50 rpm. Cardiac monitoring of heart rate, respiratory rate/minute ventilation and pulse oximeter for oxygen saturation were continuously recorded during the test.</p><p>Analysis of Maximal Aerobic Capacity parameters was performed using an ANOVA model with treatment group as a factor. Workload was progressed in 2-minute staged increments from an initial 3 minutes unloaded cycling, to exhaust subjects over a 6- to 10-min period. The test was terminated when the participant reached volitional exhaustion or their cadence dropped by 10 rpm. At the end of each increment, work-rate watts, rating of perceived exertion (Borg RPE scale), heart rate (Polar Vantage chest heart rate monitor, Polar Electro, Finland) and 3-lead ECG were recorded.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>Analyses of demographics were performed on the Intent-to-treat (ITT) population including all subjects who were randomized.

In addition, although the study was not designed to fully characterize the pharmacological effects of SRT2104, it evaluated the potential biological activity of the compound for the first time in humans, and that is an information that has not been previously reported.

(21.6&#x000b1;12.5 hr) relative to day 1 (15.1&#x000b1;5.9 hr). Between-subject variability for AUC(<sub>0&#x02013;24</sub>) was high for both dose groups. The geometric mean CV for the 0.5 g/day group was 140% and for the 2.0 g/day group was 102%. As described above, one subject who was assigned to the SRT2104 0.5 g/day cohort had study drug washed out starting at day 14 (due to increased serum creatinine levels of 151 &#x000b5;mol/L) and then restarted on day 21 of the dosing period (upon creatinine normalization, i.e. 126 &#x000b5;mol/L). Subsequent repeat measurements of serum creatinine levels revealed a relapse of out of range values (154 &#x000b5;mol/L on day 28) and a return to normal range (116 &#x000b5;mol/L) at the end of study follow up visit.

There were no serious adverse events and the drug was generally well tolerated during 28 days continuous administration, with no dose-limiting toxicities being detected. However, given the exploratory nature of our study, larger, prospectively conducted studies are required to conclude on the long-term safety of SRT2104 in the general population.</p><p>Our data suggest a less than dose proportional increase in exposure for SRT2104 between 0.5&#x02013;2.0 g/day. In a previous oral dose study in young healthy volunteers, AUC(<sub>0-&#x003c4;</sub>) and C<sub>max</sub> exhibited an approximate dose proportionality over the dose range 0.03 g/day to 1.0 g/day and a less than dose proportional increase between 1.0&#x02013;3.0 g/day when administered in the fasted state <xref rid="pone.0051395-Hoffmann1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.

When SRT2104 was administered with a standardized solid meal, an increase in overall exposure of SRT2104 was observed for both the 0.5 and 2.0 g doses, compared with administration in the fasted state. There was also a substantial reduction in inter-subject variability in exposure in the fed state. It was anticipated that the standardized meal of Ensure Plus&#x000ae; taken prior to dosing would simulate the effect of a solid meal because it contained a similar caloric content. However, the variability and exposure observed in the current study was similar to fasted-state exposure, rather than fed-state. A proportion of this pharmacokinetic variation may reflect individual differences in absorption metabolism, or a combination of the two; one subject in the 0.5 g/day group exhibited t<sub>1/2</sub> values of greater than 24 hours after both first and repeated administrations (29.7 and 28.3 hours, respectively), although the C<sub>max</sub>, AUC(<sub>0-&#x003c4;</sub>) and AUC(<sub>0&#x02013;24</sub>) were considerably lower than for other subjects. However, other data (unpublished) suggests that exposure is inversely related to gastric emptying rate. A liquid meal of Ensure Plus&#x000ae;, while calorically similar to a standardized solid meal, may have accelerated gastric emptying, which may explain why a food-related increase in drug absorption was not observed in this study. Changes in individual pharmacokinetics may be just a consequence of differences in the ontogeny of drug elimination pathways <xref rid="pone.0051395-RostamiHodjegan1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>.</p><p>Although this study was primarily designed to evaluate safety and pharmacokinetic outcomes, potential pharmacodynamic measures were also explored as secondary endpoints to preliminary assess the biological activity of the compound in humans. Effects of SRT2104 on plasma lipid profile were observed, including a decrease in serum cholesterol and triglycerides, as well as an increase in HDL:LDL ratio which appeared to be a consequence of decreases in pro-atherogenic LDL cholesterol. Notably, these effects increased through the dosing period and reversed to baseline (pre-treatment) values within one week of drug washout. Although subjects were instructed to maintain their standard level of physical activity and diet for the entire duration of the study, with the exception of consuming a standardized breakfast (Ensure Plus&#x000ae;) every morning approximately 15 minutes prior to dosing, we cannot exclude that a change in life style over a relatively short period of time may have acted as a potential confounder affecting subjects' cholesterolaemia. However, given the fact that changes in lipid profile were only observed in subjects receiving SRT2104 but not placebo seems to suggest a genuine drug-dependent effect consistent with target modulation. Both resveratrol and SRT2104 administration lower cholesterol, LDL and triglycerides in preclinical models of dyslipidemia, diabetes and obesity (e.g., DIO and Lep<sup>ob/ob</sup> obese mice) <xref rid="pone.0051395-Minor1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0051395-Qi1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0051395-Suri1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0051395-Zern1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0051395-Do1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>.

While the latter effect appears to be consistent with enhanced insulin sensitivity, a known consequence of SIRT1 activation, it remains to be proven in larger, well-selected cohorts of patients given that our observations were based on a very small sample size and short duration of treatment. In addition, the classification of subjects based on only a single OGTT is insecure <xref rid="pone.0051395-Mooy1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0051395-Utzschneider1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>.</p><p>We further explored potential mechanisms mediating the possible increase in insulin sensitivity using <sup>31</sup>P-MRS to test for a treatment-related increase in muscle mitochondrial oxidative metabolic capacity.

This may be a consequence of a lack of study power or relative deconditioning and lack of a major dependence of aerobic exercise on metabolic adaptations in skeletal muscle training, which in this population of elderly subjects may have resulted in reduced mitochondrial enzyme activities, lipid oxidation and inability to decrease lactic acid accumulation <xref rid="pone.0051395-Bassett1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0051395-Dandurand1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. Interestingly, it has recently been reported that the O2 diffusing capacity is well preserved in the elderly whereas the age related decline in oxidative capacity is most likely a consequence of limited mitochondrial content and/or mitochondrial dysfunction rather than O2 availability <xref rid="pone.0051395-Layec1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>.</p><p>Similarly, no significant difference in the MRI quantification of adipose tissue was noted in our study, despite possible beneficial effects on lipids.

On the other hand, obesity is associated with a defect in lipid oxidation in skeletal muscle, which may be corrected with exercise training but persists after weight loss <xref rid="pone.0051395-Berggren1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. It is possible that the small sample size and the relatively short duration of treatment may have at least in part contributed to the lack of SAT and VAT effect seen in our normal weight subjects who were instructed not to change their standard life style, diet and exercise for the entire duration of the study. Future investigations are warranted in patients, to explore substrate utilization during exercise and determine the impact of SIRT1 activation on fat volume and muscle performance capacity.</p><p>In conclusion, the present study indicates that SRT2104 was well tolerated up to 2.0 g/day for 28 days, in both elderly men and women. The highly variable pharmacokinetics observed may confound development of this particular molecule as a medicine in its current formulation, although the safety in short-term studies suggest an encouragingly high therapeutic index. This study also suggests that SRT2104 is biologically active in humans given the observed changes in some of the exploratory pharmacodynamic endpoints. This is the first study to demonstrate an impact of SRT2104 in humans on parameters that are known to lie downstream of SIRT1 activation. Given the potentially beneficial effects on serum lipids and the trends toward a beneficial effect on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, the results of this study may be of use for dose selection in future clinical trials and should further stimulate interest in the testing of &#x0201c;second generation&#x0201d; sirtuin activators in adequately selected patient populations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0051395.s001"><label>Methods S1</label><caption><p>
