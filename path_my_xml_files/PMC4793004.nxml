of microwave diathermy in combination with intra-articular injection of hyaluronic acid
into the knee of patients with osteoarthritis (OA). [Subjects] A total of 17 patients with
knee OA were enrolled. The participants were randomly divided into two groups: a
radiofrequency diathermy group (RF group, 9 subjects), and a microwave diathermy group (MW
group, 8 subjects). [Methods] Subjects received radiofrequency or microwave thermal
therapy 3 times at 1-week intervals. Intra-articular injection of hyaluronic acid was
administered 10&#x02005;min before every thermal therapy session. The outcome was evaluated using
the Japan Orthopaedic Association (JOA) and the Lequesne Index (LI) at baseline, at weeks
1 (1 week after the first thermal therapy) and 3 (1 week after the last thermal therapy).
[Results] The JOA scale increased significantly after three sessions of thermal therapy in
the RF group, while no significant increase was observed in the MW group. LI decreased
significantly after 3 weeks in the RF group. In the MW group, there was no significant
difference in LI between the two time points. [Conclusion] This study revealed that
symptom relief in patients with knee OA was greater with radiofrequency diathermy than
with microwave diathermy with concurrent use of hyaluronic acid injection, presumably due
to the different heating characteristics of the two methods.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Osteoarthritis</kwd><kwd>Knee</kwd><kwd>Diathermy</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee is the joint disease that is most commonly encountered in
clinical practice. Because the articular cartilage is difficult to regenerate, artificial
knee replacement is often performed for patients who have end-stage knee OA, and thus have
relatively severe symptoms such as pain, instability and limited range of motion. However,
to reduce the economic burden on the healthcare system and on patients, it would be
desirable to establish conservative therapy that can alleviate symptoms and prevent
progression to the end-stage disease. Medication, therapeutic exercise, treatments with
physical agents or orthosis are conservative therapies for knee OA, and the use of thermal
therapy alone as physical therapy or in combination with exercise is recommended in many
guidelines for the management of knee OA.</p><p>Thermal therapy is categorized into two groups: one has a superficial thermal effect, and
it includes hot packs, paraffin baths, or heat generating sheet<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>, and the second has deep thermal effects induced by
electromagnetic waves or ultrasound<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Superficial thermal therapy, when performed for a short period of time, increases the
temperature of only the cutaneous and subcutaneous layers, not inside the joints<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. In contrast, the thermal effect of
diathermy generated by electromagnetic waves or ultrasound reaches the deep layers, and the
penetration depth varies with the heating method, frequency and power output<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. In our previous study, the knee of patients
with OA was contact-heated using a bipolar radiofrequency applicator, which generates
electromagnetic waves with frequencies up to tens of megahertz, and observed a marked
improvement in the patiens&#x02019; symptoms and function<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. The purpose of this study was to show the superior clinical effects
of radiofrequency diathermy with a bipolar applicator for knee OA over microwave which is
widely used in outpatient physical medicine and rehabilitation clinics as a deep thermal
modality.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Approval for this study was obtained from the Institutional Review Board of Nippon Medical
School and subjects provided their written informed consent to participation. The purpose
and method, as well as the risk of side effects, such as burns and their countermeasures,
and the method of protecting personal information were explained to the subjects, and
written informed consent was obtained from them. One of the authors became a subject for
temperature measurement inside the joint.</p><p>This study was designed as a prospective randomized clinical trial. A total of 17 patients
aged 49&#x02013;88 (mean: 69.1&#x000b1;11.0) years with OA of the medial femorotibial compartment of the
knee and no other inflammatory disease, who visited either of two clinics (Hara Orthopaedic
Hospital, Minami-Shinjuku Orthopaedic Rehabilitation Clinic) from August 2013 to November
2013, were selected as subjects according to the clinical and radiographic criteria of the
American College of Rheumatology as well as standard exclusion criteria<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. The participants were randomly divided into two groups
using computer-generated random numbers: a radiofrequency diathermy group (RF group, 9
subjects) and a microwave diathermy group (MW group, 8 subjects). One of the authors
participated as a subject for the measurement of intra-articular temperature. Standard
standing anteroposterior radiographs of the knee were obtained of all subjects. Two
orthopedic surgeons who had more than 20&#x02005;years of experience each in analyzing knee
radiographs graded the images according to Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grade<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Knee pain had not improved in any of the subjects, despite the administration of
anti-inflammatory drugs or intra-articular injection of hyaluronic acid for 3 months.
Thermal therapy using diathermy was started more than 1 month after the last intra-articular
injection of hyaluronic acid or corticosteroid. Subjects in the RF group received thermal
therapy using a radiofrequency of 8&#x02005;MHz and 200&#x02005;W for 20&#x02005;min 3 times at 1-week intervals.
Thermal therapy was performed using Thermotron-RF8 (Yamamoto Vinita, Co, Ltd, Osaka, Japan),
which can emit a radiofrequency of 8&#x02005;MHz. The subject was placed in the lateral position
with the knee placed downside, and it was then tightly sandwiched by applicators at the
center of the femoral internal and external condyles. The temperature of circulating water
in the applicator was maintained at 25&#x02005;&#x000b0;C so that cooling of the skin was achieved. In the
MW group, a Microradar KTM-250 (Ito Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), which can emit microwaves at a
frequency of 2.45&#x02005;GHz was used for thermal therapy. The Microradar probe (circular, 150&#x02005;mm
diameter) was placed approximately 10&#x02005;cm in front of the patella, and applied (100&#x02005;W) for
10&#x02005;min while the subjects sat in a chair with their knees flexed at 90&#x000b0;. Diathermy was
performed 3 times at 1-week intervals. After sterilizing the normal left knee of a healthy
subject (one of the authors) with iodine, a sterilized thermocouple was inserted from the
lateral side, between the patella and femur, to measure the temperature changes inside the
knee joint caused by diathermy. Intra-articular injection of hyaluronic acid (Artz, Kaken
Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) was administered 10&#x02005;min before every thermal therapy
session.</p><p>The outcome was evaluated using the Lequesne Index (LI)<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup> and the Japan Orthopaedic Association (JOA) scale<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. For a comparison of trial periods, the
variables of LI and JOA scale were measured at baseline, at weeks 1 (1 week after the first
thermal therapy) and 3 (1 week after the last thermal therapy). Repeated measures analysis
of variance (ANOVA) was conducted and Tukey&#x02019;s post hoc test was performed when a significant
difference between the trial periods was found.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The baseline characteristics of the two treatment groups are shown in <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Baseline characteristics of the groups</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Radiofrequency group (RF group)</th><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Microwave group (MW group)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Number of patients</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gender (male/female)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1/8</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1/6</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (years, mean&#x000b1;SD)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">71.8&#x000b1;10.7</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">65.6&#x000b1;11.2</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Kellgren-Lawrence grade (KL grade)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">I: 1, II: 6, III: 2</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">I: 1, II: 4, III: 2</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap>.

radiofrequency diathermy than with microwave diathermy, presumably due to the different
heating characteristics of the two methods. To reveal changes in intra-articular
temperature, we previously used the finite element method (FEM) to create simulation models
of microwave and radiofrequency diathermy<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Based on the simulation, the no-contact monopolar applicator used
in microwave diathermy increases the temperature of the skin near the applicator to 37.5&#x02005;&#x000b0;C
to a depth of several centimeters from the surface, but the temperature of a large part of
the joint cavity is not increased. A previous FEM simulation study also showed that when the
knee is contact-heated by the bipolar radiofrequency applicator, the temperature of the
entire joint cavity gradually increases to approximately 38&#x02005;&#x000b0;C. These simulated results are
consistent with our present findings of chronological change in intra-articular temperature
after diathermy. The output and application length of the RF and MW groups were different
because the larger output and longer irradiation by microwaves causes a strong heat
sensation and carries the risk of burn in the skin.</p><p>In this study, intra-articular injections of hyaluronic acid were performed just before
thermal therapy. Hyaluronic acid was administered because microwave diathermy alone is not
effective, causing many patients to drop out of therapy in our preliminary study. In
contrast, heat treatment of knee OA with a bipolar radiofrequency applicator alone was
effective in a previous study, and no synergistic effect was observed even though hyaluronic
acid was injected into the joint in that study<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>OA pain is multifactorial. Not only are there multiple potential structures within a joint
that are the sources of peripheral nociceptive signals, but there may be central pain
sensitization in OA. While there is undoubtedly cartilage damage from the earliest stages of
OA, it is unclear why this results in pain, as healthy cartilage is aneural. Although it is
not clear how thermal therapy alleviates pain in knee OA, two mechanisms have been proposed:
the first mechanism involves heat-induced denervation of nerve terminals in the skin of the
knee joint. It has been reported that sensory nerve invasion containing substance P and
calcitonin gene-related peptide occurs in tibial osteophytes in human OA patients<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Hypersensitivity of nociceptive nerve
terminals to pressure stimulation was seen in the medial femorotibial joint. Percutaneous
radiofrequency treatment has been reported to be a beneficial local denervation therapy for
knee OA<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the peripheral nerve
fibers, the elevation of the superficial skin temperature is accompanied by an increase in
the nerve conduction velocity with a concomitant decrease in sensory latency<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Although its clinical significance needs
to be elucidated, nerve conduction velocity increases by approximately 2 m/s as the
temperature increases by 1&#x02005;&#x000b0;C, and this is thought to be related to nerve denervation or an
increase in the pain threshold. In the present study, microwave diathermy hardly provided
any pain alleviation because the procedure increased temperature effectively in only the
superficial layers near the applicator, but not in the nerve fibers in the vicinity of the
medial osteophyte. According to Izumi et al., pain alleviation was rapid and long lasting
when magnetic resonance imaging-guided ultrasound was used to heat the medial tibial
osteophytes<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The second mechanism involves denervation of the peripheral nerve terminals in the
subchondral bone. It has been suggested that blood vessels and sensory nerve fibers grow
into damaged OA cartilage by crossing the osteochondral junction<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. The subchondral bone in the weight bearing area with
cartilage degeneration above cannot be heated by microwave diathermy. On the other hand,
based on the knee heating simulation, the bipolar radiofrequency applicator is able to heat
a wide area of the subchondral bone, ranging from the femur to tibia<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is possible that heating of the nerve terminals, by
the bipolar radiofrequency applicator, in the subchondral bone contributes to marked
alleviation of pain in knee OA.</p><p>We are currently investigating the long-term efficacy of heating in knee OA with an
emphasis on basic research into the response of articular cartilage to heating when no
mechanical stress is present. Hojo et al. reported that proteoglycan metabolism in cultured
chondrocytes was upregulated when heated to 39&#x02005;&#x000b0;C and 41&#x02005;&#x000b0;C, but was downregulated at
43&#x02005;&#x000b0;C<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Proteoglycan genes are also
upregulated at 40&#x02005;&#x000b0;C in humans, in a process which involves the accumulation of the stress
protein, heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), in chondrocytes. In white rabbits, the gene
expression of proteoglycan and type II collagen in the articular cartilage was strongly
upregulated when the knee joint was heated to approximately 40&#x02005;&#x000b0;C using a medical 2.45-GHz
microwave irradiator<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. Also in rats, the
expression of proteoglycan was upregulated when the knee joint was heated to approximately
40&#x02005;&#x000b0;C by microwave irradiation<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Furthermore, thermal therapy by ultrasound induces chondrogenesis in rats through the
overexpression of HSP70<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. As shown in
these studies using small animals, the metabolic process in the caltilage matrix is
activated partly through the expression of HSP70 when the knee joint is heated to 40&#x02005;&#x000b0;C. In
addition, the progression of OA was suppressed when the knee joint was heated in the
rat<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup> and guinea pig (manuscript in
preparation) model of OA. These findings strongly suggest that bipolar radiofrequency
applicators protect cartilage.</p><p>There were three limitations to this study. First, we did not perform long-term follow-up.
The second limitation was the small sample number. We plan to perform radiofrequency
diathermy for a large number of patients to investigate the long-term and radiological
treatment efficacy of heat therapy for knee OA. The third limitation was the size of the
radiofrequency apparatus. Development of smaller apparatus convenient for the usual clinical
