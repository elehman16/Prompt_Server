Recognition of the continuum of premenstrual distress, and overlap between the diagnostic categories PMS and PMDD, has led to the adoption of the term &#x02018;Premenstrual Disorders&#x02019; (PMDs) by an expert advisory panel [<xref rid="pone.0175068.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. PMDs include emotional and behavioural symptoms that have a significant impact on a woman&#x02019;s quality of life during the premenstrual phase of the cycle, but are absent after menstruation and before ovulation. The symptoms most commonly reported include irritability, depression, mood swings, anxiety, concentration difficulties, feelings of loss of control and tiredness, often combined with physical symptoms such as bloating, breast tenderness, headache and general body aches [<xref rid="pone.0175068.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>The costs of PMDs, in terms of impact upon women&#x02019;s quality of life and economic functioning, are estimated to be considerable [<xref rid="pone.0175068.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0175068.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. This has led to the development of a range of biomedical interventions, including the use of anti-depressants of the serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) class, anxiolytics and hormone treatments to suppress ovulation, and oophorectomy [<xref rid="pone.0175068.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0175068.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Although these approaches may be effective in reducing premenstrual symptoms, they do not take account of the complex mechanisms underlying premenstrual distress that are not adequately accounted for by physiology alone [<xref rid="pone.0175068.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0175068.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Furthermore, many women express a preference for non-medical treatment options for their premenstrual symptoms [<xref rid="pone.0175068.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], due to side effects [<xref rid="pone.0175068.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], or contraindications to drug treatments [<xref rid="pone.0175068.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Consequently, there has been a development of psychological approaches to PMDs treatment [<xref rid="pone.0175068.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], that take into account the interaction of embodied, cognitive and socio-cultural factors in the development of symptoms [<xref rid="pone.0175068.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>The results of systematic review [<xref rid="pone.0175068.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [<xref rid="pone.0175068.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0175068.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] suggest that cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) can reduce premenstrual anxiety and depression, have a beneficial impact on behavioural change, and reduce interference of premenstrual symptoms on daily living [<xref rid="pone.0175068.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0175068.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0175068.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Such interventions involve a combination of behavioural strategies such as relaxation training, coping skills, social support, and anger management [<xref rid="pone.0175068.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0175068.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], combined with facilitation of cognitive restructuring to overcome the sense of helplessness associated with premenstrual symptoms and reframe self-defeating cognitions [<xref rid="pone.0175068.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0175068.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. CBT has been demonstrated to be as effective as SSRI&#x02019;s in reducing premenstrual distress in the short-term, and at long term follow-up to be more effective, in terms of reducing premenstrual distress and improving coping [<xref rid="pone.0175068.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0175068.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><sec id="sec006"><title>Relational context of premenstrual distress</title><p>A limitation of existing psychological or medical interventions for PMDs is that the focus is on the woman who reports distress. This negates research evidence that has found that premenstrual distress is often a relational experience, developing, and being positioned as &#x02018;PMS&#x02019;, within the context of interactions with partners or children [<xref rid="pone.0175068.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Using a short fuse metaphor, women report greater reactivity to family stresses and altered perception of daily life stresses premenstrually [<xref rid="pone.0175068.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0175068.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].Women, and their families, may also attribute premenstrual expression of negative emotion to &#x02018;PMS&#x02019;, even when alternative explanations can be found, which leads to women&#x02019;s emotions being positioned as a hormonal pathology [<xref rid="pone.0175068.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Direct expression of emotion has been reported to be lower in families where women report PMDs [<xref rid="pone.0175068.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], which increases the likelihood of premenstrual emotion being positioned as problematic.</p><p>Many women who report PMDs also report higher levels of relationship dissatisfaction or difficulties [<xref rid="pone.0175068.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0175068.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. There is evidence that both women and their partners evaluate the relationship more negatively in the premenstrual phase, suggesting that some couples are not simply distressed, but rather, are distressed in the luteal phase of the cycle [<xref rid="pone.0175068.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0175068.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. It has also been reported that premenstrual anger and irritation is associated with legitimate relationship conflicts, with feelings of dissatisfaction being openly expressed during the premenstrual phase of the cycle [<xref rid="pone.0175068.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0175068.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. This is in contrast to women&#x02019;s self-silencing during the remainder of the month, where they take up a position of self-sacrifice and self-renunciation [<xref rid="pone.0175068.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], in an attempt to live up to idealised notions of femininity [<xref rid="pone.0175068.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Whilst some women describe the premenstrual expression of negative emotion as cathartic in the short term, this catharsis is invariably followed by guilt, self-criticism, and a positioning of the premenstrual self as &#x02018;out of control&#x02019; [<xref rid="pone.0175068.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0175068.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. It is thus the <italic>break</italic> in self-silencing premenstrually, described as a transgression from the &#x02018;real me&#x02019;, which leads to distress, as well as to self-castigation [<xref rid="pone.0175068.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p><p>The role of partners in the exacerbation or amelioration of premenstrual distress has been demonstrated in a number of studies. The coping responses of men have been found to be a strong predictor of women&#x02019;s symptom severity, with high levels of premenstrual distress associated with a partner&#x02019;s avoidance, fear, and anger, and low levels of distress associated with reassurance and support [<xref rid="pone.0175068.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0175068.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0175068.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Men&#x02019;s constructions of &#x02018;PMS&#x02019; have been implicated in women&#x02019;s negative premenstrual experiences, with evidence that many men treat women with PMDs in a belittling way [<xref rid="pone.0175068.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0175068.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. At the same time, some male partners of women with PMDs report that they experience moderate to significant disruption in their lives due to their partner&#x02019;s premenstrual change [<xref rid="pone.0175068.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0175068.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], or report that they wished they had married someone else [<xref rid="pone.0175068.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], describing the premenstrual period as like walking on eggshells [<xref rid="pone.0175068.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p><p>The findings of the above body of research have led to the suggestion that PMDs is not an individual problem, but a relational issue [<xref rid="pone.0175068.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0175068.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], and that coping with moderate-severe PMDs requires effort from both members of a couple [<xref rid="pone.0175068.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In this vein, family or couple therapy has been suggested as an appropriate form of intervention for PMDs [<xref rid="pone.0175068.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. In couple therapy, it is not necessarily the relationship that becomes the focus of treatment, rather, the involvement of the partner in the therapy process enhances symptom alleviation and reduces relationship distress [<xref rid="pone.0175068.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Frank and colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0175068.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] investigated the impact of including male partners in the monitoring of a woman&#x02019;s behavioural and emotional premenstrual symptoms and reported significant improvement in relationship functioning and reduction in premenstrual distress compared to a self-monitoring control group. Awareness of cyclical patterns meant that couples could develop joint strategies to deal with potential problems, and discuss major issues at times other than the premenstrual phase. A subsequent small scale couple intervention, comparing a PMDs and non-PMDs control, reported positive effects of time, but no difference between groups [<xref rid="pone.0175068.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. There have been no other systematic evaluations of couple-based interventions for PMDs, and no comparisons of the efficacy of individual and couple CBT interventions in reducing premenstrual distress. Previous research on the efficacy of CBT in reducing premenstrual distress has also been criticised for the absence of wait-list control groups, small sample size, absence of random group assignment, and failure to use using repeated measures ANOVA to assess main effects of group, main effects of time, and time by group interactions [<xref rid="pone.0175068.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. There is also an absence of a qualitative examination of the subjective experience and mechanisms of change pre-post intervention, with the exception of one study [<xref rid="pone.0175068.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. There has been a call for the addition of qualitative methods to RCT&#x02019;s, in order to address complexity, context, and meaning of change, along-side quantitative measures of outcome [<xref rid="pone.0175068.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]</p><p>The aim of the present study was to address these gaps in the research literature, through the evaluation of the relative efficacy of a couple-based CBT intervention in comparison to a one-to-one CBT intervention and a wait-list control, in reducing premenstrual symptoms and distress, and in improving premenstrual coping, using a randomised controlled trial, and a triangulation of outcome measures. The impact of the interventions on depression and anxiety, self-silencing, and relationship adjustment were also examined, to ascertain changes in general wellbeing, relationship functioning and communication.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec007"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec008"><title>Design</title><p>A randomised control trial (RCT) was conducted to examine the relative efficacy of a brief couple-based intervention for PMDs, in comparison to a proven one-to-one CBT PMDs intervention and a wait-list control. This allows for the comparison of active treatment with absence of treatment, and the comparison of two active treatments. Triangulation of quantitative and qualitative outcome measures was used to evaluate changes pre-post intervention.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Participants and procedure</title><p>Women who reported moderate-severe PMDs were recruited from a range of contexts, including social media, sexual and reproductive health clinics, local radio and newspapers, and women&#x02019;s health centres. Women who were interested in the study were informed about the nature of the study, and then completed an on-line survey which examined demographic variables, the nature and degree of their premenstrual distress, degree of premenstrual coping, and partner support. Participants were eligible if they were aged between 18&#x02013;45 years, having regular cycles (21&#x02013;35 days); presently not taking hormonal medication (excluding contraceptives), psychotropic medication, or having been diagnosed with a major psychiatric illness; not having been pregnant or lactating within the previous 12 months. Criteria for a PMDs diagnosis were assessed with the Premenstrual Symptoms Screening Tool (PSST) [<xref rid="pone.0175068.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], with confirmation by daily diary measures [<xref rid="pone.0175068.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], demonstrating a 30% difference in symptoms between the pre- and post-menstrual period, for two consecutive months, which cause moderate-severe impairment [<xref rid="pone.0175068.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0175068.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0175068.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. If women did not report a 30% increase in premenstrual symptoms after two cycles, they were invited to complete a third, and sometimes fourth, cycle of daily diaries. The baseline pre-screening survey was completed by 1124 participants, with 584 participants invited to complete daily diaries (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0175068.t001">Table 1</xref>). Those who met the criteria for a PMDs diagnosis following daily dairies and agreed to take part (N = 96) were then randomly allocated to one of three treatment groups&#x02014;couple-based, one-to-one, or wait-list control. Minimum sample sizes of 30 women per group have been recommended for PMS research [<xref rid="pone.0175068.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] and &#x02018;large samples&#x02019; have been suggested for research examining the relative efficacy of couple therapy [<xref rid="pone.0175068.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. An a priori sample calculation analysis on G*Power for a repeated measures ANOVA (incorporating interaction effects) for 3 groups, a power of 0.95, a two-way alpha level of 0.01 to adjust for multiple comparisons, and a medium effect size (<italic>f</italic> = .25), computed a required total sample size of 90. Generation of the random allocation sequence, using permuted block randomization [<xref rid="pone.0175068.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], was conducted by the second author (JP).

months), and for both treatment groups, at three-month follow-up. This included measures of premenstrual symptoms, premenstrual distress and coping, depression and anxiety, relationship adjustment, and self-silencing. Ten women from each of the three conditions were interviewed pre- and post-intervention, and ten from each of the treatment groups interviewed at follow-up. Following Blake and colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0175068.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], participants in the wait list control condition were not required to complete the three-month follow-up questionnaires or interviews for ethical considerations. All wait list participants were provided with a previously validated self-help CBT package post-intervention [<xref rid="pone.0175068.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], and invited to take part in a group meeting with a clinical psychologist to discuss their PMDs. As a result of a procedural oversight, the authors note that the study was not publically registered before participant enrolment had begun. The study has been retrospectively registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR), ACTRN: ACTRN12616000932460 and no changes were made to the study protocol or outcomes after the trial commenced. The authors confirm that there are no ongoing or related trials for this intervention. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants, and ethics approval was received from the Western Sydney University Human Research Ethics Committee (31<sup>st</sup> January 2012, H6698).</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Interventions</title><p>The one-to-one intervention was based on a woman-centred PMDs CBT intervention previously demonstrated to be effective in reducing premenstrual distress in both a face-to face [<xref rid="pone.0175068.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and self-help modality [<xref rid="pone.0175068.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. It consisted of four 90-minute sessions, conducted over a five-month period (three sessions offered on a monthly basis, and one session at two month follow-up), delivered by a woman clinical psychologist. The aims of the intervention were to examine women&#x02019;s attributions for premenstrual distress within a bio-psycho-social framework, and to challenge negative self-blaming beliefs that may exacerbate symptomatology, such as &#x0201c;I should be calm and controlled all of the time&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;I should always be able to cope&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;I shouldn&#x02019;t be angry or irritable&#x0201d;. Behavioural coping skills, including relaxation training, taking time out for self-care, diet and exercise were also examined and encouraged across the menstrual cycle. Finally, the relational context of premenstrual distress was explored, and assertiveness training techniques used to encourage calm expression of emotion, concerns or needs throughout the month [<xref rid="pone.0175068.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Women were given homework following each of the sessions and a written booklet containing detailed information about each session, to supplement the meetings with the psychologist. The couple intervention followed the same format, with inclusion of Couples Dialogue techniques [<xref rid="pone.0175068.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] to facilitate couple communication. This allows for the active involvement of the woman&#x02019;s partner in understanding PMDs, and in strategies of prevention and amelioration.</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Measures</title><p><bold>Premenstrual Symptoms Screening Tool (PSST)</bold> [<xref rid="pone.0175068.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] is a 19 item measure used to identify women who suffer from severe PMDs and who are likely to benefit from treatment. For this study, premenstrual symptoms were treated as a continuous variable to allow for changes in the degree of severity to be assessed. A principal components analysis was run on the 14 premenstrual symptoms at pre-test for all participants. A three-component solution explained 67.14% of the total variance and varimax orthogonal rotation was used to aid interpretability. The factors were interpreted as the subscales: Emotional reactivity/mood (5 items); Lack of energy/interest (5 items); and Physical symptoms (4 items). Scores for each subscale were calculated by summing raw scores corresponding to all items loading on a factor along with a total symptom score.

Semi-structured one-to-one interviews were conducted with 10 women randomly selected from each of the three conditions, pre and post-intervention.

For continuous variables, one-way ANOVA were conducted with intervention used as the grouping variable, and the chi square test for independence used for frequency data. Descriptive frequency analyses were used to examine baseline/follow-up retention rates across intervention conditions. For each intervention condition, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) (status: completer vs. non-completer) was conducted with pre-test outcome variables. Chi square analyses were used to assess group differences in PMDs cases at post-intervention, and at follow-up in the two active conditions. One-way ANOVA (intervention: couple-based vs. one-to-one vs. wait-list control) was performed on outcome variables to assess baseline differences between the intervention groups. Due to violations in the assumptions of homogeneity of regression coefficients for the outcome measures, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with pre-test scores as covariates was not used. A series of mixed 2 (time: pre vs. post) x 3 (intervention: couple-based vs. one-to-one vs. wait-list control) ANOVA were conducted for each outcome variable. Follow-up comparisons for each outcome variable were tested with separate mixed 2 (time: post vs. follow-up) x 2 (intervention: couple-based vs. one-to-one) ANOVA. Where significant interaction effects were found, the simple main effect of intervention group was tested with one-way ANOVA, and repeated measures ANOVA for time. The expectation&#x02013;maximization (EM) algorithm was used to estimate missing data in the ANOVA models tested. An alpha level of .01 was used to adjust for multiple comparisons in the primary statistical tests, whereas .05 was used for all other statistical tests.

This involved independent reading of responses to each question by two members of the research team, in order to ascertain the major themes emerging, and to develop a coding frame, based on notions of consistency, commonality, and the function and effects of specific themes. The entire data set was then coded, using NVivo&#x02013;a software package that assists with the organisation and analysis of textual data. Following coding, the percentage of responses for the open ended survey responses was calculated within each theme, across intervention conditions, to ascertain the magnitude of changes pre-post intervention within and between groups. The open ended survey items were double-blind coded; interrater reliability was high (Cohen&#x02019;s Kappa = .89).

In contrast, we found that post-intervention women in the two active CBT conditions reported significantly lower total premenstrual symptoms, lower emotional reactivity/mood, lower premenstrual distress, and higher cognitive coping than women in the wait list control. This suggests that that a CBT intervention for PMDs, in both a one-to-one and couple modality, is effective in reducing premenstrual symptoms, premenstrual distress and premenstrual emotional reactivity, as well as in improving premenstrual coping, at post-intervention, with improvements maintained at follow-up. The absence of post-intervention change in these variables in the wait list control group suggests that positive effects were due to the CBT intervention, rather than to the effects of time, or to taking part in a PMDs intervention study. These findings also suggest that the addition of a woman&#x02019;s partner to the intervention is not having an effect on her premenstrual symptoms, premenstrual distress or cognitive coping.</p><p>The finding of a main effect of time for depression, anxiety, self-silencing, physical premenstrual symptoms and lack of energy/interest, but no post-intervention group differences between groups in these variables, suggests that positive changes were associated with time, individual differences between women, or taking part in the study. Self-monitoring has been shown to be effective in the reduction of premenstrual symptomatology [<xref rid="pone.0175068.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>], due to increased awareness of the relationship between moods and stressful situations across the menstrual cycle [<xref rid="pone.0175068.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>], and giving the woman a sense of control, as well as helping her to educate her family [<xref rid="pone.0175068.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. This was confirmed by the qualitative accounts of increased awareness and understanding of premenstrual change post-intervention in the majority of participants in the wait-list control group, attributed to the self-monitoring of premenstrual mood prior to study entry, as well as completion of pre-post surveys.</p><p>The qualitative data provides insight into the subjective experience and potential mechanism of changes resulting from participation in the intervention study. Pre-intervention, the majority of women reported feeling angry, irritable and oversensitive, which is central to clinical definitions of PMDs [<xref rid="pone.0175068.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], and has been reported in previous qualitative PMDs research [<xref rid="pone.0175068.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0175068.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0175068.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. There was a substantial reduction in such reports post-intervention, most markedly in the two active conditions, suggesting a reduction in both intensity and frequency of negative premenstrual emotional reactivity, which confirms the findings of the quantitative outcome measures (PSTT). Increased awareness and understanding of premenstrual change post-intervention was one explanation for these reductions in reactivity, reported by the majority of women across conditions. This confirms previous reports of a reduction in self-pathologisation [<xref rid="pone.0175068.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], as well as the use of anticipatory coping strategies [<xref rid="pone.0175068.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], following the development of awareness of patterns of premenstrual change. The majority of women in the two active conditions, and a minority of women in the wait-list control, also reported increased communication and help-seeking, as well as the development of coping skills, associated with reductions in premenstrual reactivity and distress. These skills are core ingredients of the CBT intervention [<xref rid="pone.0175068.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0175068.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], and demonstrate the mechanisms of its effectiveness, through changing patterns of thinking, communication, coping and self-care.</p><p>Previous research has reported that women&#x02019;s bodies are often experienced as &#x02018;out of control&#x02019; during the premenstrual phase of the cycle [<xref rid="pone.0175068.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], and can become the object of critical self-scrutiny [<xref rid="pone.0175068.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0175068.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0175068.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], with the attribution of premenstrual changes to &#x02018;raging hormones&#x02019; leading women to take up the subject position of the &#x02018;monstrous feminine&#x02019; [<xref rid="pone.0175068.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In the present study, the majority of women described embodied self-loathing and feelings of unattractiveness premenstrually, primarily associated with perceptions of bloatedness and weight gain. Previous research has reported that fluctuations in weight preoccupation across the menstrual cycle are influenced primarily by post-ovulation emotional eating, rather than ovarian hormones [<xref rid="pone.0175068.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. However, the psycho-social meaning of feeling &#x02018;fat&#x02019;, associated with failing to live up to idealised constructions of feminine bodies as slim and in control [<xref rid="pone.0175068.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0175068.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>], is arguably central to women&#x02019;s dislike of the premenstrual body. These meanings can be challenged within a CBT intervention, as reflected in the increased understanding and acceptance of embodied change reported by the majority of women in the active conditions in the present study, associated with marked decreases in negative conceptualisations of the premenstrual body. Women in the two CBT conditions were also more likely to report engaging in self-care and coping strategies to deal with embodied change premenstrually, most notably in the couple condition. These findings suggest that self-perception of the body, rather than simple increase in weight or bloating, are central to women&#x02019;s feelings of negative premenstrual embodiment. There is a dearth of research on women&#x02019;s experiences of weight gain [<xref rid="pone.0175068.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>] or embodiment premenstrually; previous studies examining the efficacy of CBT for PMDs have not examined women&#x02019;s feelings about their bodies as outcome variables. The strength and uniformity of women&#x02019;s negative reports in the present study, and the positive changes post-intervention in the active conditions, suggest that this is an area worthy of further scrutiny, as women&#x02019;s negative perceptions of their bodies are strongly associated with negative perceptions of the self [<xref rid="pone.0175068.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0175068.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. This suggests that increased acceptance of the premenstrual body can positively impact on women&#x02019;s acceptance of the premenstrual self, and of premenstrual change.</p><p>Whilst previous research has reported that women who report PMDs also report higher levels of relationship dissatisfaction or difficulties [<xref rid="pone.0175068.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0175068.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], this was not found in the present study, where levels of relationship adjustment as measured by the DAS were in the normal range. Equally, the finding that no change in relationship adjustment as measured by the DAS was reported pre-post intervention, indicates that taking part in the study did not significantly impact upon global relationship adjustment, within or between groups. However, in the qualitative open-ended survey items women reported exacerbation of relationship tensions, or greater irritation towards their partner premensturally, confirming previous research of altered perceptions of family and relationship stresses [<xref rid="pone.0175068.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0175068.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], and negative evaluation of intimate relationships [<xref rid="pone.0175068.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0175068.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] in the premenstrual phase of the cycle. These relationship tensions were still present post-intervention to the same or a greater extent for the wait-list and one-to-one conditions, in contrast to a reduction in the couple condition. The finding that women in the couple and one-to-one condition were more likely to report increased partner understanding and improved relationship post-intervention, with women in the couple condition reporting these improvements to a greater degree, confirms previous reports that CBT interventions can have a positive effect on relationships [<xref rid="pone.0175068.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0175068.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. However, it suggests that couple based CBT interventions can have a greater positive impact upon perceptions of relationship context, reinforcing the plea for couples therapy as an appropriate form of intervention for PMDs [<xref rid="pone.0175068.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], and suggesting that partner involvement can increase relational support [<xref rid="pone.0175068.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>This study had a number of strengths and limitations. The strengths were the use of daily diary measures and a standardised screening instrument to establish PMDs criteria during the recruitment phase; comparison of two active treatments with a wait list control within a randomised controlled trial design; and the use of a range of qualitative and quantitative measures allowing for the extent of change within and between groups to be evaluated with repeated measures ANOVA, alongside women&#x02019;s subjective experience of change. Whilst the rate of attrition post-intervention was a limitation, resulting in a small sample size, attrition was lower than that reported in previous CBT RCTs for PMDs [<xref rid="pone.0175068.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], and the groups were of sufficient size to allow for adequate statistical power to detect a significant difference between intervention groups. A limitation was the absence of daily diary ratings throughout the study, which would have allowed for measurement of ongoing change. This was not possible due to participant survey fatigue, with completion of daily diary ratings pre-randomisation reported to be the only negative aspect of taking part in the study. Whilst partners were included in the couple condition, no evaluation of the perspectives of partners across conditions was included. This would strengthen the design of future couple interventions for PMDs, allowing for evaluation of the impact of intervention on partners, and possible changes in their perspective on women&#x02019;s PMDs. The majority of women who took part in this study were in heterosexual relationships. However, the one-to-one intervention used in the study has been found to be efficacious with women who are single and in lesbian relationships in previous research [<xref rid="pone.0175068.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0175068.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>], suggesting it has efficacy beyond women in a heterosexual couple.</p><sec id="sec029"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, the findings of this study suggest whilst taking part in an intervention study for PMDs can have a beneficial impact in reducing premenstrual symptoms and premenstrual distress, and in improving premenstrual coping, active CBT is more beneficial than a wait-list control. Therefore, whilst daily monitoring may increase awareness of premenstrual change, the active ingredients of a women-centred cognitive behavioural intervention are more efficacious in reducing symptomatology and increasing a woman&#x02019;s sense of control of her premenstrual moods, as well as her ability to cope with psychological and embodied premenstrual change. This can have positive consequences for a woman&#x02019;s perception of her relationship in the premenstrual phase of the cycle, with couple-based interventions having a greater impact in this regard.</p><p>Couple based CBT interventions may have a greater positive impact upon behavioural coping and perceptions of relationship context and support. This suggests that CBT should be available for women reporting moderate-severe PMDs, with couple-based CBT offering additional benefits to a one-to-one modality. Whilst CBT may be more costly than bio-medical treatments in the short term, as it requires more intensive clinician time and trained personnel [<xref rid="pone.0175068.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], the finding of a benefit over a relatively short time period suggests that long term costs may be lower than the ongoing medical treatment that is recommended for severe PMDs [<xref rid="pone.0175068.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Equally, a psychological intervention may be preferable to women who experience side effects of medical treatments for PMDs and who withdraw from treatment as a result [<xref rid="pone.0175068.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0175068.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Finally, the demonstration of efficacy of a CBT intervention for PMDs confirms the viewpoint that premenstrual distress is not simply a phenomenon located in women&#x02019;s physiology, but that it is closely tied to psycho-social factors [<xref rid="pone.0175068.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0175068.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], including a woman&#x02019;s perception of &#x02018;PMS&#x02019; and the premenstrual self, her relationship context, and her means of coping with embodied or psychological change throughout the whole cycle. These findings support the argument that CBT can have a preventative effect for PMDs [<xref rid="pone.0175068.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], by preventing the premenstrual increases in negative symptomatology or changing the way women come to relate to and report those symptoms. The inclusion of a psycho-social model of premenstrual change in health education for young women, and more broadly in education about adult women&#x02019;s reproductive health, may go some way to increasing understanding of women&#x02019;s cyclical mood change, as well as increasing women&#x02019;s increasing agency and coping, thus reducing rates of premenstrual distress in the community. This will have positive consequences for women and their families, as well as for women&#x02019;s social and economic functioning.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec030"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0175068.s001"><label>S1 Checklist</label><caption><title>CONSORT 2010 checklist.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0175068.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0175068.s002"><label>S1 Protocol</label><caption><title>Study protocol.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0175068.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0175068.s003"><label>S1 Dataset</label><caption><title>Study data set file.</title><p>(SAV)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0175068.s003.sav"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Yasmin Hawkins, assisted by Michelle Rae, for administering the data collection and for coding the interview data.
