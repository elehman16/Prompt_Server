Bemfola<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (Finox AG, Burgdorf, Switzerland), a new biosimilar r-hFSH, has proven comparable non-clinical pharmacological profiles to those of the widely used Gonal-f<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (Serono Pharma S.p.A., Bari, Italy). The objective of this study was to show that Bemfola<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> yields comparable clinical pharmacokinetic (PK) and safety profiles to Gonal-f<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> in healthy female subjects. In this randomized, Phase I trial conducted in healthy female volunteers (<italic>N</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;32), a 2-period, balanced 2-treatment crossover design was used. A single subcutaneous dose of 225&#x000a0;IU Bemfola<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> or Gonal-f<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> was administered in each treatment period per sequence. Blood was collected for pharmacokinetic analysis until 10&#x000a0;days after each r-hFSH treatment. For down-regulation of endogenous FSH subjects were given a depot injection with leuprolide acetate prior to the study drug in either sequence. Pharmacokinetic data was available for 23 subjects. No appreciable differences in key PK parameters were detected between the r-hFSH products as per non-compartmental PK analysis [i.e. for Bemfola<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> and Gonal-f<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> respectively AUC<sub>0&#x02013;192</sub> 424.90 and 432.75&#x000a0;IU&#x000a0;h/L, <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> 0.98 and 0.95&#x000a0;IU/L, <italic>T</italic><sub>max</sub> 24.0&#x000a0;h (range 6.0&#x02013;24.0) and 24.0&#x000a0;h (range 9.0&#x02013;24.0), <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> 43.58&#x000a0;h [standard deviation (SD 14.17)] and 42.58&#x000a0;h (SD 16.47), and <italic>K</italic><sub>e</sub> 0.0075&#x000a0;1/h (SD 0.003) and 0.0077&#x000a0;1/h (SD 0.002)].

Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is a pituitary glycoprotein hormone that plays a key role in regulating reproductive function in both males and females.</p><p>FSH is a heterodimeric hormone composed of two linked subunits. The alpha-subunit (92 amino acids) is common to other glycoprotein hormones and the beta-subunit (111 amino acids) is specific.</p><p>For clinical use either FSH extracted from the urine of postmenopausal women (u-hFSH) or recombinant human FSH (r-hFSH) is used.</p><p>For the production of Bemfola<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, a Chinese hamster ovary cell line transfected with the genes coding for the alpha and beta subunits of human FSH is used.</p><p>Gonal-f<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, which has been commercially available since 1995, is an example of a currently marketed r-hFSH product and is primarily used for treating infertility. In particular, Gonal-f<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> is used for ovulation induction in normogonadotrophic (WHO type II) anovulatory women and WHO type I anovulatory infertility in association with a luteinizing hormone (LH) preparation, as well as for controlled ovarian stimulation in patients undergoing assisted reproductive technology (ART).</p><p>High treatment costs restrict access to high-quality biological medicines (Schellekens and Moors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2010</xref>; Engelberg et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2009</xref>); in the case of r-hFSH biosimilar versions of this recombinant hormone have been developed in&#x000a0;order to provide high-quality alternatives that are more economically attractive than their present r-hFSH counterparts. Biosimilars meet high standards for comparability to the originator medicine and are approved for use in the same indications (Weise et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2012</xref>).</p><p>Bemfola<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> is a r-hFSH biosimilar that has been demonstrated to have the same physicochemical properties (Gonal-f<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> SPC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2014</xref>; Bemfola<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> SPC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2014</xref>) and is marketed in the same therapeutic indications as Gonal-f<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>.

This design minimizes the inter-subject variability and therefore lowers the required sample size. A validated software (RANCODE; idv-Datenanalyse und Versuchsplanung, Gauting, Germany) was used to generate the randomization schedule using block randomization with variable block sizes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Treatment administration</title><p>Eligible subjects received a leuprolide acetate depot injection between cycle days 15&#x02013;21 for the down-regulation of their endogenous FSH levels and discontinued oral contraceptives on the same day.

On Study Day 2, subjects received a single subcutaneous dose of 225&#x000a0;IU r-hFSH and stayed at the clinical site for 24&#x000a0;h for PK evaluation. Further blood collections were performed daily until Study Day 10 (i.e., 8&#x000a0;days after r-hFSH application). On Study Day 10, subjects received a second depot injection of leuprolide acetate. On Study Day 15, E2 and FSH were controlled, and the second cycle with application of the other r-hFSH preparation was initiated on Study Day 16, which followed an identical schedule. On Study Day 24, the last PK sample was collected, and physical and gynecological exam, vaginal ultrasound, and safety lab examinations were performed. A telephone follow-up was arranged to confirm that menstrual cycle had resumed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Assessments</title><p>For the assessment of PK parameters [i.e., maximum concentration (<italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub>), time to maximum concentration (<italic>T</italic><sub>max</sub>), area under the curve between time 0 and 192&#x000a0;h (AUC<sub>0&#x02013;192</sub>), terminal half-life (<italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub>), and terminal elimination rate constant (<italic>K</italic><sub>e</sub>)] venous blood samples were collected at 0, 0.5, 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 16, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, 168, and 192&#x000a0;h after each r-hFSH injection. Serum was prepared by centrifugation at room temperature (10&#x000a0;min, 3,000&#x000a0;rpm Hettich Rotana TRC centrifuge, <italic>r</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;194&#x000a0;mm) and frozen at &#x02212;70&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C until analysis. The serum concentrations of FSH and E2 were analyzed using the COBAS test kit for FSH and E2, respectively (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Germany).

The null and alternative hypotheses for determining bioequivalence were tested by using the difference method implemented in the used validated statistics program TESTIMATE. This method was equivalent to fitting an analysis of variance (ANOVA) to the primary endpoint, where the factors formulation, period, sequence, and subject nested within sequence were used to explain the overall variability in the observations. The sample size was calculated to ensure an adequate evaluation of the primary endpoint (equal to the primary objective) and based on a one-sided significance level of 5&#x000a0;% and a power of 80&#x000a0;%. The intra-subject variability was estimated to be 15&#x000a0;% based on published PK data of a bioequivalence study between liquid and freeze-dried formulation of Gonal-f<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>.

Altogether, 17 out of 24 subjects gave a written consent for further investigation of their blood samples.</p><p>Background for this amendment was the expectation of detecting an increase in E2 levels even after single application of r-hFSH to pituitary down-regulated subjects. This increase could be rated as marker for pharmacodynamic activity of Bemfola<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> and Gonal-f<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>. The rise in E2 serum concentration was expected to be low but detectable with a maximum approximately 24&#x000a0;h after r-hFSH application. Therefore sample collection times used for determination of FSH serum concentration were also appropriate for investigating E2.</p><p>A low but detectable rise and plateau by 24&#x02013;48&#x000a0;h in mean E2 serum concentration was observed after a single subcutaneous dose of either Bemfola<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> or Gonal-f<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>.

The AEs occurring most frequently were headache (63&#x000a0;% of subjects) and hot flushes (46&#x000a0;% of subjects). One subject was withdrawn because of an erroneous ultrasound assessment. All but one subject recovered from their AEs, with the majority of AEs being mild in nature and requiring minimal or no therapeutic intervention for resolution. The one subject not recovered during the frame of the study was reported with acne of mild intensity; however, this was suspected by the investigator to be related to the leuprolide acetate depot treatment. Results of ECG, vital signs and physical examinations gave no reason for clinical concern. No continuous and relevant changes of the safety laboratory parameters were documented throughout the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Immunogenicity profile</title><p>No specific antibodies to FSH were detected after r-hFSH administration. In 64 of 72 samples, response signals were below the limit of Quantification (LoQ). 8 of 72 samples were above the LoQ (i.e., in the very low range of the standard curve). Results from a specificity assay demonstrated that these were background signals unspecific to FSH. In samples collected at Study Days 15 and 24, the detected response was similar to the baseline value for all subjects, and no significant increase was detected (data not shown).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec15" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The results of Study FIN1001 indicate that 225&#x000a0;IU Bemfola<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> and the reference product Gonal-f<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> administered as a single dose are bioequivalent based on the systemic exposure as demonstrated by AUC<sub>(0&#x02013;192)</sub>.

The PK and safety findings presented here therefore support the assumption that Bemfola<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> may be an acceptable alternative to Gonal-f<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> in the treatment of infertility.</p><p>As a marker for Pharmacodynamic activity of Bemfola<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> and Gonal-f<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, a post hoc analysis was conducted, measuring whether an increase in E2 levels could be detected after a single application of r-hFSH to the pituitary down-regulated subjects. Both r-hFSH preparations induced a measurable increase in E2 levels. While there was a tendency to a stronger response to Bemfola<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, the difference in AUC and <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> was not statistically different.</p><p>No significant safety issues were reported in this safety assessment; most AEs were mild in nature and resolved in response to minimal or no therapeutic intervention. One subject was withdrawn because of an erroneous ultrasound assessment. No clinically relevant findings as per ECG, vital-sign, physical, and laboratory examination were observed. Immunogenicity to FSH was not evident in this trial; however, the clinical impact of this observation is not clear given that it is based on the administration of a single SC dose.</p><p>The results of this study indicate that a single dose of Bemfola<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> exhibits pharmacokinetic and safety profiles comparable to Gonal-f<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> in healthy young women.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are grateful for the study support by Carola Fuchs, RN of the Medical University of Vienna.</p><sec id="d30e1150"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>Michael Wolzt, Ghazaleh Gouya and Michael Sator have nothing to declare.
