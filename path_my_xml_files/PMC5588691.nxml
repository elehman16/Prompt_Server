Laparoscopy was introduced in the 1990es and is today one of the recommended routes of surgery. A recent observational study showed that operative time for hysterectomy was significantly lower for 3-dimensional compared to conventional laparoscopy. Complication rates were similar for the two groups. No other observational studies or randomized clinical trials have compared 3-dimensional to conventional laparoscopy in patients undergoing total hysterectomy for benign disease.</p><p id="Par2">The objective of the study is to determine if 3D laparoscopy gives better quality of life, less postoperative pain, less per- and postoperative complications, shorter operative time, or a shorter stay in hospital and a faster return to work or normal life, compared to conventional laparoscopy for benign hysterectomy.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p id="Par3">The design is a randomised multicentre clinical trial. Participants will be 400 women referred for laparoscopic hysterectomy for benign indications. Patients will be randomized to 3-dimensional or conventional laparoscopic hysterectomy. Operative procedures will follow the same principles and the same standard whether the surgeon&#x02019;s vision is 3-dimensional or conventional laparoscopy. Primary outcomes will be the impact of surgery on quality of life, assessed by the SF 36 questionnaire, and postoperative pain, assessed by a Visual Analogue scale for pain measurement. With a standard deviation of 12 points on SF 36 questionnaire, a risk of type I error of 3.3% and a risk of type II error of 10% a sample size of 190 patients in each arm of the trial is needed. Secondarily, we will investigate operative time, time to return to work, length of hospital stay, and - and postoperative complications.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par4">This trial will be the first randomized clinical trial investigating the potential clinical benefits and harms of 3-dimensional compared to conventional laparoscopy.

Both procedures are associated with shorter hospital stay and faster recovery compared to laparotomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Vaginal hysterectomy has lower costs and in some studies, a lower complication rate compared to laparoscopy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In younger women without prolapse, however, the operation is not as straightforward as in older women. Furthermore, proper access to the pelvic cavity is not provided by the vaginal route, which makes laparoscopy first choice when the procedure involves adnexal surgery. In many departments, adnexal surgery has become part of the standard procedure for hysterectomy, since recent studies suggest that concomitant removal of the fallopian tubes may decrease the risk of development of ovarian and peritoneal cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par10">Despite promising results, adoption of the laparoscopic approach for benign hysterectomy has been slow. A longer operating procedure, the requirement of advanced laparoscopic skills, and challenges in especially obese patients have been cited as the main reasons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Accordingly even today only a minor proportion of all benign hysterectomies are performed laparoscopically in European countries.</p><p id="Par11">In 2005 the US Food and Drug Administration approved the Da Vinci robotic platform for gynaecologic surgery. Due to improved dexterity, ergonomics, and a 3-dimensional imaging the technology was promoted to overcome many of the limitations and drawbacks of conventional laparoscopy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Within few years, the number of benign hysterectomies performed by robotic-assisted laparoscopy showed a tremendous rise. Benefits compared to conventional laparoscopy, however, have not been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. On the contrary, a randomized trial concludes that robotic assistance may lengthen operative time for benign hysterectomy with an average of 77&#x000a0;min compared to conventional laparoscopy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par12">Three-dimensional (3D) laparoscopy offers the same 3-dimensional stereoscopic imaging as robotic surgery, but in a conventional laparoscopic set-up with much lower costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Although dexterity and ergonomics are theoretically inferior to those of robotic surgery, docking of the big and inconvenient patient robotic-cart is avoided, reducing the number of operative steps. Furthermore, instruments are held by the surgeon and not by robotic arms, which means a preservation of the tactile sense. The place of 3D laparoscopy in the range of endoscopic approaches for benign hysterectomy, however, is not clear. An updated literature search in PubMed and Embase, using Mesh terms and the search string <italic>&#x0201c;&#x0201c;Imaging, Three-Dimensional&#x0201d;&#x0201d; [Mesh]) AND ((&#x0201c;&#x0201c;Hysterectomy&#x0201d;&#x0201d; [Mesh]) OR laparoscopic hysterectomy) (19&#x02013;02-2015)</italic>, demonstrates that data are sparse. No randomized trials exist, and only a single retrospective study has been published within gynaecological surgery. In that study, operative time for hysterectomy was significantly lower for 3D compared to conventional laparoscopy. Complication rates were similar for the two groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par13">In conclusion, although laparoscopy is one of the recommended routes of surgery for benign hysterectomy, the place of 3D laparoscopy in the range of endoscopic approaches is not clear. Robotic surgery for hysterectomy was introduced without evidence for the clinical benefit, underlining the importance of clinical trials before implementation of new techniques. We expect that 3D- technology improves imaging and facilitates faster and safer surgery, causing less pain, shorter recovery and fewer postoperative complications.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods and design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Aim</title><p id="Par14">The objective of the study is to determine if 3D laparoscopy gives better quality of life, less postoperative pain, less per- and postoperative complications, shorter operative time, or a shorter stay in hospital and a faster return to work or normal life, compared to conventional laparoscopy for benign hysterectomy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Design</title><p id="Par15">An investigator-initiated, blinded, randomized, clinical trial.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Setting</title><p id="Par16">Roskilde University Hospital, Denmark.</p><p id="Par17">Herlev University Hospital, Denmark.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Participants</title><p id="Par18">Participants will be patients referred for laparoscopic hysterectomy with or without bilateral salpingectomy or bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy for benign indications.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Interventions</title><p id="Par19">In order to assess which mode of laparoscopy is more favourable in a RCT, it is necessary to use similar and well-defined procedures in all other areas around the surgery. Therefore the preoperative information and patient education is standardized. Pre-emptive medication is 8&#x000a0;mg dexamethasone, 2&#x000a0;g paracetamol, 400&#x000a0;mg Ibumetin and 4&#x000a0;mg Ondacetron. Anaesthesia and postoperative care is also standardized as well as the operative procedure.</p><p id="Par20">Standard preoperative assessment will be performed together with transvaginal ultrasound estimating the size of the uterus. Operative procedures will follow the previously described &#x0201c;Gold standard&#x0201d; as follows: A manipulator will be used in all patients to expose and delineate different anatomical structures. For ligation and dissection, a Thunderbeat&#x000ae; bipolar/ultrasound sealing and cutting energy device will be used. After detachment, uterus will be removed through the vaginal vault. In case of a very narrow vagina combined with a myomatous uterus it may be necessary to enlarge the abdominal incision [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Morcellation or any other destruction of the uterus inside the abdomen will not be performed. The vaginal vault will be closed laparoscopically with a running Vicryl 2&#x02013;0 suture or a barbed suture V-lock&#x000ae; 2&#x02013;0. Urinary catheter will be removed immediately after the operation. For postoperative pain relief, the patients will be given sufentanil/Fentanyl in the recovery ward, and paracetamol, NSAID and in some cases morphine in the gynaecological unit. After a few hours on the recovery ward, they will return to the gynaecological unit.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Data collection</title><p id="Par21">Patients found suitable for participation will be informed about the trial.

<italic>If willing to participate, and after instructions on how to understand the questionnaire the patient completes the SF-36 questionnaire in the preoperative assessment. To reduce risk of bias at the 6&#x000a0;week postoperative telephone interview, patient is re-introduced to and provided with a copy of the SF 36 questionnaire at the time of discharge; further, the research nurse is instructed to stay neutral at the telephone interview</italic> Randomization will be performed in the morning of the operation day. A visual analogue-scale (VAS) for pain scoring will be used when the participants return to the gynaecological unit, 5&#x000a0;h postoperatively. Hospital discharge will be considered when the women are fully mobilized, urinating and pain is controlled with milder oral analgesia. At discharge, use of painkillers stronger than over-the-counter medicine will be registered. The women will be asked to scale their pain at a VAS score in the morning of the first 3 days after discharge. Six weeks after surgery, all patients will receive a telephone call from a nurse, where a SF-36-v2 questionnaire similar to that given preoperatively will be filled out. Pre-operative data is registered by the doctor in the outpatient department record sheet, Operative data by the surgeon in the operation record sheet, and Postoperative data recorded by the nurse surgeon in the discharge department record sheet. Any readmission or complications causing readmission is registered by the doctor in the readmission sheet and will be double-cheeked at the telephone interview. If readmitted or treated at another hospital, this will be registered (linked to personal identification number) at the national patient register where all diagnoses are registered and compiled, with the Hysterectomy Database ensuring no complication will be overlooked.</p><p id="Par23">Time to return to work or other normal life, use of postoperative painkillers, and postoperative complications are noted by the nurse in the telephone interview 6&#x000a0;weeks after the operation (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Plan for obtaining data for both 2- and 3D hysterectomies</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>3D and conventional laparoscopic hysterectomy</th><th>Enrolment in outpatient clinic</th><th>Allocation and operation</th><th>Discharge from hospital</th><th>Telephone interview</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>TIMEPOINT</td><td>-t1</td><td>0</td><td>tx</td><td>tx&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;6&#x000a0;weeks</td></tr><tr><td>Baseline variables: height, weight, age, prior operations, chronic pain, parity, estimated weight of uterus, indication for operation, site.

Complication rates were not statistically different, but this conclusion was limited by a small number of patients in each group. So far, no trials have examined whether 3D laparoscopy has an impact on postoperative pain or quality of life after return to daily activities.</p><p id="Par53">3D laparoscopy offers a 3-dimensional stereoscopic imaging combined with preserved tactile sense as in a conventional laparoscopic set-up, and 3D laparoscopy might therefore refine and optimise surgery. However, we do not know whether 3D laparoscopy offers clinical benefit compared to conventional laparoscopic, whether the potential beneficial effects are relevant for the patient, or whether 3D laparoscopy causes unexpected adverse effects.</p><p id="Par54">The price of 3D laparoscopy is higher than for 2D equipment, but lower than for robotic surgery. As medical equipment is becoming increasingly sophisticated and expensive, it is essential to determine whether 3D has relevant effects in clinical practise before it is implemented as part of the daily routine.</p><p id="Par55">We hope that this trial will help place 3D laparoscopy in the range of endoscopic approaches for benign hysterectomy.</p><sec id="Sec26"><title>Trial strengths and limitations</title><p id="Par56">This trial has a number of strengths. First, the randomized design makes it possible to validly assess the effects of the two surgical interventions. Second, the trial has a high degree of external validity because we assess the effects of operative procedures as they are performed in most gynecological departments and we use two recruiting centers. Third, the risk of systematic errors is reduced by central randomization stratified for prognostic factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], blinding is used to the highest possible extent, and data is analysed according to the intention-to-treat principle. Fourth, in trials investigating operative procedures it is often difficult to distinguish whether different effects of the operative techniques or varying skills of the surgeon cause a supposed difference. In this present trial the same experienced surgeons perform both the conventional and 3D operations. This, together with the overall low risk of bias of this trial, contributes to a high degree of internal validity. Finally, we estimated a sample size adjusted for two primary outcomes using realistic anticipated intervention effects and we performed power calculations for all secondary outcomes, and we planned to adjust the thresholds for significance if we do not reach the planned sample size. This limits the risks of random error [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par57">A limitation of this trial is that we will probably not be able to detect a difference in complication rate between the 2 arms of the trial. The overall low complication rate following laparoscopic hysterectomy requires a large sample size to detect a possible difference. We expect it is more likely to demonstrate a difference in postoperative pain or quality of life, two other relevant clinical outcomes that have not previously been assessed following 3D laparoscopic hysterectomy.</p></sec></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>3D</term><def><p id="Par6">3-dimensional</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Tv.
