At least 94 common breast risk single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been shown to be associated with breast cancer.<sup><xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>-<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> It is anticipated that many more will be found in future,<sup><xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> but they are expected to be individually much less predictive. Each SNP found to date only confers a small relative risk, but together, they can usefully stratify risk in the general population.<sup><xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup></p><p>Accurate risk assessment is important for many decisions about preventive interventions, such as increased screening and preventive therapy.<sup><xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> Risk evaluators available include the Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool (Gail model), Tyrer-Cuzick (TC), Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium, and the Breast and Ovarian Analysis of Disease Incidence and Carrier Estimation Algorithm models.<sup><xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>-<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> SNP panels are most likely to be of use in clinical practice if they can be combined with such models; therefore, it is important to measure how much additional information they add.</p><p>Previous work in this area has been done using case-control studies of mainly postmenopausal women. Wacholder et al<sup><xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> showed that fitting a SNP10 risk score in addition to Gail model factors yielded a modest improvement. Mealiffe et al<sup><xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> found a similar result in in the Women&#x02019;s Health Initiative trial using a predefined SNP7 panel, and Lee et al<sup><xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> reported that a SNP51 panel added to Gail model risk factors in Asian women. Vachon et al<sup><xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> showed that a predefined SNP76 panel added information to the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium model in three case-control studies. Mavaddat et al<sup><xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> fitted a SNP77 panel in a large case-control analysis of women from the general population. Dite et al<sup><xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> reported that a predefined SNP77 panel was informative for women at increased risk for breast cancer as a result of classic risk factors from the Australian Breast Cancer Family Registry.</p><p>Our focus is the extent to which an SNP panel can refine risk in women already at an increased risk for breast cancer as a result of classic factors and who may receive preventive therapy and to assess whether the preventive effect of tamoxifen varied according to SNP-derived estimates of risk. A previous study of the first of these issues has been conducted by Vachon et al.<sup><xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> They used a nested case-control study within the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project P-1 and P-2 prevention trials, on the basis of women receiving tamoxifen or raloxifene (no placebo), and found that a 75-SNP panel had good univariable power for predicting subsequent risk and added accuracy to the Gail model. However, they did not compare directly with women who did not receive treatment and therefore were unable to directly test for a difference between women receiving treatment or not, nor could they estimate the relative information from the SNP panel compared with classic factors.</p><p>A consortium has designed a custom Illumina (San Diego, CA) array (OncoArray), with more than half a million SNPs, including most known breast-cancer risk SNPs. In this article, we present the results from an SNP score on the basis of this assay, using a nested case-control study of women recruited into the International Breast Intervention Study (IBIS-I)<sup><xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> and Royal Marsden<sup><xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> randomized tamoxifen prevention trials. The SNPs used were those for which the breast cancer risk has been previously validated and are directly available or have close surrogates on the OncoArray. The main objectives were to evaluate the performance of the SNP panel using a population at increased risk as a result of classic risk factors (including a family history or prior proliferative benign tissue diagnosis); compare and combine this with risk estimates from the TC model,<sup><xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> which uses classic phenotypic factors; and to conduct subgroup analyses to assess the performance by treatment allocation (tamoxifen or placebo) and estrogen-receptor (ER) status of the tumors that subsequently occurred.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s3"><title>Patients</title><p>Women were recruited into the IBIS-I and Royal Marsden (Marsden) trials, as previously described<sup><xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> (Data Supplement). Both trials were double blind with women randomly assigned to receive tamoxifen (20 mg/day) or placebo for 5 years (IBIS-I) or 5 to 8 years (Marsden). Subsequent cancers were ascertained by clinic visits during the treatment period and thereafter by questionnaire, cancer registry follow-up, and/or clinic visits.

However, they were not available for 38 cases, where tissue samples from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded blocks were used. They were included only in a sensitivity analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Assay Methods</title><p>We used 10 &#x003bc;L of extracted DNA from IBIS-I (concentration 100 ng/&#x003bc;L) and Marsden (50 ng/&#x003bc;L) samples on thirteen 96-well plates, including a separate plate for the formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded block samples. Two samples with known genotypes were used as internal controls for each plate. Assays were carried out blindly at Genome Quebec (Montreal, Canada), which was clinical service provider&#x02013;certified by Illumina; the Illumina OncoArray was used, and the Illumina HTS (high-throughput sequencing) protocol was rigorously followed.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Study Design</title><p>The primary end point was diagnosis of invasive breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ. The study was designed to use all cases from the trials with material available for genotyping and had more than 99% power to detect the expected polygenic score at a 5% level.<sup><xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> The Marsden trial was a pilot for the IBIS-I trial, and the cohorts had similar characteristics. They were combined to increase precision and to provide greater power for subgroup analyses, as in previous analyses.<sup><xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> Case-control matching was by study, age at baseline (&#x000b1; 2 years), treatment arm, and follow-up time, with two controls per case in IBIS-I and one in Marsden. IBIS-I recruited from 1992 to 2001, and Marsden recruited from 1986 to 1996. The end of follow-up for the current analysis was 2014 and 2010, respectively; median follow-up was 16.5 years for IBIS-I and 18.4 years for Marsden.</p><p>A polygenic score was used to provide an overall risk estimate.<sup><xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> Three SNPs were excluded because they had no surrogate SNP on the OncoArray (<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> &#x0003c; .8 from the 1000 Genomes Project Central European panel<sup><xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>) and three SNPs failed quality control. We calculated the normalized odds ratio for each of the three SNP genotypes (no risk alleles, 1 risk allele, and 2 risk alleles) from published per-allele odds ratios, assuming independence and normalizing by an assumed risk allele frequency so that the average risk was unity.<sup><xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>-<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> An overall SNP risk score for each woman (SNP88) was formed by multiplying the odds ratios for each of her 88 genotypes together (Data Supplement). The odds ratios for the TC risk<sup><xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> (v7.02) at entry to each study were obtained by dividing the 10-year predicted odds for a person by that from the average population of a woman of the same age (Data Supplement).</p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Analysis Methods</title><p>SNPs that failed in more than 2% of the samples were excluded, as well as samples that failed for more than 10 SNPs. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for each SNP in cases and controls was tested by assessing the observed number of homozygotes against expected using a binomial distribution. Sporadic assay failures in SNP88 were assigned the population risk of 1.0. Conditional logistic regression was used for the logarithm of the SNP88 score and TC risk, alone and in combination, assuming independence. A bivariable model was then used to assess the added value of the SNP88 score to the TC risk model. Interaction tests were used to examine subgroups. SNP88 and TC calibration was assessed primarily by regressing observed risks on expected risks. Calibration of SNP88 was further explored by deciles of the SNP88 in controls and for TC by the ratio of observed to expected cancers diagnosed in the entire placebo arm of the IBIS-I trial, overall and by decile (TC in the complete Marsden cohort was unavailable). Concordance indices for matched sets were used as a secondary measure of discrimination.<sup><xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> The distribution of absolute 10-year risk was estimated by weighting cases and controls to reflect a 6% 10-year risk for the whole trial.<sup><xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> An 8% 10-year risk cut point was chosen because this is the threshold recommended in the United Kingdom for offering preventive therapy.<sup><xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> The reclassification of cases and controls about this cut point from TC was assessed using an SNP score that was recalibrated to the data. A sensitivity analysis was undertaken to impute risk from failed assays in the 88 SNPs by applying the Beagle algorithm (Data Supplement).<sup><xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> A sensitivity analysis considered when tissue samples that did not fail more than 10 SNPs were included.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s8"><title>RESULTS</title><p>A CONSORT diagram of the source of patients is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>. A total of 1,276 women (483 cases, 793 controls) from both trials were initially selected for the case-control study. However, insufficient DNA was available in 169 samples, and the initial design was adjusted to ensure that all cases had matched controls. Twenty-five samples (2.3%) with more than 10 failures were excluded (Data Supplement), in addition to all tissue sample results, because tissue samples were more likely to have more than 10 SNP failures.

In sensitivity analyses, there was little difference when missing data were imputed (Data Supplement) or when the analysis included all tissue samples that met the quality control thresholds (Data Supplement).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s9"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>A polygenic SNP score on the basis of common low penetrance genetic polymorphisms provides additional risk information for women who are already at an increased risk for the disease as a result of classic factors. SNP88 was independent of the TC risk model, and no loss of relative predictive power was seen when it was used in combination with TC. However, the SNP panel seems to be in need of recalibration, at least when applied to high-risk women in similar populations. SNP88 had less than half the expected risk on the basis of multiplying published risks for individual SNPs. In addition, the spread of risks associated with SNP88 were of a smaller magnitude than those of TC (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>), especially after recalibration. Thus, although the SNP score had minimal ability to increase the number of classically high-risk women to be at more than 8% 10-year risk (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>), it did more accurately populate this group. The SNP score also did not predict which women would differentially benefit from tamoxifen.</p><p>One possible reason for the poor calibration of the SNP score is overfitting. Using the published odds ratios and CIs, we applied a James-Stein shrinkage estimator and estimated that this might account for overfitting of approximately 5% in calibration (data not shown). Thus, it is unlikely to explain most of the difference between observed and expected risks.</p><p>In general populations, polygenic scores have demonstrated good calibration. For example, Vachon et al<sup><xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> used a SNP76 panel in a general population and found an OR per standard deviation (SD) of approximately 1.5, compared with 1.6 expected (calculated by computer simulation following Brentnall et al<sup><xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>): calibration was approximately 86% [log<sub>e</sub>(1.5)/log<sub>e</sub>(1.6)]. Dite et al<sup><xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> reported a SNP77 panel in women with a family history. The OR per SD was approximately 1.4, which was only approximately 70% of expected. In the context of prevention trials, Vachon et al<sup><xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> reported an odds ratio of approximately 1.8 for the difference between the top and bottom quintile of their SNP75 panel, compared with approximately 3.8 if the score had been well calibrated. Thus, overall, our results are not inconsistent with previous findings for women with an elevated risk of cancer, and it seems that recalibration of polygenic risk scores is needed for these women. A strong family history might change the relationship between SNPs and risk because risks for each SNP are different for <italic>BRCA1</italic> and <italic>BRCA2</italic> mutation carriers than for the general population.<sup><xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> The percentage of <italic>BRCA1</italic> and <italic>BRCA2</italic> carriers was estimated to be 2.8% in Marsden and 1.9% in IBIS-I from the TC model; therefore, this is only a partial explanation.</p><p>A limitation of this study is that we could not assess the performance of SNPs in conjunction with mammographic breast density, which is another important component of risk.<sup><xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> Also, the findings are only applicable to similar high-risk groups of women of the same age. It is likely that these findings apply to other risk models, such as the Gail model, because SNP scores are largely independent of the factors used.<sup><xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup></p><p>The study has several strengths. First, the cancers were diagnosed prospectively from an extended follow-up period. Second, we were able to compare the performance within the tamoxifen and placebo arms directly, without indirect comparisons with other studies. Third, we were able to assess how much an SNP score adds compared with a risk model on the basis of classic factors (except for age). This was not possible in the analysis from the P1 and P2 trials,<sup><xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> because they matched on risk from classic factors. Another advantage of the current study is that the SNPs were genotyped directly (36 of 75 were imputed in Vachon et al<sup><xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>), so that a poor imputation procedure is not a possible reason for the calibration issue.</p><p>In conclusion, our findings extend earlier work to high-risk populations and indicate that SNP scores increase the accuracy of risk assessment for these women, but substantial recalibration seems to be required for accurate risk assessment.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn2" fn-type="supported-by"><p>Supported by the National Cancer Institute (Grant No. prime award: 5U19CA148065-03Rev; subaward: 114080_5029147 to J.C.), Cancer Research UK (Grant No. C569/A16891), and the Breast Cancer Research Fund.
