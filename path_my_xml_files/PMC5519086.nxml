Adherence to this recommendation is poor, especially among older adults. According to the 2016 OECD report in European countries, approximately 36% of adults aged 16 years and older, and as many as 64% of adults aged 65 years and older do not meet this minimum PA level [<xref rid="pone.0181371.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0181371.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. This epidemic of physical inactivity has detrimental health effects [<xref rid="pone.0181371.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Physical inactivity is thought to determine 9% of premature mortality and its elimination would remove 6&#x02013;10% of major noncommunicable diseases such as coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and breast and colon cancers [<xref rid="pone.0181371.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Among older adults, PA has shown additional benefits that include the prevention or delay of functional decline [<xref rid="pone.0181371.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0181371.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], protective effects on cognitive function [<xref rid="pone.0181371.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], mood improvement in depressive disorders [<xref rid="pone.0181371.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], reduced fear of falling and improved balance [<xref rid="pone.0181371.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and prevention of fractures by increasing muscle strength, balance, and bone mineral density [<xref rid="pone.0181371.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Not only is the minimal recommended level of PA beneficial for health, but studies have shown a favourable dose-response relationship of further increases of PA up to 3 to 5 times the minimum recommended level [<xref rid="pone.0181371.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>So, why do older persons not engage in more PA? Evidence for the favourable effects of PA on health is abundant, and most older persons give high priority to staying healthy in old age. Many are aware of general health benefits of PA but believe that high levels of PA may be unnecessary or perhaps even harmful for them personally [<xref rid="pone.0181371.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0181371.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. More importantly, several studies have shown that many older persons remain at low levels of PA due to problems or concerns related to their individual health status, such as pain or discomfort with PA, physical limitation, fear of falling, or presence of one or multiple chronic conditions [<xref rid="pone.0181371.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0181371.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Not surprisingly, multiple intervention studies have found only modest effects of interventions to increase PA on older persons&#x02019; PA levels [<xref rid="pone.0181371.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>We therefore designed a novel intervention for increasing PA and reducing sedentary behaviour in older persons. To address potential barriers to PA relevant in old age, we combined PA counselling with an initial multidimensional health assessment to detect concomitant health problems and risks that may negatively influence older persons&#x02019; levels of PA. The intervention began with a tool of health risk assessment (HRA) that has been validated for measuring social, functional, somatic, psychological, and environmental factors in community-dwelling older persons [<xref rid="pone.0181371.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0181371.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. We based subsequent PA counselling on behavioural change techniques and arranged monthly counselling sessions over a period of six months that aimed at raising study participants&#x02019; PA awareness, and developing, implementing, and possibly modifying individual PA related goals while addressing potential PA barriers [<xref rid="pone.0181371.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0181371.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. We hypothesized that this intervention would substantially improve older persons&#x02019; PA levels. A secondary study question explored whether effects differ for different types of PA recommendations and between subgroups of older persons.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec007"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec008"><title>Study organisation</title><p>The Ethics Committee of the National Institute of Gerontology and Geriatrics &#x0201c;Ana Alan&#x0201d; approved the study (972/2014).

The RAHEO (Medical <underline>R</underline>isk <underline>A</underline>ssessment and <underline>H</underline>ealth <underline>E</underline>ducation in <underline>O</underline>lder People) trial is a randomised controlled trial on HRA and specialist geriatric counselling in older persons conducted in Bucharest, Romania. The ethics committee approved the study protocol January 28, 2014 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0181371.s004">S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0181371.s005">S2</xref> Text). Based on this protocol, the trial was registered on June 17, 2014. Due to a management error, the study was registered shortly after patient enrolment started (first patient enrolled May 12, 2014). According to the original study protocol submitted to the ethics committee and to trial registration, the trial was planned for an ambulatory and a hospital-based setting. However the study in the hospital setting was terminated in August 2014 because the required sample size was not reached within four months after the start of the study. The study in the ambulatory setting was carried out as planned with no deviations from the study protocol. The RAHEO trial was conducted by the geriatrics office of the Ambulatory Clinic of the National Institute of Gerontology and Geriatrics &#x0201c;Ana Aslan&#x0201d;, Bucharest, Romania. The overall trial was designed to address effects of HRA-based counselling in the following domains: physical activity, nutrition, psychosocial factors, and preventive care. This is the first published report of the RAHEO trial.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Participants and randomisation</title><p>Participants were recruited from patients referred to the &#x0201c;Ana Aslan&#x0201d; outpatient geriatric clinic by their general practitioners. From May 12 to July 7 2014, all patients aged 65 years and older were consecutively evaluated for eligibility by trained researchers at the study centre in Bucharest. Patients who met any of the following criteria were excluded: moderate to severe dementia (equivalent to a Mini-Mental State Examination score &#x0003c; 20) [<xref rid="pone.0181371.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], severe disability (need of human help in one or more basic activities of daily living) [<xref rid="pone.0181371.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], terminal illness, major surgery within the last three months, not living in catchment area (more than 2&#x02013;4 hours travel time), living in nursing home, not speaking the Romanian language, inability or unwillingness to complete the prerandomisation questionnaire, and not wishing to give written informed consent. Recruitment was continued until the required sample size of 200 study participants was reached.</p><p>The independent study centre in Bern, Switzerland randomly divided the consenting participants equally between intervention and control groups using a computer generated random allocation sequence. Persons allocated to the intervention group were invited to monthly counselling sessions over a six-month follow-up period at the geriatrics clinic, with the first session taking place four to eight working days after randomisation. Participants in the control group were invited to a follow-up consultation session six months after randomisation. Patients of both intervention and control groups continued to receive usual care by their primary care physicians.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Data collection</title><p>The Romanian and English versions of the questionnaires used in this trial are included in the study protocol (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0181371.s005">S2 Text</xref>). Baseline data were obtained prior to randomisation, and consisted of a brief face-to-face interview with the participant by a trained interviewer and the HRA for Older Persons questionnaire. In the interview trained researchers collected information on participant income (pension slip), body weight and height, blood pressure, and medication. The HRA for Older Persons questionnaire is a multidimensional self-administered questionnaire composed of validated questions identifying potential health and disability risk factors in relevant domains among older persons [<xref rid="pone.0181371.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Its development relied on an extensive literature review and focus group work, and it has shown high acceptance among older persons and primary care physicians in various European countries [<xref rid="pone.0181371.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. A Romanian version of the questionnaire was developed based on a scientific update, cultural adaptation, backward translation, and coordination with existing Romanian guidelines. Participants completed this questionnaire on site. The completed forms were scanned and sent to the independent study centre for double data entry.</p><p>Baseline information on PA was obtained from participants&#x02019; answers to a brief version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) that was part of the HRA for Older Persons questionnaire [<xref rid="pone.0181371.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The IPAQ enquires about frequency and time spent doing different types of PA lasting at least 10 minutes at one of three different levels of PA (vigorous activity such as jogging, cycling at high speed; moderately vigorous activity such as brisk walking, swimming, dancing, cycling at normal speed; and moderate activity with time spent walking at a normal pace). Each set of questions is introduced by a brief instruction while the types of physical activities are exemplified with pictures. In addition, the IPAQ asks about usual sitting time per day, and we added a question on the intention to increase one&#x02019;s level of PA based on the transtheoretical model of behaviour change [<xref rid="pone.0181371.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Appraisal was based on the participants&#x02019; own assessments and recollection of their activities during the previous week. Collection of six-month follow-up data took place between November 26, 2014 and February 3, 2015. Participants from intervention and control groups were invited for a final on-site visit at the study centre and were asked by research assistants who were blinded for participants&#x02019; treatment allocation status to complete a shortened version of the self-administered HRA for Older Persons questionnaire including the IPAQ.</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Outcome measures</title><p>The primary outcome was derived from analyses of the participants&#x02019; answers to the IPAQ questionnaires at six months according to the IPAQ scoring standards [<xref rid="pone.0181371.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], and defined as the metabolic equivalent of task (MET, multiples of the resting metabolic rate) minutes per week; one MET minute corresponds to 1 kilocalorie in an adult who weighs 60 kg. Secondary outcomes were (1) vigorous activity (measured as the proportion of persons who reported at least 10 minutes of vigorous activity at least once during the preceding week), (2) moderately vigorous or vigorous activity (similarly, measured as the proportion of persons who reported such an activity at least once during the preceding week), (3) walking (measured as number of minutes walking per week), and (4) physical inactivity (measured as hours sitting per day).</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Intervention</title><p>All sessions took place at the outpatient geriatric clinic in Bucharest and consisted of face-to-face health counselling meetings of the participant with an experienced geriatrician lasting 15 to 30 minutes. The health counsellor relied upon the individualized computer-generated health profile report derived from each participant&#x02019;s answers to the HRA for Older Persons questionnaire. This report covered PA and other health domains relevant for PA counselling (including pain, cardiovascular risk factors, nutrition, social network, and preventive care).</p><p>At the first counselling session, the geriatrician counsellor asked the participant about additional details of previous PA, his or her motivation to increase PA, and potential problems related to engaging in PA such as pain, fear of falls, unsafe neighbourhood for outdoor activity, and depressive symptoms. The counsellor addressed barriers to performing PA, and options such as pain management, referral for additional work-up, and social group activities to overcome them and explored options for increasing the current type of PA or starting new kinds of PA. Examples of PA were discussed, along with resistance training exercises [<xref rid="pone.0181371.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The counsellor explained benefits and risks of increasing PA with each participant, taking into account findings from the participant&#x02019;s health profile report, such as cardiovascular risk factors, pain, and emotional function. Finally, the counsellor and participant agreed upon an action plan with realistic, goal-oriented PA recommendations. The plan could include an increase in PA, or alternatively, maintenance of a high level of PA on a regular daily basis. Subsequently, the counsellor and the participant discussed the need for action in other domains such as nutrition and preventive care. At the end of the first counselling session, the participant was given the computer-generated individualised health profile report and a written summary with the individualised recommendations.</p><p>During the monthly follow-up sessions, participants were asked how successful they had been in reaching their goals for PA, and about reasons that may have prevented them from following their PA programmes. If a goal was achieved, the counsellor offered praise and reinforced motivation by adding new suggestions and diversifying the daily exercise schedule. If a goal was not achieved, the participant&#x02019;s knowledge and motivation were re-evaluated while difficulties in achieving recommended PA were identified. When new problems were identified, recommendations were adapted as needed. At the end of each follow-up session, participants received a brief written note with a summary of the updated recommendations as well as the date and time for the next appointment. To improve participants&#x02019; adherence to recommendations, counselling sessions took place in a calm, assuring, and friendly manner, and participants&#x02019; full attention was regularly confirmed during discussions to support self-management of recommended actions by participants. The final counselling session included additional reinforcement to sustain implementation of recommendations.</p><p>To facilitate comparisons of the findings of our study with those of others, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0181371.s001">S1 Table</xref> summarizes the study design based on the Behaviour Change Technique Taxonomy v1 [<xref rid="pone.0181371.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].

The median increase among participants in the intervention group was 180 MET minutes per week (95% CI 43.4 to 316.6; p = 0.01) and the median decrease in the control group 346.5 MET minutes per week (95% CI 178.4 to 514.6; p&#x0003c;0.001). The decrease in the control group is explained by a seasonal effect with important differences in weather conditions in Bucharest between baseline and follow-up (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec014">Discussion</xref> section for detailed meteorological data).</p><p>The analyses revealed that the difference in PA between intervention and control groups at follow-up mainly involved walking (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0181371.t004">Table 4</xref>).

This is equivalent to approximately 360 MET minutes per week, which is a major proportion of the observed intervention effect of 420 MET minutes per week. A remaining small part of the intervention effect was related to a difference in the proportion of persons engaging in moderately vigorous levels of PA between intervention and control groups. Finally, intervention group participants spent less time sitting compared to persons in the control group at follow-up. The sensitivity analyses that were conducted to assess possible selection bias (inverse probability of censoring weighting) revealed similar results for primary and secondary outcomes (for detailed results, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0181371.s003">S3 Table</xref>).</p><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0181371.t005">Table 5</xref> presents the prespecified subgroup analyses.

The exploratory subgroup analyses suggest that this effect is found for all subgroups, including persons with poor self-perceived health status, low income, and those who had no intention at baseline to increase their level of PA. The difference was mainly related to an increase in walking, and to a smaller extent to higher levels of moderately vigorous activities.</p><p>This study observed a seasonal effect with a substantial decline of PA among control group participants between baseline and follow-up. According to official meteorological data, the summer months May to July 2014 (the time period when baseline assessments took place) were mostly mild, with hot air temperatures &#x0003e;30&#x000b0;C on only 12 out of 90 days. In contrast, the winter months November 2014 to February 2015 (the follow-up period) were mostly cold and wet with snow and ice, and air temperatures at or below the freezing point on 75 of 120 days and precipitation on 53 of 90 days (meteorological information from National Administration of Meteorology, Meteo Romania, Bucharest, Romania (for details see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0181371.s007">S4 Text</xref>). Levels of PA change in regions with greater seasonal variation in temperature or precipitation [<xref rid="pone.0181371.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0181371.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], and outdoor walking, a highly weather sensitive activity, was the main type of participants&#x02019; PA. It is therefore remarkable that PA among persons in the intervention group significantly increased from baseline to follow-up despite this seasonal effect.</p><p>Given the high prevalence of health risks and problems in the elderly, the potential for PA counselling based upon HRA information is high. Yet many older persons report health-related barriers to increasing PA, and/or a lack of awareness that they might benefit from an increase in PA. To realize counselling&#x02019;s potential for increasing PA, counsellors need time sufficient to build mutual trust with the older participant and work out the specific pros and cons of PA with each one. That our study&#x02019;s effect on PA was stronger than those reported in both previous HRA-based studies [<xref rid="pone.0181371.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0181371.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and interventions designed to increase PA among older persons [<xref rid="pone.0181371.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] is most likely explained by its unique combination of an initial multidimensional assessment with strong theory-based and highly individualized counselling.</p><p>Among this study's limitations is a possible selection effect. Compared to international data, baseline levels of PA were relatively high in the study population: about 80% of participants exceeded the minimum recommended level of 450 MET minutes per week of PA at baseline. This may have arisen from the fact that patients referred for specialized geriatric care were in general well-educated and motivated for health promotion. Although this possible selection bias and the single-centre design limit generalisability of our findings, the study results were consistent across persons with varying socioeconomic backgrounds, health status, and initial motivation for behaviour change.</p><p>A further limitation may be located in participant self-reporting of PA with the IPAQ [<xref rid="pone.0181371.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0181371.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Direct outcome measurement with an accelerometer was not possible due to budgetary constraints. A recent systematic review of the measurement properties of self-report PA questionnaires found good to excellent reliability of the IPAQ but concluded that its validity requires further investigation [<xref rid="pone.0181371.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The review also showed that IPAQ validity partly depends on the version of the IPAQ, and may vary by IPAQ domain. For example, the IPAQ short form covering the &#x0201c;last 7 days&#x0201d; (i.e., the questionnaire version used in our study) has shown good agreement for the IPAQ walking component if compared with accelerometer data [<xref rid="pone.0181371.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], a relevant finding since walking was the main type of PA observed in our study. Most previous IPAQ validation studies have been conducted in samples of relatively young adults, and only few studies included healthy older persons. One such study suggested fair validity if used in older persons, with positive correlations (r = 0.28 to 0.47) between self-report and accelerometer data (sitting, walking, and both moderate and vigorous PA) [<xref rid="pone.0181371.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Most studies evaluated the IPAQ in the English language and translations may lead to inconsistent results. However, the Romanian version used in our study was based on a translation/ back-translation approach to avoid inconsistencies in translation. In summary, use of the self-report IPAQ results in some uncertainty about the validity of the absolute values of energy expenditure levels, but it is unlikely that self-reporting led to biased estimates of intervention effects in our study. A further limitation may involve follow-up which was not possible for all participants. The number of participants lost to follow-up was small, though, and sensitivity analyses suggest that this did not affect results. It seems unlikely that other problems impede the internal validity of the main study findings (e.g., leakage, maturation, testing bias). Finally, this study was designed to explore the effects of a short-term intervention and short-term effects on PA, and did not have a long-term perspective. From other intervention studies it is known that PA interventions have to be continued over the long-term to attain sustained effects [<xref rid="pone.0181371.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Yet this study's promising outcome suggests its short-term scope was less a limitation than a time frame appropriate for obtaining evidence to motivate in-depth investigation of this kind of PA intervention over the long term.</p><p>In spite of these limitations, we believe this study can inform clinical interventions to improve PA. The standardised HRA approach has been shown to be feasible in diverse health care settings in several European countries and the U.S at low cost [<xref rid="pone.0181371.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0181371.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Replication of this method of HRA and PA counselling should align with a setting's health care system by involving health professionals in the system who care for older adults, thereby also ensuring that the intervention is pursued for longer-term follow-up. For practice implementation, relying on senior clinicians for health counselling in the long run is probably not feasible due to cost and resource constraints. However, counselling can be organised in the general practice system with nurses or other health professionals as counsellors [<xref rid="pone.0181371.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Reinforcement via programmes implemented on mobile communication and data acquisition platforms may be added to further focus and increase the efficacy of PA counselling [<xref rid="pone.0181371.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0181371.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The finding that HRA with counselling has strong effects on PA in older persons is promising, given the fact that HRA has been shown to result in favourable long-term health benefits in nondisabled older persons [<xref rid="pone.0181371.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Future studies can refine the intervention methodology and test the reproducibility of findings in other settings.</p><p>We conclude that using HRA to inform individualized PA counselling is a promising method for achieving improvements in PA, and ultimately health and longevity among large groups of community-dwelling older persons.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec016"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0181371.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Description of key elements of the intervention, classified according to Michie et al.
