17.3 million people each year.<sup><xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> The
coronary artery diseases are the most chronic and life- threatening diseases.<sup><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> High blood pressure that is one of its main
side effects and risk factors is responsible for 13% of deaths and 7% of
inabilities.<sup><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> This disease would
cause the highest rate of death, recurrence of heart problems and infections after
treatments for coronary artery diseases including angioplasty.<sup><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Therefore, it is necessary to perform appropriate
interventions to control blood pressure, especially in patients undergoing angioplasty.</p><p>Based on Seven Joint National Committee Criteria (NJC7), the algorithm for treatment of
hypertension begins with lifestyle modifications and ends with medication diets.
Unfortunately, they didn&#x02019;t receive proper education about lifestyle modification.<sup><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup></p><p>Studies on lifestyle modifications have revealed that modifications such as weight loss,
taking Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, reducing salt consumption and
exercising would be effective in lowering blood pressure and reducing its
complications<sup><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> especially the rate of morbidity and mortality in hypertensive
patients undergoing angioplasty.<sup><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup></p><p>Different studies have been conducted on lifestyle modification programs and educational
interventions for patients with high blood pressure. Despite the effectiveness of
educational interventions on the lifestyle of patients with high blood pressure,<sup><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>-<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>
the results of one study showed that educational interventions had no significant effect on
weight, blood pressure level and physical activity in people at the risk of ischemic heart
diseases.<sup><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> In another study,
although health education improved the knowledge of patients with high blood pressure, it
had no significant effect on the level of their blood pressure.<sup><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Another study found no significant effect from educational
interventions on blood pressure<sup><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> and
another one found no significant relationship between weight changes and changes in
diastolic blood pressure.<sup><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup></p><p>Studies showed that ignorance and lack of knowledge and awareness are some of the barriers
to having a healthy lifestyle and not controlling and preventing high blood
pressure.<sup><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> It is assumed that increased knowledge about the role of
lifestyle in the occurrence of high blood pressure would cause people to start modifying
their lifestyles and enhance their preventive behaviors.<sup><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> The results of a study showed that when the score of
knowledge in high blood pressure patients increases by one, their score of practice would
increase by 0.12.<sup><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup></p><p>Anyway, studies have shown that improving knowledge and awareness could not be enough to
control the effects of diseases by itself. The results of the study showed that by
increasing the score of attitude toward high blood pressure, systolic and diastolic blood
pressures would decrease significantly.<sup><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Also, the lack of motivation to modify the lifestyle is another barrier
to control blood pressure,<sup><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> because
people do not feel any necessity to change their lifestyle<sup><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Some of the
reasons leading to lack of motivation are not taking treatment and controlling high blood
pressure seriously,<sup><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> alcohol
consumption,<sup><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> unemployment, using
smuggled drugs, drugs&#x02019; cost, health care, drugs&#x02019; side effects, and the complexity of diet
for controlling blood pressure.<sup><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup></p><p>However, just knowledge and attitude are not enough for lifestyle modifications. The
results of studies showed that from those samples that had a good knowledge and attitude
about exercise and healthy nutrition to prevent cardiovascular diseases, only 23.6% in the
field of exercise and 24.1% in the field of nutrition showed a good practice.<sup><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>
Results of the study showed that although educational lifestyle interventions improved the
knowledge of the participants of the experimental group, it made no significant difference
in the attitude and practice of the experimental group. </p><p>Also, most of the patients with high blood pressure assume themselves to be healthy until
they start to show complication. They tend to change their lifestyle when their disease is
advanced or they have started to experience serious complications such as coronary artery
diseases<sup><xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> and they feel the need to
change their lifestyle when they have to go through coronary angioplasty. </p><p>Some patients with hypertension have no symptoms even without medication, but they would
experience side effects after drug consumption.<sup><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> For these people, modification of lifestyle is useless; especially in
high blood pressure patients who feel better after angioplasty and their health condition is
improving, this matter is of greater importance, because when patients continue their
previous unhealthy lifestyle, they would provide the ground for recurrence of their disease,
so modification of attitude is necessary for changing their behaviors. Meanwhile, nurses, as
the greatest health profession group<sup><xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>
that have the closest communication with patients in health environments, compared to other
members of the health care team, have a more comprehensive understanding of these patients&#x02019;
educational needs and they are more able to follow them up, manage their blood
pressure<sup><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> and modify their lifestyle. </p><p>Considering the serious threat of this silent killer and the importance of healthy
lifestyle to control it,<sup><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> the relationship between people&#x02019;s knowledge, attitude and
practice with improvement of healthy behaviors,<sup><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> and also the incremental growth of the prevalence of this disease and
its complications and the low number of studies that have been conducted in Iran, we decided
to conduct this study. The present study was conducted to evaluate the effect of an
educational program to modify the lifestyle on knowledge, attitude and practice of
hypertensive patients undergoing angioplasty. </p></sec><sec sec-type="method" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ATERIALS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>This study was a randomized controlled clinical trial conducted from November to April 2014

table as many odd and even numbers and the number of participants was selected and then put
in a block. After the participants were selected based on the inclusion criteria and through
convenience sampling, then a numbered cart was opened for each one of them and dependent on
the number, whether it was odd or even, the participants were allocated to any of the two
groups of control and experimental. So, sample allocation continued until the sample size
reached the predetermined number. </p><p>For this study, data were collected by reviewing medical records and a questionnaire. In
addition, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, pulse rate, height and weight of both
groups were measured for matching. This questionnaire was made by researchers and completed
by the researcher&#x02019;s assistant (the researcher and patients were familiar with the course of
the study but the researcher&#x02019;s assistant was not). The questionnaire consisted of two parts.
The first part included information about disease and background variables (including age,
sex, height, weight, blood pressure, pulse rate, education, marital status, and job) and the
second part included questions to assess the knowledge, attitude and practice of the
samples. This questionnaire was designed using opinions of professors, articles and
texts.<sup><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup></p><p>To determine the content validity of the questionnaire, it was given to 10 academic members
of Nursing and Midwifery Faculty and Hypertension Research Center in Isfahan University of
Medical Sciences. Modifications were made on the basis of recommendations and suggestions of
the experts. After consulting with a statistician, the final questionnaire was modified. The
questionnaire was valid for hypertensive patients. Reliability of this questionnaire was
filled by 50 individuals who had the inclusion criteria and then based on the obtained
scores the correlation coefficient was calculated. The Chronbach&#x02019;s &#x003b1; for knowledge
assessment was 0.860, for attitude assessment it was 0.748 and for practice assessment it
was 0.771, which could confirm the questionnaire&#x02019;s validity. In addition, test-retest method
was used to determine the reliability of the questionnaire, so 20 patients with the
inclusion criteria filled the questionnaire twice with 2 week interval; also, Pearson
correlation coefficient for knowledge assessment was 0.822, for attitude assessment it was
0.812 and for practice assessment it was 0.782. </p><p>Each question in the questionnaire was scored separately and the total score was 100. So,
each participant could get a total score between 0 and 100. T he knowledge-assessment
questionnaire had 17 closed-answer 4-chioce questions; each correct answer was scored 1 and
incorrect answer 0. Thus, each participant could get a total score between 0 and 17 in the
knowledge dimension and for better understanding of the score it was calculated on the basis
of 100; therefore, each participant could have a score of 100/17. The attitude-assessment
questionnaire contained 21 questions that was scored based on 5-point Likert scale
(completely agreed, agreed, no idea, disagreed and completely disagreed). Each question was
scored from 0 to 4. So, each participant could get a total score between 0 and 84 in the
dimension of attitude. At the end, the total score out of 100 was calculated so each
participant&#x02019;s score could be 100/84. The practice-assessment questionnaire had 27 questions
that were also scored based on 5-point Likert scale (always, often, sometimes, rarely and
never) to evaluate the patients&#x02019; practice regarding their lifestyle. Each question was
scored from 0 to 4. Therefore, each participant could get a total score between 0 and 108 in
the practice dimension. Finally, the total score out of 100 was calculated for better
understanding of the score; hence, each participant could obtain a score of 100/108. </p><p>After sampling and taking written informed consent, the participants were assigned into two
groups of experimental and control. Then, they completed the demographic, disease
information and knowledge, attitude and practice questionnaire. Systolic and diastolic
pressures of both groups were measured using a mercury sphygmomanometer from the right hand
in sitting position, considering all the scientific principles. The participants&#x02019; height and
weight were measured using a meter and calibrated scale. </p><p>The experimental group was divided into two groups of 8 and two groups of 7 persons and
they were coordinated for group educational sessions. Also, to remind them, the researcher
contacted each participant on the phone the day before each session. Based on previous
study<sup><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> educational program was conducted in 6 sessions during 3 weeks, each

and practice of the experimental group right after the study and one month later was
significantly higher than that of the control group and it seems that the lifestyle

the mean score of knowledge, attitude and practice of the experimental group three months
after the study had a significant difference with that of the control group.<sup><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> But the results showed that although the
mean score of attitude and behavior of the experimental group three months after the study

significant improvement of knowledge in the experimental group is very valuable and
important, because having knowledge about healthy lifestyle is considered a prerequisite and
necessity for having the right attitude and appropriate practice.<sup><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> These changes could indicate the significant effect of
multilateral lifestyle interventions on improvement of the patients&#x02019; knowledge. </p><p>The results of the present study showed that the mean score of attitude of the experimental
group increased right after the study. In this regard, the results of the study that aimed
to evaluate the effect of health education on knowledge and attitude of patients with high
blood pressure about how to take care of themselves showed that the mean score of attitude
was significantly increased in patients.<sup><xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> The results of the study showed that by increasing the mean score of

their lifestyle and it has created a background for patients to change their practice. </p><p>In contrast to the above-mentioned results, the findings of a study showed that although
educational lifestyle modification improved the knowledge of the participants of the
experimental group, it caused no significant difference in their attitude.<sup><xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> Also, the results of another study showed

lifestyle modification program.</p><p>The results of the present study showed that the mean score of practice significantly
increased right after the study and one month later. Also, there was a significant
difference between the mean score of practice right after the study and one month later. In
this regard, the results of a study that aimed to determine the effect of education through
booklet and brochure on the blood pressure of hypertension patients showed that lifestyle
interventions through booklets would increase the mean score of knowledge, attitude and
practice in patients with high blood pressure.<sup><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Moreover, the result of another study on the effect of health education
interventions (group sessions held during 12 months) showed that the interventions improved
the knowledge, attitude and practice of patients with high blood pressure.<sup><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Also, the results of study showed that

during 3 and 6 months of follow up.<sup><xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup></p><p>Although the results of the present study were similar to those of previous studies, some
of the important features of the present study were participation and support of the
patients&#x02019; families, patient follow-up for one month, having the history of coronary
angioplasty and also using a multilateral lifestyle modification program to improve
knowledge, attitude and practice. </p><p>Unlike the results of the present study, the results of another study showed that although
educational interventions improved the knowledge and attitude of the participants of the
experimental group, it caused no significant difference in the practice of the experimental
group.<sup><xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> Also, another research
revealed that despite improvement in knowledge, attitude and practice of diabetic patients,
educational interventions had no significant effect on lifestyle and self-care. They
believed this program was not effective.<sup><xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> The results of the study showed that the change of the mean of practice
about consumption of fruits and vegetables after the study was not significant between the

Furthermore, the findings of a study showed that the participants&#x02019; practice about physical
activity right after the study, 3 months later and 9 months later showed no significant
difference between the control and experimental groups.<sup><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> In this regard, the results of an investigation in this
field showed that educational lifestyle intervention had no significant effect on the

a change in health behaviors, and practical application of knowledge and information
requires enhancement of awareness through appropriate educational programs and changing the
patients&#x02019; attitude and beliefs. Therefore, to make effective interventions, target groups
must be defined and appropriate behavior changing strategies must be applied.<sup><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup></p><p>The most important limitation of this study was the follow-up time, so it is recommended
