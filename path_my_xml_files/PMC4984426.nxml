Buprenorphine is a partial agonist at the &#x003bc;-opioid receptor and an antagonist at the &#x003ba; receptor; it is used for treating acute and chronic moderate to severe pain as well as opioid dependence [<xref rid="pnv110-B1" ref-type="bibr">1&#x02013;5</xref>]. It has properties that may provide an improved risk-benefit profile relative to other opioids [<xref rid="pnv110-B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pnv110-B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], including analgesic efficacy with no reported ceiling and an analgesic potency that has been reported to be 30 to 115 times greater than that of oral morphine sulfate [<xref rid="pnv110-B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pnv110-B7" ref-type="bibr">7&#x02013;10</xref>]. Buprenorphine has also been shown to possess a lower potential for adverse events (AEs) commonly associated with opioid use, such as constipation [<xref rid="pnv110-B11" ref-type="bibr">11&#x02013;13</xref>] and respiratory depression [<xref rid="pnv110-B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pnv110-B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pnv110-B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Buprenorphine is an agonist at the opioid receptor-like 1 receptor, the activation of which blocks analgesic tolerance and dampens the rewarding effects of opioids [<xref rid="pnv110-B3" ref-type="bibr">3&#x02013;5</xref>,<xref rid="pnv110-B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pnv110-B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], presumably lending to buprenorphine&#x02019;s lower potential for abuse and diversion.</p><p>A buprenorphine buccal film has been developed using BioErodible MucoAdhesive (BEMA&#x000ae;) delivery technology composed of flexible, water-soluble polymeric films that adhere to the moist buccal mucosa and erode [<xref rid="pnv110-B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Buccal buprenorphine (BBUP) doses up to 900 &#x003bc;g twice daily have demonstrated efficacy in controlling chronic low back pain in both opioid-naive and opioid-experienced patients, including those requiring up to 160&#x02009;mg morphine sulfate equivalent (MSE) per day, with low incidences of AEs typically associated with opioid administration [<xref rid="pnv110-B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pnv110-B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>Because buprenorphine has high affinity binding, slow receptor dissociation, and low intrinsic activity at the &#x003bc;-opioid receptor, administration of buprenorphine to patients with a significant proportion of &#x003bc;-opioid receptors occupied by a full &#x003bc;-agonist may result in displacement of the full agonist [<xref rid="pnv110-B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and induce opioid withdrawal. The present study was designed to determine whether opioid-experienced patients with chronic pain receiving 80 to 220&#x02009;mg oral MSE daily dose (the dose range commonly used in treating opioid-experienced patients with an around-the-clock [ATC] opioid) could be safely converted to buccal buprenorphine HCl without inducing opioid withdrawal or sacrificing analgesic efficacy.</p><p>Current recommendations for switching to the transdermal formulation of buprenorphine available for treating chronic pain call for tapering to the lowest possible dose of a full &#x003bc;-opioid agonist before switching to buprenorphine and titrating to effect [<xref rid="pnv110-B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. For patients on higher MSE doses, this approach may necessitate a long taper period that may be more difficult to achieve and may require more clinical oversight than converting to another full agonist at 50% MSE dose. Here we report the results of a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial demonstrating the feasibility of switching opioid-dependent patients with chronic pain directly to BBUP without a taper.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Participants</title><p>Male or female patients 18 to 60 years of age receiving ATC therapy with a full &#x003bc;-opioid agonist and confirmed to be opioid dependent by naloxone challenge were eligible for enrollment. In addition, patients were required to fulfill the following criteria at visits 1, 2, and 3: &#x02265;&#x02009;6-month history of chronic pain (including peripheral neuropathic pain) requiring &#x02265;&#x02009;80 but &#x02264;&#x02009;220&#x02009;mg MSE per day of either morphine sulfate or oxycodone HCl for &#x02265;&#x02009;28 days; displaying signs and symptoms of withdrawal (i.e., Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale [COWS] score &#x02265;&#x02009;5) within 5&#x02009;minutes following naloxone challenge; stable health, as determined by the principal investigator on the basis of medical history, physical examination, and screening laboratory results; and, if female, not pregnant on the basis of screening serum pregnancy test, and not lactating. Patients taking opioid medication other than morphine sulfate or oxycodone HCl were not enrolled in this trial. Reasons for exclusion were clinically significant pulmonary disease; supine systolic blood pressure &#x0003e;&#x02009;180 or &#x0003c;&#x02009;90&#x02009;mm Hg or&#x000a0;diastolic blood pressure &#x0003e;&#x02009;105 or &#x0003c;&#x02009;50&#x02009;mm Hg at screening; COWS score &#x0003e;&#x02009;4 before the screening naloxone challenge; aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase &#x0003e;&#x02009;3 times the upper limits of normal or serum creatinine &#x0003e;&#x02009;1.9&#x02009;mg/dL at screening; history of alcohol or substance abuse and/or positive urine drug screen or alcohol breath test at screening; or at significant risk for suicidal behavior based on the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). To be eligible, subjects could not have used monoamine oxidase inhibitors within 14 days of screening or during the study; any medication or nutraceutical or herbal product with cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 inhibition or induction properties within 30 days of screening; class IA antiarrhythmic medications or class III antiarrhythmic medications within 14 days of screening; or &#x003b1;2-agonist antihypertensives (e.g., clonidine), 5-HT3 antagonists (e.g., ondansetron), benzodiazepines, or other medications that were anticipated to confound detection of signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal.</p><p>This study was designed and monitored in accordance with good clinical practice as required by the major regulatory authorities and the Declaration of Helsinki. The study protocol and protocol amendment were reviewed and approved by Copernicus Institutional Review Board, Durham, NC. Written informed consent was obtained by the investigator at the screening visit before any assessments were performed.</p></sec><sec><title>Study Design</title><p>This was a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled, two-period crossover study. Patients entered a 7- to 14-day screening period, during which they continued to receive their full &#x003bc;-opioid agonist therapy ATC. At visit 1 (screening), patients signed the informed consent and were assessed for protocol eligibility, including the naloxone challenge.</p><p>Eligible patients returned to the clinic 7 to 14 days later and were admitted for two consecutive nights. Patients were randomized to one of two treatment sequences, AB or BA, where treatment A was two doses of BBUP and treatment B was two doses of active full &#x003bc;-opioid agonist. A conversion ratio of 100:1 for morphine to buprenorphine dose was used for this study. A subject&#x02019;s original MSE dose was reduced to 50%, and the subject was given either 300 or 450 &#x003bc;g of buprenorphine. <xref ref-type="table" rid="pnv110-T1">Table 1</xref> outlines the range of original MSE doses, examples of opioid study dose calculations, and BBUP study dose assignments.

BBUP 300-&#x003bc;g and 450-&#x003bc;g doses were selected because they represent relative equivalence to 50% of the patients&#x02019; MSE. Randomized patients were stratified into two groups based on their original ATC MSE. MSE Dose Group 1 was composed of patients requiring between 80 and 160&#x02009;mg MSE per day, and MSE Dose Group 2 was composed of patients requiring between 161 and 220&#x02009;mg MSE per day for &#x02265;&#x02009;28 days.

The most frequent AEs with full &#x003bc;-opioid agonist were headache (16%), drug withdrawal syndrome (13%), and nausea (6%).</p><p>No deaths occurred during the study; one patient in MSE Dose Group 1 experienced serious AEs of chest pain and dyspnea when treated with buprenorphine. No clinically meaningful trends were noted in laboratory test results, vital signs, physical examination findings, or C-SSRS.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Buprenorphine is a partial agonist at the &#x003bc;-opioid receptor agonist and an antagonist at the &#x003ba; receptor, with high affinity binding and slow dissociation from receptors, as well as low intrinsic activity at the &#x003bc;-opioid receptor [<xref rid="pnv110-B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. It is possible that administration of buprenorphine to patients with a high percentage of &#x003bc;-opioid receptors occupied by a full &#x003bc;-agonist could result in displacement of the full agonist [<xref rid="pnv110-B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and precipitate opioid withdrawal. Nevertheless, opioid rotation is an important strategy for pain management in patients who require chronic opioid therapy [<xref rid="pnv110-B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. This randomized, double-blind, active-controlled study was designed to evaluate the risk of withdrawal syndrome with doses of BBUP administered 8 to 12&#x02009;hours after the last dose of full &#x003bc;-opioid agonist. Some important aspects of the study design were inclusion of opioid-dependent patients requiring &#x02265;&#x02009;80&#x02009;mg MSE and documented withdrawal symptoms following a naloxone challenge. In addition, this was a crossover study design in which patients received two doses of BBUP at approximately 50% of their MSE dose and two doses of active full &#x003bc;-opioid agonist at 50% of their prescribed total daily dose, allowing for direct comparison of withdrawal effects from the two treatments in the same patients.</p><p>For the primary efficacy analysis, opioid withdrawal was defined as a maximum COWS total score that was at least 13 or the patient requiring rescue medication for withdrawal symptom management. Only two patients experienced withdrawal during one or both study treatments, both in the MSE Dose Group 1 stratum (80&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;160&#x02009;mg). The mean maximum COWS scores did not show any significant difference between full &#x003bc;-opioid agonist and BBUP (<italic>P</italic> = 0.79) Similarly, there was no change from baseline in mean pain NRS scores through 9&#x02009;hours postdose. The data did not suggest any difference in opioid withdrawal following BBUP and full &#x003bc;-opioid agonist administered at 50% of the therapeutic dose. Thus, patients can rotate from a full &#x003bc;-opioid agonist to BBUP in the 80- to 160-mg MSE dose range without any greater risk of precipitating withdrawal than would be expected when switching to another opioid. Administration of 300- or 450-&#x003bc;g doses of BBUP 8 to 12&#x02009;hours after the last dose of full &#x003bc;-opioid agonist was not associated with a higher incidence of serious AEs, AEs leading to discontinuation, or treatment-emergent AEs overall compared with the 50% dose of the prescribed full &#x003bc;-opioid agonist.</p><p>One limitation of this study is that the full &#x003bc;-opioid agonists used in this study and buprenorphine are different molecules with different receptor affinities; it cannot be stated unequivocally that the doses were comparable. As in all opioid conversions, the 50% MSE represents a best estimate. Second, all subjects were converted from morphine or oxycodone, so results may not be applicable to other opioids. In addition, the prespecified calculation of the odds ratio of buprenorphine to full &#x003bc;-opioid agonist could not be calculated because of the small number of patients who met the definition for opioid withdrawal. Furthermore, no conclusions can be drawn from the high-dose cohort because of the small sample size. Overall, the results suggest that switching patients to a 50% MSE dose of BBUP is comparable in safety and tolerability to reducing a patient to a 50% MSE dose of their current full &#x003bc;-opioid agonist therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Chronic pain patients treated with around-the-clock full &#x003bc;-opioid agonist therapy can be switched to buccal buprenorphine (a partial &#x003bc;-opioid agonist) at approximately 50% of the full agonist dose without an increased risk of opioid withdrawal or loss of pain control.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Funding for the research and editorial support was provided by Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc.</p><p>Funding sources: Funding for the research presented was provided by Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc.</p><p>Disclosure and conflicts of interest: Lynn Webster and Daniel Gruener have acted as clinical study investigators for Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc.
