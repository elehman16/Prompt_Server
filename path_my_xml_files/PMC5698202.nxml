If left untreated, acne can have a profound negative impact on patient quality of life (QoL) and psychosocial development.</p><p id="Par8">Combination therapies for acne, utilizing agents with different modes of action, facilitate the simultaneous targeting of multiple factors. A fixed-dose topical combination gel containing adapalene 0.1% and benzoyl peroxide (BPO) 2.5% (A/BPO) was developed for once-daily treatment of acne. The different mechanisms of action and favorable efficacy/safety profiles of adapalene and BPO make them logical choices for combination agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].

In a small pilot study, the use of medication event monitoring system (MEMS) caps to objectively assess adherence to topical BPO gel has shown that adherence decreased after dispensation, with 82% of subjects applying medication on day&#x000a0;1 and only 45% at week&#x000a0;6 (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. According to a large-scale worldwide observational study using a short and validated questionnaire (ECOB) to assess the risk of poor adherence of acne patients, it was estimated that poor adherence occurred in 40% of patients treated with topical acne therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].

It may be necessary to continue treatment for prolonged periods of time to ensure therapeutic success and prevent disease relapse. Despite the availability of efficacious and safe therapeutic options for topical treatment, poor adherence of patients to such therapies may lead to unnecessary treatments, increased healthcare costs, and reduced patient QoL. Dr&#x000e9;no et al. previously identified factors associated with poor adherence including the occurrence of side effects, lack of knowledge about acne and acne treatment, consultation with a primary care physician, and lack of patient satisfaction with treatment, among others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Snyder et al. stated that a physician&#x02019;s ability to convey information about the medication is critical for treatment success and patient satisfaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. For effective patient education and counselling on the treatment of chronic disease, various means of information such as reading materials, videos, and reminders may be utilized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Recent studies have shown that written counselling significantly improved adherence in acne patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Moreover, evidence from an observational study has shown that A/BPO gel leads to good treatment adherence for the majority of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p id="Par41">This multicenter, randomized, and controlled study assessed the effect of patient education on treatment adherence and satisfaction among acne patients receiving once-daily A/BPO gel treatment in primary care clinics in the UK versus SOCPE and more frequent clinic visits. Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> is an excerpt from the SEM video shown to subjects.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;5</label><caption><p>Excerpt from the supplementary educational material video</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13555_2017_203_Fig5_HTML" id="MO5"/></fig>
</p><p id="Par42">Overall, better adherence was observed in the A/BPO&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;SEM group compared with the A/BPO&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;more visits or A/BPO alone groups, as measured by MEMS. The similar adherence between the group with extra visits and the A/BPO alone group may be due to the timing of the additional visits. These visits took place on weeks&#x000a0;3 and 9, whereas treatment-related irritation is more likely to occur earlier, which may explain why the extra visits had little effect on adherence. According to the subject appreciation questionnaire, the SEM helped them adhere to treatment, better use the product, and manage their expectations and side effects. Subjects were also more satisfied in terms of safety in the A/BPO&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;SEM group. All physicians were satisfied with the SEM provided and the vast majority would consider using it in their practice.</p><p id="Par43">A/BPO was well tolerated in this study, with related AEs as expected from previous studies and post-marketing experience. All related AEs were mild to moderate in intensity and resolved quickly and spontaneously. Although the A/BPO&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;SEM group reported more premature discontinuation compared with the other groups (8, 6, and 1, respectively), only one of those was related to the study treatment. A possible explanation for the higher premature discontinuation reported in the A/BPO&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;SEM group is that more subjects in this group were &#x0201c;almost clear&#x0201d; at baseline and if they achieved a &#x0201c;clear&#x0201d; status at an early stage of the treatment they may not have wanted to continue treatment.</p><p id="Par44">A limitation of this study is that the MEMS used may not be a user-friendly system. The subjects had to open and close the cap on every application in order to record data on treatment adherence. This may potentially introduce more missing values during the data collection process.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par45">This educational material is easy to understand and use. Use of this material may increase adherence of patients treated with once-daily A/BPO gel for acne in primary care, consequently improving treatment and QoL in the long term. Physicians could consider using this material in their practice to enhance patient satisfaction and treatment outcome. Future studies are warranted to confirm that improved treatment adherence should translate into improved efficacy.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Enhanced content</bold></p><p>To view enhanced content for this article go to <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.medengine.com/Redeem/B1CCF06063563D18">http://www.medengine.com/Redeem/B1CCF06063563D18</ext-link>.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Sponsorship for this study and article processing charges were funded by Nestle Skin Health-Galderma R&#x00026;D.
