Persistent uncontrolled hyperglycaemia is the hallmark metabolic abnormality of type 2 diabetes and is attributable largely to ongoing deterioration of insulin-secreting pancreatic &#x003b2;-cell function, which is characterized by both insulin resistance and/or secretory failure <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>. There is now abundant scientific evidence supporting the notion that achievement of tight glycaemic control will substantially reduce hyperglycaemia-related morbidity <xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>. This would be relatively straightforward if sufficient insulin could be administered to reduce glucose levels to within the &#x02018;normal&#x02019; range, but this ignores the devastating effects of hypoglycaemia, the most feared adverse consequence of glucose-lowering therapy <xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>. A wide range of antidiabetic agents have been developed to help improve glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and, in Japan, insulin secretagogues, such as sulphonylureas, are commonly used, either as monotherapy or in combination regimens <xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>. Sulphonylureas stimulate insulin secretion by selectively targeting ATP-regulated K<sup>+</sup> channels in the plasma membrane of pancreatic &#x003b2; cells. This mechanism is independent of plasma glucose levels, however, and thus increases the risk of hypoglycaemia <xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>. This has led to a search for agents that can augment insulin secretion depending on the circulating glucose level, so as to minimize the chances of hypoglycaemia. In this regard, recent interest has centred on long-chain fatty acids which have been shown to amplify glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from pancreatic &#x003b2;-cells; this effect is mediated through activation of the G protein-coupled receptor 40 (GPR40), also known as free fatty acid receptor 1 <xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>. It has been suggested that selective GPR40 agonists may potentiate nutrient-induced insulin secretion and this will favour enhanced prandial secretion and reduce the risk of interprandial hypoglycaemia <xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>.</p><p>Fasiglifam, an orally bioavailable GPR40 agonist, has been shown to produce marked dose-dependent glucose-lowering effects and improvements in other indices of glycaemic control <xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>. In exploratory and dose-finding studies published to date in the USA/Central America and Japan, it has been well tolerated and did not increase the risk of hypoglycaemia <xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>. Indeed, in the US study it was associated with a significantly lower rate of hypoglycaemia than was glimepiride <xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>.</p><p>Based on the antihyperglycaemic effects and overall tolerability of fasiglifam reported in the pilot and dose-ranging studies, it was decided in the present phase III placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the glycaemic effects and safety of fasiglifam 25 and 50&#x02009;mg administered once daily for the longer duration of 24&#x02009;weeks in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled by diet/exercise. Concerns relating to liver safety, however, after a review of data obtained during the clinical trials&#x02019; programme, resulted in termination of the development of fasiglifam after the present trial was completed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>This was a phase III, multicentre (21 clinical institutions in Japan), randomized, double-blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled 24-week comparative study in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled by diet and exercise. After a 4-week screening period, a 24-week treatment period in which patients were randomly assigned to receive either placebo or fasiglifam (25 or 50&#x02009;mg) followed by a 1-week follow-up period was initiated. The study was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonisation Harmonized Tripartite Guideline for Good Clinical Practice. All participants provided written informed consent. Central or local institutional review boards approved the protocol at each study site.</p><p>Patients eligible for the study were aged &#x02265;20&#x02009;years and had type 2 diabetes mellitus with a glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) level of between 6.9 and 10.4% at the start of the screening period. All patients had received specific dietary and exercise therapy for at least 8&#x02009;weeks before the start of screening. Patients were excluded if they had been treated with any antidiabetic drug within 8&#x02009;weeks before the start of screening or during the screening period, or if they had systolic blood pressure of &#x02265;180&#x02009;mmHg or diastolic blood pressure of &#x02265;110&#x02009;mmHg. Additionally, patients with requirement for insulin, those with hepatic or renal impairment, and those with serious cardiovascular, pancreatic or haematological disorders, or with any malignancy were also excluded. Pregnant or lactating women and those of child-bearing age who were not using contraception were not eligible.</p><p>Each participant visited the institution at the start and completion of the screening period (weeks &#x02212;4 and 0) and on weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24 and 25. Provided they met the eligibility criteria during week 0, they were randomly allocated to receive double-blind therapy with fasiglifam 25 or 50&#x02009;mg, or placebo. All treatments were administered as identical tablets once daily before breakfast.</p><p>During the 4-week screening period, the following were recorded: demographics/patient characteristics, medical history, concomitant medications, physical examination details, body weight, vital signs, 12-lead ECG (repeated on weeks 12 and 24), clinical laboratory test results, pregnancy test (repeated on week 24), measures of glycaemic control [HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), fasting insulin, fasting C-peptide, fasting glucagon and fasting proinsulin levels], adiponectin, compliance with diet/exercise, and pretreatment-emergent adverse events. On weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24 and after an additional 1&#x02009;week&#x02019;s follow-up, the following measurements were performed: physical examination, body weight, vital signs, concomitant medications, clinical laboratory tests, compliance with diet/exercise, measures of glycaemic control, such as HbA1c, FPG, fasting insulin, fasting C-peptide, fasting glucagon and fasting proinsulin levels (but not at the follow-up visit), and treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). All assessments were performed at the end of the treatment period at week 24 or at the point of discontinuation for patients who prematurely withdrew from the study.</p><p>The study was registered under clinical trials number: JapicCTI-111604.</p><sec><title>Efficacy and Safety Outcome Measures</title><p>The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in HbA1c at week 24 [last observation carried forward (LOCF)].

Both fasiglifam groups were compared with placebo based on a stepwise testing procedure. Two-sided hypothesis testing was performed at a significance level of 5%. Other efficacy endpoints were summarized at each visit by treatment group using descriptive statistics or frequencies, and exploratory two-sided 95% CIs for differences between treatment groups were also calculated.</p><p>Safety assessments included all patients who received at least one dose of study medication.

The incidence of ALT &#x02265;5 times the ULN was similar among all treatment groups: fasiglifam 50&#x02009;mg, 0% (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;0); fasiglifam 25&#x02009;mg, 1.6% (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;1); and placebo, 1.5% (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;1). The ALT abnormalities were observed at different time periods in the fasiglifam groups: at week 4 in 1 participant, weeks 8&#x02013;12 in 3 participants, and weeks 16&#x02013;24 in 3 participants. Follow-up of the 7 fasiglifam-treated participants with ALT &#x0003e;3&#x000d7; ULN revealed that in 5 participants, levels returned to normal or back to baseline within 4&#x02009;weeks, either during continued treatment (3 participants) or after stopping study treatment (2 participants). In 2 participants, ALT increases occurred at week 24 and, in both these participants, ALT levels also decreased during the extended follow-up period. Five of 7 fasiglifam-treated participants had evidence of hepatic steatosis. The incidence of other abnormal liver tests [aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase or &#x003b3;-glutamyltransferase &#x02265;3&#x000d7; ULN or total bilirubin &#x02265;2&#x000d7; ULN] were similar among all treatment groups. Study treatment was discontinued in only 1 participant each in the placebo, fasiglifam 25&#x02009;mg and fasiglifam 50&#x02009;mg groups, respectively. The participant in the fasiglifam 25&#x02009;mg group experienced a serious TEAE of abnormal hepatic function (ALT 10&#x000d7; ULN and total bilirubin 3&#x000d7; ULN) which was accompanied by epigastric pain, and gallstones, biliary sludge and adenomyomatosis (confirmed by medical imaging). The participant in the fasiglifam 50&#x02009;mg group had a TEAE of increased ALT (approximately 4&#x000d7; ULN), and the participant in the placebo group had TEAEs of increased ALT and AST levels, approximately 6&#x000d7; ULN and 3&#x000d7; ULN, respectively. No other participants discontinued study treatment as a result of a hepatic adverse event.</p><p>No clinically meaningful differences were found among the treatment groups for vital signs or 12-lead ECGs.

Fasiglifam 25 and 50&#x02009;mg administered orally once daily for 24&#x02009;weeks produced clinically relevant and significant reductions in HbA1c and FPG versus placebo. The percentage of participants who achieved an HbA1c level of &#x0003c;6.9% was 30.2% in the fasiglifam 25&#x02009;mg group, 54.8% in the fasiglifam 50&#x02009;mg group and 13.8% in the placebo group, showing that more than half of participants achieved the glycaemic control target with the fasiglifam monotherapy. These results are consistent with previous 12-week dose-ranging studies performed in the USA/Central America and Japan in patients with type 2 diabetes <xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>. In a Japanese dose-ranging study <xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, LS mean change from baseline in HbA1c at week 12 was 0.09% with placebo, &#x02212;0.88% with fasiglifam 25&#x02009;mg and &#x02212;1.27% with fasiglifam .50 mg. While the reductions in HbA1c were slightly less in the present study, HbA1c levels at baseline were lower. Since the subgroup analysis showed that HbA1c tended to be reduced more in participants with higher HbA1c levels at baseline, the smaller reduction in HbA1c in the present study might be associated with the lower HbA1c baseline level.</p><p>Overall, the incidence of TEAEs in each group was similar for the fasiglifam and placebo groups with the majority of TEAEs being mild in severity. There was a slightly higher incidence of TEAEs in the fasiglifam 50&#x02009;mg group, but this was not considered clinically relevant and there was no difference between fasiglifam and placebo regarding the number of participants discontinuing treatment as a result of a TEAE. As noted earlier, hypoglycaemia is the most feared TEAE associated with type 2 diabetes and agents that can reduce glucose levels without causing episodes of hypoglycaemia would be advantageous. The novel mode of action of fasiglifam, via GPR40-stimulated glucose-dependent increases in insulin secretion <xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, has been proposed as a mechanism which would pose a low risk of causing hypoglycaemia <xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>. The US/Central American study reported an incidence rate of mild hypoglycaemia for fasiglifam 6.25&#x02013;200&#x02009;mg (2%) that was similar to that for placebo (3%), and these rates were significantly lower than the rate of 19% reported for glimepiride <xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>. Similarly, in a Japanese dose-ranging study the incidence of mild hypoglycaemia was 0.7% with fasiglifam compared with 4.1% for glimepiride, and no dose-dependent trends were observed <xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>. In the present study, which was twice the duration of the earlier studies, only one case of hypoglycaemia was recorded in a participant taking fasiglifam 50&#x02009;mg and this highlights the low potential for fasiglifam to provoke episodes of hypoglycaemia.</p><p>The incidence of ALT &#x02265;3 times the ULN was slightly higher in the fasiglifam groups than in the placebo group, while the incidence of ALT &#x02265;5 times the ULN was no different between fasiglifam and placebo. The majority of participants who experienced elevation of aminotransferases had confounding factors such as hepatic steatosis and/or cholelithiasis. In some cases, however, drug-induced liver injury cannot be excluded completely. The incidence rates of other abnormal liver tests or of discontinuation of study treatment as a result of a hepatic adverse event were similar among all treatment groups. One participant treated with fasiglifam 25&#x02009;mg developed a serious TEAE of abnormal hepatic function that was considered possibly drug-related by the investigator, but cholecystitis with gallstones and adenomyomatosis may have been a confounding factor in this participant. No participants treated with fasiglifam 50&#x02009;mg had a serious hepatic-related TEAE. The earlier phase II studies also showed that no dose-dependent trends relating to tolerability and safety, including liver tests, were observed with doses of fasiglifam up to 200&#x02009;mg once daily for 12&#x02009;weeks <xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>; however, in a recent review of data from fasiglifam global clinical trials by an independent panel of experts overseeing the clinical development programme, concerns about liver safety arose and the sponsor has voluntarily terminated the clinical development of fasiglifam <xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>. The mechanisms causing the hepatic changes have not been identified so far. In contrast to most idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injuries, which commonly develop within 3&#x02009;months after the initiation of a suspected drug, 3 out of 7 participants who experienced an ALT increase after the treatment with fasiglifam had a relatively long latency period in the present study, especially the 2 participants who experienced an ALT increase at the last visit during the treatment period. Although the meaning of this observation is currently unclear, further analysis using global phase III data may provide additional information for better understanding the fasiglifam drug-induced liver injury. Additional research is clearly essential to ascertain the mechanisms causing the hepatic changes and to assess whether they are potentially a class effect related to GPR40 agonism or findings specific to fasiglifam.</p><p>Whilst this phase III study was well designed in terms of controls to reduce bias and variation, the 24-week treatment period was short for a disease that will probably need life-long treatment. In addition, the number of participants treated was too small to be able to detect statistically significant differences in HbA1c between the various subgroups tested, or to detect less common TEAEs. These limitations may explain why we were not able to clearly identify any liver safety issues for fasiglifam in the present study.</p><p>In conclusion, fasiglifam is the first GPR40 agonist to undergo extensive clinical development. Fasiglifam 25 and 50&#x02009;mg produced significant improvements in glycaemic control (HbA1c and FPG) with a low risk of causing hypoglycaemia in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled by diet and exercise.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>K.
