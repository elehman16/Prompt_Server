Prevalence of this disease decreases as the gestational age increases. In most cases, diagnosis occurs based on the findings from clinical and radiographic trials. Classic clinical demonstrations of the disease include grunting, intercostal and subcostal retractions, nasal flaring, cyanosis, and increase in the need for oxygenation. These symptoms occur shortly after birth. None of the interventions done to manage newborn RDS in the last 20 years has influenced this disease more than surfactant administration. Surfactant administration is undeniably followed by an increase in lung volume, functional residual capacity (FRC) stability, improved ventilation to perfusion ratio, improved oxygenation, and less air leak prevalence.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>At the moment nCPAP and surfactant administration are considered to be the basis and the first level of intervention for newborns affiliated with RDS. However, for surfactant administration we need to intubate the newborn and place an ET-tube.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Undoubtedly, laryngoscope ET-tube placement is one of the most common methods used in the NICU.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Considering the pain and the stress imposed on the newborn by ET-tube placement, and also the point that laryngoscope usage may cause dangerous side effects, such as, severe trauma caused by hypopharyngeal or tracheal perforation, psudodiverticulum, bleeding, mucosa necrosis, vocal cord trauma, laryngeal edema or arytenoid cartilage dislocation, which are intensified if the newborn is awake, alternative solutions are more preferred.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>Excessive physical stimulation in the larynx, such as using a laryngoscope, is accompanied with pain and stress in the newborn (after 24 weeks of gestation the newborn feels pain). On the other hand, in newborns less than six month the experience of pain is more severe due to the absence of the pain-reduction nervous pathway.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>Hemodynamic effects caused by the pain during intubation increase the average blood pressure by 33 mmHg and the heart beat rate to 30 beats more than the basic rate. These effects are caused by the release of catecholamine and cortisol, which also induce changes in the Cerebral Blood Flow Velocity (CBFV). These physio-hormonal changes may also cause a sudden decrease of blood pressure and heart beat rate, even as they are accompanied by vagus nerve stimulation during the intubation. We should note that for a newborn that is awake, who can challenge intubation by resistance, these cardiovascular instabilities increase. Nevertheless, these abrupt changes in the heart rate, newborn's blood pressure, and increase in the need for oxygenation (due to the sudden decrease of the functional residual caused by vocal cord impairment) may bring about hypoxic-asphyxia, intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), and intracranial hemorrhage (ICH).[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] During ET-tube placement, the pressure increase in the anterior fontanel causing Intracranial Pressure (ICP) is observed.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>In fact, in order to avoid intubation in the process of surfactant administration in the INSURE method, the development of other methods of surfactant administration such as intra-amniotic surfactant administration for women in danger of pre-term newborn birth, nasopharyngeal surfactant administration for newborns at birth, before the birth of the shoulders, administering surfactant using nebulizers, surfactant administration through a catheter into the trachea in spontaneous breathing or administration by laryngeal mask airway (LMA) is highlighted more.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>The laryngeal mask airway provides not only the capability of ventilation, but also a reservoir for gradual administration of the drugs, which can be absorbed through the lungs, by providing a space between the larynx and the mask, which is completely leak-proof through the cuff.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>I-gel, is modeled after LMA, with the exception of not having a system to distend the cuff pneumatically, due to the use of a silicon gel combination in its structure, which has the capability of distention and seal with heat (body temperature). This design made the application of i-gel easier and avoided the problem of leakage due to less than desired distention and the excessive distention of the cuff, which could cause compression and ischemia in the tissues and damage in the larynx.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>Considering the point that i-gel is categorized as a supraglottic airway device among the respiratory management devices, it meanwhile can direct liquids to the trachea. Therefore, we decided to study the method of directing the surfactant to the lungs in newborns affiliated with RDS through i-gel (i-gel surfactant administration/i-gelSA) compared to the standard care INSURE method, in a clinical trial.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This study is an RCT done on newborns weighing 2000 g or more, affiliated with RDS, in the neonatal care units of the Shahid Beheshti and Al-Zahra Hospitals, relevant to the Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, from September 2012 to April 2013, after acquiring the Ethics Committee approval (number 391345).</p><p>Newborns with RDS symptoms (tachypnea, intercostal retraction, nasal flaring, and grunting) at birth or within 48 hours of birth, who were treated with Bubble CPAP with CDP equal to 5 cm H<sub>2</sub>O and still required FiO<sub>2</sub> &#x02265;0.3 under a CDP &#x02265;5 cm H<sub>2</sub>O for more than 30 minutes, to maintain SpO<sub>2</sub> in the range of 89 - 95% in the right hand, were included in the study.

For those born from the vagina, once the newborn's head appeared in the perinea the obstetrician, avoiding the birth of the shoulders, would provide the needed time for the neonatologist to administer 3 to 4.5 ml of surfactant (Infasurf) through a catheter in the posterior of the pharynx. For the newborns who were born via the Cesarean section, this process would start once the head of the newborn became visible in the cut area, and at the time that birth was allowed to be completed, CPAP with a pressure of 10 cm H<sub>2</sub>O was administered with a mask. Thirteen out of 15 vaginal-born newborns and three out of eight Cesarean born newborns needed no more respiratory support; however, other newborns were treated by nCPAP.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</p><p>In a study done in 2000, by Berggren E <italic>et al</italic>., 32 newborns affiliated with RDS, with gestational ages 27 to 34 weeks in both groups, with each group including 16 newborns, were treated with CPAP and CPAP with surfactant administration by nebulizer. This study could not achieve significant meaningful differences regarding the prevalence of invasive mechanical ventilation, patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), intra-ventricular hemorrhage (IVH), air leak or chronic lung disease (CLD) in both groups.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</p><p>For surfactant administration using the Aerosolized technique, a study was done by Finer NN et. al. in 2006 in which 17 newborns with gestational ages between 29 and 32 weeks were treated by CPAP and nebulizer surfactant, due to demonstration of RDS symptoms. In the mentioned study, the administration was based on the Aerosurf and Lucinactant systems. No mortality was reported for the newborns and the air leak syndrome and necrotizing enterocolitis were never reported. Thirteen newborns needed no more supplemental oxygen after 28 days and just four newborns showed the criterion of CLD.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</p><p>In a study done by Zhang JP in 2004, which aimed to study the intra-amniotic surfactant administration to prevent RDS syndromes, 15 out of 45 mothers exposed to pre-term delivery were treated with intra-amniotic surfactant and 30 cases of birth were considered as the control. RDS prevalence was statistically and meaningfully higher in the control group.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</p><p>In the case of surfactant administration through a catheter placed in the trachea, a study was done in 2007, by Kribs A <italic>et al</italic>., who supported 29 newborns in the Koln University Pediatric Hospital, aged between 23 and 27 gestational weeks, with nCPAP by the Infant Flow Driver (IFD) (EME, Brighton, UK), for a period of 13 months. If the newborns needed FiO<sub>2</sub> &#x02265;40% to maintain SpO<sub>2</sub> in the range of 85 to 93%, they were treated with surfactant through a catheter in the trachea. To do this intervention, first 0.0025 mg/kg Atropin was administered IV and then they placed the head of the newborn in a intubation-like position, while a 4 F feeding tube with just a hole at the end was attached to a syringe containing 100 mg/kg Survanta, indicated at 1.5 cm from the end, and this was placed in the trachea using a Magill forceps through the laryngoscope in a way that the indicator was situated exactly at the vocal cords. Then the catheter was stabilized with the right hand fingers and the laryngoscope was extracted. Finally the surfactant was administered gradually, in one to three minutes These newborns were then statistically compared with the 34 newborns (control group) with a gestational age of 25 weeks, who were managed with the same care system, but the surfactant administration system was of the INSURE type, according to Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), pulmonary interstitial emphysema (PIE), CLD, periventricular leukomalacia (PVL), IVH, and retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). The Prevalence of IVH (Grade III and V) and PIE showed a meaningful increase in the control group.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>In a case report in 2004, by Brimacombe J <italic>et al</italic>., newborns weighing 1360 g and 3200 g, diagnosed as affiliated with RDS, were treated with surfactant administration through LMA while spontaneously breathing, and he reported that there were minimal fluctuations in cardiovascular and respiratory criteria in this treatment rather than INSURE, and concluded that this intervention can have less side-effects such as intracranial hemorrhage.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</p><p>In a study by Trevisanuto D <italic>et al</italic>., eight preterm newborns, with an average gestational age of 31 weeks, affiliated with RDS, were treated with surfactant through LMA. In this study, Trevisanuto D reported a significant difference, with an increase in the a/APO<sub>2</sub>, three hours after administration of the surfactant, rather than before the administration, in the newborns studied.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</p><p>Studies with a contrastive approach, done in the field of surfactant administration methods are limited; however, with this limited number of researches, both this study and the one by Brimacombe J show that surfactant administration through LMA is followed by minimal fluctuations in the cardiovascular criteria. Moreover, the increase in a/APO<sub>2</sub> after surfactant administration through LMA, in this study and the one by Trevisanuto, is significant. On the other hand, even in this limited study, the prevalence of side effects compared between the two systems show the safety of this intervention, which can be challenged in further studies. Overall, considering the high efficacy of surfactant administration (which is shown in the changes of a/APO<sub>2</sub> before and after the administration of the surfactant in the i-gel device), further studies to promote the standard care for the administration of the surfactant seems logical.</p><p>This research is only funded by the Isfahan University Vice-Chancellery for Research, and
