<italic>Ganoderma lucidum</italic> (Leyss. ex Fr.) Karst., also called Ling Zhi in China and Reishi in Japan, is an oriental mushroom that has been used for thousands of years in East Asia to improve health and longevity [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Ling Zhi has also been used to prevent and treat various human diseases including bronchitis, allergies, hepatitis, hypertension, and immunological disorders as well as cancer [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Oral administration of Ling Zhi extract for 12 weeks has been demonstrated to significantly enhance the immune response in patients with advanced-stage cancers [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Additionally, one recent study has found that oral administration of Ling Zhi preparation for 12 weeks seems more capable of stabilizing tumor size compared with a placebo in patients with recurrent gynecologic cancers [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Many bioactive components such as polysaccharides and triterpenoids are thought to be associated with the anticancer activities of Ling Zhi [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Ganoderic acid A, a highly oxygenated C30 lanostane-type triterpenoid, exhibits significant anticancer activities through inhibition of cancer cell proliferation and metastasis [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The inhibition of cancer cell proliferation of ganoderic acid A is believed to be mediated via the downregulation of Cdk4 expression, while its antimetastatic effects appear to be mediated through the inhibition of AP-1/NF-<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B-dependent secretion of urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Ganoderic acid A has also been shown to suppress the JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway leading to an enhancement of chemosensitivity to cisplatin in human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Its inhibitory effect on farnesyl protein transferase (FPT), an enzyme that catalyzes the posttranslational farnesylation of the cysteine residue located in the Ras oncoprotein, appears to involve an inhibition of Ras-dependent cell transformation [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) is an essential micronutrient required for normal metabolic functioning of the human body [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. It is also an effective water soluble, chain-breaking antioxidant. Recent evidence indicates that an increased intake of ascorbic acid is associated with a reduced risk of chronic diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases, cataracts, and neurodegenerative conditions [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In addition to its antioxidant capacity [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], ascorbate is a specific cofactor for a large family of enzymes known as the Fe- and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases (2-OGDD) which catalyze the hydroxylation of various substrates. As well as being a well-known cofactor for prolyl hydroxylase, which is essential for the biosynthesis of collagen [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], recent evidence indicates that promotion of the regulatory hydroxylases by higher tumor ascorbate levels can downregulate hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), a transcription factor necessary for maintaining oxygen and energy homeostasis in solid tumors under conditions of cell stress, hence decreasing tumor viability [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Epigenetic control in cancer cells mediated via demethylases (which belong to the 2-OGDD family) appears to be affected by higher tumor ascorbate levels [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Additionally, high intracellular concentrations of ascorbic acid can act as a prooxidant agent by generating hydrogen peroxide and hence damage the cell membranes of cancer cells. It has also been suggested that the selective toxicity of ascorbic acid in cancer cells is possibly due to reduced levels of catalase, the enzyme that catalyzes the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Notably, there is a 10- to 100-fold lower level of catalase in tumor cells than in normal cells [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In addition, ascorbic acid exhibits other anticancer effects, possibly by the suppression of angiogenesis, by increasing immunocompetence or by acting as a mitochondrial energy intermediate [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. High-dose ascorbic acid (10&#x02009;g/day by continuous intravenous infusion for periods up to ten days and then 2,500&#x02009;mg/dose orally administered four times a day as a long-term treatment) appears to increase survival, improve well-being, and reduce pain in cancer patients [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Additionally, recent evidence has shown that intravenous ascorbic acid can improve quality of life and decrease multiple aspects of fatigue in cancer patients [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>A previous pharmacokinetic study has demonstrated that the pharmacokinetic profile of ganoderic acid A following a single oral dose of 3,000&#x02009;mg of the Muang Ngai 2-strain of Ling Zhi (MG2FB-WE) is characterized by relatively low oral bioavailability and rapid elimination [<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Although a simple method to enhance the extent of absorbable ganoderic acid A is to increase the ingested Ling Zhi dose, that approach appears to be inappropriate as a relatively high dose of MG2FB-WE has been already administered in this setting. An alternative approach would be to identify agents that would result in an increase in the oral bioavailability of ganoderic acid A when coadministered with Ling Zhi preparations. Among several candidates, ascorbic acid is an agent of interest because several lines of evidence indicate that it may have the potential to enhance the oral bioavailability of several coadministered drugs [<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. For example, ascorbic acid enhances the bioavailability of levodopa (a weakly acidic drug with a pKa of 2.3) in elderly patients with Parkinson's disease [<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], possibly by increasing the acidity of gastric fluid and intestinal juice, thus enabling more unionized levodopa (a readily absorbable form) to exist in the gastrointestinal tract. Another example is that ascorbic acid enhances reabsorption of furosemide (a weakly acidic drug with a pKa of 3.8) from the renal tubules back into systemic circulation in dogs, presumably through its ability to acidify urine, thus facilitating more of the unionized fraction existing in the tubular lumen to be reabsorbed [<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p>Since ganoderic acid A and ascorbic acid exhibit their anticancer activity via the different pathways as mentioned above, coadministration of Ling Zhi preparation with ascorbic acid might show promise as a potential chemotherapeutic intervention in cancer through a synergistic pharmacodynamic effect. Details of the pharmacokinetic interaction between these two interventions are, however, not yet known. The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of ascorbic acid on the pharmacokinetics of ganoderic acid A following oral administration of water extract from the fruiting bodies of Ling Zhi in healthy Thai male subjects. In the present study, we hypothesized that ascorbic acid would increase the bioavailability of ganoderic acid A, a weakly acidic substance with a pKa of 4.35, after oral coadministration of Ling Zhi preparation.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2.

The health of all subjects was assured through a review of their medical history as well as a prestudy physical examination and a laboratory investigation which included a complete blood count, a liver function test, a blood urea nitrogen test, and a creatinine test. All subjects were fully informed about the nature of the study and all signed a written statement regarding their volunteer status prior to the start of the study. Exclusion criteria included hypersensitivity to Ling Zhi or ascorbic acid, chronic renal, liver, neurological, pulmonary, or cardiovascular diseases including malignancy, a personal history of kidney stones, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, bleeding disorders, and a family history of iron overload or hemochromatosis. Other exclusion criteria were abuse of alcohol or other substances, cigarette smoking within three months of the study, the use of any Ling Zhi preparations, ascorbic acid, or other medications (with the exception of occasional use of acetaminophen) within one month of the study. Withdrawal criteria for subjects in this study included experiencing adverse effects during the study, an inability to comply with the study protocol, a requirement for other medications during the study period, and voluntary withdrawal from the study.

Discussion</title><p>This randomized, two-phase crossover study found that oral coadministration of ascorbic acid with MG2FB-WE Ling Zhi preparation in healthy male subjects did not significantly alter the pharmacokinetic parameters of ganoderic acid A, an important biologically active triterpenoid compound with well-known anticancer activities found in Ling Zhi. A crossover design was considered an appropriate choice because each crossover patient served as his own control; therefore, intersubject variability between the two treatment phases could be minimized. The study was conducted under fasted conditions because a previous study by the authors had demonstrated that intake of food significantly reduces <italic>C</italic>
<sub>max</sub> and delays <italic>T</italic>
<sub>max</sub> of ganoderic acid A, although it does not affect the extent of its absorption [<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>The dose of 3,000&#x02009;mg of MG2FB-WE Ling Zhi preparation was chosen for evaluating herb-drug interaction in the present study because a previous randomized double-blind study found that oral administration of 3,000&#x02009;mg/dose of MG2FB-WE twice daily for 12 weeks seems more capable of stabilizing tumor size compared with a placebo in patients with gynecologic cancers after failure of at least two regimens of conventional chemotherapy [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The dose of ascorbic acid investigated in this study was chosen based on previously reported data which suggested that a continuous oral administration of 2,500&#x02009;mg/dose four times a day may have a palliative effect in the treatment of terminal human cancer [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>The present pharmacokinetic study, performed under fasted conditions, found that ganoderic acid A had a rapid <italic>T</italic>
<sub>max</sub> of 0.54 &#x000b1; 0.10 hours and a short elimination <italic>t</italic>
<sub>1/2</sub> of 0.66 &#x000b1; 0.33 hours. These pharmacokinetic parameters are in accordance with the values of 0.54 &#x000b1; 0.18 hours and 0.62 &#x000b1; 0.17 hours, respectively, reported in our previous study [<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].

<sub>1/2</sub> of ganoderic acid A. That finding could be interpreted as meaning simply that ascorbic acid does not cause significant changes in the rate and extent of ganoderic acid A absorption or in the elimination rate of ganoderic acid A. This finding contradicts our hypothesis that ascorbic acid would increase the bioavailability of ganoderic acid A, a weakly acidic substance with a pKa of 4.35, after oral coadministration of Ling Zhi preparation. This discrepancy might be due to the basal pH of gastric juice in our subjects under fasted conditions being already low enough to enable nearly the maximum potential concentration of unionized ganoderic acid A (an absorbable form) to exist in the gastrointestinal tract; therefore, coadministration of ascorbic acid under these conditions might not provide further reduction in gastric pH and thus not affect the rate or extent of ganoderic acid A absorption.</p><p>It can be assumed that although ascorbic acid did not enhance the oral bioavailability of ganoderic acid A, the acceptable safety profiles from long-term treatment of either Ling Zhi preparation or high-dose ascorbic acid [<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] and the possibility that this combination might provide a synergistic pharmacodynamic effect in cancer treatment suggest that this combination is a potential option for cancer patients, especially in the final stages of terminal cancer; however, this option should be carefully considered and recommended to patients at the physician's discretion. Nevertheless, the potential synergy from a combination of Ling Zhi preparations and ascorbic acid in cancer patients warrants further intensive clinical investigations.</p><p>Some major limitations in the present study should be addressed. First, this study aimed to investigate the effects of a single dose of ascorbic acid orally coadministered with Ling Zhi preparation; the coadministration of both medications in multiple dosing regimens (repetitive dosing) and determination of their pharmacokinetic interaction at steady state should be further investigated. Second, the current study focused on the influence of oral coadministration of ascorbic acid with Ling Zhi preparation on the pharmacokinetics of ganoderic acid A but did not investigate possible impacts on other biologically active compounds in the Ling Zhi preparation; in addition, it did not answer the question of whether Ling Zhi preparation affects the pharmacokinetics of ascorbic acid. Third, the antioxidant capacity of ascorbic acid, as well as its effects on hypoxia-inducible factor regulation and epigenetic control, should be further investigated, especially following the long-term coadministration with Ling Zhi preparation in cancer patients. Fourth, although blood samples used to determine plasma ganoderic acid A concentrations were serially collected until eight hours after dosing in order to obtain adequate detectable values during the elimination phase, in practice plasma concentrations in all subjects were quantifiable for a maximum of two hours after dosing because the sensitivity of LC-MS used for detecting plasma ganoderic acid A concentration in this study was limited to an LLOQ of 0.50&#x02009;ng/mL. A more sensitive quantitative bioanalysis should be considered in further studies; however, a recent study demonstrated that detection of plasma ganoderic acid A concentrations using LC-MS-MS provides a sensitivity (LLOQ) that is not greater than that of LC-MS [<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Finally, although the 12 subjects enrolled in this study appear to be a rather small sample, post hoc analysis based on the data from the present study demonstrates a power of test (1-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>) of 87% (based on an estimated minimum detectable difference in means of <italic>AUC</italic>
<sub>0&#x02013;<italic>t</italic></sub> between the treatment phases of approximately 25%), indicating acceptable statistical power.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>5.
