Introduction</title><p>Diabetic macular edema (DME) is a major cause of central visual loss in diabetic patients [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].

However, Kim et al. [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] suggested that 22% of diabetic patients develop increases &#x0003e;30% in central retinal thickness measured by optical coherence tomography (OCT) after uncomplicated phacoemulsification. </p><p>Many studies proposed the used of intravitreal bevacizumab or intravitreal steroids after phacoemulsification in patients with DME to prevent the increase in retinal thickening and to improve the DME and final visual acuity [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we injected Ranibizumab, effective in the treatment of wet macular degeneration and macular edema [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], immediately after phacoemulsification in diabetic patients with some degree of diabetic retinopathy without macular involvement and studied the macular thickness and morphology by OCT 1 and 3 months after surgery.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2. Material and Methods</title><p>This prospective, randomized, and controlled intervention study included a total of 54 eyes in 54 patients with cataract and some degree of diabetic retinopathy. All patients were enrolled from December 2009 to September 2010 and were followed up for 3 months. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committees of the centre. In addition, this study has been performed in accordance with the ethical standards laid down in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki for research involving human subjects.</p><p>Patients were given an information sheet with the study details, and signed specific informed consent forms for inclusion in the study, cataract surgery and intravitreal injection respectively. </p><p>Inclusion criteria were aged over 18 years and able to make decisions, reduced visual acuity secondary to lens sclerosis and some degree of diabetic retinopathy without macular involvement. Exclusion criteria were previous DME treated or not, any kind of complication during the surgery, other ocular pathology with macular involvement uncontrolled hypertension, recent myocardial infarction, and cerebral vascular accident.</p><p>Patients undergoing standard cataract surgery (phacoemulsification with the Infiniti Vision System and monofocal intraocular lens (IOL) implantation) were consecutively assigned in a 1&#x02009;:&#x02009;1 ratio to receive an intravitreal injection of ranibizumab (0.5&#x02009;mL of solution at 10&#x02009;mg/mL) at the end of surgery or not (control group). All surgeries and intravitreal injections were performed by the same surgeon at the Department of Ophthalmology, University Hospital La Fe in Valencia. Postoperative treatment was identical for all the patients and consisted of the topical administration of tobramycin-dexamethasone eye drops four times a day for one month.</p><sec sec-type="subsection" id="sec2.1"><title>2.1. Clinical Examination</title><p>A complete ophthalmologic examination was performed before, 1 and 3 months after cataract surgery by the same observer in all cases. The examination included slit lamp examination of the anterior and posterior segment, visual acuity with and without correction, goldmann tonometry, and measurement of the central foveal thickness by OCT retinal examination. Briefly, all eyes underwent macular cube (512 &#x000d7; 128) scans with the Cirrus HD-OCT system (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, Calif, USA). The central subfield thickness was calculated from the mean of three consecutive measurements. The data obtained in the control and Ranibizumab groups before, 1 and 3 months after surgery, were expressed as the mean&#x02009;&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;&#x02009;S.D., and compared using the <italic>z</italic>-test.</p><p>The main outcome measured was the presence of clinically significant macular edema (CSME) defined as macular edema involving or threatening the centre of the macula as defined by the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>3. Results</title><p>A total of 54 eyes of 54 consecutive patients with no DME measured by OCT were enrolled in the study in a ratio 1&#x02009;:&#x02009;1, 27 eyes in each group. All patients completed the study at 1 and 3 months after surgery. Thirty-five women and 19 men were included, being equivalent the proportion of patients of either sex included in both groups. The mean patient age was also similar in the control and Ranibizumab groups (68.9&#x02009;&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;&#x02009;4.7 years versus 72.8&#x02009;&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;&#x02009;5.2 years, resp.). All the patients had a mild to moderate nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy without any differences between control and Ranibizumab groups. The clinical characteristics of patients with diabetes are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>.</p><sec sec-type="subsection" id="sec3.1"><title>3.1.

Discussion</title><p>This study is, to our knowledge, the first one to report the effectiveness of Ranibizumab in the prevention of CSME after phacoemulsification in patients with mild to moderate diabetic retinopathy.</p><p>It has been reported that the VEGF, induced by ocular hypoxia, is an important factor in the development of abnormal angiogenesis and macular edema [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Ranibizumab, a recombinant, humanized, monoclonal antibody Fab that neutralizes all active forms of VEGF-A, has recently demonstrated its effectiveness for the treatment of diabetic macular edema [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Previously, some reports confirmed the usefulness of Bevacizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that inhibits all isoforms of VEGF, in the prevention of macular thickening after phacoemulsification [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Bevacizumab is a molecule designed to treat the colon cancer, and Ranibizumab has been specially designed to treat ocular pathology, so the use of Bevacizumab in ocular pathology can be controversial. The success with Bevacizumab in previous studies together with this off-label use of the drug in ophthalmology prompted us to investigate whether the prophylactic use of Ranibizumab in diabetic patients could prevent the development of CSME.</p><p>In our results, 25.92% of the eyes in the control group develop a macular thickening which results in a CSME at 1 and 3 months postoperatively. These results are slightly higher to that found by Kim et al. [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], who concluded that 22% of diabetic patients developed increases of the center point thickness of &#x0003e;30% 4 weeks after uncomplicated phacoemulsification. The main difference between both studies is that only patients with mild to moderate diabetic retinopathy were included in our study, and Kim et al. also included patients with none diabetic retinopathy. </p><p>The mean central thickness increased in 105&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>m in the 7 eyes of the control group. This value is similar to that published by many series in diabetic patients after phacoemulsification [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In the treatment group only 1 patient develop a CSME with an increase in the central thickness of 65&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>m, being statically significant the differences between both groups.</p><p>Limitations of our study include the short duration of followup, which precludes the determination of the long term safety and efficacy of prophylactic Ranibizumab in cataract surgery and the number of patients included in the study. However, CME develops shortly after cataract surgery with a maximum at 4&#x02013;6 weeks postop [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Our study determined the incidence of CSME at 1 and 3 months, and there was no evidence that new cases of macular edema had developed in the following months if we consider that there were no new cases appearing between the first and the third month after the cataract surgery. </p><p>Although further investigation with a longer followup and a larger series of patients may be needed, the intravitreal injection of Ranibizumab immediately after the phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation may be a potent tool to prevent clinical significant macular edema after cataract surgery according to our results.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>In summary, the combination of intravitreal Ranibizumab and uncomplicated phacoemulsification avoids the macular thickening measured by OCT in mild to moderate diabetic retinopathy patients without previous macular involvement. Although the small number of patients and the short followup, the results seem to be promising with no increasing risk for the patient.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Funding</title><p>The authors
