A total of 146 older adults aged 56&#x02013;91 (mean 69.99, SD 8.12) participated in this study during February to May 2011. The intervention involved 2 weeks of learning about using the National Institutes of Health&#x02019;s SeniorHealth.gov website to access reliable health information. The intervention took place at public libraries.

When controlling for baseline differences, no significant main effect of the learning method was found on computer/Web knowledge, skills, or eHealth literacy efficacy. Thus, collaborative learning did not differ from individualistic learning in affecting the learning outcomes. No significant interaction effect of learning method and time of measurement was found. Group composition based on gender, familiarity with peers, or prior computer experience had no significant main or interaction effect on the learning outcomes. Regardless of the specific learning method used, participants had overwhelmingly positive attitudes toward the intervention and reported positive changes in participation in their own health care as a result of the intervention.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The findings provide strong evidence that the eHealth literacy intervention tested in this study, regardless of the specific learning method used, significantly improved knowledge, skills, and eHealth literacy efficacy from pre to post intervention, was positively perceived by participants, and led to positive changes in their own health care. Collaborative learning did not differ from individualistic learning in affecting the learning outcomes, suggesting the previously widely reported advantages of collaborative over individualistic learning may not be easily applied to the older population in informal settings, though several confounding factors might have contributed to this finding (ie, the largely inexperienced computer user composition of the study sample, potential instructor effect, and ceiling effect). Further research is necessary before a more firm conclusion can be drawn. These findings contribute to the literatures on adult learning, social interdependence theory, and health literacy.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Health literacy</kwd><kwd>lifelong learning</kwd><kwd>aged</kwd><kwd>technology</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Health literacy is &#x0201c;the degree to which individuals have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>]. This concept has drawn much attention recently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>], with increasing well-documented evidence of both the negative impact of poor health literacy on health outcomes and health care costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] and the alarmingly low levels of health literacy among American adults: a national survey showed only 12% of the adults in the United States have proficient health literacy, and this proportion drops to 3% among older adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>].</p><p>Recently, information and communication technologies (ICTs) are increasingly being widely used in health care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>], presenting both opportunities and challenges for developing and implementing effective health literacy interventions. As government agencies such as the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), nonprofit organizations such as medical associations, and for-profit organizations alike are increasingly putting health information online, the Internet has already become an invaluable resource for high-quality health information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>]. This resource, however, can only be useful if the user has adequate eHealth literacy, or &#x0201c;the ability to seek, find, understand, and appraise health information from electronic sources and apply the knowledge gained to addressing or solving a health problem&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>]. Individuals who have low health literacy&#x02014;for instance, older adults&#x02014;are likely to also have low computer and Internet literacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>], thus facing a double jeopardy in the eHealth era.</p><p>Existing literature provides little scientific evidence about effective health literacy interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>], and even less about effective interventions for improving the eHealth literacy of the older population. Existing interventions focus predominantly on simplifying medical materials and instructions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>]. This &#x0201c;lowering-the-bar&#x0201d; approach is useful but limited given the complexity of medical terminology and knowledge. Education and training is another key approach to addressing the health illiteracy crisis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>]. This approach requires an understanding of health literacy as an active, lifelong learning process that features continuous learning of new, valid health information and unlearning of outdated, harmful information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>]. Such an understanding is especially important in the context of ICTs being increasingly used by health consumers, professionals, and policy makers alike in health care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>]. As ICTs change at a rapid rate, so do the requirements for health literacy skills [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>].</p><sec><title>Electronic Health Information for Lifelong Learners</title><p>The present study is a part of the Electronic Health Information for Lifelong Learners (<italic>e</italic>HiLL) research project that aims to address these gaps in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>]. The goal of the larger <italic>e</italic>HiLL research project is to generate scientific knowledge about optimal learning conditions and strategies that can effectively and efficiently improve older adults&#x02019; learning and use of eHealth applications. To achieve this goal, the <italic>e</italic>HiLL research project consists of a series of experimental studies designed to examine the effects of various learning conditions and strategies through theory-driven, hypothesis-testing, rigorous experiments. The <italic>e</italic>HiLL experimental studies build on an understanding of health literacy as an active, lifelong learning process that goes beyond the formal educational settings in early life stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>]. Importantly, guided by the literature on older adults&#x02019; learning of computer technology, the <italic>e</italic>HiLL interventions all feature key elements designed specifically to accommodate older computer learners&#x02019; needs and preferences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>]. These include (1) providing step-by-step, detailed instructions and avoiding technical jargon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>], (2) providing hands-on practice and encouraging questions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>], (3) making sure each lesson builds on previous lessons and increases complexity gradually [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>], (4) ensuring the learners experience at least some level of success at the initial stage of the training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>], (5) conducting the training in a familiar, relaxed, and supportive environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>], and (6) offering the training in the early morning hours, which is generally the optimal time of day for older learners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>].</p><p>These key elements were fully incorporated in prior <italic>e</italic>HiLL interventions and proven to be effective in improving older adults&#x02019; eHealth literacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>]. Building on and expanding the success of these prior studies, the present study fully incorporates these key elements while adding a new aspect&#x02014;that is, collaborative versus individualistic learning. Existing literatures on adult learning and cognitive development in later life provide a theoretical foundation for the collaborative versus individualistic versions of the intervention tested in the present study. The present study differs from prior <italic>e</italic>HiLL studies in important ways. First, the only prior <italic>e</italic>HiLL study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] that involved both collaborative and individualistic learning had a brief intervention time (the experimental session lasted 2 hours) and it used a 16-minute-long video tutorial as the curriculum. In comparison, the present study involved 2 weeks of intervention for a total of 8 hours, using a paper-based curriculum. Second, while the present study and prior <italic>e</italic>HiLL studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>] all used instructional materials drawn from the same tutorial, the Xie and Bugg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] and Xie [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>] studies focused on individualistic learning and the Xie [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] study was only on collaborative learning. The present study is the first <italic>e</italic>HiLL study that compares the relative effects of collaborative versus individualistic learning over an extended period of intervention time.</p></sec><sec><title>Collaborative Versus Individualistic Learning</title><p>Collaborative learning is one of the most common forms of active learning. It can be defined as &#x0201c;any instructional method in which students work together in small groups toward a common goal,&#x0201d; ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>] p 223). Collaborative learning requires learners to actively engage in the learning process by engaging in meaningful activities and reflecting on what they are learning from doing those activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>]. Collaborative learning is often contrasted with individualistic learning that features students working on their own with little or no interaction with peer students [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>].</p><p>The superiority of collaborative learning over individualistic learning is predicted by social interdependence theory, which emphasizes the interdependence among group members by arguing that the group is a &#x0201c;dynamic whole,&#x0201d; such that any change in the state of a group member changes that of other group members [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>]. The social interdependence among group members can be positive, negative, or nonexistent. Positive interdependence (collaboration) facilitates learning by promoting collaboration among group members. It can be found when individuals recognize that the only way they can achieve their goals is when other group member also achieve their goals. Negative interdependence (competition) exists when individuals recognize that the only way they can achieve their goals is when others fail to do so. It often results in obstructive interactions impeding learning. Nonexistent interdependence (individualistic efforts) exists when individuals perceive that their achievement is not affected by others&#x02019; performance. It features no interaction among group members as each member learns independently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>].</p><p>Extensive empirical evidence supports the effectiveness of collaborative learning. A meta-analysis of over 300 studies shows that collaborative learning outperforms individualistic and competitive learning in postsecondary and professional settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>]. However, there are still major gaps in the literature that require further examination. Collaborative learning research within the social interdependence tradition is predominantly based on formal education of younger adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>]. Whether these findings can be generalized to older age groups in informal educational settings is yet to be answered.</p><p>Recently, the cognitive-developmental literature has begun to examine collaborative learning as a mechanism for improving cognitive abilities in later life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref>]. Some (non-computer-related) studies find a positive impact of collaborative learning on older adults&#x02019; performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref>]. However, there is also evidence that, compared with individualistic learning, collaborative learning has no, or even negative, impact [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref>]. A possible reason might be that existing research within the cognitive-developmental tradition generally does not provide detailed instructions to ensure collaboration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref>]. Instead, participants are simply instructed to &#x0201c;work together&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref>] or &#x0201c;collaborate as much as possible&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref>]. To ensure collaborative learning for older adults in informal settings, it is critical to develop effective strategies that really work.</p></sec><sec><title>Group Composition</title><p>Group composition may affect the &#x0201c;dynamic whole&#x0201d; of a group and, subsequently, the learning process and outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>]. Evidence suggests there is more collaboration in groups with either female- or male-gender majority than in groups with equal gender composition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">45</xref>], and more collaboration in same-gender groups than in mixed ones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">46</xref>].</p><p>The time and effort spent on getting familiar with each other and coordinating may negatively affect the learning process and outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref>]. This argument finds support in research reporting collaborative learning with familiar partners (typically defined as related family members such as a spouse) being more effective than that with unfamiliar partners in enhancing cognitive performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">47</xref>] or in reducing the negative effects of collaboration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref>]. Yet evidence exists that, even with familiar partners, collaborative learning does not generate more benefits than individualistic learning in improving older adults&#x02019; cognitive performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref>].</p><p>Ample evidence suggests that prior computer experience is a strong predictor for older adults&#x02019; computer task performance and learning outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">48</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref50">50</xref>]. Cody et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>] in their study of older computer learners found that &#x0201c;the same [computer training] program was too challenging to some and insufficiently stimulating to others&#x0201d; (p 282). Some researchers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>] suggest forming homogeneous groups based on prior computer experience to ensure the success of computer training for older adults. This suggestion should be taken with caution, given that to date research on computer training for older adults has focused predominantly on individualistic learning while paying little attention to collaborative learning (an important exception is the Zandri and Charness study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref51">51</xref>], which found promising signs for the superiority of collaborative learning over individualistic learning). While homogeneous groups based on prior computer experience might work better than heterogeneous groups in individualistic learning, this might not be the case for the collaborative learning condition.</p></sec><sec><title>Research Questions and Hypotheses</title><p>The present study asked the following primary research question: what impact might the intervention have on older adults&#x02019; computer and Web knowledge, procedural skills, eHealth literacy efficacy, attitudes, and participation in their own health care?</p><p>Under this primary research question, 2 subresearch questions were asked: (1) what impact might the learning method (collaborative; individualistic) have on the learning outcomes?, and (2) what impact might group composition (based on gender, prior familiarity with peers, and prior computer experience) have on the learning outcomes?</p><p>The following hypotheses were tested: (1) hypothesis 1: computer/Web knowledge, skills, and eHealth literacy efficacy increase significantly from pre to post intervention (at the .05 level; same for all hypotheses), (2) hypothesis 2: collaborative learning is significantly more effective than individualistic learning in improving the learning outcomes, and (3) hypothesis 3: collaborative learning is significantly more effective than individualistic learning in heterogeneous group compositions, while individualistic learning is more effective than collaborative learning in homogeneous group compositions.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Design</title><p>We used a 2 &#x000d7; 2 mixed factorial design with learning method (collaborative; individualistic) as the between-participants variable and time of measurement (pre; post) as the within-participants variable.</p></sec><sec><title>Research Sites</title><p>The Hyattsville and New Carrollton branch libraries of the Prince George&#x02019;s County Memorial Library System served as the primary research sites for this study. The Library System is a publicly funded large, urban library system serving over 830,000 residents in Prince George&#x02019;s County, Maryland, USA. It has been serving as the primary research site for the larger <italic>e</italic>HiLL research project since 2007 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>]. This Library System was selected as the key site for the <italic>e</italic>HiLL research project because it serves a large population of ethnic minorities, particularly African American/black people. According to the US Census Bureau, 66% of Prince George&#x02019;s County residents are African American/black, much higher than the 30% overall rate of African American/black residents in Maryland or the 12% rate nationwide (http://www.census.gov). Partnering with this Library System ensures the reach of <italic>e</italic>HiLL interventions to individuals from this underserved minority group. The Hyattsville and New Carrollton branch libraries of the Library System provided free networked computers, space, and staff support to facilitate the implementation of this study. The geographic location of these branch libraries is convenient for potential research participants and the researchers. Both are within 10 miles of the University of Maryland and easily accessible by car or public transportation.</p></sec><sec><title>Participants</title><p>Standard recruitment techniques were used to recruit participants. These included posting recruitment flyers in the branch libraries and other local organizations (eg, senior centers, community centers, and churches) and advertising in the Library System&#x02019;s newsletter. The inclusion criterion was age 60 years and above, though on request and in cases where seats were available, we accommodated individuals a few years younger. A total of 146 older adults aged 56&#x02013;91 years (mean 69.99, SD 8.12) participated in the present study during a 4-month period (February to May 2011). We randomly assigned 72 participants to the collaborative learning experimental condition and 74 to the individualistic learning condition. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>

In the first session, participants first signed the consent form (approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Maryland). The pre intervention survey questionnaire was then administered, followed by the pre skill testing. The intervention began with the completion of the pre testing. At the end of the last session, the post intervention survey questionnaire was administered, followed by the post skill testing. Each class met twice a week, 2 hours each time between 9:00 and 11:00 am, for a total of 2 weeks, at a library site. Class size was small (no more than 8 participants per class). The instructors, trained Master of Library Science students, frequently provided immediate, positive, and useful feedback when needed. Each participant had one computer to work on during each session. The instructors emphasized hands-on practice and provided relevant handouts during each session. These procedural components were carefully designed based on the literature on older adults&#x02019; computer learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>] and proven to be effective in prior <italic>e</italic>HiLL studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>].</p><p>Compared with prior <italic>e</italic>HiLL studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>], a unique procedural aspect of the present study was the use of both collaborative and individualistic learning methods.

promote collaborative learning among younger adults in formal learning settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>], and adapting those strategies

Due to age-related changes in social environments and individual abilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref63">63</xref>], interventions that target younger age groups are unlikely to reach or have similar impact on older adults. Further complicating the situation is that the requirement for health literacy skills is a moving target, particularly in the context of eHealth becoming increasingly prominent in contemporary society [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>]. As Norman [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>] correctly points out, as technology changes, so do the requirements for health literacy skills.</p><sec><title>Impact of the Overall Intervention</title><p>This study aimed to generate new scientific knowledge about effective eHealth literacy interventions for the older population. The primary research question was &#x0201c;What impact might the intervention have on the learning outcomes?&#x0201d; The analyses revealed that computer knowledge, Web knowledge, procedural skills, and eHealth literacy efficacy all improved significantly from pre to post intervention (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .001 in all cases). The effect sizes of these improvements ranged from 0.88 to 2.25, suggesting that the magnitude of these improvements was large [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref64">64</xref>]. What these effect sizes mean is that, for instance, with respect to improvements in eHealth literacy efficacy, an effect size of 2.25 meant a learner increased from the 50th percentile on the pre test to the 99th percentile on the post test on this measure. These results strongly support the magnitude of the effects of the intervention. Further adding to the strength of these positive results is that the statistical power of these measures was strong: it reached 1.00 even at the alpha = .01 level in all cases.</p><p>These findings are even more impressive when interpreted in the context of the literature showing that &#x0201c;effect sizes of 0.8 are rare for any [learning] intervention and require truly impressive gains&#x0201d; ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>] p 224). Also, as summarized in several meta-analyses, the effect sizes of prior collaborative learning interventions (that focused on younger learners in formal educational settings) ranged from 0.29 to 0.70 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref66">66</xref>]. In the present study, the effect size of the intervention on all knowledge, skill, and efficacy measures was greater than 0.8, suggesting the intervention has indeed resulted in &#x0201c;truly impressive gains.&#x0201d; These results provide strong support that the intervention, regardless of the specific learning method used, was effective in improving older adults&#x02019; eHealth literacy.</p><p>Across the 2 experimental conditions, participants had overwhelmingly positive views of the intervention. Notable percentages of participants also reported changes in various aspects of participation in their own health care. These findings suggest the health information these participants obtained from the intervention had affected their health behavior and decision making, which is a key component of eHealth literacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>]. These findings further suggest that the intervention, regardless of the specific learning method used, was effective in improving older adults&#x02019; eHealth literacy. These findings are particularly meaningful in the context of the contemporary health care system increasingly promoting shared medical decision making, where patients are expected to participate more in their own health care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref67">67</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref71">71</xref>].</p><p>An important reason for the effectiveness of the intervention tested in this study was that it fully incorporated the key elements of successful computer training for older adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>], as outlined in the Introduction section above.

A unique aspect of this study was to compare the effectiveness of the collaborative and individualistic learning methods built into the intervention. The analyses yielded interesting findings, as discussed in the next subsection.</p></sec><sec><title>Collaborative Versus Individualistic Learning Method</title><p>The analyses found neither an interaction effect of the learning method and time of measurement nor a main effect of the learning method on any of the outcome measures, suggesting the collaborative and individualistic learning methods did not differ in their relative effects. This finding deserves careful consideration. As reviewed above, the superiority of collaborative learning over individualistic learning, as is well documented in the literature, is based on studies of younger learners in formal educational settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>]. It is possible that collaborative learning may simply not work as well for the older population in informal settings. If this is the case, then this study contributes to the literature by identifying some key limits of the social interdependency theory.</p><p>In particular, the sample of this study consisted of primarily inexperienced computer users: less than 9% of participants used computers every day, while 35% of participants had never used a computer before (participants who used computers less often than every 2&#x02013;3 days made up 72% of the study sample). Engaging in collaborative learning might have been too challenging for most participants who had to focus on their own activities with little attention to spare to interact with and help others, which is in line with the findings of prior research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>]. Thus, the previously widely reported advantages of collaborative learning over individualistic learning may not be easily realized among individuals who have limited prior computer experience.</p><p>Another way to look at this matter, however, is that perhaps different collaborative learning strategies could be used to better promote collaboration among inexperienced computer users. The collaborative learning strategies used in this study were carefully developed based on prior research on younger adult learning in formal educational settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>] and modified to accommodate the older population in informal settings (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4</xref>). In reflection, however, there might not have been sufficient consideration for the largely inexperienced user composition of the study sample.</p><p>For logistical reasons, multiple instructors were hired on an hourly basis to provide the instructions. It is likely that individual differences in these instructors (eg, teaching style, commitment, personality) may have affected the learning outcomes. One indication of this possibility is that the measure of the instructor&#x02019;s teaching <italic>approached</italic> a statistically significant difference between the 2 experimental conditions (<italic>P</italic> = .07). Participants in the individualistic learning condition expressed more positive views of the instructor&#x02019;s teaching than those in the collaborative learning condition. It is possible that this factor might have helped at least partially offset any hypothesized advantage of collaborative learning over individualistic learning.</p><p>The ceiling effect might have also affected the results: due to the positive impact of either version of the intervention, it may have been difficult to differentiate between the relative effects of the collaborative versus individualistic versions of the intervention. A possible solution for future research is to make the knowledge and skill tests more challenging so that the measures can be more sensitive to potential differences in learning outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Group Composition</title><p>As reviewed above, the literature suggests that group composition factors (based on gender, prior familiarity with peers, and prior computer experience) may affect the learning outcome. This study, however, found neither an interaction effect of any of these group composition factors with the collaborative versus individualistic learning method nor a main effect of any of these group composition factors. These findings are in line with those of 2 earlier <italic>e</italic>HiLL studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>]. Replicating the same findings in these 3 independent studies, which differed in multiple ways (eg, intervention duration, instructional materials, procedures, and participants), lends some support to the generalizability of these findings. Note, though, that the study samples of these 3 independent <italic>e</italic>HiLL studies were similar: in each study the majority of the participants were women, unfamiliar with their study peers, and inexperienced computer users. While these findings might be generalized to populations with similar characteristics, they may not be so to populations with different characteristics. Also, as discussed above, if there were insufficient strategies to fully promote collaborative learning, then the potential effect of group composition might have also been affected.</p><p>Participants who completed both the pre and post testing reported <italic>less</italic> prior use of computers than those who completed only the pre testing (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .01), suggesting that participants who used computers more often were more likely to drop out. One possible reason is that the intervention, by design, started from basic computer terms and increased in complexity gradually (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>). Yet this might not have been made clear to the participants and some of them, after the first session, might have gotten the impression that the class was too &#x0201c;basic&#x0201d; for them and thus left. In future research, it will be necessary to fully communicate to participants, during the very first session, all the topics that will be covered in the remaining sessions.</p></sec><sec><title>Practical Implications</title><p>As in the earlier <italic>e</italic>HiLL interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>], the intervention tested in the present study also involved productive partnerships among local public libraries, a library and information science academic program at a state university, and the NIH. These local, state, and federal organizations bring complementary resources to the project and, in doing so, help each organization to achieve its mission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>]. The local public libraries provide the facility and staff support for the project, helping the libraries better serve socially, economically, and technologically underserved library patrons. The library and information science academic program provides the human resources through well-trained and dedicated faculty and graduate students and, in doing so, better achieves its research and educational missions. The NIH provides reliable online health information resources, and its involvement in this study helps promote the use of these resources. Tapping into these well-established public infrastructures ensures the intervention&#x02019;s capacity for scaling up (eg, it can be easily rolled out to other communities across the country to improve older adults&#x02019; eHealth literacy).</p></sec><sec><title>Limitations and Future Directions</title><p>This study has some limitations. First, the sample was a convenience one, consisting of mostly African American/black people (64%), women (69%), and inexperienced computer users (72%). The findings may not be representative of the older population as a whole and should not be generalized without caution. Future research will benefit from examining the issues in a representative sample.</p><p>Second, potential confounding factors might have affected the relative effects of collaborative versus individualistic learning. These include insufficient consideration for the inexperienced user composition of the sample, instructor differences, and the ceiling effect. It will be necessary in future research to test strategies that can more fully promote collaboration among participants who have limited computer experience, control for instructor differences, and use more sensitive measurements to eliminate a potential ceiling effect.</p><p>Third, eHealth literacy skills may involve different levels of skills, with some skills being relatively easier to obtain and others requiring more effort. In future research, it will be necessary to develop more refined measures to assess changes in skills on different levels (eg, skills in not only finding a particular health topic on the NIHSeniorHealth.gov site but also determining the quality of information on any health website).</p><p>Fourth, this experimental study did not have a qualitative component. Future research can include qualitative data collection and analysis, which may generate additional insights into the learning process and the relative effects of collaborative versus individualistic learning.</p><p>Fifth, this study did not include measures of participants&#x02019; potential practice of the skills outside of the intervention (eg, at home or other locations). Future research may include these measures to determine whether and how outside practice might affect the effects of the intervention.</p><p>Finally, changes in participation in own health care were measured in this study by self-report and at only one time point (post intervention) with no follow-up beyond the intervention period. In future research, it will be necessary to add more objective measures (eg, physicians&#x02019; reports) and measure this variable over time at multiple time points.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The findings of this experimental study contribute to the literatures on adult learning, social interdependence theory, and health literacy. This study used both objective and self-report measures. The findings from both types of measures are consistent and, together, provide strong evidence that the eHealth literacy intervention tested in this study, regardless of the specific learning method used, significantly improved knowledge, skills, and efficacy. Participants also had overwhelmingly positive attitudes toward the intervention. Participants reported changes in participation in their own health care as a result of the intervention, further supporting the effectiveness of the intervention on improving older adults&#x02019; eHealth literacy. Collaborative learning did not differ from individualistic learning in affecting the learning outcomes, suggesting that the previously widely reported advantages of collaborative learning over individualistic learning may not be easily applied to the older population in informal settings, though several confounding factors might have contributed to this finding. Further research is necessary before a more firm conclusion can be drawn. Finally, group composition based on gender, familiarity with peers, and prior computer experience demonstrated no significant interaction or main effect on the learning outcomes.</p><p>The study addressed an important social problem: the health &#x0201c;illiteracy&#x0201d; problem among older adults, particularly those who have low incomes, limited education, limited prior computer/Internet experience, and/or belong to ethnic minority groups. The findings of this study contribute to scientific knowledge by advancing theory in older adult learning, particularly the generalizability and application of the collaborative versus individualistic learning method to the older population in an informal setting, and the use of these learning methods as an effective eHealth literacy intervention. By focusing the content of learning on eHealth literacy knowledge and skills, this study broadens current understanding of the health literacy concept and interventions to address the increasing importance of technology in health care. By developing and testing the effectiveness of an eHealth literacy intervention, this study shapes this newly emerging component of health literacy (ie, eHealth literacy) that has increasing significance in contemporary health care.</p><p>This study broadens current paradigms in health literacy by using concepts and approaches novel to the field of health literacy. First, while health literacy has been promoted as a lifelong learning process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>], little attention has been paid to examining the relative benefits of different instructional methods (eg, individualistic versus collaborative learning) on older adults&#x02019; learning of health literacy knowledge and skills. Second, while some prior interventions have involved the use of computers, their primary approach is presenting medical materials on a specific topic through a specially designed localized computer-based system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>]. While such an approach has its advantages (eg, targeting a very specific problem), it also has limitations: it requires extensive resources (to develop and update), and the knowledge and skills learned through this approach are often difficult to generalize to other areas or computer systems. In contrast, in the present study, we used the high-quality Internet health information resources maintained and updated by the NIH that focus on a broad range of medical knowledge, and provide training to improve general knowledge about and skills in finding information on any health topic that might be of interest to an individual&#x02014;and from a common computer system. Thus, this <italic>e</italic>HiLL intervention is cost effective and easily transferrable.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The author thanks the administrators and staff of the Prince George&#x02019;s County Memorial Library System for facilitating the on-site recruitment and logistics, the instructors for carrying out the instructions, graduate assistant Ivan Watkins for scheduling and administering the data collection instruments, and graduate assistant Man Huang for administering the data collection instruments and data entry.
