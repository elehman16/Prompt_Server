Behaviour change interventions may assist people with MS to increase physical activity and reduce sedentary behaviour. However, few studies have investigated their effectiveness using objective measures of physical activity, particularly in the long term. Further, interventions that have proven effective in the short term may not be feasible in clinical practice because of the large amount of support provided. The iStep-MS trial aims to determine the safety, feasibility and acceptability of a behaviour change intervention to increase physical activity and reduce sedentary behaviour among people with MS.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>Sixty people with MS will be randomised (1:1 ratio) to receive a 12-week intervention or usual care only. The intervention consists of four physical activity consultations with a physiotherapist supported by a handbook and pedometer. Outcomes assessed at baseline, 12 weeks and 9 months are physical activity (ActiGraph wGT3X-BT accelerometer), sedentary behaviour (activPAL3&#x000b5;), self-reported activity and sitting time, walking capability, fatigue, self-efficacy, participation, quality of life and health service use. The safety of the intervention will be determined by assessing change in pain and fatigue and the incidence of adverse events during the follow-up period. A parallel process evaluation will assess the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention through assessment of fidelity to the programme and semistructured interviews exploring participants&#x02019; and therapists&#x02019; experiences of the intervention. The feasibility of conducting an economic evaluation will be determined by collecting data on quality of life and resource use.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>Research ethics committee approval has been granted from Brunel University London. Results of the trial will be submitted for publication in journals and distributed to people with MS and physiotherapists.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p>

Those who participate in high levels of physical activity and spend little time in sedentary behaviour have milder disability, better mental health, better social functioning, less fatigue and a lower rate of premature mortality than people who are inactive and sedentary.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7&#x02013;10</xref> Increases in physical activity over time may be associated with improvements in health-related quality of life and the stability of MS symptoms.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 12</xref></p><p>Although the terms physical activity and exercise are often used interchangeably, there is an important distinction between them; exercise is a type of physical activity that is planned, structured and repetitive, whereas physical activity includes a broader range of activities that result in energy expenditure such as occupation-related physical activity, activities of daily living and travel-related physical activity.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Similarly, although sedentary behaviour and physical inactivity have historically been used synonymously, sedentary behaviour is &#x02018;any waking behaviour characterised by an energy expenditure&#x000a0;&#x02264;1.5&#x02009;metabolic equivalents, while in a sitting, reclining or lying posture&#x02019;, whereas physical inactivity is defined as not meeting physical activity recommendations.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p><p>There is substantial evidence that exercise interventions improve mobility, fatigue, strength, quality of life and cardiorespiratory fitness in people with MS<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15&#x02013;19</xref> but little evidence regarding effective interventions to increase physical activity in this group. If physical activity is not maintained beyond the duration of an exercise intervention, the benefits of exercise are likely to be short-lived. At present, people with MS who want to increase physical activity report not receiving support to do so.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p><sec id="s1a"><title>Behaviour&#x000a0;change interventions</title><p>Behaviour&#x000a0;change interventions are a potential method of increasing physical activity and reducing sedentary behaviour in people with MS. Behaviour&#x000a0;change interventions are &#x02018;coordinated sets of activities designed to change specified behaviour patterns&#x02019;.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> These are often complex interventions, involving multiple, interacting components. Such interventions are commonly used to increase physical activity and reduce sedentary behaviour in the general population.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22&#x02013;24</xref> Examples of established techniques that may be incorporated in interventions include goal setting, action planning, providing information on the consequences of the behaviour and providing feedback on performance of the behaviour.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></p><p>A recent meta-analysis indicated that behaviour&#x000a0;change interventions of approximately 8 to 12 weeks&#x02019; duration are effective at increasing physical activity in people with MS in the immediate period following the intervention.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> While this suggests that physical activity may be increased in the short&#x000a0;term, this finding must be interpreted with caution. Eight of the 11 studies were judged at being at high risk of bias.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Nine of the 11 studies assessed physical activity using self-reported measures, which are likely to result in biased estimations of the effect of the intervention given that activity is often overestimated or underestimated.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27 28</xref> Further, self-reported physical activity may be subject to significant reporting bias when participants are not blinded to group allocation, as was the case in all included studies. While it is rarely possible to blind participants to group allocation when examining the effectiveness of complex interventions, an objective measure of physical activity will prevent recall bias. Of the two studies that objectively measured physical activity,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29 30</xref> one reported a significant increase in physical activity immediately after a 3-month intervention.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> However, this increase was not sustained at 9 months. The second study reported no significant increase in objectively measured physical activity after a 6-month intervention despite improvements in self-reported physical activity.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Further, no study included in the review investigated the long-term effect of a behaviour&#x000a0;change intervention on physical activity.</p><p>In addition to these methodological limitations, there is large variation in the volume (ie, duration and frequency) and mode of delivery of interventions across studies. The only intervention that resulted in a significant increase in objectively measured physical activity following a 3-month intervention included 20 exercise consultations, which incorporated behaviour&#x000a0;change techniques, each lasting 60&#x02009;min.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> It may not be feasible or acceptable to deliver or receive such a large volume of exercise in clinical practice, therefore preventing the implementation of the intervention into routine care.</p><p>Although behaviour&#x000a0;change interventions present as a potentially effective method of increasing physical activity and reducing sedentary behaviour in people with MS, the current evidence to support the use of these interventions for people with MS is limited.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> More research is required to identify a feasible, acceptable, clinical-effectiveness and cost-effective intervention to help people with MS increase physical activity and reduce sedentary behaviour in the long&#x000a0;term.</p></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>Study objective</title><p>The aim of the iStep-MS trial is to determine the safety, feasibility and acceptability of a behaviour-change intervention to increase physical activity and reduce sedentary behaviour for people with MS.

Those already participating in a clinical trial will also not be permitted to participate to minimise the impact of potential confounding variables on the study outcome. We have chosen not to limit the eligibility criteria to people who are physically inactive or people with a specific type of MS as the impact of these factors on study outcomes will be determined following completion of this feasibility study. Our analysis of the impact of these factors on study outcomes will inform inclusion criteria and stratification factors in a definitive trial.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Sample size</title><p>&#x000a0;Sixty participants will be recruited for this study. This is a pilot study and thus a sample size calculation has not been performed. There are currently 1200 people on the database of the Berkshire MS Therapy Centre. Recruitment rate to the study is estimated to be 10% based on previous physical activity studies that include an intervention to change physical activity behaviour.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32 33</xref></p></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>Recruitment</title><p>Participants will primarily be recruited from people with MS who are registered at the Berkshire MS Therapy Centre and meet the eligibility criteria. As it is not possible to screen the database at the Therapy Centre to identify potentially eligible participants, due to the type of data stored on the database, everyone on the database will be provided with an information pack by post or email. The information pack, sent by an administrator at the centre, includes a participant invite letter and a participant information sheet. People who receive information by post will also receive a questionnaire about their reasons for non-participation (described under the&#x000a0;"reasons for non-participation"&#x000a0;section) and a stamped addressed envelope. Participants who receive information by email will be directed to an online version of the questionnaire. If no response is received within 4 weeks of the first contact, the administrator will send a second invitation pack containing a new participant invite letter, participation information sheet, questionnaire and stamped addressed envelope (or link to the online version of the questionnaire). Information on the study will be shared through Berkshire MS Therapy Centre newsletter, blog and social media, and posters advertising the study will be displayed at the centre. In addition, the study will be advertised on the MS Society website. People who express an interest in participating in the trial will be contacted by a member of the research team who will provide them with more information about the study, screen for eligibility and answer questions.</p><p>Potential participants identified by the physiotherapy team during routine attendance at the MS Therapy Centre will also be approached by a member of the research team. A member of the physiotherapy team will obtain consent from the individual for the member of the research team to approach them before they do so. The researcher will introduce the study, ensure the person is eligible to participate and provide them with an information pack.</p><p>The study recruitment period will run from May 2017 to end January 2018. Over the 9-month recruitment period, we expect to recruit 60 participants with MS through the Berkshire MS Therapy&#x000a0;Centre, which equates to approximately 1.5 participants per week. At the time of recruitment for this study, there will be no competing studies ongoing at the MS Therapy Centre.</p></sec><sec id="s3f"><title>Reasons for non-participation</title><p>A potential concern is that the people who are already physically active select to participate in the study. The broad inclusion criteria and various recruitment pathways aim to counteract this. In addition, the profile of participants and non-participants will be compared in order to identify potential selection bias. In order to identify the reasons why people refuse to participate in the study and to identify any differences in baseline characteristics between participants and non-participants, we will ask non-participants to complete an online or paper questionnaire. Individuals will be asked to provide information on sociodemographic factors, health and lifestyle factors, and physical activity, and provide reason(s) for non-participation. This survey will take approximately 5&#x02009;min to complete. Completion of the survey will indicate consent. Non-participants will be incentivised to complete the questionnaire by being included in a raffle for a &#x000a3;50 gift voucher on completion of the questionnaire.</p></sec><sec id="s3g"><title>Randomisation</title><p>Following baseline assessments, participants will be randomly allocated to the intervention or usual care control group in a 1:1 ratio. Allocation will be performed by an individual independent to the study according to a computer-generated random schedule in permuted blocks of 2 or 4. The allocation sequence will be placed in sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes. Following each baseline assessment, an envelope will be drawn sequentially by a researcher who will inform the participant if they are in the intervention group or the control group.</p></sec><sec id="s3h"><title>Blinding</title><p>Participants and physiotherapists will not be blind to group allocation. Researchers conducting the assessments will also not be blind to group allocation. However, the questionnaires will be self-reported and participants will receive standardised instructions to mitigate against measurement bias. Assessment of objectively measured physical activity and sedentary behaviour is unlikely to be influenced by the assessor being aware of group allocation. To mitigate against observer bias during data processing and analysis, a person independent to the study will apply anonymous codes to all data sheets and physical activity data files before analysis to ensure that the research team and statistician are blinded to group allocation when processing and analysing the data.</p></sec><sec id="s3i"><title>Intervention</title><p>Participants in the intervention group will receive four physical activity sessions with a trained physiotherapist delivered over 3&#x02009;months, supported by a handbook and pedometer, in addition to usual care. Participants will be provided with a handbook prior to session 1.</p><p>The handbook was developed to guide physiotherapists and participants through the four physical activity sessions. It was developed by cognitive-behavioural trainers with experience in training health professionals to use brief behaviour change techniques, the research team, people with MS and experienced neurological physiotherapists. The intervention handbook was adapted from the National Health Service (NHS) Health Trainer Handbook<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> and incorporated aspects from the Supportive Adjustment for Multiple Sclerosis (saMS) manual.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> The NHS Health Trainer Handbook incorporates established, effective techniques that help people change behaviours that are known to cause ill-health. It does not focus on a specific theory of behaviour&#x000a0;change but incorporates behaviourchange techniques that draw from several theories. At present, the NHS Health Trainer Handbook is not appropriate for use for the purpose of this study as it does not specifically focus on changing physical activity and sedentary behaviour and is designed for use in the general population. A modified version of the NHS Health Trainer Handbook delivered alongside four supporting consultations has proved effective at increasing physical activity in older adults.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> The saMS manual was developed to guide a cognitive behavioural therapy programme aimed to help people with MS adjust to living with MS.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> The specific aspects of the saMS manual that were adapted for use in the handbook were addressing the particular challenges of MS in relation to physical activity, identifying strategies for coping with MS-related problems in relation to physical activity and reducing &#x02018;symptom focusing&#x02019;.</p><p>The handbook consists of seven sections. The content of each section is described in <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="B1">box</xref>. An independent group of people with MS and physiotherapists reviewed and revised each section in consultation with the research team. Briefly, the handbook consists of an introduction, a section dedicated to each of the four sessions and additional resources. The format of the sections dedicated to each session is: overview, pre-session reading and reflection, content specific to that session (eg, barriers and facilitators to physical activity), goal setting, and a diary to record and monitor goals. Key behaviour&#x000a0;change techniques drawn from Michie <italic>et al</italic>&#x02019;s taxonomy of behaviour&#x000a0;change techniques<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> were incorporated into each session.

Participants will be asked to wear the accelerometer on their right side or least effected side in the case of significant asymmetry at the hip for 7 days at each assessment point. They will be instructed to wear the accelerometer during waking hours and remove it for swimming and bathing. They will be asked to complete a diary indicating the times that they wore the accelerometer. Data will be collected in 15&#x02009;s epochs.

Sampling of participants to participate in interviews will involve key criteria such as gender, age, type of MS and level of baseline walking ability to ascertain a range of views.</p><sec id="s3o1"><title>Fidelity</title><p>Fidelity to the programme will be assessed through fidelity to intervention content and delivery skills. The content parallels the main skills identified in the intervention itself. Skills relate to delivery skills of the therapists including empathic listening, partnership working and motivational interviewing, all part of the training delivered to the therapists. A fidelity tool has been developed by an expert panel consisting of experienced cognitive-behavioural trainers involved in intervention development. Prior to its use in the trial, the tool will be piloted by three raters (two members of the research team and a cognitive-behavioural trainer) independently rating four different recorded sessions. All therapists delivering the intervention will have each of the four sessions assessed with the specific sessions selected at random, ensuring a minimum of 10% of each therapists&#x02019; sessions are assessed. Assessment will occur through audio-recordings of the sessions and no feedback will be given to the therapists.</p><p>Fidelity to intervention content will be achieved if 70% of appropriate content is covered either completely or partially within a session. This acknowledges that for some individuals, certain content may not be appropriate and can therefore be removed from the assessment. Fidelity to delivery skills will be achieved if the therapist is scored at an adequate level or above in each of the designated skill categories.</p></sec><sec id="s3o2"><title>Interviews</title><p>Interviews will be conducted in person or over the phone.

Pain will be assessed using the section relating to pain on the EQ-5D-5L. Fatigue will be assessed using the MFIS. At each assessment point, participants will be asked if they experienced a fall, a relapse or any AE since the last contact. Although this method of assessing falls relies on the recall ability of the participant, it accurately detects injurious falls in community-dwelling older adults.<xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref> Participants will also be advised to contact the research team if they experience an AE during the trial. An adverse event is considered serious if it results in death, is life-threatening, requires hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation and&#x000a0;results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity. All serious adverse events (SAEs) will be reported to the trial Sponsor and Research Ethics Committee within 48&#x02009;hours of a member of the research team or the physiotherapy team at the MS Therapy Centre first becoming aware of the SAE.

All data will be stored securely to maintain confidentiality. To preserve the participant&#x02019;s anonymity, only their allocated trial number and initials will be recorded on any trial documentation except for the consent form and contact details. Documents with identifiable information will be stored separately to other study documents. Pseudonyms will be used when reporting findings from qualitative research. The use of the data from the study will be controlled by the Chief Investigator. All data and documentation related to the trial will be stored in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements and access to data will be restricted to authorised trial personnel. Pseudonymised quantitative data will be made available in a public repository once the data have obtained validation through publication.</p></sec><sec id="s3q"><title>Service user involvement</title><p>People with MS have been involved in the development of the protocol and will be included in all stages of the study. The need for the study was highlighted through interviews with people with MS. A reference group of two people with MS and four experienced neurological physiotherapists was developed to advise the research team. The reference group contributed to the development of the intervention and assisted with piloting the intervention and creating materials for training physiotherapists. The reference group also reviewed the documentation developed for the trial, including participant information sheets, participant invite letters and questionnaires. A member of the reference group also assisted with piloting the assessment. The reference group will continue to advise the research team on recruitment, retention and dissemination of the results of the trial throughout the project.</p></sec><sec id="s3r"><title>Data analysis</title><sec id="s3r1"><title>Qualitative data</title><p>In order to determine the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention among both people with MS and physiotherapists, interviews from both groups (physiotherapists and people with MS) will be analysed independently through framework analysis.<xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref> This method of analysis provides a clear audit trail of the analytical process, which enhances transparency.<xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref> The technique involves five iterative stages of analysis:&#x000a0;familiarisation, identifying thematic framework, labelling, charting, and&#x000a0;mapping and interpretation,<xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>&#x000a0;following which significant themes can be presented. Further steps to enhance rigour in this process including peer debriefing will be put in place and reported. NVIVO will be used for interview data management.</p></sec><sec id="s3r2"><title>Quantitative data</title><p>To determine fidelity to the intervention, descriptive statistics will be used to describe the number of sessions received by participants, the time between each session and the duration of each session. The percentage of participants who receive at least 70% of appropriate content, either completely or partially, within a session will be reported.</p><p>To determine acceptability of the intervention, descriptive statistics will be used to report attendance at physical activity consultations, completion rate of the handbook and completion of the physical activity diary.</p><p>To determine safety of the intervention, descriptive statistics will be used to report fatigue and pain at baseline, 3 months and 9 months, respectively. Linear mixed models will be used to assess differences in changes in pain and fatigue during follow-up between groups. Descriptive statistics will be used to report the number of adverse events, including falls and relapses, in each group for the duration of the trial. A negative binomial model, which accounts for overdispersion in the outcome, will be used to investigate if the number of adverse events differ between groups. Participants with data recorded at at least one follow-up assessment will be included in the analysis. The type and severity of the adverse event will be described.</p><p>As this is a feasibility study, the efficacy of the intervention is not of primary interest. However, exploratory analysis will be conducted to examine how outcomes differ between the intervention and control group over time. A detailed statistical analysis plan will be made prior to the analysis. It is anticipated that linear mixed models, to account for within-participant correlation, will be used to determine the difference in objectively measured moderate-to-vigorous activity, step-count, sedentary behaviour, walking capability, fatigue, self-efficacy and participation between groups at 3 months and 9 months. The baseline score for the relevant outcome will be included in the model as a covariate in order to improve precision of the effect estimate.</p><p>The primary analysis will be an intention-to-treat analysis. A secondary per-protocol analysis will be conducted using participants who attended at least 75% of the sessions and completed follow-up to 9 months. The amount and mechanism of missing data will be explored. If data are only missing in the outcome and the missingness mechanism is assumed to be MAR (missing at random), linear mixed models provide an unbiased and efficient estimate of the treatment effect.<xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref> Sensitivity analyses will be conducted to determine if the assumption of MAR is reasonable.<xref rid="R64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref></p><p>All analyses will be conducted using Stata (StataCorp).</p><p>The following criteria are proposed to determine if the intervention warrants further investigation in a larger phase 3 trial: there is no evidence of a greater number of adverse events or a greater negative change in pain and fatigue in the intervention group in comparison to the control group; there is no indication of a dominant negative theme from interviews with participants and physiotherapists;&#x000a0;and the attrition rate is less than 20%. In addition, if these criteria are met, data collected during interviews will be used to adapt the intervention in order to improve its acceptability for use in a definitive trial.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3s"><title>Timeline</title><p>The trial is funded for a period of 24 months and commenced in January 2017. This includes time to develop the intervention. Recruitment commenced in May 2017 and is projected to be completed by January 2018. The final follow-up assessment is projected to be completed by September 2018 with data analysis and report writing being conducted from month 21 onwards.</p></sec><sec id="s3t"><title>Ethics</title><p>The study is sponsored by Brunel University London. Any protocol modifications will be communicated to the Brunel University London Ethics Committee and consent will be reobtained from participants if the Research Ethics Committee deems it necessary. The trial will be conducted in full conformance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and to Medical Research Council Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines. All researchers working on the trial will receive training in GCP guidelines. It will also comply with all applicable Brunel University Research integrity guidance.</p><p>Consent will be obtained from the manager of the Berkshire MS Therapy Centre to conduct the research at the centre.
