As with any procedure in any surgical discipline, complications can and do occur. The Charit&#x000e9; artificial disc (DePuy Spine, Raynham, Mass) was first made commercially available outside the United States in 1987. In October 2004, the device was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of lumbar degenerative disc disease (DDD) at 1 level: L4-5 or L5-S1.</p><p>The literature contains multiple reports of the worldwide experience with lumbar TDR, almost all of which are retrospective case series or case reports that have been described previously in review articles.<sup><xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Because the Charit&#x000e9; artificial disc has the longest history of any TDR device, more complications have been reported in the literature for it than for other TDR devices. In 2003, van Ooij et al.<sup><xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> reported 27 complications of TDR with the Charit&#x000e9; artificial disc. However, what was not reported, as described by McAfee, <sup><xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> was that these complications came from a series of 500 patients with widely varying patient indications, the use of early basic instrumentation, and, in some cases, inadequate sizing of the prosthesis.</p><p>Zeegers et al.<sup><xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> reported a retrospective series of 50 patients implanted with the Charit&#x000e9; artificial disc with a complication rate of 13%. In a series of 46 patients, Cinotti et al.<sup><xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> reported a reoperation rate of 19.5%. Other authors have reported similar or lower complication rates from TDR with the Charit&#x000e9; artificial disc. Lemaire et al.<sup><xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> reported a total of 21 complications, both major and minor, in their series of 100 patients with minimum 10-year follow-up. David<sup><xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> reported a 14% complication rate in 197 patients followed for 10 years. All of these series were retrospective, involving the early experience of the authors with lumbar TDR. Since the time of these early implantations with the Charit&#x000e9; artificial disc, patient selection criteria, surgical implantation instruments, and surgical technique have all evolved, in part as a response to the early failures reported. To date, an analysis of complications of lumbar TDR, using prospective, narrow, clinically defined indications and a standardized surgical technique with modern instrumentation have not been reported as part of a prospective, randomized, controlled trial.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S0002"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>Between May 2000 and April 2002, 304 patients underwent surgery in this prospective, randomized, nonblinded, FDAapproved study at 14 investigational sites across the United States. Before beginning patient enrollment, each site obtained local institutional review board approval for conducting the study. Complete inclusion and exclusion criteria were previously described by both Geisler et al.<sup><xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> and Blumenthal et al.<sup><xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> The primary inclusion criteria were single-level symptomatic DDD at L4-5 or L5-1 confirmed by provocative discography, back or leg pain without nerve root compression (radiculopathy) with a visual analog scale (VAS) score of &#x02265;40 (range: 1&#x02013;100) and an Oswestry Disability Index 2.0<sup><xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> score of &#x02265;30 (range: 1&#x02013;100), ability to tolerate an anterior abdominal approach, and failure to respond to nonoperative treatment for a period of at least 6 months. The primary exclusion criteria were multilevel symptomatic DDD, previous thoracic or lumbar fusion, current or previous lower lumbar fracture, osteoporosis, spondylolisthesis &#x0003e;3 mm, spondylosis, or scoliotic deformity greater than 11&#x000b0;.</p><p>Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to one of 2 groups. The investigational group received TDR with the Charit&#x000e9; artificial disc. The control group received anterior lumbar interbody fusion (ALIF) with BAK threaded fusion cages (Zimmer Spine, Minneapolis, Minn) packed with iliac crest autograft. A total of 205 patients were enrolled in the investigational group, and 99 patients were enrolled in the control group. There was no significant difference between the groups with respect to all demographic variables with the exception of mean weight, which was slightly higher in the control group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T0001">Table 1</xref>).

All patient files and case report forms were monitored by a contract research organization to ensure that all adverse events were captured and reported to the FDA and local institutional review boards. Final adverse event data from the randomized arm of the study was verified as complete and submitted to the FDA in August 2004, before FDA approval of the investigational device in October 2004.</p><p>Adverse event data were reviewed by the authors. A large number of reported adverse events in an IDE study are often unrelated to the treatment. Examples include reported events such as dermatological events, psychological events, drug allergy, motor vehicle accidents, and coumadin overdoses. Some adverse events reported were secondary to another event, such as fever with infection and leg pain with a neurological event. Some reported adverse events are normal occurrences after spinal surgery, such as incision pain and musculoskeletal spasms. These adverse events, not related to the procedure or the approach, were excluded from this review to create a true account of the perioperative and postoperative complications associated with a TDR procedure in comparison to an ALIF procedure.</p></sec><sec id="S0003"><title>STATISTICAL METHODS</title><p>Fisher's exact test was used to test categorical variables between the 2 groups.

The rate for a report of both back and lower extremity pain at the same time was 11.7% (24) in the investigational group and 14.1% (14) in the control group.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="S0012"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>A key point that is often lost in the literature is that the majority of complications related to TDR procedures, particularly complications necessitating revision or removal of a prosthesis, are unrelated to a specific device. In addition, the literature contains just a small subsection of the total worldwide experience with lumbar TDR. A wider experience describing complications and revision strategies for the Charit&#x000e9; artificial disc and other lumbar prostheses, including important revision approach considerations, has been previously described by McAfee et al.<sup><xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> This is a significant educational resource on the topic of complications resulting from lumbar TDR procedures.</p><p>In this study, the rate of perioperative venous injury was twice as high in the investigational group compared with the control group. This is most likely because of issues with retraction of the great vessels at L4-5 to implant the investigational device. The prosthesis must be placed in the exact center of the disc space, but complete vessel retraction to the right at L4-5 is sometimes difficult to achieve, depending on the patient's vascular anatomy. One other possible cause of the venous injuries in the investigational group may have been the use of first-generation instrumentation throughout the randomized phase of the study. For example, the original endplate inserter had a 30&#x000b0; offset, which forced the instrument laterally onto the patient's left abdomen while inserting the prosthesis endplates. This has since been corrected to a 0&#x000b0; offset with the introduction of new instrumentation (Centreline TDR, DePuy Spine, Raynham, Mass).</p><p>Because the Charit&#x000e9; prosthesis incorporates sharp teeth for vertebral fixation, great care must be taken to avoid a vessel laceration when implanting the prosthesis endplates. Of the 11 perioperative venous injuries, only 1 resulted in blood loss of more than 1500 mL. The overall rate of venous injury in all 304 patients enrolled in the study was 3.6%. This is 2.5 times higher than the rate of venous injury reported by Brau et al.<sup><xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> in 1315 consecutive ALIF procedures (1.4%). However, the patients in the Brau series may have benefited from the ability to place fusion devices or femoral rings anterolaterally when vessel retraction was insufficient. This was not possible in the IDE study.</p><p>The higher rate of superficial wound infection in the investigational group may be attributable to the investigational group being more active preoperatively (and postoperatively) compared with the control group. As reported in the clinical results article by Blumenthal et al.,<sup><xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> although the difference between the groups was not significant, the investigational group had a higher rate of active or moderately active patients preoperatively compared with the control group.</p><p>The rate of retrograde ejaculation in male patients enrolled in the study was 4.1%. This rate was higher than the rate of 0.3% reported by Brau<sup><xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> in a study of 17 spine surgeons performing 686 ALIF procedures through a minilaparotomy approach. There is no obvious reason for the disparity between the rate experienced in the IDE trial and the experience of Brau. Sasso et al.<sup><xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> reported a retrograde ejaculation rate of 1.7% in 116 consecutive cases of ALIF via a retroperitoneal approach and a rate of 13.3% in 30 consecutive cases of ALIF using a transperitoneal approach. Sasso et al.<sup><xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> recommend avoidance of the transperitoneal approach, except in cases of revision at L5-S1, to reduce the incidence of retrograde ejaculation in male patients. Early identification of the sympathetic plexus and avoiding the use of monocautery also will reduce the incidence of retrograde ejaculation in male patients undergoing a retroperitoneal approach to the lumbar spine.</p><p>As previously described by Geisler et al.,<sup><xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> the rate of major neurological complications was small in both groups, and the overall rate of neurological adverse events was equivalent between both groups. Therefore, it can be expected that the incidence of neurological complications as a result of TDR with the Charit&#x000e9; artificial disc will be no greater than for ALIF procedures.</p><p>Subsidence occurred in 7 patients enrolled in the investigational group. We believe that these cases were technique related. It is important to perform a complete discectomy before prosthesis insertion. However, as with an ALIF procedure, removal of the bony vertebral endplate in the central part of the vertebral body will result in exposure of soft cancellous bone, which is unable to biomechanically support the prosthesis under normal loading, causing subsidence. We believe that the discectomy may have been too aggressive in these 7 cases, and we caution against removing the bony endplate during the discectomy phase of the procedure. Further, it is important to size the prosthesis correctly and maximize the surface area so that the footprint of the device covers as much of the vertebral rim of cortical bone as possible. Since FDA approval, 2 additional footprint sizes have been added to assist in matching up the footprint size to the patient's vertebral anatomy.</p><p>The rate of confirmed nonunion in the control group (9%) further validates the study performed by Kuslich et al.<sup><xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> using BAK cages for standalone interbody fusion in narrowly indicated patients. In the 7 cases of revision to a new prosthesis (5) or removal and replacement with interbody fusion (2), all of the devices were placed too anteriorly, which led to migration or displacement of the prosthesis. Placement of the prosthesis too anteriorly can lead to migration or core displacement because adequate posterior disc space height is not achieved. Therefore, it is imperative that the prosthesis be placed in the ideal position in the sagittal plane, 2 mm dorsal to the exact center of the disc space, with particular attention to fiuoroscopic landmarks to avoid parallax-related positioning errors. Revisions and reoperations in the randomized arm of the study, as well as the training and continued access arms, are described in greater detail by McAfee et al.<sup><xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup></p><p>It is unclear whether many of the complications classified as &#x0201c;other&#x0201d; were a result of the surgical intervention, or whether they were not realized preoperatively. This may be the case for reported events such as postoperative spondylolisthesis and spinal stenosis in both groups. As described by McAfee et al.,<sup><xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> 2 pars fractures in the investigational group were evident retrospectively on preoperative radiographs that were not diagnosed until after the index surgery. Inclusion of these patients in the study was a protocol deviation, and because the fractures were present preoperatively and not caused by the device or the procedure, they are not classified as adverse events or complications. The rate of adjacent-level disc disease is exceedingly low out to 24 months. However, we believe this topic needs to be studied with long-term data because adjacentlevel disc disease does not normally present itself in such a short timeframe.</p><p>It is unknown how many reports of postoperative pain are true complications in this study, related to either the device or procedure in either group. The protocol did not specify the reporting threshold for postoperative pain. General guidelines to the investigative sites recommended that pain be reported as an adverse event if the pain is (1) (a) possibly, (b) probably, or (c) definitely related to the device or the intervention; (2) more severe than the patient experienced before the intervention; or (3) represented in a new area where the patient did not have pain before the intervention. These guidelines were not adequately communicated to the investigators in the study, so it is not known how many of these adverse event reports fit the definition described previously mentioned.</p><p>Pain after lumbar surgery is often expected. With respect to point 1a above, almost all patients experience pain related to the procedure in the immediate postoperative timeframe and for several weeks after surgery. At 24 months of follow-up, the mean VAS score was 31.2 in the investigational group and 37.5 in the control group. This represents a significant improvement in pain compared with baseline levels, but clearly some patients in both groups were not pain free. Is postoperative pain a complication of a lumbar TDR procedure or a lumbar fusion procedure? If so, when? In terms of classifying pain as a complication, we should be more concerned with instances of pain fitting the definition of points 2 and 3; pain more severe than before the intervention, and pain in a new area. Perhaps point 2 should be expanded to include the same amount of pain as before the intervention, because certainly &#x0201c;breaking even&#x0201d; on a patient's pain is not a good result for the patient. Unfortunately, because of the reporting of pain-related adverse events in this study, it is not possible to adequately address the true rate of pain-related complications.</p><p>Complications occur with every surgical procedure in every surgical discipline. However, specific steps can be taken to minimize perioperative and postoperative surgical complications, particularly with respect to lumbar TDR procedures. The first of these steps is correct patient indications. Clinical and radiographic results previously described, as well as the complications reported here, are directly related to the narrow patient indications used in this IDE study. Use of the Charit&#x000e9; artificial disc, or any spine surgery device, in nonindicated patients may not yield the same results and may lead to unintended, avoidable complications.</p><p>Both training and experience are important in terms of minimizing complications. Each of the investigators in this IDE study had extensive experience with ALIF procedures and the retroperitoneal approach to the lumbar spine before enrolling patients in the study. It is imperative that surgeons wishing to add lumbar TDR procedures to their armamentarium attend a company-sponsored training course on the procedure and perform the procedure without shortcuts. This holds true for other TDR prostheses as well, because each prosthesis has its own surgical technique and instrumentation. It is recommended that after training, surgeons observe at least 1 case in the operating room before attempting the procedure. Further, for those surgeons who have performed few or no ALIF procedures, it is recommended that they first become comfortable with ALIF before including TDR procedures in their practice.</p><p>The senior author prefers to perform his own approaches. However, the coauthors believe an approach surgeon is a valuable addition to the surgical team, to assist with mitigating perioperative complications, as well as for prescreening patients who have had previous abdominal surgery for potential problems during the approach. In our opinion, major neurological complications may be minimized by taking care not to overdistract the disc space. The goal of TDR (as with interbody fusion) is to restore the original disc height relative to the heights of adjacent discs. The goal is not to increase disc height to the maximum possible.</p><p>TDR procedures differ from interbody fusion procedures because exact placement of the prosthesis is required for the best results. This is not necessarily true for all interbody fusion procedures. Particular attention should be paid to device placement in the ideal position, as described by McAfee et al.<sup><xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>: 2 mm dorsal to the midpoint of the disc space in the sagittal plane and in the exact center in the coronal plane. If the prosthesis is placed too anteriorly, migration or displacement are more likely to occur. If initial placement of the prosthesis is too anterior on fiuoroscopy, we recommend repositioning of the prosthesis before closing the wound. Revision anterior lumbar surgery is often difficult because of scarring in between and around the vessels; therefore, repositioning the prosthesis during the index surgery may eliminate the need for a potentially life-threatening revision surgery in the future.</p><p>Incidence of perioperative and postoperative complications for lumbar TDR was similar that of ALIF. Vigilance is necessary with respect to patient indications, training, and correct surgical technique to maintain TDR complications at the levels experienced in the IDE study.</p></sec></body><back><bio id="d35e130"><p>All authors are consultants to DePuy Spine, Raynham, Mass.</p></bio><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="CIT0001"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>de Kleuver</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Oner</surname><given-names>FC</given-names></name><name><surname>Jacobs</surname><given-names>WC</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Total disc replacement for chronic low back pain: background and a systematic review of the literature</article-title><source>Eur Spine J.</source><year>2003</year><volume>12</volume><fpage>108</fpage><lpage>116</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">12709847</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CIT0002"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Szpalski</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Gunzburg</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Mayer</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Spine arthroplasty: a historical review</article-title><source>Eur Spine J.</source><year>2002</year><volume>11</volume><issue>suppl 2</issue><fpage>S65</fpage><lpage>84</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">12384726</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CIT0003"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>McAfee</surname><given-names>PC</given-names></name></person-group><person-group person-group-type="editor"><name><surname>Kaech</surname><given-names>DL</given-names></name><name><surname>Jinkins</surname><given-names>JR</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Artificial disc prosthesis: the Link SB Charit&#x000e9;
