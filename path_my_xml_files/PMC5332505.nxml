This study investigated a 1-year intervention with focus on increasing physical activity (PA) and fruit and vegetable intake (FVI), decreasing screen media use (SMU) and soft drink consumption (SDC) in children with MB. 525 children (7.1&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.7&#x000a0;years) with MB who participated in the cluster-randomised study were assessed at baseline and after 1&#x000a0;year. Daily SMU, PA behaviours, SDC and FVI were assessed using a parental questionnaire. After one&#x000a0;year, significant effects were found in the intervention group for FVI (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x02264;&#x000a0;0.035). Partially strong tendencies but no significant differences were found for PA and SDC. Although the effects are small, the intervention seems to reach children with MB.

In developed countries, the prevalence of childhood overweight and obesity has been increasing dramatically during the last decades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Although current evidence suggests obesity rates are plateauing in a few countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], it has been shown that once children are overweight it is most difficult to treat or even reverse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. It long has been recognised that numerous health problems in childhood and later life are associated with obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and besides genetic predispositions the main reasons of this worldwide increase are behavioural and cultural factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>Although, the World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends an engagement of at least 60&#x000a0;min daily in moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) for children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], decreased physical activity levels from early childhood into adolescence and adulthood are well documented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. On the other hand, prolonged periods of sitting and a sedentary lifestyle rise continuously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Even at an early age, extensive use of screen media as one aspect of sedentary behaviour dominates many children&#x02019;s&#x000a0;day to day routines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Paired with poor dietary behaviours, often consisting of a regular consumption of sugar-sweetened drinks as well as low fruit and vegetable intake, these are the most consistent factors associated with childhood overweight and obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>Moreover, children with migration background appear to be at higher risk of developing overweight and obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], have a higher sugar intake&#x02014;assumingly due to a higher consumption of sweets&#x02014;as well as a higher risk of low physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. It has been suggested that this increased risk of overweight and obesity in children with migration background is a consequence of acculturation and lifestyle changes, such as giving up traditional dietary patterns and adopting new food habits as well as a high media exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>Children&#x02019;s dietary and physical activity behaviours are mostly influenced by their homes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In order to reach parents and promote a healthy lifestyle, education settings are promising for interventions as most children can be reached and already existing infrastructure can be used to support the implementation of interventions. Research shows that successful interventions should be integrated in the school curriculum and include aspects such as healthy eating and physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. However, health promotion solely for children with migration background in a school-based setting is hardly possible and&#x02014;especially since a holistic approach on health is being assumed&#x02014;undesirable.</p><p>In 2009, the health promotion programme &#x0201c;Join the Healthy Boat&#x0201d; was implemented in primary schools in the south-west of Germany (federal state Baden-W&#x000fc;rttemberg). The materials and contents of the programme are designed for all primary school children and are fully incorporated in the curriculum whereby the focus lies on behaviour change to be more physically active, have a healthier diet and spend less time with screen media; all delivered through the classroom teacher but with substantial parental involvement, including parents&#x02019; nights, regular written information and so-called family homework (for more detailed information see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]). In order to also reach parents with migration background, parent information was also delivered in Turkish and Russian, which are the two largest groups of migrants in Germany (28 and 30&#x000a0;%, respectively) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>Given that intervention effects can vary between populations with different ethnic backgrounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and therefore, the success of a health promotion programme could be influenced by ethnic or cultural factors, it is essential to investigate whether the implementation and intended outcomes of this intervention were achieved even in children with migration background. Hence, a large-scale evaluation study was carried out to examine children&#x02019;s health behaviours after a one&#x000a0;year intervention in respect of the programme&#x02019;s main aspects: increased physical activity, decreased screen media use as well as a healthy diet including sufficient fruit and vegetable intake and a reduced consumption of sugar-sweetened drinks. This work reports intervention results of children with migration background only, intervention results of the general population are published elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Intervention and Evaluation Design</title><p>&#x0201c;Join the Healthy Boat&#x0201d; is a school-based intervention to promote a healthy lifestyle in children. Key aspects of the intervention are more physical activity, less time with screen media and a more healthy diet, especially targeting a reduction of soft drink consumption and an increase of fruit and vegetable intake. The ready to use materials the teachers are given include one lesson per week (on physical activity, diet or screen media use) and daily exercise breaks of 10&#x02013;15&#x000a0;min. The main focus lies on the promotion of healthy and active alternatives, which children are offered to choose in order to lead a healthier lifestyle. In order to enable children to carry home the learnt information, parents&#x02019; nights, regular parents&#x02019; letters and so-called family homework are provided; the latter require joint efforts of parents and child to solve the given exercises. Further information on development, materials, implementation and recruitment of teachers and pupils can be found elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>The evaluation of this health promotion programme was designed as a prospective, stratified, cluster-randomised, and longitudinal study with control and intervention group. Baseline measurements were taken prior to the programme&#x02019;s start at the beginning of the academic year within 6&#x000a0;weeks in autumn, after that the intervention group integrated the programme into the curriculum whereas the control group stuck to the regular school curriculum. In autumn the following year, follow-up measurements were taken. Approval for the study was obtained from the University&#x02019;s Ethics Committee, the Ministry of Culture and Education and was provided in accordance with the declaration of Helsinki.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Participants</title><p>1943 first and second grade schoolchildren in 154 classes (80 classes in the intervention group; 74 classes in the control group) were assessed at baseline and 1736 of them at follow-up. A sub-sample of 525 (27&#x000a0;%) children (7.1&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.7&#x000a0;years; 51.4&#x000a0;% female; 318 in the intervention group, 207 in the control group) was classified as having a migration background. Children were included in the sub-sample if at least one parent was born abroad or the child was spoken to in another language than German in the first 3&#x000a0;years of life. Prior to data collection, parents provided written informed consent to taking part in the study. Children gave their assent.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Measures</title><p>Children&#x02019;s height (cm) and body weight (kg) were assessed by trained staff to ISAK-standards [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] using a stadiometer and calibrated electronic scales (Seca 213 and Seca 826, respectively, Seca Weighing and Measuring Systems, Hamburg, Germany). Children&#x02019;s body mass index (BMI) was calculated (kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and converted to BMI percentiles (BMIPCT) based on German reference data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] in order to classify children into overweight (above the 90th percentile) and obese children (above the 97th percentile).</p><p>Daily screen media use, physical activity behaviours, soft drink consumption, daily fruit and vegetable intake at school as well as parental education levels (determined by mother&#x02019;s and father&#x02019;s highest education) and weight status were assessed using a parental questionnaire. The included questions are validated questions from the German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents (KiGGS), which recently assessed health behaviour in 18,000 German children and adolescents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Since parents confirmed on the consent form that they understand German as a language, no translations were used.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Data Analysis</title><p>Statistics were performed using SPSS Statistics 21 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, US) with a significance level set to &#x003b1;&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05. Descriptive statistics were calculated (mean values and standard deviations for continuous variables; frequencies and percentages for categorical variables). For the detection of group differences at baseline for categorical data, Fisher&#x02019;s exact test was used. For group differences at baseline and follow-up, Chi-Square test was used. For inference statistical analysis, physical activity was dichotomised by reaching the physical activity guideline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] or not, i.e. engagement on most days per week (4&#x000a0;days or more) of at least 60&#x000a0;min of MVPA. Based on recommendations of the American Academy of Paediatrics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], screen media use (TV, PC and game consoles) was dichotomised using a cut-off point of 1&#x000a0;h per day. Soft drink consumption was dichotomised by consuming soft drinks more than once versus less than once per week (median split). The frequency of fruit and vegetable intake at school was assessed as &#x0201c;always&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;often&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;rarely&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;never&#x0201d; and dichotomised in always/often versus rarely/never. Subsequently, logistic regression was used to determine odds ratios (OR) for all health outcomes, controlling for baseline, age, weight status and parental education level. Fruit and vegetable intake at school was additionally analysed using a related-samples marginal homogeneity test, for control and intervention group, respectively.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>There were no significant gender differences or significant differences between the participants in the control group compared to the intervention group with regards to gender, age, height, body weight, BMIPCT, weight status as well as parental education level and weight status.

Nevertheless, screen media use decreased in both groups with a tendency towards a greater reduction of screen media use in the intervention group.

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a low-threshold, teacher-centred health promotion programme over one&#x000a0;year on primary school children with migration background. Key focus areas of this intervention are an increase in daily physical activity, a reduction of screen media use and a more healthy diet, especially a reduction of sugar-sweetened beverages and an increased fruit and vegetable intake.</p><p>In this study, there was no significant intervention effect on children&#x02019;s daily MVPA, which is consistent with other research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Within one&#x000a0;year, children&#x02019;s activity levels decreased in both groups. An age induced decline of physical activity levels has been reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], which is especially pronounced at school entry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. However, after one&#x000a0;year, a trend towards a greater decrease of daily MVPA in the control group could be observed. Nevertheless, this intervention aimed at children changing their activity behaviour during their day to day lives without additional PE lessons, which may not necessarily result in a change of MVPA levels. The main focus of this programme lies on delivering alternatives to spend ones leisure time as well as daily routines more actively. Nevertheless, very similar results could be observed in the overall &#x0201c;Healthy Boat&#x0201d; group (children with and without migration background) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], suggesting that the physical activity aspect of this intervention might be too low-threshold. However, as suggested by Vander Ploeg and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] more positive effects might have been achieved with a longer lasting and more intense intervention.</p><p>Further, the notably low levels of physical activity in this study are reflected in previous research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] showing that especially Turkish children engage in very little physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p><p>But not only low physical activity levels are higher in children with migration background, other risk factors for overweight, especially television watching has been shown to have a particularly high influence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. In this study, no significant intervention effects were seen with regards to screen media use. After one&#x000a0;year, television viewing and computer use decreased slightly in both groups, with a tendency of a greater reduction in the intervention group. Similar effects have been reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] whereas parental involvement was identified as one of the most important aspects for a successful intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. The present programme targeted screen media use solely by offering children active alternatives for sedentary behaviour. Parents were informed about these alternatives as well as about recommendations and age-appropriate time limits for screen media use by letters and family homework, which includes a &#x0201c;screen-free weekend&#x0201d; with the whole family, offering action alternatives for an active weekend. Although all letters to parents were also provided in Turkish and Russian, parents from other countries may have not understood the given information. This would be further supported by the fact that children without migration background of the whole cohort showed a significant decrease in screen media use after one&#x000a0;year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Therefore, this aspect clearly failed to reach children with migration background (and their families). However, it has been suggested that a change in children&#x02019;s behavioural capability precedes an actual behaviour shift [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], which might imply that one&#x000a0;year for a very low-dose intervention as this one is not sufficient to achieve effects on children&#x02019;s screen media use.</p><p>The diet component of this intervention focussed on a reduction of sugar-sweetened beverages and a regular intake of fruit and vegetables. It has been shown that soft drink and juice consumption differs in children with migration background compared to German children, with children with migration background drinking more sugar-sweetened beverages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] and that these differences may modify intervention effects of health promotion programmes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. In accordance with recent research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], no intervention effect was observed with regards to the amount of sugar-sweetened drinks children consumed per week. This may be due to the already low levels of soft drink consumption (one drink per week) or the intervention method since soft drink consumption was addressed to parents using letters only.</p><p>Regular fruit and vegetable consumption however, was communicated using family homework and different hands-on exercises, such as healthy snacks at school, joint healthy breakfast at school and at home, which also required parental involvement. The important role parents play in the development of healthy eating behaviours is indisputable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] and nearly a quarter of children in this study never or rarely ate fruit and vegetables at school. But on the other hand, nearly 40&#x000a0;% of boys and girls took some piece of fresh fruit or vegetable to school every day (data not shown), which is comparable with other German data of 15,865 children (3&#x02013;17&#x000a0;years) on fruit and vegetable intake, showing that 47&#x000a0;% or boys and 55&#x000a0;% of girls eat fruit at least once per day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, significant positive intervention effects could be observed for fruit and vegetable intake at school, even though at baseline, children with migration background in the control group ate fruit and vegetables more regularly than their counterparts in the intervention group. This could possibly be due the fact that one focus of the programme lies on fresh fruit and vegetables as part of a healthy breakfast and snack at school. Parents were informed about the importance of daily fruit and vegetable intake for their children&#x02019;s health as well as being given ideas and little recipes for healthy snacks. At school, healthy breakfasts and snacks have been discussed and prepared together. Further, a recent study in the US showed that getting children to try different kinds of fruits and vegetables can increase their liking and therefore their intake of those [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. This might suggest that the action alternatives this intervention offers may well lead to children getting to know and even like certain foods they have not tried before. Especially children with migration background could benefit from these methods since they might get to know foods which are unusual in their families and culture. Moreover, recipes and pictures of fruit and vegetables are easily understood even without fluency. This would also be supported by the fact that when considering children without migration background of the same intervention no effects with regards to fruit and vegetable consumption could be reported (data not shown).</p><p>However, there are some limitations to be considered when interpreting these results. The subjective assessment methods of all three variables (physical activity, screen media use, diet) and the potential recall bias and social desirability are a limitation of this study. Furthermore, language might for parents with migration background have been a barrier when answering questions about their children and themselves. This might have led to a misinterpretation of some questions. Additionally, changes in health behaviours from interventions targeting children usually occur in the long term [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>], which would mean one&#x000a0;year of intervention&#x02014;especially as very low-threshold one like this one&#x02014;may not have been long enough to detect behaviour changes. Nevertheless, the large sample size and the randomised controlled design with a control group are major strengths of this study. Still, generalisation of these results is not possible and further detailed research in this area is necessary&#x02014;especially in order to understand mode of action and barriers for the here targeted health behaviours.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The evaluation of a very low-threshold teacher-centred health promotion programme has shown the ability to significantly increase fruit and vegetable intake in children with migration background as well as tendencies in other targeted areas, namely more physical activity and reduced screen media use. Although some effects are small, the intervention&#x02014;especially its action alternatives and parental involvement&#x02014;seems to reach children with migration background and their parents. It is especially important to look at this group since it has been shown that children with migration background differ from those without migration background in a number of health-related behaviours such as physical activity, diet and drinking habits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] as well as being of higher risk of overweight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. So far only few prevention or health&#x000a0;promotion programmes exist for these populations which are generally less effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>] and because most health related behaviours are hard to change within the space of one&#x000a0;year, longer and more intense interventions are necessary. However, healthcare professionals should be aware of the low levels of physical activity and increased consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages among children with migration background. Further studies on why some aspects of this intervention only showed effects in children without migration background are required in order to modify those. Additionally, more research on the level of parental involvement and their barriers, particularly for parents from a migration background, would be of interest to be able to better tailor health promotion programmes for this group and to avoid a potential broadening of health inequalities.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>New Contribution to the Literature</title><p>Children with migration background appear to be at higher risk of developing overweight and obesity; therefore, early and effective prevention programmes are necessary in order to avoid a possible expansion of health inequalities.</p><p>This theory-based, teacher-centred intervention focussed on increased physical activity and fruit and vegetable intake as well as decreased screen media use and soft drink.</p><p>Findings show that only 5&#x000a0;% of children with migration background reached the recommended 60&#x000a0;min of moderate to vigorous physical activity on 7&#x000a0;days per week.
