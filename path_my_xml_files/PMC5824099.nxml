In Canada, the rural population is older and is disproportionally aging relative to the urban population [<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The incidence of dementia increases with age, and formal dementia services are the least accessible in rural and remote communities where the proportion of older adults is the greatest [<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Long travel distances and transportation difficulties further limit accessibility [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Telemedicine, or telehealth, is the remote delivery of health care services, where distance is a critical factor, by means of information and communications technology [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Expanding telehealth services has been suggested to reduce disparities in urban and rural health care [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Interventions to support the function of older adults with cognitive concerns, including dementia, are needed, and it is essential that these interventions are accessible to all families. Cognitive rehabilitation is a promising but understudied nonpharmacological individualized treatment that has been shown to help individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), early stage dementia due to Alzheimer disease (AD), and vascular dementia set [<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and attain personally important functional goals [<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>-<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. This study investigated the feasibility and acceptability of delivering cognitive rehabilitation to individuals with subjective cognitive impairment (SCI), MCI, and early stage dementia using telehealth videoconferencing.</p></sec><sec><title>Telemedicine and Dementia</title><p>Research on telemedicine and dementia has primarily focused on diagnosis (eg, [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]), clinical consultation, follow-up appointments [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and support for family caregivers [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>-<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In comparison, relatively little work has studied interventions for individuals diagnosed with dementia, although research in this area has begun to emerge. For example, Dal Bello-Haas et al [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] demonstrated that videoconferencing is a feasible method to deliver an exercise intervention for rural individuals with dementia due to AD. These examples of successfully delivering remote interventions for individuals with dementia suggest that remote cognitive rehabilitation could be feasible.</p></sec><sec><title>Telerehabilitation</title><p>Telerehabilitation is &#x0201c;the set of instruments and protocols aimed at providing rehabilitation at a distance&#x0201d; [<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Telerehabilitation has been used to provide a range of interventions to individuals diagnosed with a number of different disorders. For example, telerehabilitation has been used to treat stroke [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], spinal cord injury [<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], traumatic brain injury [<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], multiple sclerosis [<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], and cognitive impairment following intensive care [<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Diverse use of telehealth includes delivering diagnostic assessments, caregiver support groups, individual and group psychotherapy [<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], home exercise programs, clinical consultations, and cognitive rehabilitation using information and communications technology [<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Cognitive Rehabilitation for Dementia</title><p>Clare and colleagues have developed a goal-focused approach to cognitive rehabilitation for individuals with early stage dementia due to AD, or mixed AD, and vascular dementia [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In this approach, cognitive rehabilitation begins with an assessment, which is followed by collaborative goal setting [<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Typically, functional goals related to everyday memory problems, practical skills, and activities and concentration are set, and improved function in these areas has been reported in multiple studies (eg, [<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>-<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]). Generally, these collaborative goals are addressed in weekly 1-hour sessions using empirically supported techniques such as spaced retrieval, cuing and fading, errorless learning, and external memory aids [<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Briefly, errorless learning involves training without allowing trial-and-error guessing; cues and supports are given to maximize the probability of guessing the correct response instead [<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Numerous methods facilitate errorless learning, which includes cuing, gradual fading of cues, and spaced retrieval where recollection occurs over increasing time intervals [<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Although promising, research evaluating cognitive rehabilitation for individuals with early stage dementia is still emerging [<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Remotely-Delivered Cognitive Rehabilitation</title><p>The majority of literature on remotely-delivered cognitive rehabilitation focuses on interventions with individuals who have a traumatic brain injury (TBI). Early research suggests that remotely-delivered rehabilitation for individuals who have sustained TBI is feasible (eg, [<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]). For example, Tam and colleagues [<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] reported a series of 3 case studies where individuals with TBI participated in cognitive rehabilitation using customized software. This software combined videoconferencing with screen-sharing, and participants completed computer-based activities that targeted word recognition, semantic memory (ie, memory for factual knowledge), and prospective memory (ie, memory to perform something in the future). In other work, Bergquist and colleagues [<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] opted to use technology to remotely teach participants who had had a severe TBI to use a calendar as a compensatory memory strategy. They adapted Sohlberg and Mateer&#x02019;s [<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] calendar training procedure to an instant messenger format and also taught participants to use a personal diary [<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Both interventions led to increased use of compensatory strategies and improved mood [<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Finally, in an approach that is more similar to the type of cognitive rehabilitation reported here, Bourgeois and colleagues [<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] had participants with chronic TBI identify three everyday memory problems (ie, forgetting appointments, forgetting day planner at home, and losing items), and they provided either an errorless learning approach, spaced retrieval, or memory strategy instructions over the telephone. Individuals in the spaced retrieval group made greater gains in their target goals than those given strategy instructions, and both groups improved their everyday memory functioning. These studies suggest that traditional, in-person cognitive rehabilitation strategies can be delivered by videoconferencing, instant messaging, or telephone.</p><p>Remotely-delivered cognitive rehabilitation has also been demonstrated for persons with dementia. Joltin et al [<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] used the telephone to train spaced retrieval, a memory intervention, to help 3 women previously diagnosed with dementia recall target information. The goals addressed using spaced retrieval were set in collaboration with family caregivers, staff at the assisted living facility, and the individual diagnosed with dementia [<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Two participants set the goal to recall what time to take their medications, and one participant set the goals to recall her grandson&#x02019;s names, her room number, and the year [<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The first participant (Mini-Mental State Exam, MMSE=17) did not always answer the telephone when the researchers called to provide spaced retrieval training and after 4 sessions, she was still unable to recall the times to take her medication for longer than 2 min [<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The second participant (MMSE=17) was able to pick up a prompt card listing the times she needed to take her medications across a 5-min interval at the conclusion of the intervention. The third participant (MMSE=13) achieved all three of her goals (grandchildren&#x02019;s names, room number, and year) and was able to recall the target information across 3 sessions [<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The authors concluded that it is feasible to modify spaced retrieval for remote delivery. To date, no research has explored videoconferencing for remote delivery of cognitive rehabilitation.</p></sec><sec><title>Objectives</title><p>Telerehabilitation is a developing field with the promise of increasing the accessibility of specialized interventions such as cognitive rehabilitation. To date, remotely-delivered cognitive rehabilitation for persons with dementia has not been systematically studied. Interventions that are included in cognitive rehabilitation, such as spaced retrieval, have been applied in a telerehabilitation format, suggesting that this may be an acceptable and feasible approach to increasing the accessibility of cognitive rehabilitation for dementia for persons residing in rural and remote areas. The purpose of this study was to investigate the acceptability and feasibility of delivering cognitive rehabilitation to individuals diagnosed with dementia due to AD using telehealth videoconferencing.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Experimental Design</title><p>This small-scale randomized control trial used a combined single-case and between-subjects design. Random assignment to in-person versus videoconferencing conditions occurred by random number generator. Random assignment to condition occurred before recruitment (conditions were determined before the study commenced and hidden in envelopes) and was not stratified by diagnosis or by rehabilitation goal. Regardless of randomized condition, all participants received an in-person initial assessment. At the initial in-person assessment participants selected at least two goals for cognitive rehabilitation. The features of a between-subjects design were combined with the features of a multiple-baseline design. Multiple baselines were measured within-subjects, and treatment modalities were compared across participants. After 3 weeks of baseline assessment, Goal 1 was targeted and baseline assessment for Goal 2 continued. After 3 weeks of Goal 1 intervention, Goal 2 was targeted. In this way, both the in-person and telehealth groups were observed repeatedly during the baseline and treatment phases. The repeated observations over the baseline and treatment phases meet the criteria for a multiple-baseline design (across groups) [<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In single-case experimental design guidelines, three is the minimum number of data points required to establish a baseline, and the minimum number of data points needed in each phase [<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Participants</title><p>The University of Saskatchewan Behavioural Ethics Review Board provided ethical approval. Participants were recruited through community-based organizations and a hospital-based geriatric assessment program. Initially, the researchers hoped to recruit participants solely from clinical settings, but low enrollment led us to expand the recruitment strategy and inclusion criteria. With the expanded criteria, individuals with SCI and no diagnosis, MCI, early stage dementia due to AD, or mixed AD and vascular dementia, were all invited to contact us if they were interested in participating in the study. Diagnosis was self-reported (ie, participants reported that they had received a diagnosis of dementia due to AD from their neurologist, reported no diagnosis), but all self-reported diagnoses were consistent with the clinical interview, neuropsychological tests, and questionnaires administered in the assessment for the study. Prior to enrolling in the study, participants completed a brief clinical interview where cognitive rehabilitation was reviewed, informed consent was obtained (from participant and caregiver wherever appropriate), and a Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE; [<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]) was administered. All individuals were encouraged to participate with a family member or friend, but this was not mandatory.</p></sec><sec><title>Measures</title><p>Two sets of measures were used in this study: pre-post measures and weekly measures. A set of measures was administered in-person to all participants before and after the intervention. Second, weekly observational measures and measures of goal performance and satisfaction were collected using the medium of in-person versus telehealth as per the random assignment. The measures were selected to be similar to those used by Clare and colleagues in their 2010 randomized control trial [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><sec><title>In-Person Initial Assessment and Posttreatment Measures</title><p>All participants completed neuropsychological testing and self-report measures of mood, anxiety, and quality of life.

Measurement occurred either in-person or through telehealth, depending on the experimental condition. Following 3 weeks of baseline measurement, each participant&#x02019;s first goal was addressed in the subsequent cognitive rehabilitation sessions.

Each participant&#x02019;s first goal(s) were addressed in cognitive rehabilitation on the fourth week, following the baseline phase. A new goal, or set of goals, was introduced every 3 weeks (ie, in CR 4, and in CR 7).</p><p>For all participants, the treatment phase was designed to take place over 8 weeks. This decision was based on the procedure reported in Clare and colleagues [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Participants attended the Video Therapy Analysis Lab on the University of Saskatchewan campus once a week for a 1-hour session. The setting was the same regardless of in-person versus telehealth condition, but for the telehealth condition, the therapist was not in the same room and videoconferencing was used.</p></sec><sec><title>Research Journal</title><p>RLB kept a research journal during this study beginning in the recruitment phase.

In single-case research visual inspection is the primary method of data evaluation and, although statistical methods for evaluating single case data are increasingly available, they are not widely used [<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Visual inspection is based on exploration of changes in the magnitude of the data and changes in the data across phases (eg, from the baseline to the intervention phases). There are two characteristics of single-case data related to magnitude: changes in means across phases and changes in level across phases [<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. A change in means refers to a change in the average of a measure in one phase to another. A change in level refers to a shift, jump, or discontinuity in the data from the end of one phase to the beginning of another. There are also two characteristics related to rate of change: changes in trend and latency. A change in trend is a change in the slope of the data from one phase to the next. A change in latency refers to the period of time that elapses from the time the phase changes (ie, the onset of the intervention) until there is a change in the data.</p><p>Visual inspection is a reliable method of data evaluation when the results are strong, and changes from one phase to the next are clear [<xref rid="ref60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Therefore, visual inspection encourages researchers to study interventions that have potent effects that are readily observable because weak results are generally not visible under visual inspection [<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The insensitivity of visual inspection to weak results is often considered to be a strength of this approach rather than a limitation. For example, looking for consistent results that can be easily seen also minimizes the chances of making a Type I error (concluding that the intervention has an effect when the results are because of chance; [<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]). In this multiple-baseline study, the researchers were interested in determining whether there was a significant change in performance from the baseline to intervention phase. Changes in level and trend were both of interest.</p></sec><sec><title>Evaluation of Qualitative Data Provided in the Research Journal</title><p>The journal documenting the experience of adapting cognitive rehabilitation to telehealth videoconferencing was analyzed thematically. Journal entries were organized into a descriptive summary based on the method of qualitative description detailed in Sandelowski [<xref rid="ref61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>,<xref rid="ref62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>], and the technique of thematic analysis was as described by Braun and Clark [<xref rid="ref63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. The thematic analysis took a theoretical approach (as opposed to an inductive approach) insofar as the researchers specifically coded responses related to ways in which the videoconferencing-delivered intervention needed to be modified. This method of qualitative description is a low inference qualitative methodology, and it is intended to generate a comprehensive summary of an event in everyday terms [<xref rid="ref61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>].</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Participants</title><p>Eight individuals were recruited to participate in this study, participants were immediately randomly assigned to in-person versus telehealth, and the initial assessment was completed in-person. Two discontinued the study following the initial assessment, and these two happened to be randomly assigned to the telehealth condition. In one case, the family member support person reported that she and the participant did not have time to participate. In the other case, the family member support person reported that initial assessment had been distressing for the participant, and following a family discussion it had been decided that participating in the study was likely to be more distressing than helpful.

Ms A&#x02019;s goal was to improve her recollection of personally significant life events. A memory book was compiled by Ms A and her husband, and this book was trained using spaced retrieval and fading and cuing in two sets of 10 memory book pages (ie, 2 sets of 10 pages each). Baseline data from all measures was collected. Set 1 was studied in sessions CR 1, 2, and 3 (indicated by the first vertical line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure1">Figure 1</xref>). Sets 1 and 2 were both studied in sessions 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. Visual inspection of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure1">Figure 1</xref> suggests Ms A&#x02019;s (COPM patient) COPM scores were relatively stable across the cognitive rehabilitation, but her husband&#x02019;s scores increased with the number of intervention sessions. Moreover, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure1">Figure 1</xref> demonstrates support for spaced retrieval: recall of both memory book sets was at floor during the baseline, and only recall set 1 improved with the initiation of spaced retrieval (first vertical line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure1">Figure 1</xref>) and the untrained set 2 remained at baseline, only improving after initiation of training (second vertical line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>Mr B set two goals for cognitive rehabilitation. First, he wanted to keep better track of his daily notes and musings, which were disorganized. Second, he wanted to reduce feelings of frustration when challenged during a task to feel more engaged in his daily activities (eg, attending club meetings, taking his dog for a walk). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure2">Figure 2</xref> shows a moderately stable baseline for Goal 1 and robustly stable initial baseline for Goal 2 as measured by the COPM. At the first intervention session (first vertical line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure2">Figure 2</xref>), a consolidated notebook strategy was introduced to target Goal 1, and COPM scores for both goals show a change in level and trend. The change in level is maintained throughout the remainder of the sessions. Although Goal 2 was not explicitly targeted until session CR 4 (the second vertical line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure2">Figure 2</xref>) when relaxation techniques and cues were introduced, Goal 2 scores nevertheless appeared to have improved with the intervention targeting Goal 1. Introducing the organizational strategy designed to target Goal 1 had a greater impact on Goal 2 scores than the relaxation exercises designed to address Goal 2. If Mr B&#x02019;s frustration is conceptualized as being a reaction to cognitive lapses that were not mitigated by his previously disorganized memory aide strategy, this &#x0201c;bleeding&#x0201d; of the organizational intervention from one goal to another goal is expected.</p><p>Ms E set two goals for cognitive rehabilitation. Following 3 baseline sessions (B1, 2, and 3) the researchers focused on her goal to improve her recall of bridge (a card game) strategies, which she enjoyed studying. This was addressed using the Preview Question Read State Test [<xref rid="ref67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>] strategy, a hierarchical strategy for organizing texts, which was trained using spaced retrieval. Ms E also began to use an external aid (note taking) when reading her bridge books. Visual inspection of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure3">Figure 3</xref> shows some variability in the baseline, but consistent and sustained improvement one session after initiation of the intervention aimed at this goal (first vertical line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure3">Figure 3</xref>). The baseline sessions for goal 2, keeping track of daily activities, also show variability, but COPM scores clearly increase after this goal was the focus of cognitive rehabilitation (second vertical line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><fig id="figure3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) scores for participant E who attended cognitive rehabilitation sessions through in-person.

Next the researchers targeted her sleep (CR 4, 5, and 6; second vertical line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure4">Figure 4</xref>) using strategies from cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTi), and finally her ability to recall what she read (CR 7, 8; third vertical line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure4">Figure 4</xref>) using external aids and the Preview Question Read State Test [<xref rid="ref67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>] strategy. Visual inspection of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure3">Figure 3</xref> suggests name recall and reading improved, with sleep showing variability through its baseline sessions (B1-3, CR 1-3) and training sessions. Reading performance improved starting at CR 3 suggesting treatment carry over from training naming strategies, which makes sense considering that the strategies for learning and remembering names (ie, face-name associations) require one to slow down, to focus on the information that is being presented, and to work to encode it in a more rich, elaborative manner.</p><p>Ms D reported subjective cognitive impairment and set five goals, which were addressed in three training sets (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>). Cognitive rehabilitation was ended after 7 sessions because of a summer vacation for Ms D. Goal set 1 focused on keeping track of day-to-day events, and what to bring to club meetings was addressed using external aids. Ms D was using a number of different systems (cellphone, notebook, day timer), which were consolidated. Visual inspection of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure5">Figure 5</xref> suggests that despite some variation in the baseline sessions (B1, 2, and 3), performance on Goal 1 improved by 3 points on the COPM from the highest baseline rating to the highest intervention rating. This increase begins following the first vertical line and is maintained over the course of the remaining sessions. Similarly, performance on Goal set 2, which was concentration and driving, improved when cognitive rehabilitation targeted this goal starting in CR 4 (second vertical line). Goal 3, reading, was targeted only in CR 7 using the Preview Question Read State Test [<xref rid="ref67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>] strategy, but performance improved starting in CR 1 and 2, which suggests that the specific training provided during cognitive rehabilitation in CR 7 did not cause the improvements shown in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure5">Figure 5</xref>. Rather, the strategies started in CR 1 (external aids) appeared to have supported her goal to recall what she had read. These data suggest that Ms D tended to multitask, and moved quickly from one partially finished task to the next. Using external aids may have reduced the load on her working memory, which would allow her to devote more of her cognitive resources to reading when she picked up a book or newspaper.</p><p>Ms F only had one goal for cognitive rehabilitation: she described herself as an avid reader and reported struggling to recall the plot of a novel while reading. Her goal was to be able to keep track of significant characters and their relationships when reading, which was addressed using the Preview Question Read State Test [<xref rid="ref67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>] strategy taught through spaced retrieval. This was also combined with external aids including using sticky notes in her books to mark important passages and writing down notes about major characters which she could refer back to. Keeping track of appointments was rated weekly using the COPM as a comparison goal, and served as the second baseline but was never trained. Visual inspection of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure6">Figure 6</xref> suggests little variability in this comparison measure, which was, unfortunately likely at ceiling even during the baseline and was therefore never trained. Regarding Ms F&#x02019;s goal, the baseline phase is stable and substantial improvement in performance is present beginning with cognitive rehabilitation in CR 1 (vertical line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure6">Figure 6</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Secondary Outcomes</title><p>The pretreatment and posttreatment scores for the secondary outcome measures are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>.

She demonstrated an increase (from 0 to 3) on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) depression subscale that was greater than the MCID, but her score remained well below cut-off for clinical depression. Although she reported improved quality of life, her husband reported decreased quality of life over the 12 weeks.

The study also adds to the growing body of literature that suggests goal-oriented cognitive rehabilitation delivered in-person is a promising nonpharmacological intervention for older adults with SCI, MCI, and early stage dementia due to AD. For participants who completed the initial assessment and baseline sessions, participation was excellent with all in the in-person group completing 8 out of 8 sessions. Although two in the telehealth group completed fewer than 8 sessions, one terminated because of the goal having been attained and the other terminated because of scheduling conflict with vacation. Both groups demonstrated high completion rates, however the lower rate of session completion for the telehealth group may suggest that telehealth-delivered treatment is less acceptable to participants or something about this modality of treatment (such as the virtual nature of the interpersonal connection, or added challenge of describing steps and materials verbally rather than physically interacting or handing something in to be read) delivery made completion of the sessions less motivating. Despite this caveat, the high completion rates over 12 weeks (3 baseline and 8 intervention sessions) suggest participating through either delivery modality was acceptable to participants. The themes from the research journal also support this conclusion; although some participants assigned to telehealth were initially apprehensive or even disappointed to be assigned to the telehealth condition, as sessions progressed the theme &#x0201c;different but not worse&#x0201d; as a description of videoconferencing-delivered sessions emerged from the research journal entries. These qualitative data revealing apprehension about telehealth could have interacted with the decision to withdraw made by the 2 participants initially assigned to telehealth, but who withdrew after the initial assessment and before the intervention. In order of theme of &#x0201c;different but not worse&#x0201d; to be created, an individual needed to first interact through telefhealth to discover that expectancies regarding apprehension of technology were unfounded.</p><p>Importantly, the results suggest participants&#x02019; goal performance improved across both treatment delivery modalities. Of the 15 goals set in this study, performance on only two goals (sleep set by Participant C, and concentration set by Participant D) did not improve by 2 or more points on the COPM. Participants C and D were both assigned to the telehealth group, so this raises the possibility that telehealth may reduce the efficacy of cognitive rehabilitation for older adults with SCI. It may also be the case that these goals are less amenable to cognitive rehabilitation. Improved sleep, in particular, is not a typical goal for cognitive rehabilitation, however, improving sleep and managing daytime sleepiness were both reported as goals set in Clare and colleagues&#x02019; [<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] study (goal attainment was not reported goal by goal). In the sleep intervention literature more generally, CBTi is an effective treatment, demonstrates efficacy that is similar to pharmacological interventions with better long-term outcomes, and has been recommended as a standard treatment for insomnia [<xref rid="ref68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Importantly, a full course of CBTi, which is typically between 6 and 8 sessions was not delivered here (Ms C participated in 5 sessions that focused on her goal to improve her sleep). Overall, the results of this study suggest that it is worthwhile to pursue adapting cognitive rehabilitation to telehealth videoconferencing. This is consistent with previous research that has explored remotely-delivered cognitive rehabilitation (ie, [<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]) as well as remotely-delivered psychotherapy (ie, [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]).</p><p>The importance of establishing a strong therapeutic relationship was a major theme that emerged from the research journal. This aspect of cognitive rehabilitation has perhaps not been emphasized enough in the literature, and clinicians who are providing the intervention (whether or not they have been trained as psychotherapists) may benefit from attending to the research on the common factors of psychotherapy (see [<xref rid="ref69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>] for a recent summary of the common factors literature based on meta-analyses). This is not to suggest that the therapeutic relationship has been ignored in the cognitive rehabilitation literature, but to highlight the importance of not emphasizing technique (ie, errorless learning and spaced retrieval) at the expense of developing an alliance. One imagines that telehealth videoconferencing could impact developing an alliance, however, this was not noted in the research journal and psychotherapy noninferiority trials (ie, [<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]), and other videoconferenced work [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] detail how the therapeutic relation can be established and maintained remotely. Future researchers might consider adding a formal measure of alliance to their protocols.</p></sec><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>In carrying out this study, the researchers learned a number of things that may be helpful for future researchers. First, the researchers were surprised by how challenging it was to recruit research participants with MCI or early-stage AD. Those recruited and retained in the study were highly motivated and engaged, which is a self-selection bias. This recruitment challenge and the way in which participants were randomly assigned to the in-person or telehealth videoconferencing limits the conclusion the researchers can draw about delivering cognitive rehabilitation through videoconferencing to individuals with MCI or dementia due to AD (the 3 telehealth participants were individuals with subjective memory impairment). The researchers were also surprised to find that the majority of the participants in this study opted to participate without a support person. This was either because no support person was available (Ms C), because a support person was not interested in participating (Mr B and Ms E), or because it was decided that the support person was not needed (Ms D and Ms F). Only Ms A&#x02019;s husband accompanied her to every session. This is noteworthy because Ms A was the only participant with a diagnosis of dementia due to AD. Previous research (ie, [<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]) has recommended that a support person always be included in the intervention. The results of this study suggest that for individuals with SCI a support person is not necessary, but for individuals with dementia due to AD or MCI, the researchers continue to recommend a support person.</p><p>The researchers also came to reconsider the experimental design. The multiple baseline design was chosen to be able to infer that any improvements in COPM scores were due to cognitive rehabilitation interventions rather than common therapeutic factors such as establishing a positive relationship with the researcher delivering the treatment. As the study progressed, it became apparent that skills being taught for one goal carried over to other goals, and in some cases (Participant D in particular), participants spoke explicitly about generalizing strategies from a goal that was being trained to a goal that was not being trained. Of course, this is excellent for that individual, but it does limit the usefulness of within-person multiple baselines for cognitive rehabilitation. Therefore, this type of experimental design is not recommended, at least not for similar goals. Furthermore, in this study the researchers chose to rely on visual inspection to examine these data. This has the advantage of highlighting strong effects, which are more likely to be functionally relevant. The limitation of this approach is that subtle trends such as serial dependency are not readily observable using visual inspection, visual inspection is unreliable when effects are not large, and for these reasons, statistical methods of analyzing single-case data have been increasingly studied and used [<xref rid="ref60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The findings presented in this study support developing goal-oriented cognitive rehabilitation delivered both in-person and expanding the accessibility of this intervention by adapting it to videoconferencing. Further research is needed to replicate the results presented here. Additionally, this data does not fully explore the adaptation of cognitive rehabilitation to videoconferencing for individuals with cognitive impairments consistent with MCI or dementia due to AD. Given the increasing prevalence of cognitive impairment in late life in both urban and rural areas, interventions aimed at supporting the personally relevant functional goals of these individuals are clearly needed.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>RLB was supported by a doctoral award from the Alzheimer Society of Canada.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>Conflicts of Interest: None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><app-group><app id="app1"><title>Multimedia Appendix 1</title><p>CONSORT&#x02010;EHEALTH checklist (V 1.6.1).</p><fig id="d35e2315" position="anchor"><media xlink:href="resprot_v7i2e43_app1.pdf"/></fig></app></app-group><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term id="abb1">AD</term><def><p>Alzheimer disease</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="abb2">ADLs-Bristol</term><def><p>Bristol Activities of Daily Living Scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="abb3">CBTi</term><def><p>cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="abb4">CG</term><def><p>caregiver</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="abb5">COPM</term><def><p>Canadian Occupational Performance Measure 4th Edition</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="abb6">D-KEFS</term><def><p>Delis Kaplan Executive Function System</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="abb7">HADS</term><def><p>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="abb8">MCI</term><def><p>mild cognitive impairment</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="abb9">MCID</term><def><p>minimum clinically important differences</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="abb10">MMSE</term><def><p>Mini-Mental State Exam</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="abb12">QoL-AD</term><def><p>Quality of Life in Alzheimer Disease</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="abb13">RBMT-III</term><def><p>Rivermead Behavioral Memory Test III</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="abb14">RCI</term><def><p>reliable change indices</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="abb15">SCI</term><def><p>subjective cognitive impairment</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="abb16">SED</term><def><p>standard error of the difference</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="abb17">SEM</term><def><p>standard error of measurement</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="abb18">TBI</term><def><p>traumatic brain injury</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="abb19">TEA</term><def><p>Test of Everyday Attention</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="abb20">WHOQOL-BREF</term><def><p>World Health Organization Quality of Life Assessment, short version</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="abb21">ZBI</term><def><p>Zarit Burden Inventory</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>World Health Organization</collab></person-group><source>Telemedicine: Opportunities and developments in Member States: report on the second global survey on eHealth 2009</source><year>2010</year><publisher-loc>Geneva</publisher-loc><publisher-name>WHO Press</publisher-name></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="webpage"><source>Statistics Canada</source><year>2010</year><date-in-citation>2017-10-03</date-in-citation><comment>Seniors
