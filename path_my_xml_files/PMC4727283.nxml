The addition of large quantities of salt to foods is incompatible with Australian Dietary Guidelines and the reformulation of processed foods to have less salt is a focus of non-governmental organisations (NGOs). There is evidence that advocacy can influence corporate behaviour but there are few data to define the effects of NGOs working in the food space. The aim of this study is to quantify the effects of advocacy delivered by a local NGO on the salt content of food products produced or marketed by companies in Australia.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p id="Par2">This is a cluster-randomised controlled trial that will be done in Australia from 2013 to 2015 which includes 45 food companies. The 23 companies in the control group will receive no specific intervention whilst the 22 companies in the intervention group will receive an advocacy program based upon an established theory of change model. The primary outcome will be the mean change in sodium content (mg/100&#x000a0;g) of processed foods produced or marketed by intervention compared to control companies assessed at 24&#x000a0;months. Interim outcomes (statements of support, published nutrition policies, level of engagement, knowledge and use of technology to reduce salt, salt reduction plans, and support for national initiatives) will also be assessed and a qualitative evaluation will provide more detailed insight.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">This novel study will provide robust randomised evidence about the effects of advocacy on food company behaviour and the quality of the processed food supply. A finding of improved food company behaviour will highlight the potential for greater investment in advocacy whilst the opposite result will reinforce the importance of government-led initiatives for the improvement of the food supply.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par4">ClinicalTrials.gov: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/home">NCT02373423</ext-link>. 26/02/2015</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12889-016-2743-4) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Advocacy</kwd><kwd>Food companies</kwd><kwd>Salt reduction</kwd><kwd>Randomised trial</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par10">The food system, which includes the actors, institutions and processes that influence the way in which food products are produced, processed and distributed to consumers, is dynamic and complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Advances in food processing, defined as the use of a &#x0201c;series of mechanical or chemical operations to change or preserve food&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], have enabled the launch and renovation of many food products targeted to meet consumer demand for safe, palatable, and convenient food. Likewise, distribution channels and retail operations have evolved to ensure processed foods are readily available to purchase. Decisions about the nutritional quality of processed foods and the numbers of foods marketed are taken primarily by food companies to create and respond to consumer demand and are potent factors shaping the food supply, and thereby food choice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].

The trial intervention program comprises of a series of advocacy actions based upon an established theory of change model (COM-B). The model defines three aspects of behaviour (capability, opportunity, and motivation) and maps these to intervention functions targeted to change one or more aspects of behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Drawing on organisational behavioural theory we have adapted the original definitions of capability, opportunity, and motivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] to an organisational context. Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> depicts our adaption of the COM-B model to target organisational behavioural dimensions with a series of advocacy interventions designed to deliver a healthier processed food supply. The intervention program logic model (See Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) illustrates the overall design of the program and the connections between the theory of change model and the intended advocacy outcomes. A series of inputs have been identified indicating the resources and competencies required for the program. These inputs enable nine intervention functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] which are akin to &#x02018;tools&#x02019; or&#x02019;methods&#x02019; (training, coercion, incentivisation, persuasion, education, restriction, environmental restructuring, modelling) and these in turn enable the advocacy actions. The advocacy actions listed are those commonly used in advocacy programs of diverse types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Collectively, the resources, intervention function, and advocacy actions represent the advocacy output, or, the &#x02018;what we will do&#x02019; aspects of the program. Downstream from the advocacy outputs are the planned advocacy outcomes divided into interim (0&#x02013;18 months) and long-term (18&#x000a0;months onward) outcomes. The interim outcomes are grouped by the change in organisational behaviour being targeted (opportunity, motivation, capability) with an advocacy action. During the intervention a feedback loop will enable monitoring of the intervention and interim data will be used to inform future actions. Finally, each advocacy action is targeted towards individuals in food companies who are considered to be influential representatives within their organisation, and in a position to favorably modify the national corporate agenda in their capacity as an &#x02018;internal advocate&#x02019; of salt reduction.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Change model: the original behavioural model by Michie et al.

Baseline data for eligible food companies were collected and companies classified into three strata based on company ownership, size of company and industry sector. 18 blocks were created with companies in each block randomised in a 1:1 ratio to intervention or control. Randomisation was performed in December 2012 by an independent statistician using a random number function in SAS (Version 9.3).

The survey comprises a structured questionnaire focusing on the business context, company policies and practices related to product innovation and nutrition. The questionnaire is accompanied by an in-depth interview designed to seek a richer understanding of the Australian political and economic environment, stakeholder influence, and the development of company strategy in relation to producing and marketing healthier processed foods, an important component of which are company research and development (R&#x00026;D) plans, and provides an opportunity to clarify queries the participants have about the survey questionnaire. The in-depth interviews done after baseline will provide an opportunity to probe for examples of NGO influence as a direct result of implementation of the advocacy program. The data collected will enable the full assessment of each aspect of the advocacy program depicted in the logic model. Interviews are sought with the most senior individual able to provide the requisite knowledge as nominated by the CEO or equivalent. The multiple roles of managers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] suggest this approach will provide the breadth of data sought and that these data are likely to be representative of a food company&#x02019;s approach to nutrition. In addition, relevant information available from public sources will be systematically collected and compiled for all companies. For example, data about engagement with other initiatives designed to improve the healthiness of processed foods, such as national and international affiliations, trade association-led healthy eating schemes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], the Australian Food and Health Dialogue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>], the National Heart Foundation Tick [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>], and the Australian Division of World Action on Salt and Health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Knowledge about engagement with other campaigns to improve the healthiness of products is particularly important since it is likely to be influential in creating a more favourable climate for the advocacy work done for this project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].

For this project baseline data were collected between September and December 2013 and there will be annual collection of the data 12 and 24&#x000a0;months later. Data are obtained directly by taking a set of photographs of each product using a smartphone app designed to collect photos of packaged food items. One of the photographs includes the mandatory Nutrition Information Panel (NIP) and is available for a sample of about 20,000 Australian packaged food products each year. The included products are those on the shelves of the same four supermarkets (comprising a Coles, Woolworths, ALDI and IGA outlet) in Sydney, Australia. Where the same product is for sale in more than one supermarket it is recorded only once and likewise, where the same product is presented in different pack sizes, only one entry is recorded.

Qualitative data will be used to identify and understand the impact of advocacy actions on food company behaviour and the potential impact of influences other than advocacy will be taken into account to identify alternative hypotheses as to why an advocacy outcome may have arisen. For example events in the macro environment such as a policy change in food labelling. There will be a summary for each advocacy action, which will include the relevance of the theory of change to the outcome, an assessment of the quality of the implementation (i.e. frequency and intensity of the intervention, appropriateness of targeting and impact on output indicator) and lessons learned to inform the subsequent advocacy actions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. The interim qualitative assessments are expected to yield information on the organisational opportunity, motivation and capability of food companies to reduce salt across the product portfolio and a richer understanding of the role of advocacy actions in effecting such a change.</p><p id="Par39">The data from the in-depth interviews are anticipated to inform the assessment of the advocacy program. Interview data will be open-coded and organised using NVivo software (version 10; QSR International, Doncaster, Victoria, Australia).

There were 45 food companies selected for the study and between them they supplied 80&#x000a0;% of the products in the 2011 database with their products encompassing all the major product food groups for sale in Australian supermarkets. All included companies were invited to participate in the baseline survey conducted between December 2013 and April 2014. These data have informed the design of the advocacy program that is currently being implemented. Baseline nutritional data (2013) were collected in the 4th quarter of 2013. Final evaluation of the primary outcome using 2015 nutritional data will occur in 2016 and an interim evaluation will be conducted at the end of 2015.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par41">This project will use a robust clustered randomised design to provide high quality evidence about the potential for an advocacy program to influence corporate behaviour and the healthiness of the processed food supply in Australia. With evidence of this type very limited, it is anticipated that the study findings will receive significant interest and widespread dissemination. A finding of improved company behaviour will provide new impetus for the many advocacy groups working in this space and the opposite result will serve to highlight the importance of government action for the enactment of change to the processed food supply. Furthermore, while the focus of this work is on the processed food supply, the novel experimental approach taken here will likely engender interest across a broader range of public health activities where there is a desire to know more about the effectiveness of advocacy.</p><p id="Par42">The advocacy program design incorporates an adapted theory of change and intervention functions targeting organisational behaviour. Our conceptualisation of COM-B draws on the organisational behavioural literature as we considered it applicable to food companies seeking to produce and market healthier processed foods in Australia. As such, <italic>organisational capability</italic> is viewed as the technical, managerial, and process competencies necessary to improve the nutritional profile of processed foods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. In the same way, <italic>organisational opportunity</italic> comprises the physical supply and demand considerations where &#x02018;supply&#x02019; is a set of up-stream activities (procurement and the availability and access to less salty ingredients) and &#x02018;demand&#x02019; a set of down-stream activities (distribution channels, consumer preferences). Organisational opportunity also includes social opportunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] defined as the opportunity to contribute to the prevailing discourse and determined by organisational culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>] (communications strategy, and framing). Lastly, <italic>organisational motivation</italic> is considered to be the mix of planned and unplanned events prompting an organisation to choose certain behaviours which may be planned positions on nutrition integral to the company culture or emergent positions responding to a threat to reputation or other issues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].</p><p id="Par43">Key features of the approaches to advocacy identified and applied in program development were the framing of the issue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>], the use of surveillance, the reporting of market-based activities, and holding companies to account &#x02013; both praising good practice and identifying when companies fail to achieve benchmarks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The study design will help to identify under what circumstances corporate actions to improve the food supply can be encouraged and identify the windows of opportunity for advocacy.</p><p id="Par44">A key challenge in working with food companies is the risk of non-participation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>] and thereby the absence of opportunity to influence. Lack of trust and commercial sensitivities (for example disclosure of R&#x00026;D plans) can be key barriers in this regard. Ongoing monitoring of the implementation, which will include an assessment of the opportunity/capacity to influence, and questions about the frequency, intensity, and reach of the advocacy actions will help us to explore this issue and seek solutions to it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>].</p><p id="Par45">This study is highly novel in the use of a randomised design although the relatively small sample size will provide power to detect only moderately large effects of the advocacy program on the primary outcome. The measurement of advocacy and attribution of impact will also be difficult because of the complex, multifaceted nature of the intervention program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] and the shifting background political, economic and social contexts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Randomisation should help to control the latter issue since background environmental changes will influence both intervention and control groups but it is possible that there will be interactions between parts of the intervention and the environment which will be hard to identify. The concurrent qualitative evaluation of the program which includes the recording of notable macro-environmental factors will, however, provide some evaluation of these types of influences and add rigor and depth to the analysis of the overall study findings. Our application of an established plan for advocacy as depicted by our logic model could be a limitation as it has the potential to impair program effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] because it imposes a degree of rigidity to the program and may limit the capacity to respond to evolving opportunities. On the other hand the a priori definition of a change model and a series of core activities will aid replication of the intervention in other settings if it is proved effective. We acknowledge that the study evaluation will focus on the short- and medium-term effects and corporate change may take longer than our study period allows for. However, as part of an ongoing monitoring program we will be able to assess changes in mean salt content post-2016. Lastly, market share data for individual products are unavailable to us and are unlikely to become available as the cost is prohibitive, as well as these data generally coming with restrictions on their use. Weighting of the analyses by sales will not therefore be possible. The systematic collection of data from all products on shelves does however provide for subset comparisons of baseline products available in multiple years and new market introductions.</p><p id="Par46">In conclusion, this study will provide evidence about the potential for an advocacy program to influence corporate behaviour and the healthiness of the processed food supply in Australia. Whether the program is effective or not, the trial results, which use a novel and highly robust design, will have important implications for the future of Australian efforts to reduce the large burden of disease caused by poor diet - a finding of improved company behaviour will highlight the need for investment in advocacy whilst the opposite finding will reinforce the importance of other policy-based initiatives for the improvement of the healthiness of the food supply.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec21"><p>
