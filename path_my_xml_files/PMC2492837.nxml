Background</title><p>Coronary artery bypass surgery is a proven and effective mode of treatment for ischaemic heart disease. It provides relief of symptoms and increases survival, in particular in patients with left main disease and two or three vessel disease including the proximal left anterior descending artery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) can be performed in several ways but in the majority of cases it is still performed with the assistance of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), aortic cross clamping and cardioplegia induced cardiac arrest ("on-pump" or conventional method). Coronary artery bypass grating can also be performed without CPB ("off-pump" or OPCAB) and this method's application varies from around 20% in the USA and Europe to more than 50% in India and Japan.</p><p>As a consequence of increased life expectancy and a more widespread use of coronary angiography with exponential growth of percutaneous coronary interventions in ischaemic heart disease, patients proposed for CABG are older and suffer from more co-morbid conditions. In spite of this, continuous incremental improvements in peri-operative patient management, anaesthetic and surgical techniques have led to better results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. However, morbidity is still significant in certain patient subsets and off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery saw its development in the nineties with the rationale of reducing some of the cardiopulmonary bypass related complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Indeed, although CPB is usually well tolerated in the majority of cases, it can be responsible for complications and death, particularly in older and sicker patients with co-morbid conditions. Cardiopulmonary bypass may be a source of distal embolization by aortic canulation and manipulation and causes myocardial ischaemia-reperfusion injury through cardioplegic arrest. CPB causes also a systemic inflammatory response and increases the need for blood transfusion by hemodilution and coagulation disturbances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>Most studies show that OPCAB is associated with less cardiac, pulmonary, renal or neurologic complications and reduces blood transfusion and hospital stay compared with "on-pump" coronary bypass surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. However, there is still some debate about the type and degree of morbidity reduction achieved by OPCAB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. For example, neurocognitive decline is one of the most frequent sequelae of cardiac surgery but there is still no consensus whether OPCAB is superior to conventional CABG with respect to this complication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Neuropsychological evaluation is based on a battery of tests evaluating memory, learning, attention, psychomotor speed, dexterity and diverging results between studies, may be due to different assessment protocols, different timings, statistical tools used to define a decline and absence of control groups.</p><p>In general, there has been difficulty in accumulating scientific evidence for OPCAB benefit, due to low incidence of events (mortality, stroke, myocardial infarction), therefore requiring very large samples or high risk populations to demonstrate a statistically significant improvement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>On the other hand, "off-pump" CABG has been accused of compromising completeness of revascularisation and graft patency by its increased technical difficulty, particularly in grafting the left ventricular lateral wall [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Indeed, a learning curve applies in OPCAB, and its benefits can be expected only with the strict application of principles and rules and a sustained practice without which results can be inferior to those obtained with conventional "on-pump" CABG. The same applies to long term results which depend on completeness and quality of revascularisation.</p><p>Coronary artery bypass grafting has an important role in the treatment of coronary artery disease as shown by series with long term results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. However, increased survival and symptoms relief are directly related to graft patency. Consequently, it is important that new, less invasive methods reduce the early risk of the procedure but also ensure the same revascularisation quality as the conventional technique.</p><p>The justification for the<bold>P</bold>rospective <bold>R</bold>andomized Comparison of <bold>O</bold>ff-Pump and On-Pump Mult<bold>I</bold>-vessel Coronary Artery Bypas<bold>S </bold><bold>S</bold>urgery (PROMISS) derives from current discordant data in the literature regarding the potential inferior graft patency when CABG is performed off-pump as compared with the arrested heart on-pump procedure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. There would be no advantage to the patient if a short term benefit was to be compromised by the ultimate goal of achieving perfect myocardial revascularisation. In fact, while some studies show no difference in graft patency, others show decreased graft permeability when OPCAB is used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>Many procedural and surgeon related factors (exposure, stabilisation, shunt use, operator's experience and patient selection) can account for these differences so it is important to evaluate both off and on-pump coronary bypass surgery using standardised techniques, unbiased assessment of results and an accurate patency control method.</p><p>Until recently, coronary angiography was the only method to assess coronary artery bypass graft patency. This technique is stressful, causes discomfort and has local (limb ischemia, haematoma, false aneurysm), neurological (stroke, TIA) and cardiac (graft dissection, myocardial infarction, arrhythmias) complications in up to 1% of cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. From an ethical standpoint, a potential life threatening complication risk in asymptomatic patients discouraged us from embarking on a randomized study using conventional coronary angiography.</p><p>Recent advances in multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) technology, namely with reduced acquisition time and improved spatial resolution, has permitted its application to the detection of coronary artery disease and bypass graft evaluation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Relative graft immobility and freedom from calcification allows multidetector computed tomography to achieve high diagnostic accuracy for coronary bypass graft patency evaluation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. This led to the design of a randomized but non invasive study of coronary bypass graft patency, comparing on and off-pump techniques and the conception of PROMISS.</p><p>PROMISS <underline>primary objective</underline> is to compare early coronary bypass graft patency by 16 slice computed tomography in patients with multivessel coronary artery disease undergoing first time coronary artery bypass grafting with (on-pump) and without (off-pump) cardiopulmonary bypass.</p><p>Secondary endpoints are:</p><p>1- Mortality and morbidity in patients operated with on-pump and off-pump.</p><p>2- Comparative changes in neuro-cognitive performance between base line and 4&#x02013;6 weeks by a battery of neuropsychological tests.</p><p>3- Evaluation of functional status, ischaemic threshold by stress test, quality of life and adverse events at 6 months and one year.</p><p>Finally, as tertiary end point we aim to analyse hospital costs.</p></sec><sec><title>2.

This trial includes only patients with multi vessel disease with an indication to perform at least 3 distal coronary artery anastomoses for two reasons. Firstly to compare the two techniques in terms of completeness of revascularisation since various series have reported a lower number of grafts/patient in OPCAB relative to conventional on-pump surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Secondly to compare OPCAB graft patency with the reference method in a high percentage of cases requiring revascularisation of the lateral wall for its reported increased technical difficulty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Complete revascularisation is mandatory including the lateral wall since it is one reason for the superior outcomes of CABG compared with percutaneous coronary intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>Few studies have compared OPCAB versus CABG with CPB among randomly assigned patients unselected for coronary anatomy, ventricular function or co-morbidities except renal insufficiency. All surgeries using standardized techniques were performed by a single surgeon experienced with both methods in an attempt to eliminate technical variability.</p><p>This is the first randomized study comparing early graft patency in off-pump and on-pump coronary bypass surgery using 16 slice multidetector computed tomography in patients with multivessel disease. Although 64 slice multidetector computed tomography has improved temporal and spatial resolution, there is ample evidence that, with appropriate heart rate reduction, 16 slice MDCT is able to accurately detect graft occlusion and stenosis compared to conventional coronary angiography [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>Limitations of this study include the fact that physicians involved in patient care, except those assessing graft patency, are not blinded to treatment method, which can eventually bias treatment decision making and length of stay. Another limitation is the single surgeon type of study which may prevent generalizability of the results. Finally, the assumption made for sample size calculation that graft patency within a patient is an independent research unit may not always apply requiring application of statistical adjustment.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The Prospective Randomized Study of graft patency in Off-pump and On-pump MultI-Vessel coronary artery bypasS Surgery (PROMISS) using multidetector computed tomography, has the potential to shed new light on the ongoing debate regarding these two techniques and therefore may have implications on the revascularisation strategy.</p></sec><sec><title>List of Abbreviations</title><p>ARDS: Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome; CABG: coronary artery bypass grafting; CAD: Coronary Artery Disease; ICU: Intensive Care Unit; MDCT: Multidetector Computed Tomography; OPCAB: Off-Pump Coronary Artery Bypass; PROMISS: <bold>P</bold>rospective <bold>R</bold>andomized Study of graft patency in <bold>O</bold>ff-pump and On-pump <bold>M</bold>ult<bold>I</bold>-Vessel coronary artery bypas<bold>S </bold><bold>S</bold>urgery; TIA: Transient Ischemic Attack; ULN: Upper Limit of Normal of Laboratory value.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>All authors read and approved the final manuscript.
