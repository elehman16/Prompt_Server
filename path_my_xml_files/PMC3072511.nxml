This is typically referred to as &#x0201c;task-induced deactivation&#x0201d; (TID) and identifies a network that is qualitatively similar to that observed in resting state connectivity (reviewed in Buckner et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2008</xref>). The DMN contains &#x0201c;hubs&#x0201d; in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), posterior cingulate/retrosplenial cortex (PCC/rSpl), and bilateral inferior parietal lobule (IPL). These are strongly connected to each other and to all other nodes of the network (Buckner et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2008</xref>), and there is evidence that the PCC may be the most prominent functional hub in the brain, from a study that integrated resting-state blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) imaging data across 19 independent research sites and 979 subjects (Tomasi and Volkow <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2010</xref>). The DMN is generally active in the relative absence of strong or salient environmental stimuli and is deactivated with attention or control-demanding processes (Fox et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2005</xref>; McKiernan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2003</xref>).</p><p>There is now considerable convergent evidence indicating that attention and control processes are strongly modulated by subcortical catecholamine systems (see (Arnsten <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">1997</xref>; Aston-Jones and Cohen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2005</xref>; Goldman-Rakic et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2000</xref>; Miller and Cohen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2001</xref>; Robbins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2005</xref> for reviews). Cortically projecting systems arising in the locus coeruleus (LC) and the ventral tegmental area exert a gating function for cortical ensembles supporting a given cognitive process (Aston-Jones and Cohen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2005</xref>). Catecholamine neurotransmission leads to both the relative suppression of background or spontaneous activity and relative enhancement of excitability to task-relevant excitatory inputs. The combined effect is manifest as an increased gain in the input/output relationships for these cortical neurons, which may be critical to their participation in an active cortical ensemble to support a given cognitive process (Aston-Jones and Cohen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2005</xref>).</p><p>It remains quite unclear, however, whether this physiological process is employed to modulate cortical regions such as those found in the DMN. A few studies have addressed catecholamine modulation of TID in the DMN, with transient dopamine (DA) depletion (Nagano-Saito et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2008</xref>), apomorphine administration (Nagano-Saito et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2009</xref>), natural variation in DA transporter (DAT) binding (Tomasi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2009</xref>), and variation in the gene coding for catechol-<italic>O</italic>-methyl transferase (Liu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2010</xref>).These findings generally suggest that higher DA transmission is associated with augmented TID in the DMN.</p><p>While DA-regulated TID in DMN areas is observed as a function of parametric task demand, it remains unclear whether catecholamine modulation of the DMN is a predictor of actual task <italic>performance</italic>. Errors and slowed reaction times (RTs) occurring spontaneously during task performance are preceded within trials by transient attenuations in TID in midline DMN areas (Li et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2007</xref>; Polli et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2005</xref>; Weissman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2006</xref>). This critically suggests that TID in the DMN, particularly midline areas in vmPFC and PCC/rSpl, may be a determinant of task performance. This has been shown with single doses of nicotine, which deactivates DMN areas such as the vmPFC and PCC to enhance visuospatial performance (Hahn et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2007</xref>).</p><p>With these considerations, we tested the role of catecholamine systems in the modulation of TID in the DMN and the relationship of this modulation to task performance. We identified the DMN via TID during a visual sensorimotor processing task and used a pharmacological intervention to enhance catecholamine neurotransmission. Modafinil is an FDA-approved agent that inhibits the norepinephrine (NE) transporter (NET) and DAT (Madras et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2006</xref>; Volkow et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2009</xref>), leading to increased synaptic levels of NE and DA, with indirect effects on other neurotransmitter systems (reviewed in Minzenberg and Carter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2008</xref>). There is also considerable evidence that modafinil can enhance cognitive performance, including in healthy individuals (reviewed in Minzenberg and Carter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2008</xref>). These effects appear to be most strongly manifest on tasks that are highly dependent on the prefrontal cortex (e.g., Turner et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2003</xref>; see review in Minzenberg and Carter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2008</xref>). We hypothesized that modafinil would augment TID in the DMN, as an analogous expression of gain control in support of task-relevant information processing, and that this effect would be associated with improved performance.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Subjects/overview of procedures</title><p>The study was conducted at the University of California, Davis Medical Center from the period March 2006 to January 2008. All procedures were approved by the UCD Institutional Review Board, and all subjects provided informed consent for all procedures. Five subjects consented for the study, but were excluded for the following reasons: Two declined further participation prior to any testing procedures, one tested positive for illicit substances prior to testing, one completed one testing day only (this subject&#x02019;s data were not analyzed), and one experienced equipment malfunction. All additional subjects (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;18) completed this study and provided data for the present analysis. Subjects were all recruited from the community and were included if they were aged 18&#x02013;50; right-handed; free of past or present psychiatric illness as determined by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Disorders, non-patient version; lacked significant medical illness, any neurological illness, and a family history of major psychiatric illness by report; and were not taking medications with either psychotropic effects or established drug&#x02013;drug interactions with modafinil at study. There were ten men and eight women who completed the study, with mean age 33.6&#x000a0;years. All subjects were instructed to maintain their usual quantities and patterns of nicotine and caffeine intake, without changes on or between test days, in order to avoid neural/cognitive effects due to changes in intake from their baseline. All included subjects tested negative for drugs of abuse in the urine on each testing day. Each completed a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study of the effects of modafinil (single oral dose 200&#x000a0;mg) on neural activity measured by fMRI during performance of a sensorimotor task. We chose 200&#x000a0;mg as a dose that was likely to optimize experimental effects with tolerability in a single dose to drug-na&#x000ef;ve subjects. Randomization of treatment order was performed without stratification with a computer algorithm by a research pharmacist who also packaged active medication and placebo in identical-appearing capsules for administration and was otherwise uninvolved in the study. Ten subjects completed the active drug testing day first and eight subjects completed the placebo day first, with at least 3&#x000a0;days between test days (mean 5.7&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;4.1&#x000a0;days) to allow for complete drug washout. All investigators remained blind to treatment order for individual subjects until all data were acquired for that subject and treatment order information was then necessary to sort data for inferential testing. All subjects received the dose in the morning, and echo-planar imaging was initiated at an average elapsed time 3.6&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.2&#x000a0;h post-dose, within the time window of reported average peak plasma levels of modafinil (Robertson and Hellriegel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2003</xref>). No subjects reported any adverse subjective or physical symptoms during study procedures.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Task paradigm</title><p>The visual sensorimotor processing task was modified from (Handwerker et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2004</xref>) and is associated with robust positive event-related activation of the visual cortex and primary motor cortex. It was presented using EPrime software. The trial structure was as follows: A contrast-reversing checkerboard was presented for 200&#x000a0;ms; after stimulus offset, the stimulus was replaced with the central fixation cross again. The interstimulus interval was randomly varied between 18 and 22&#x000a0;s (at 2-s intervals), both to optimize the convolution of the hemodynamic response function (HRF) with the BOLD signal time series and to minimize preparatory responses by subjects. Therefore, the duration of each trial was 18&#x02013;22&#x000a0;s, and the number of brain volumes acquired on each trial varied from 9 to 11. Subjects were instructed prior to the task onset to maintain fixation on the crosshair, and then with checkerboard onset, to press a button with the right index finger as fast as possible. One block of 20 trials was presented. To our knowledge, this particular paradigm has not been evaluated to date for TID or other DMN effects.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>fMRI acquisition and pre-processing</title><p>Event-related fMRI was conducted on a 3-T Siemens Trio MRI system with a Siemens eight-channel phased array coil. Measurement of BOLD contrast was conducted during single-shot, echo-planar imaging (EPI) using a T2*-weighted sequence and whole brain coverage. The parameters of the EPI sequence were TR 2,000&#x000a0;ms, TE 30&#x000a0;ms, flip angle 90&#x000b0;, FOV 220&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;220&#x000a0;mm, with 36 contiguous slices in the axial oblique plane with voxel size 3.4&#x000a0;mm isotropic. Pre-processing was performed using SPM5. The first five images (preceding onset of trial 1 of block 1) were discarded to allow for stabilization of the scanner signal. The remaining images were realigned (motion-corrected) to the first retained image in the first block, then adjusted for acquisition time (slice timing correction), then subject to spatial normalization directly to the EPI template from the SPM5 library. Images were then resliced to 2&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;2&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;2 and spatially smoothed with an 8-mm, full-width-at-half-maximum Gaussian kernel. At this point, drug and placebo day scans were concatenated for the purpose of modeling of the signal and inferential testing.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Inferential testing of voxel-wise drug effects on neural activity</title><p>Derivation of the signal proceeded with the use of the general linear model. Regressors were established for Drug_Event and Placebo_Event. A canonical (double-Gaussian) hemodynamic response function was convolved with a series of delta functions to model the BOLD time series, with regressors placed at event onset. We also established the temporal derivative of the HRF as a regressor, paired with each of the experimental condition regressors, to account for temporal variation in the latency of the event-related response. A 0.0125-Hz high-pass filter was used and a first-order autoregressive function to account for serial autocorrelations. We evaluated the data with global normalization both included and excluded in the model, in parallel analyses. We did this in order to evaluate the potential for detecting spurious deactivations in these data, which have been found by others in BOLD time series data using global normalization (Aguirre et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1998</xref>; Desjardins et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2001</xref>; Gavrilescu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2002</xref>). A recent paper has found that this effect is minimal in the DMN and that global normalization significantly improves the detection of activity in functional networks that are well established from both animal models and structural anatomic imaging methods in humans (Fox et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2009</xref>). In the present context, global normalization facilitates the integration of BOLD data across tests days, primarily by accounting for machine-related variation in signal across days. Nevertheless, we evaluated the potential effect of global normalization on the inferential test results by repeating the regression model estimation with the no-scaling option in SPM (as per Desjardins et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2001</xref>). This analysis revealed test statistics virtually identical to that derived with the proportional scaling option, suggesting that this step in the estimation of the regression model does not show spurious effects on inferential tests in this data set. The results of the no-scaling analysis are reported in &#x0201c;<xref rid="Sec8" ref-type="sec">Results</xref>&#x0201d; below. After signal estimation, linear contrasts were defined at the single-subject level (see below), and then relevant contrast maps from individual subjects (containing voxel-wise parameter estimates for a given contrast) were entered into the group-level analysis for inferential testing.</p><p>In order to test hypotheses regarding drug effects within the DMN, we interrogated voxels solely within DMN hubs (identified in Buckner et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2008</xref>). These voxels were identified by meeting each of the following criteria: (a) significant TID in the group-level Placebo_Event minus Baseline contrast at a voxel-wise threshold of <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0005 uncorrected (negative activations observed in ESM Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="">1</xref>); (b) significant TID in the group-level Drug_Event minus Baseline contrast, also at a voxel-wise threshold of <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.0005 uncorrected; (c) located within <italic>any</italic> of the four following anatomic masks from the AAL library (utilized in the MarsBaR program): bilateral vmPFC (identified in the AAL library as anterior cingulate cortex, which spans the rostral/subgenual ACC and adjacent ventral aspect of the medial frontal gyrus, to comprise the vmPFC), bilateral rSpl/PCC (identified as posterior cingulate cortex), and left and right inferior parietal lobules (identified as such; Tzourio-Mazoyer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2002</xref>). These conjoined masks (each of which were fixed across subjects) had volumes as follows: vmPFC, 8,072&#x000a0;mm<sup>3</sup>; rSpl/PCC, 2,160&#x000a0;mm<sup>3</sup>, left IPL, 272&#x000a0;mm<sup>3</sup> (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The right IPL did not contain any voxels that met these criteria, and therefore, drug effects in this region were not interrogated. The use of this DMN-defining procedure is unbiased for testing drug effects and also allows for unambiguous inferences about the direction of these hypothesized treatment effects. This is because any Drug minus Placebo effects manifest as negative values must represent activity further below baseline since activity in these voxels on Placebo is below baseline to start with (i.e., represents TID). For the contrast of Drug_Event minus Placebo_Event, the threshold for statistical significance was set at <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05, with a small-volume correction (using the volumes defined by the above criteria) for multiple comparisons. We hypothesized that significant drug effects would be manifest as further deactivations within the DMN, i.e., negative activity in the contrast (Drug_Event minus Placebo_Event).

We also tested the hypothesis that drug effects on TID within these DMN hubs predict drug effects on task performance.

After entry of this predictor variable to the regression model, drug effects on TID in the other two hubs did not contribute to significant variance in RT speeding across subjects: rSpl/PCC (<italic>t</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.78, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.45) and left IPL (<italic>t</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.5, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.16). In other words, stronger TID on drug in the vmPFC specifically predicted RT speeding on drug.

Modafinil, a NET/DAT inhibitor, significantly augmented deactivation in the three major hubs of the DMN&#x02014;the vmPFC, PCC/rSpl, and IPL. Among these areas, TID in the vmPFC significantly predicted speeding of RT on drug.</p><p>There is now considerable evidence that modafinil shows efficacy for a range of cognitive processes, particularly those that are dependent on the PFC (Minzenberg and Carter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2008</xref>; Turner et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2003</xref>). This has been demonstrated in healthy populations, sleep-deprived subjects, and a range of neuropsychiatric populations. One very characteristic finding in this literature is that modafinil enhances processing speed, just as it did in the present study. The present evidence therefore suggests that the modulatory effects of modafinil on catecholamine systems may lead to enhanced cognition, in part by augmentation of TID. Additionally, there is evidence that modafinil affects levels of other extracellular neurotransmitters such as serotonin and amino acid neurotransmitters; however, there is no evidence that this agent binds directly to elements of these other neurotransmitter systems, suggesting that these latter effects are mediated via direct catecholamine effects (Minzenberg and Carter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2008</xref>). It does remain possible that the drug effects observed here result from indirect modafinil effects on these other neurochemical systems. This seems less likely, however, given (a) the primary effects of this drug on DAT and NET; (b) the literature on modafinil effects on cognition and behavior in animals, which strongly emphasizes catecholamine effects (reviewed in Minzenberg and Carter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2008</xref>); (c) our prior evidence of the specific effects of modafinil on task-independent activity in the locus coeruleus using similar fMRI methods (Minzenberg et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2008</xref>); (d) the topographic specificity of the observed effects (e.g., no diffuse effects on positive activity throughout the brain, as might be expected with known modafinil effects observed in animals to increase glutamate and decrease GABA signaling); and (e) the consistency of the present findings with the general model of catecholamine-mediated gain control during information processing (Aston-Jones and Cohen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2005</xref>), which emphasizes the modulation of task-relevant brain activity. This notion can be tested more fully in the future by testing the cognitive effects of modafinil in combination with a second catecholamine agent.</p><p>Drug-induced modulation of activity in DMN areas was associated with task performance despite the simple sensory and motor demands of the task. Primary sensory and motor areas of the cortex do not participate in the DMN whose hubs generally are not strongly connected to these sensorimotor areas (see Figs.&#x000a0;5&#x02013;8 in Buckner et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2008</xref>). This is particularly the case for vmPFC which showed the strongest experimental effects. Nevertheless, TID in vmPFC was a predictor of task performance across subjects. These results indicate that catecholamine systems modulate the DMN and suggest that one information-processing role of these systems is to diminish DMN activity in response to task demands. The role of catecholamine systems in cognitive processes such as attention, working and episodic memory, and cognitive control is well established and appears to be expressed via a gating or gain control function in active cortical neuronal ensembles (Aston-Jones and Cohen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2005</xref>; Montague et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2004</xref>). We previously found a complex pattern of effects of modafinil on a rostrodorsal pontine area consistent with the LC, in concert with changes in the cortical&#x02013;subcortical cognitive control network, during cognitive control task performance (Minzenberg et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2008</xref>). These effects were consistent with the shift of the LC&#x02013;NE system to a relatively low-tonic/high-phasic mode of activity, which optimizes task-relevant activity in cortical ensembles by a gain control mechanism (Aston-Jones and Cohen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2005</xref>). The present findings suggest that just as catecholamine neurotransmission augments task-related excitatory throughput in active ensembles, it similarly augments task-related <italic>deactivation</italic>, and this contributes to task performance.</p><p>The association of enhanced TID with enhanced performance may appear paradoxical, given that TID scales with attention demand (McKiernan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2003</xref>), which itself tends to lead to decrements in performance, either in accuracy and/or speed. TID can reasonably be considered one important process engaged to meet this demand and support ongoing performance, as a mirror (i.e., &#x0201c;anticorrelated&#x0201d;) response to task-positive activity in the frontoparietal network. This perspective is supported by the finding that errors are preceded by transient <italic>attenuations</italic> in TID in the DMN (Li et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2007</xref>; Polli et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2005</xref>; Weissman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2006</xref>). Therefore, TID is unlikely to directly lead to performance impairments. This is analogous to the notion that dorsal anterior cingulate activity is associated with errors, but does not <italic>cause</italic> them, and in fact is engaged in order to positively meet cognitive control demand (van Veen and Carter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2006</xref>). This line of reasoning would suggest that a pharmacological intervention that enhances TID should <italic>enhance</italic> performance in concert. This is the prediction that we have tested with the regression analysis, and the results support this prediction, particularly for the vmPFC. This is a novel finding and, we believe, not inconsistent with the foregoing evidence.</p><p>These results also implicate the vmPFC as a particularly strong anatomic substrate for catecholamine effects on TID, especially as a determinant of cognitive performance. This cortical area receives significant DA and NE innervation arising from the ventral tegmental area and LC, respectively (reviewed in Steketee <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2003</xref>). The vmPFC and adjacent orbitofrontal cortex in humans forms a &#x0201c;medial PFC network&#x0201d; projecting to limbic forebrain, hypothalamus, and brainstem areas such as periaqueductal gray, in contrast to the &#x0201c;orbital PFC network&#x0201d; (Ongur and Price <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2000</xref>). This pattern of connectivity, which likely influences the expression of basic drives, suggests that default mode activity in this cortical area represents the operation of an &#x0201c;intrinsic, probabilistic model of anticipated events&#x0201d; (Raichle and Gusnard <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2005</xref>) which is altered with the demands of an externally driven, goal-directed task. The distinct patterns of medial PFC network connectivity with the subregions of both the striatum and the mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus suggest that the medial PFC network may also participate in a unique striato-pallido-thalamo-cortical circuit (Ongur and Price <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2000</xref>), which could mediate the relationship of TID in vmPFC to task-related neural network activity that serves as a proximal driver of goal-directed task performance. Among the hubs of the DMN, there is evidence that vmPFC and PCC have differing patterns of effective connectivity with their respective anticorrelated dorsal/lateral cortical networks (Uddin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2009</xref>) and differing patterns of local functional connectivity density (Tomasi and Volkow <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2010</xref>). These observations suggest that modulation of vmPFC may have unique consequences (within the DMN) for cortical areas that are brought online during task performance.</p><p>The cellular or local network basis of TID, and more generally of BOLD signal changes below baseline, remains to be characterized. However, recent evidence suggests that deactivations, or negative BOLD responses (which can be defined objectively as local increases in oxygen extraction fraction), are associated with increases in local neuronal inhibitory processes, including neuronal membrane hyperpolarization (Boorman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2010</xref>; Devor et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2007</xref>; Northoff et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2007</xref>; Shmuel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2002</xref>). Importantly, this phenomenon may be one mechanism of gain modulation (Wade and Rowland <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2010</xref>). Hyperpolarization of cortical neuron membranes may be mediated by either gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) receptors or by several monoamine receptor subtypes. Catecholamine systems are well suited to modulate complex local network dynamics that are inhibition-dependent as catecholamine receptors located on both GABAergic interneurons and primary cortical neurons may afford a sensitive control over spatiotemporal patterns of membrane polarization states (Shmuel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2002</xref>; Gu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2002</xref>). Many important effects of catecholamines on cortical function are mediated via GABAergic interneurons (Bacci et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2005</xref>; Durstewitz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2000</xref>; O&#x02019;Donnell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2003</xref>), and these may be expressed in cortical oscillations such as gamma-range activity. Cortical oscillations such as those in the gamma range are not only associated with BOLD signal change in animal models (Logothetis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2001</xref>; Mukamel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2005</xref>; Niessing et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2005</xref>) but are also proposed to represent one important mechanism of gain control in the brain (Salinas and Sejnowski <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2001</xref>). There is intriguing preliminary evidence that during waking periods, gamma-range power is associated with resting-state fluctuations in BOLD activity (He et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2008</xref>). It remains unknown whether TID measured in humans during BOLD-fMRI is associated with task-induced changes in oscillatory activity. It is also important to note that these cortical areas are subject to modulation by other ascending subcortical neurotransmitter systems, and there is evidence, for instance, that nicotinic receptors can mediate deactivation in DMN areas to support cognitive performance (Hahn et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2007</xref>).</p><sec id="Sec14"><title>Study limitations</title><p>In the present study, we used a rather simple task with minimal frontoparietal task demands in order to evaluate drug effects on TID in the DMN. The apparent inverse functional relationship between the dorsal/lateral frontoparietal control network and the DMN, which has been reported in other studies (e.g., Fox et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2005</xref>), is likely an important feature of distributed network activity as it determines cognitive performance. This could even represent a general, or fundamental, feature of cognition as it is instantiated in brain dynamics. With the present experimental design, we are not able to evaluate intra- or inter-network dynamics directly. Nevertheless, we are able to gain a degree of inferential leverage from the lack of engagement of the dorsal frontoparietal network. The present results suggest that catecholamine modulation of DMN in the service of sensorimotor processing is not simply an indirect consequence of the positive modulation of activity in other more dorsal/lateral PFC subregions and the cognitive processes that they subserve. Regarding the question of how neurochemical systems may aid the integration of frontoparietal and DMN networks, a more conclusive answer will require the use of cognitive tasks where these networks can be interrogated concurrently. Given the nearly ubiquitous presence of catecholamines throughout the cortex of humans (Gu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2002</xref>), these neurochemical systems seem well suited to integrate the function of these two large, widely distributed cortical networks. Current models of catecholamine-mediated gain control in cortical neuronal ensembles would predict that this anticorrelation should be strengthened with interventions that enhance catecholamine neurotransmission. We also did not conduct other tests of cognition in this study, so the cognitive process specificity of these findings is uncertain. Our working model would suggest that augmentation of task-relevant neural changes is a general feature of catecholamine drug effects, but this remains to be fully tested in future work, along with the possible modulation of connectivity within the DMN.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><sec id="AppESM1"><title>Electronic supplementary materials</title><supplementary-material id="d28e978" content-type="local-data"><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.
