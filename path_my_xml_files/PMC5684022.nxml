mechanical characteristics of cervical muscles and cervical posture in patients with
cervicogenic headache following exercise program intervention in order to present
effective treatment methods for such patients. [Subjects and Methods] A total of 30
patients with cervicogenic headache were recruited and 15 patients were allocated to
cervical stretching exercise group and 15 to cervical stretching exercise and
cranio-cervical flexion exercise group. After 3 weeks of exercise intervention,
craniovertebral angle and tone (Hz) and stiffness (N/m) of the suboccipital and upper
trapezius muscles were measured. [Results] After the exercise program intervention, a
greater amount of change in tone of suboccipital and upper trapezius muscles was found in
the experimental group, as compared to the control group, but the difference was not
statistically significant. Greater amount of change in muscle stiffness and
craniovertebral angle was found in the experimental group, as compared to the control
group. [Conclusion] Findings of the present study showed that cranio-cervical exercise was
an effective form of exercise for changing muscle characteristics and posture in patients
with cervicogenic headache. Such findings will be helpful in providing effective
treatments for patients with cervicogenic headache.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Cervicogenic headache</kwd><kwd>Cranio-cervical flexion</kwd><kwd>Mechanical properties</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Cervicogenic headache refers to repetitive and persistent pain in the cervical and cranial
areas that occurs secondarily from anomalies in the soft tissues in the cervical spine or
cervical areas<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is a syndrome that is
characteristic of chronic pain mostly in one side of the head that is the same side where
cervical musculoskeletal impairment appears<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. The structures that cause pain in the cervical region include the
suboccipital muscles, C1-2 nerve roots, C2-3 intervertebral discs, upper cervical ligaments,
and synovial joints. Moreover, the suboccipital nerves may be the source of headache that
occurs in the occipital region as they send nerve branches to the atlanto-occipital joint,
while pain originating from cervical muscles can cause referred pain in the head and
face<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Methods for treating cervicogenic
headache include the foremost recommended method of joint mobilization, along with
manipulation, soft tissue mobilization and stretching techniques, retraining of special
postural muscle groups, and patient lifestyle training<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Hamilton et al.<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>
analyzed changes in pain threshold in the suboccipital muscles after separately applying
muscle energy and manipulation techniques, while Dunning et al.<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup> observed changes in cervical impairment indices in patients
with cervicogenic headache after applying manipulation to the upper cervical and upper
thoracic spine regions. Vavrek et al.<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>
applied cervical massage to patients with cervicogenic headache and observed changes in
their pain and functional impairment. Along with these, there are other on-going studies
that have applied various physical therapy interventions to patients with cervicogenic
headache for investigation of therapeutic effects. Cervical stabilization exercise
strengthens deep muscles that play a dominant role in cervical postural control and
stability in patients with cervical impairment, which induces maintenance of neutral
cervical posture<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Jull et al.<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup> observed scalene and sternocleidomastoid
muscle activity after applying 6 weeks of intervention consisting of different exercise
therapies to patients with chronic cervical pain. The results showed that
sternocleidomastoid and scalene muscle activity decreased to a greater degree in the
cervical stabilization exercise group than in other groups. Zito et al.<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup> observed sternocleidomastoid muscle activity while
applying deep cervical flexion exercise to patients with cervicogenic headache, patients
with migraine, and healthy subjects. The results showed that sternocleidomastoid muscle
activity was higher in patients with cervicogenic headache than the other groups. It was
surmised that such results were due to patients with cervicogenic headache not being able to
effectively use deep cervical flexion muscles, as compared to those in other groups.</p><p>As shown, stabilization exercise training has positive effects on patients with
cervicogenic headache. However, most of the existing studies used electromyography (EMG) to
measure and analyze muscle activity or subjectively measured muscle elasticity or stiffness
by manual examination, while studies that analyzed postural changes after stabilization
exercises in patients with cervicogenic headache are lacking. The present study divided
patients with cervicogenic headache into the control group, in which cervical stretching
exercise was applied, and the experimental group, in which both cervical stretching and
cranio-cervical flexion exercises were applied. Exercise intervention was applied to both
groups for 3 weeks, and comparative analysis was performed on changes in posture and
characteristics of upper cervical muscles between the 2 groups. Our objective was to present
an effective method for postural analysis and application of exercise therapy in patients
with cervicogenic headache.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The present study was conducted from April 15 to May 12, 2017. A total of 30 patients with
cervicogenic headache were recruited. Their age ranged from 20 to 42&#x02005;years. Using random
clinical sampling, patients were assigned to the experimental group (n=15), which
participated in cervical stretching and stabilization exercise programs, or the control
group (n=15), which participated in cervical stretching exercise program only. The subjects
were those who had been diagnosed with cervicogenic headache based on International Headache
Society diagnostic criteria, and their duration of disease ranged between 4 months and
2&#x02005;years.</p><p>For cervical stretching exercise, lateral flexion was performed in the opposite direction
of and rotation was performed in the same direction of the muscle that would stretch the
neck in sitting position. The therapist stood behind the patient and used one hand to
immobilize the thoracic skeleton and the other hand to immobilize the patient&#x02019;s head. When
the patient breathed, the thoracic skeleton was immobilized and relaxed, which was repeated
5&#x02013;6 times. Moreover, the C2 spinous process was felt and this location was immobilized with
the thumb as the patient nodded. The therapist induced the motion and instructed the patient
to maintain it for about 10&#x02005;s, and the stretching exercise was repeated 5&#x02013;6 times.
Cranio-cervical flexion exercise was performed while lying down with the knees bent. After
placing a pressure sensor (Stabilizer, Chattanooga Group, TX, USA) underneath the subject&#x02019;s
neck, about 20 mmHg of air, which is enough to fill the space between the neck and floor,
was used to fill. The subject was instructed to performed smooth nodding action to induce
cranio-cervical flexion. Pressure in the sensor would increase up to 2&#x02013;10 mmHg depending on
the subject. Such state of increased pressure was maintained for 10&#x02005;s and this was repeated
10 times<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The mechanical characteristics of cervical muscles were measured using MytonPRO (Myoton AS,
Tallinn, Estonia). Tone (Hz) and stiffness (N/m) in the left and right suboccipital muscle
and upper trapezius muscles were measured and the mean values were analyzed. Tone (Hz) and
stiffness (N/m) values were calculated as the mean value measured 5 times. The measurement
method involved pressing the skin with a force of 0.18 N and subsequently applying
instantaneous impulse of 0.4 N in 15-ms intervals to the skin. Afterwards, skin surface
vibration caused by MytonPRO was measured to confirm the values of mechanical variables<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. For measurement of cervical posture,
photographs taken from the side were used for objective measurement of forward head posture.
The patient was instructed to assume a standing posture, and then to relax. The camera was
positioned at shoulder height, and after printing the photographs taken, the craniovertebral
angle, which represented the angle of forward head posture, was measured. The
craniovertebral angle was derived from the angle formed by the horizontal line that passed
the 7th cervical vertebra and the line that connected the tragus of the ear and C7 spinous
process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>The craniovertebral angle: the angle between C7, the tragus, and the horizontal</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jpts-29-1836-g001"/></fig>)<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. The value of the
craniovertebral angle were calculated as the mean value measured 5 times. To examine the
mechanical characteristics of cervical muscles and changes in forward head posture between
the experimental and control groups after different exercise therapy interventions, the
present study performed an analysis of covariance. Statistical significance level was set to
&#x003b1;=0.05, and SPSS 19.0 for Windows was used for statistical analysis. This study was approved
by Bioethics Committee of Sehan University Center (IRB) (Approval number: 2017&#x02013;02) on March
31, 2017.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The general characteristics of the subjects are shown in <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>General characteristics of the subjects</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" width="523"><col width="38%" span="1"/><col width="31%" span="1"/><col width="31%" span="1"/><thead><tr><th rowspan="3" align="center" colspan="1"/><th colspan="2" align="center" rowspan="1">M &#x000b1; SD</th></tr><tr><th colspan="2" align="center" rowspan="1"><hr/></th></tr><tr><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control group</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Experimental group</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gender (male/female)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5/10</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4/11</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (years)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">32 &#x000b1; 5.0</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">31 &#x000b1; 6.5</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">BMI (kg/m<sup>2</sup>)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> 21.6 &#x000b1; 2.0</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">21.89 &#x000b1; 2.5</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Values are shown as mean (M) &#x000b1; standard deviation (SD)</p><p>Control group: cervical stretching exercise; Experimental group: cervical stretching

experimental (n=15) and control (n=15) groups by random clinical sampling. After applying
different exercise therapy intervention for 3 weeks, tone and stiffness in the upper
trapezius and suboccipital muscles were measured and craniovertebral angle was also measured
for comparative analysis in order to identify if exercise intervention causes any
changes.</p><p>Tone in the upper trapezius and suboccipital muscles decreased in both the experimental and
control groups after exercise intervention. Although the control group showed a higher
value, the difference was not statistically significant. Hamilton<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup> applied high velocity low amplitude manipulation and muscle
energy technique stretching exercise to 65 subjects and found that there were changes in
their suboccipital muscle pain threshold. When the value of tone is higher, it is said to
represent increased degree of pain and exercise overload<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the present study, both the experimental and control groups
showed a decrease in tone, which is an indicator of pain sense. These results were similar
to the findings in a study by Hamilton<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>,
meaning cervical stretching and cranio-cervical exercise reduced pain by decreasing the tone
of muscles around the cervical vertebrae.</p><p>Stiffness of upper trapezius and suboccipital muscles decreased after exercise intervention
in both groups, and in particular, the experimental group, which had both stretching
exercise and cervical stabilization exercise applied together, showed significantly lower
stiffness values than the control group. Zito et al.<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup> recruited 25 healthy subjects and 27 patients with cervicogenic
headache and observed their sternocleidomastoid muscle activity during cervical
stabilization exercise. The results demonstrated that patients with cervicogenic headache
had higher sternocleidomastoid muscle activity than the healthy subjects. Moreover, Jull et
al.<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup> recruited 40 patients with chronic
cervical pain and observed their sternocleidomastoid muscle activities after applying
cervical stabilization exercise to only 20 patients and cervical muscle strengthening
exercise to the other 20 patients. The results showed that the group that had cervical
stabilization exercise applied had decreased sternocleidomastoid muscle activity, as
compared to the group that had muscle strengthening exercise applied. Increase in
sternocleidomastoid muscle activity reflects weakening of deep cervical flexion muscles,
which can lead to difficulties in maintaining the neutral cervical posture. In the present
study, stiffness value decreased in the group that received intervention by cranio-cervical
flexion exercise, which is believed to be the result of stiffness in cervical muscles
decreasing from neutral cervical posture being maintained by strengthening of the deep
cervical flexion muscles.</p><p>In the present study, changes in forward head posture were measured for observation of
postural changes after intervention with different exercise therapies. The results showed
that forward head posture decreased more in the experimental group than in the control
group, but the difference was not statistically significant. Chae &#x00026; Lee<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup> applied 8 weeks of cervical stabilization
exercise on 24 patients with tension type headache and performed comparative analysis on the
changes in their forward head posture. The results showed that there was a significant
increase in craniovertebral angle which reflects the forward head posture in both sitting
and standing positions. Such results were similar to the findings in the present study,
demonstrating that cranio-cervical flexion exercise improved forward head posture by
increasing the craniovertebral angle.</p><p>The present study performed comparative analysis on the changes in mechanical
characteristics of muscles and posture in patients with cervicogenic headache after applying
intervention with different exercise programs. The results showed that the group that had
cervical stretching and stabilization exercise applied had greater amount of changes in
tone, stiffness, and cervical posture. If such points are taken into account when applying
exercise therapy to patients with cervicogenic headache, the patients can be maintained more
effectively.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research was supported by research grant of Sehan Univercity in 2017.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Jang</surname><given-names>JH</given-names></name><name><surname>Sagong</surname><given-names>ES</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Chiropractic manipulation treatment in cervicogenic
