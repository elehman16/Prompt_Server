Pain in bones, joints, and muscles is very common and can often be persistent. This condition is called chronic MSK pain.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Chronic MSK pain includes various painful local or regional MSK disorders such as cervical and low back pain, soft-tissue rheumatism, osteoarthritis (OA), and fibromyalgia of at least 3 months duration.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] MSK pain and arthritis are universal problems.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Moderate-to-severe chronic MSK pain is an important cause of physical disability and work absence, carrying a huge economic and social cost. Therefore, it represents a relevant health problem to patients, health professionals, the health-care system, and society. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin, ibuprofen, and diclofenac are the most commonly used pharmacological agents for symptom control in various chronic MSK pain conditions.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Oral NSAIDs are associated with safety risks including gastrointestinal (GI) side effects,[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] renal insufficiency, hepatic toxicity, exacerbation of asthma, sodium retention, raised blood pressure, and resistance to antihypertensive drugs, as well as increased risk of thrombotic cardiovascular events for nonaspirin agents and increased risk of intracerebral hemorrhage and other bleeding with aspirin.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] GI adverse events, such as dyspepsia, upper abdominal pain, and general abdominal pain, are among the most common reasons for discontinuation of oral NSAIDs therapy.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>Topical NSAIDs such as gels and transdermal patches are also used for the treatment of MSK pain and are popular for their advantages such as decrease in incidence of GI adverse events. Transdermal NSAIDs seems to be attractive alternative to oral NSAIDs with the potential advantage of improving the safety profile.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of myofascial pain of the upper trapezius demonstrates that diclofenac sodium patch was superior to placebo in terms of reducing visual analog (VAS) scores and improving functional outcomes and did not cause significant adverse effects.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>Moreover, our literature search did not reveal any study evaluating the efficacy of transdermal patches of diclofenac in chronic MSK pain conditions. In addition, there are very limited studies directly comparing transdermal diclofenac diethylamine patch with oral diclofenac. Hence, the present study was planned with the objective of comparing efficacy, safety, and tolerability of transdermal patches of diclofenac sodium with oral diclofenac sustained release (SR) in patients of chronic MSK pain conditions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ATERIALS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study design</title><p>A randomized, open-label parallel design trial in 56 patients of chronic MSK pain after approval of Institutional Ethics Committee was conducted from January 2014 to February 2015.

The patients were asked to bring the empty wrappers of patches and empty packets of tablets during follow-up visit to check adherence. Ninety percent consumption was considered as adequate adherence. Patients were given patches and tablets for 2 weeks. The patients were asked not to take any other analgesic medications during the study.

Chronic MSK pain is often associated with reduced activity, sleep disturbance, fatigue, and mood alterations and can result in severe disability. People with chronic pain often get into a &#x0201c;vicious circle&#x0201d; of problems. The pain leads to anxiety and depression, which can make the pain worse.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Various treatment modalities available for chronic MSK pain include NSAIDs such as diclofenac, ibuprofen, paracetamol and aspirin, opiates, opioids, and alternative pharmacologic agents such as anti-seizure drugs and antidepressants.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] NSAIDs can be administered in a range of formulations such as oral, parenteral, rectal, or topical. While oral administration is the most commonly used, it has been associated with serious side effects such as GI, cardiovascular, and renal events.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] To overcome the problem associated with oral NSAIDs various topical preparations of NSAIDs in the form of gels and transdermal patches are available. Transdermal patches of salts of diclofenac approved for use for pain indications are diclofenac epolamine patch and diclofenac diethylamine patch.</p><p>One of the principle findings of our study was that the effects of transdermal diclofenac diethylamine patch in patients of chronic MSK pain were apparent within 2 weeks of treatment. The transdermal diclofenac diethylamine patch (100 mg) produced statistically significant as well as clinically significant reduction in numerical rating scale for pain at the end of 2 weeks which continued till 2 weeks of treatment.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] These results confirm findings of study conducted by P. Br&#x000fc;hlmann and Michel[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] in OA of knee joint. Diclofenac patch resulted in a statistically significant reduction (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01) in VAS compared to control patch in a study by Hsieh <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] in myofascial pain syndrome of upper trapezius.</p><p>Topical diclofenac diffuses into the subdermal tissue. It is a small lipophilic molecule that has been shown to be capable of rapid diffusion through the skin and to distribute in blood, muscle, interstitial tissue, and synovial fluid. In the form of the 1.16% diethylamine salt (1% diclofenac sodium), absorption occurs continuously through the underlying dermis, and subcutaneous tissue to a depth of 3&#x02013;4 mm and is increased by 3&#x02013;10 times when an occlusive dressing is used. There is a significant direct penetration of diclofenac into skeletal muscle following multiple epicutaneous administrations. Plasma concentrations are less than tissue concentrations, thus reducing the probability of systemic adverse effects.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] In our study, the effects of tablet diclofenac sodium SR were apparent within 2 weeks of treatment which continued till 4 weeks. The tablet diclofenac sodium (100 mg) SR also produced statistically and clinically significant reduction in numerical rating scale for pain at the end of 4 weeks of treatment. Similar findings with diclofenac SR tablet were reported in a study conducted by Goei Th&#x000e8; <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>In our study, when the two groups were compared for efficacy it was found that transdermal diclofenac diethylamine patch (100 mg) once daily was equally efficacious as tablet diclofenac sodium SR (100 mg) once daily at the end of 2 weeks which continued till 4 weeks in reducing pain by NRS. In this study, overall improvement in pain was calculated to be 45.03% in transdermal diclofenac diethylamine patch group and 46.38% in tablet diclofenac SR group. In a study by Farrar <italic>et al</italic>., a 50% reduction in pain intensity corresponded to the highest level of patient impression of improvement.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Inspite of extensive literature search, no head-to-head comparative studies in chronic MSK pain between transdermal diclofenac diethylamine patch and tablet diclofenac sodium SR were found. Hence, it is difficult to compare our results with published reports. However, different studies have compared transdermal diclofenac patch with tablet diclofenac sodium SR in postoperative pain and acute pain such as pain due to extraction of tooth. In a study by Prithvi S Bachali <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] where in transdermal diclofenac diethylamine (100 mg) patch group provided similar analgesia as oral diclofenac (100 mg) SR following the removal of mandibular impacted third molars on second and third postoperative day as measured on VAS.</p><p>Topically, applied NSAID's are effective in decreasing both acute and chronic pain. They inhibit prostaglandin synthesis and decrease the inflammatory response. Similar efficacy of transdermal patch as that of oral diclofenac sodium is due to the similar mechanism of action that is inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis. In one study, plasma levels achieved by transdermal patch ranged between 20 and 50 ng/ml, which was lesser when compared to the oral route, but these levels were sustained for a longer time.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] One study has reported that the amount of drug bioavailable for targeting the sites of action is lower than oral route, but the absorbed dose appears to be adequate for therapeutic use.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] In one <italic>in vitro</italic> study carried out in rats, patches were subjected to <italic>in vitro</italic> permeation enhancement studies through rat skin using, an especially designed diffusion cell. The pharmacokinetic parameters calculated from blood levels of drug reveal of profile similar to a sustained-release formulation, with ability to maintain adequate plasma levels of 24 h (i.e., up to the next application).[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>One of the important findings of our study was that there was no significant difference between transdermal diclofenac diethylamine patch group and oral diclofenac SR group in PGIC score at the end of 4 weeks. Patient's evaluation of their global impression of change at the end of treatment was improvement (much improved and minimally improved) in their overall situation for chronic MSK pain in both the groups. In our study, 4 (16%) patients in transdermal diclofenac diethylamine group and 4 (16%) patients in tablet diclofenac SR withdrew from study due to lack of efficacy. Similar finding was reported in a study[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] conducted in patients with OA and rheumatoid arthritis. Twenty percent of patients in transdermal diclofenac diethylamine group complained of adverse drug reactions, of which 16% patient's experienced local irritation over applied area. The tolerability of the transdermal diclofenac diethylamine patch was otherwise good except only 4% of patients had burning sensation in abdomen. However, all the adverse drug reactions were of mild severity and disappeared on continued use. In a study conducted by P. Br&#x000fc;hlmann and Michel[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] for 14 days, 4 patients complained of adverse drug reactions, in the diclofenac epolamine group (2 rush, 1 pruritus, 1 nausea). None of the adverse events described in this study were judged as severe, and all symptoms resolved spontaneously. However, findings of our study showed a higher number of adverse drug reaction in comparison to above-mentioned study. This might be probably due to longer duration of treatment with transdermal diclofenac diethylamine patch which was 28 days in our study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>Our study concludes that transdermal diclofenac diethylamine patch is equi efficacious as oral diclofenac sodium SR in patients with chronic MSK pain. The treatment with transdermal diclofenac diethylamine patch has comparatively lesser percentage of GI adverse events compared to oral diclofenac sodium SR in this study. Further study of longer duration is needed to evaluate the safety of transdermal diclofenac diethylamine patch.</p><sec id="sec2-8"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-9" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Dr Sontakke Smita, Dr Turankar A.
