We developed a ligation selection strategy using random RNAs in combination with high-throughput sequencing to gain insight into the differences in efficiency of ligating pre-adenylated DNA adapters to RNA 3&#x02032;-ends. After analyzing biases in RNA sequence, secondary structure and RNA-adapter cofold structure, we conclude that T4 RNA ligases do not show significant primary sequence preference in RNA substrates, but are biased against structural features within RNAs and adapters. Specifically, RNAs with less than three unstructured nucleotides at the 3&#x02032;-end and RNAs that are predicted to cofold with an adapter in unfavorable structures are likely to be poorly ligated. The effect of RNA-adapter cofold structures on ligation is supported by experiments where the ligation efficiency of specific miRNAs was changed by designing adapters to alter cofold structure. In addition, we show that using adapters with randomized regions results in higher ligation efficiency and reduced ligation bias. We propose that using randomized adapters may improve RNA representation in experiments that include a 3&#x02032;-adapter ligation step.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Bacteriophage T4 encodes two RNA end-joining enzymes, T4 RNA ligase 1 (Rnl1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1263-B1">1</xref>) and T4 RNA ligase 2 (Rnl2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1263-B2">2</xref>). Both enzymes catalyze the formation of a 3&#x02032;- to 5&#x02032;-phosphodiester bond between a 3&#x02032;-hydroxyl group and a 5&#x02032;-phosphoryl group in three nucleotidyl transfer steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1263-B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1263-B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1263-B4">4</xref>). The function of Rnl1 is to counter a particular host defense mechanism induced after T4 phage infection. This host defense mechanism involves generating a break in the anticodon loop of tRNA<sup>Lys</sup> so that the viral genes of T4 cannot be translated. Rnl1, together with T4 polynucleotide kinase, repairs the cleaved anticodon loop of tRNA<sup>Lys</sup>

Although Rnl2 is phylogenetically related to DNA ligases, RNA-editing ligases and mRNA capping enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1263-B7">7</xref>), the function of Rnl2 <italic>in vivo</italic> is not clear. The activity of both T4 RNA ligases has been exploited <italic>in vitro</italic> for use in applications such as RNA ligase-mediated rapid amplification of cDNA ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1263-B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1263-B9">9</xref>), ligation of oligonucleotide adapters to cDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1263-B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1263-B11">11</xref>), various 5&#x02032;-nt modifications of nucleic acids, RNA 3&#x02032;-end modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1263-B12">12</xref>) and small RNA sequencing library construction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1263-B13">13</xref>).</p><p>miRNAs are one class of small regulatory RNAs that mediate post-transcriptional gene regulation in higher eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1263-B14">14</xref>). miRNAs base pair with a target mRNA when associated with the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) resulting in regulation of gene expression through mRNA degradation and translation repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1263-B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1263-B16">16</xref>). Studies of miRNAs in various organisms have revealed that the expression and regulatory functions of miRNAs are controlled at different developmental stages, in different cell types, tissues and species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1263-B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1263-B17">17</xref>) and that misregulation of miRNA expression and function is a significant factor in many diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1263-B18">18</xref>). The emerging realization of miRNA functions <italic>in vivo</italic> makes the development of effective experimental methods to accurately detect and measure the expression of miRNAs important for future research.</p><p>High-throughput sequencing (HTS) has been an invaluable tool not only for the discovery of miRNAs but also for profiling their relative expression level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1263-B19 gkr1263-B20 gkr1263-B21 gkr1263-B22 gkr1263-B23">19&#x02013;23</xref>). However, HTS-based miRNA profiling experiments are reported to be biased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1263-B24 gkr1263-B25 gkr1263-B26">24&#x02013;26</xref>). The level of bias has been suggested to cause a miscalculation of miRNA abundance by as much as three or four orders of magnitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1263-B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1263-B25">25</xref>). Thus, relating the number of reads from HTS to the abundance of miRNA in the sample is problematic. Additional comparison studies showed that the bias is reproducible and independent of sequencing platforms and also that the bias is derived from the methods used for small RNA library preparation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1263-B24">24</xref>).</p><p>In general, small RNA library preparation methods for HTS start with the ligation of 5&#x02032;- and 3&#x02032;-adapters to add &#x02018;handles&#x02019; that are used for priming during reverse transcription and PCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1263-B24">24</xref>). Typically, adapters are attached to small RNAs by T4 RNA ligases using either a single-stranded adapter ligation approach, a splinted ligation approach or by poly adenylation of the RNA 3&#x02032;-termini followed by 5&#x02032;-end adapter ligation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1263-B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1263-B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1263-B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1263-B27">27</xref>).</p><p>Two recent studies suggested that miRNA representation bias in HTS is primarily derived from the adapter ligation steps mediated by T4 RNA ligases and that the ligation might be biased in a sequence-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1263-B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1263-B26">26</xref>). However, these studies examined ligation bias using HTS, which means the results reflected the combined bias from both the 5&#x02032;- and 3&#x02032;-adapter ligation steps. Bias studies to date have, at most, been based on a pool of several hundred miRNAs or just a few known miRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1263-B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1263-B25">25</xref>). The limited sequence space of the reference pools in these recent reports is not sufficient to determine the exact nature of ligase bias.</p><p>In this work, we separated the two adapter ligation steps and focused on the ligation bias in 3&#x02032;-adapter ligation reactions, which have been suggested to be more biased than 5&#x02032;-adapter ligation reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1263-B26">26</xref>). We developed an <italic>in vitro</italic> selection strategy where the 3&#x02032;-end of randomized RNA oligonucleotides were ligated to pre-adenylated DNA adapters using Rnl1 or four variants of a truncated form of Rnl2 (Rnl2tr) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1263-B28">28</xref>). We determined the sequences of ligated oligos using the Ion Torrent sequencing platform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1263-B29">29</xref>), and analyzed bias at the level of primary RNA sequence, RNA secondary structure and RNA-adapter cofold structures by comparing the ligated RNA sequences to the random input sequences.</p><p>Sequence analysis did not reveal appreciable RNA primary sequence preference in the 3&#x02032;-adapter ligation reaction for any of the ligases we tested. Instead, ligation bias is primarily due to the cofold structure between a given RNA and the adapter. These findings are supported by results from <italic>in vitro</italic> ligation experiments on a representative set of miRNAs from miRBase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1263-B30">30</xref>). Furthermore, we demonstrate that <italic>in vitro</italic> ligation efficiency for specific miRNAs can be significantly affected by manipulating the adapter sequence to change the predicted RNA-adapter cofold structure and improve the ligation of otherwise poorly ligated miRNAs. Finally, we present an approach to improve ligation efficiency and reduce ligation bias of miRNA pools using a mixture of adapters with randomized 5&#x02032;-regions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Ligated and random library preparation</title><p>Random RNA oligos were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (Iowa, USA).

Therefore, it was necessary to hand mix an equimolar amount of four random oligos to generate an oligo pool containing 21 random positions.
<fig id="gkr1263-F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Scheme of <italic>in vitro</italic> ligation selection and sequencing library preparation. For each ligase selected library, an equal amount of 4 random RNA oligos containing a constant region (solid line), a randomized region (wavy line) and a known 3&#x02032;-nt were combined to make a random oligo pool and used as substrates in a ligation reaction with pre-adenylated SR1 DNA adapter using a specific T4 RNA ligase. The ligated products were reverse transcribed and amplified to introduce the required primer regions for Ion Torrent sequencing. To determine the sequence content of the random RNA oligo pool, each of the four RNA oligos was sequenced independently. First, the oligos were poly A tailed for the random RNA oligo U, C and G or poly C tailed for the random RNA oligo A using poly(A) polymerase. The tailed RNA oligos were then reverse transcribed using primers complementary to the polymer tails (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkr1263/DC1">Supplementary Table S1</ext-link>).

Each oligo was tailed with poly nucleotides using poly(A) polymerase. The random RNA oligo ending with U, C or G was tailed with ribonucleotide A, while the random RNA oligo ending with A was tailed with ribonucleotide C in order to distinguish the last A from the tailed region. We performed poly-adenylation reactions under conditions that minimized 3&#x02032;-end nucleotide bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1263-B39">39</xref>). These conditions resulted in essentially complete tailing of the input oligos (data not shown). After tailing, the RNAs were reverse transcribed and the cDNAs were used for Ion Torrent sequencing library preparation. After sequencing, 29&#x02009;737 sequences from each of the four random oligos were pooled to generate a random input library with 118&#x02009;948 reads in total (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkr1263/DC1">Supplementary Table S3</ext-link>).</p><p>Our ligation selection reactions used 9.0&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>13</sup> molecules of random oligos in order to cover all the 4.4&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>12</sup> possible sequence combinations from 21 random positions. For each library, a ligation reaction was performed using an excess of RNA ligase and 5&#x02032;-pre-adenylated DNA adapter (SR1) over random RNA oligos. The SR1 adapter was blocked at its 3&#x02032;-end by an amino group to prevent it from participation intra- and inter-molecular ligation with other SR1 molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1263-B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1263-B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1263-B39">39</xref>).

We interpret these observations to mean that the primary sequence of RNA substrate has minimal impact on the ligation efficiency.</p></sec><sec><title>Ligation efficiency is affected by the secondary structure within an RNA substrate</title><p>Given the striking differences we observed in miRNA 3&#x02032;-adapter ligation efficiency and having failed to observe significant sequence bias in our sequencing experiments, we next asked whether T4 RNA ligases prefer certain secondary structures within RNA substrates as suggested previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1263-B25">25</xref>). Considering the function of T4 Rnl1 is to repair a break in the anticodon loop of tRNA<sup>Lys</sup>, it is possible that ligases such as Rnl1 prefer RNA substrates similar in structure to its biological substrate. To explore the possible secondary structure preferences of ligases, sequences from each library were analyzed by CONTRAfold to predict their secondary structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1263-B42">42</xref>). After folding, structural predictions of the 42&#x02009;nt sequences were sorted into groups based on the number of unpaired nucleotides at their 3&#x02032;-end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr1263-F4">Figure 4</xref>). If the 3&#x02032;-end nucleotide is predicted to be paired, there are &#x02018;0&#x02019; unpaired nucleotides and if no pairing was predicted within the RNA, there are &#x02018;42&#x02019; unpaired nucleotides. The percentage of each group in a specific library was calculated and the enrichment of that structure group was determined by comparing its percentage to that in the random input library using the following equation, &#x02018;(Observed&#x02013;Expected)/Expected&#x02019;. &#x02018;Observed&#x02019; is the percentage of a specific group in a ligated library and &#x02018;Expected&#x02019; is its corresponding percentage in the random input library. If the calculated value is positive or negative, it means the structure is over- or under-represented in the ligated library, respectively. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr1263-F4">Figure 4</xref>, it is clear that all tested ligases share a similar preference. Specifically, RNAs with fewer than three unpaired nucleotides at the 3&#x02032;-end are under-represented in the ligated libraries while RNAs with three or more unpaired nucleotides at the 3&#x02032;-end appear at their expected frequency or are over-represented. Thus, RNA ligases generally prefer RNA with a relatively accessible 3&#x02032;-end and one source of bias in ligation is secondary structure at the 3&#x02032;-end of an RNA substrate.

Structure classes 1, 3, 9, 11 and 15 were less abundant and ranged from 1.1% to 8.6% in each library. We did not observe structure classes 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14 and 16 in any of our sequenced libraries.</p><p>To assess the cause of the absent structure classes in our sequenced libraries, and exclude that the absence was caused by a lack of sequence coverage, we generated random libraries <italic>in silico</italic>. Ten simulated random libraries, each consisting of 300&#x02009;000 random sequences, were generated by a computer containing the same 5&#x02032;-constant sequence and 21-nt random region. Each sequence was then cofolded with the SR1 adapter and the average distribution of cofold structures from the 10 libraries was compared to our sequenced random input library (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr1263-F5">Figure 5</xref>B). Distribution of the simulated random libraries is similar to that of our sequenced random library confirming that our sequenced random library indeed represents a random pool. The absence of observed cofold structure classes is therefore not due to the sequence coverage nor bias introduced by poly(A) polymerase. In addition, the absent cofold structure classes do not result from the presence of 5&#x02032;-constant region in the RNA (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkr1263/DC1">Supplementary Figure S2</ext-link>) since the presence or absence of the 5&#x02032;-constant region did not affect their presence in our cofold predictions. The absent cofold structure classes are structures where the RNA and adapter are predicted to not form heterodimers or where adapters are internally structured. Since the SR1 adapter does not form internal secondary structure or homodimers according to secondary structure prediction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr1263-F6">Figure 6</xref>A), it makes sense that these structure classes would not be represented when RNAs are cofolded with the SR1 adapter. These observations lead us to conclude that the distribution of cofold structures is largely due to the SR1 adapter and limitations in what structures that it can form.

</p></sec><sec><title>Enrichment of RNA-adapter cofold structures in the ligated libraries</title><p>To determine whether the ligases prefer or discriminate against a specific cofold structure, we first compared the percentage of each cofold structure class in the ligated libraries to that in the random library. We further calculated enrichment for each cofold structure class using &#x02018;(Observed&#x02013;Expected)/Expected&#x02019;, in which &#x02018;Observed&#x02019; is the percentage of a specific cofold structure class from a ligated library and &#x02018;Expected&#x02019; is the percentage of the corresponding class from the random library. When the value is greater or less than 0, it means the structure class is over- or under-represented, respectively. If the value is equal to 0, it means there is no preference for that structure class. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr1263-F5">Figure 5</xref>C, it is evident that two structure classes, 7 and 13, were slightly over-represented in the libraries of all tested ligases and none of the ligases showed much preference toward structure class 11. Three structure classes, 3, 5 and 9, were found to be under-represented in the ligated libraries, though structure 5 was only slightly so. The natural substrate of T4 Rnl1, cleaved tRNA<sup>Lys</sup>, is predicted to cofold into structure class 5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1263-B5">5</xref>). Interestingly, the ligases did not differ in their preference for structure class 5 as reflected by the representation of this class in our sequenced libraries. However, the ligases showed different preferences toward structure classes 1 and 15. For instance, class 15 was under-represented in the library using T4 Rnl1 but was over-represented when using Rnl2tr, but all of the mutant variants of T4 Rnl2 showed similar preferences to structure class 15 as Rnl1.</p></sec><sec><title>RNA-adapter cofold structure influences ligation efficiency</title><p>Our observations that certain cofold structure classes were over- or under-represented in our sequenced libraries prompted us to examine the influence of RNA-adapter cofolding on ligation efficiency. We designed a new adapter, SR1-S, which shares the same sequence as SR1 at the 5&#x02032;-end from positions 1 to 12, but with a modified 3&#x02032;-sequence so that, in contrast to SR1, SR1-S is predicted to have secondary structure. We presume that internal secondary structure in the adapter would reduce its ability to productively cofold with RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr1263-F6">Figure 6</xref>A and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkr1263/DC1">Supplementary Table S5</ext-link>). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr1263-F6">Figure 6</xref>B, SR1-S migrated faster than the SR1 adapter, which is the same length, likely because of incomplete denaturation or renaturation. SR1-S stained more strongly than an equivalent amount of SR1 in gels, consistent with the 2&#x000d7; increased staining of dsDNA versus ssDNA with SYBR Gold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1263-B43">43</xref>). We then compared the ligation efficiencies of 18 miRNAs with both the SR1 and SR1-S adapter. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr1263-F6">Figure 6</xref>B and C, we observed large overall decreases in ligation efficiency using SR1-S. The average ligation efficiency of the miRNAs decreased from 27% with SR1 to 8% with SR1-S. The decrease in ligation was most dramatic for miRNAs which ligated efficiently with SR1, such as miR-31, let-7, miR-139-3p, miR-122, miR-253, miR-1614 and miR-2419. The fold decrease in ligation efficiency for these RNAs ranged from 3- to 22-fold. miRNAs that had low ligation efficiencies with SR1 also ligated poorly with SR1-S. The finding that we can modulate ligation efficiency by changing secondary structure within the adapter without changing primary sequence at the 5&#x02032;-end is at odds with a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1263-B26">26</xref>). This report concluded that RNA ligase bias is due to primary sequence-specific preferences at the ligation junction, specifically the first two nucleotides of the 5&#x02032;-end of adapter sequence and the last two nucleotides of the 3&#x02032;-end of the RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1263-B26">26</xref>). Our results, especially when considered with the nucleotide frequency results from our sequencing experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr1263-F3">Figure 3</xref>), contradict this conclusion. Together, our results demonstrate that structures within and between the RNA acceptor and the adapter are more important than primary sequence in influencing ligation efficiency. These results support a model where favorable heterodimeric RNA and adapter cofold structures promote efficient ligation.</p><p>To further test our model, we tried to improve the ligation efficiency of seven miRNAs that ligate poorly with SR1 by designing a new adapter for each miRNA. In each case, the adapter was designed so that the predicted RNA-adapter cofold structure was changed from an under-represented class to an over-represented class (<xref ref-type="table" rid="gkr1263-T1">Table 1</xref>). The predicted cofold structures of six miRNAs with SR1 belonged to one of two under-represented cofold structure classes, either class 1 or 5. The adapters we designed for each of these miRNAs changed their predicted RNA-adapter cofold structures to the over-represented structure class 13. The seventh miRNA, miRNA-5183, was already predicted to cofold with SR1 in structure class 13, despite the fact that it ligates poorly with SR1. When we examined predicted loop size of miRNAs within structure class 13, and correlated this with ligation efficiency, we noted a trend that some loop sizes appear to be unfavorable for ligation (data not shown). The adapter we designed for miR-5183 adjusted the size of the loop in the cofold structure class 13.

The increase in ligation efficiency for miRNAs ranged from 2.2- to 17.1-fold.

These data confirm the important role of RNA-adapter cofolding during ligation. We suggest that the method demonstrated here is useful for improving the ligation of any known RNA sequence and could be applied to situations where accurate quantification of a set of known RNAs is important.

We therefore attempted to minimize the bias using a pool of adapters with randomized 5&#x02032;-ends in order to decrease the likelihood that a particular miRNA will be incompetent for ligation with a single sequence adapter. In other words, we attempt to minimize bias by supplying many adapters to increase the likelihood of more favorable cofold structures between adapters and all RNAs in the sample. We designed a pre-adenylated adapter, SR1-R, which contains the same sequence as SR1 except the first six nucleotides at 5&#x02032;-end are randomized (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkr1263/DC1">Supplementary Table S1</ext-link>).</p><p>We performed ligation reactions using Rnl2tr to compare the ligation efficiency of each miRNA with SR1 and SR1-R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr1263-F8">Figure 8</xref>A). miRNAs that ligated efficiently with SR1 were also efficiently ligated with SR1-R, while miRNAs that ligated poorly with SR1 generally showed improved ligation efficiency with SR1-R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr1263-F8">Figure 8</xref>B). Reflecting this observation, the average ligation efficiency increased from 67% with SR1 to 78% with SR1-R. Furthermore, the index of dispersion, defined as the ratio of the variance to the mean, decreased from 0.13 with SR1 to 0.034 with SR1-R. The decreased index of dispersion indicates less divergence in ligation efficiencies among miRNAs and suggests that using a randomized SR1-R adapter reduces the bias of Rnl2tr in ligation.

In order to test this, we radio-labeled an miRNA of interest at the 5&#x02032;-end with <sup>32</sup>P so that we could use small amounts (0.75&#x02009;fmol) of the miRNA in a mixture containing small RNAs extracted from mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr1263-F9">Figure 9</xref>A). Ligation reactions were performed using 500-fold excess of mouse ES cell small RNAs and excess amount of adapter compared to radio-labeled miRNA. The ligated and unligated radio-labeled miRNA were separated in 15% TBE&#x02013;urea gels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr1263-F9">Figure 9</xref>B). The average ligation efficiency increased from 36% with SR1 to 46% with SR1-R.

All miRNAs with &#x0003c;40% ligation efficiency with SR1 exhibited improved or unchanged ligation efficiencies when ligated to SR1-R. In agreement with the results of the experiments with pure miRNAs, the ligation bias was reduced as measured by the index of dispersion, which decreased from 0.42 with SR1 to 0.23 with SR1-R. In summary, the use of randomized adapters when ligating adapters to the 3&#x02032;-end of miRNAs with Rnl2tr results in generally improved ligation efficiency and decreased ligation bias.

Compared to traditional gene expression profiling methods such as hybridization based methods, microarrays and quantitative PCR, HTS offers the advantages of high sensitivity, the ability to identify novel miRNAs and provides information about miRNA editing and 3&#x02032;-end modification simultaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1263-B21">21</xref>). Despite these advantages, recent studies have revealed the existence of bias in HTS when quantifying the level of miRNA expression directly from sequence reads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1263-B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1263-B25">25</xref>).</p><p>A recent study using a pool of synthetic miRNAs concluded that inconsistencies in miRNA quantitation in HTS experiments are primarily due to biases in the adapter ligation steps and not due to downstream steps such as reverse transcription, PCR, or the sequencing reaction itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1263-B25">25</xref>). Previous studies examined the bias after complex sample preparation protocols, which reflect a combined bias from two ligation steps using two ligases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1263-B24 gkr1263-B25 gkr1263-B26">24&#x02013;26</xref>). In this study, we used a random mixture of RNA substrates to examine the bias of T4 RNA ligases during 3&#x02032;-adapter ligation in isolation. Our selection strategy enabled us to include 9&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>13</sup> randomized RNA sequences in one ligation reaction, which provides complete sequence coverage for all possible RNAs 21&#x02009;nt in length in contrast to previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1263-B24 gkr1263-B25 gkr1263-B26">24&#x02013;26</xref>).</p><p>To study bias in 3&#x02032;-adapter ligations, it was critical to accurately determine the content of the random input sequences in our ligation reaction. To do so we employed a homopolymer tailing approach. Alternatively, we attempted to assess the nucleotide content of the random pools using a direct reverse transcription method with two different 3&#x02032;-overhang degenerate nucleotide stem&#x02013;loop RT primers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1263-B44">44</xref>). Hairpin RT primers with either 6 or 10, 3&#x02032;-overhanging degenerate nucleotides, were designed to hybridize to the 3&#x02032;-ends of unknown RNAs, and serve as reverse transcription primers. Libraries prepared with the degenerate stem&#x02013;loop RT primers showed bias for G and C nucleotides in the degenerate priming region (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkr1263/DC1">Supplementary Figure S1</ext-link>). We interpreted this to reflect a bias that results from primer annealing, where more stable G&#x000b7;C base pairs were favored over A&#x000b7;T pairs. In addition to being a poor option for assessing the content of a random oligo pool, using a stem&#x02013;loop primer with a randomized 3&#x02032;-end for annealing will introduce additional bias when used to quantify miRNAs. In contrast, the poly(A) polymerase tailing method showed no detectable bias (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkr1263/DC1">Supplementary Figure S1</ext-link>). For this reason, we used the random library sequences obtained by the poly(A) polymerase tailing method for all subsequent analysis.</p><p>Strikingly, we found that T4 RNA ligases show no significant preference for RNA primary sequence, contradicting a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1263-B26">26</xref>). Instead, we provided experimental evidence for the important role of RNA and adapter cofold structures that were suggested to be influential in an article published while this manuscript was in preparation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1263-B25">25</xref>). What distinguishes our work from these recent studies is that we separated the 3&#x02032;-ligation step so that we could study its inherent bias in the absence of potentially confounding effects from 5&#x02032;-ligation that was used by Hafner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1263-B25">25</xref>) and Jayaprakash (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1263-B26">26</xref>). In addition, our expanded analysis of a larger group of possible ligation substrates allowed us to accurately assess primary sequence preference. We were then able to predict, test, and prove that particular cofold structural classes are disfavored for ligation with T4 RNA ligases, while others are neutral or slightly favored. Together, these factors explain why we arrived at different conclusions than Jayaprakash <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1263-B26">26</xref>). We performed folding analysis based on their results, but are unable to comment on whether their results can be explained based on our finding of structural bias because of what we believe to be confounding effects of 5&#x02032;-ligation and different ligation conditions. Future definition of the bias in ligation of adapters to the 5&#x02032;-ends of RNAs, and interpretation of how that bias may have affected the conclusions of both Hafner <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1263-B25">25</xref>) and Jayaprakash <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1263-B26">26</xref>) will necessitate further study. The cumulative results of our experiments demonstrate that, for T4 RNA ligases, the adapter and its ability to interact with an RNA substrate has a major influence on ligation efficiency. The concept of redesigning adapters can be practically applied to improve the ligation efficiency of a specific miRNA with known sequence.</p><p>In many experimental situations, the starting material to be ligated is a pool of unknown RNAs, or a mixture of RNAs that is so complex that designing an adapter for each RNA is impractical. Our 5&#x02032;-randomized adapter approach increases the chance that an appropriate adapter for ligation is present for each miRNA. While largely effective, the ligation of some individual miRNAs to 5&#x02032;-randomized adapters was not improved in the context of excess small RNA as we predicted. A possible explanation is that there may be interference from other small RNAs in the pool that interact with the miRNA and inhibit productive cofolding with adapters. Overall, however, we observed that ligation bias was reduced with randomized adapters.</p><p>Recently, methods that include barcoding when preparing samples for HTS have been shown to be efficient and affordable for sequencing multiple samples simultaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1263-B45">45</xref>). A very recent report showed that barcodes introduced at the ligation step resulted in significant bias on miRNA expression profiles in high-throughput multiplex sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1263-B46">46</xref>). The effect of cofold structures on ligation explains the observation of bias. For that reason, introducing barcodes in the 3&#x02032;-adapter for HTS warrants careful consideration, especially when one tries to compare the relative miRNA expression level from different samples prepared with different barcoded adapters. We therefore suggest introducing barcodes in the reverse transcription or PCR step to avoid introducing ligation bias among samples.</p><p>The procedures described here for studying T4 RNA ligase bias should be applicable to other ligases and other ligation conditions, for instance ligation of adapters to unknown RNA 5&#x02032;-ends. These procedures represent important early steps toward resolving the issue of ligation bias by seeking alternative or modified ligases.</p><p>In summary, our findings show that the bias introduced by T4 RNA ligases in HTS experiments is due to structural properties within and between RNA substrates and the adapters used in ligation. Our model of what constitutes a compatible RNA-adapter pair was successfully used to design adapters to improve the ligation of RNAs with a known sequence. The randomized adapter that we designed demonstrated promise toward improving ligation efficiency and reducing bias when ligating a pool of RNAs. This approach may be extended by producing minimized sets of adapters for the study of specific pools of RNAs. For instance, a set of adapters could be designed so that the each member of the miRNA repertoire of an organism would have a corresponding high efficiency adapter included in the mixture. Our approaches should also be applicable to RNAs other than miRNA, including mRNAs fragmented for strand-specific RNA sequencing library preparation.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkr1263/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online: Supplementary Tables 1&#x02013;5 and Supplementary Figures 1 and 2.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>Funding for open access charge: <funding-source>New England Biolabs Inc</funding-source>.</p><p><italic>Conflict of interest statement</italic>.
