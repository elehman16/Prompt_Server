Secondary outcomes include disability (key secondary), back pain intensity, quality of life, participants&#x02019; perceived global effect, work absenteeism and health utilisation. Information about medication usage and tolerability are also collected. Outcomes are collected over one year (weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 26 and 52).

Repeated-measure linear mixed models will assess the effect of treatment (pregabalin versus placebo) on primary and secondary outcomes at all time points. Fixed effects will include group allocation, visit as a categorical variable and the interaction between group and visit. Covariates will include baseline leg pain and symptom duration, with an interaction term between baseline leg pain and visit. Pairwise differences between groups will be tested at weeks 8 and 52. The number of serious adverse events and adverse events will be reported, and the proportion of patients per group who have at least one event will be compared using Fisher&#x02019;s exact test.

This statistical analysis plan details the planned analyses for the PRECISE study to facilitate transparency of data analysis. The statistical analysis plan was approved and signed by study investigators on 28 November 2015.

The study received ethics approval from the University of Sydney Human Research Ethics Committee (protocol number 15333), was prospectively registered at the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12613000530729) and the study protocol has been published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study population</title><p>Two hundred and nine eligible consenting participants who were seeking care for their back-related leg pain (sciatica) were recruited from primary care (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;45 sites) or outpatient specialist clinics (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;2 sites). Eligible participants were adults with radiating leg pain below the knee, of at least one week but no longer than one year in duration, which caused at least moderate pain or interference with work or daily activities in the last week. Participants had to have signs or symptoms of nerve root or spinal nerve involvement, as demonstrated by either myotomal weakness, dermatomal deficits, diminished reflexes or leg pain radiating in a dermatomal distribution, and had to have sufficient understanding of the English language or assistance with interpretation to allow completion of the study treatment and assessments. Participants were excluded if they had any known or suspected serious spinal pathology; were scheduled for spinal surgery or interventional procedures for sciatica during the 8-week treatment period; were pregnant, breastfeeding or planning conception during the intervention period; had taken pregabalin or gabapentin for this current episode of sciatica; were taking an anticonvulsant medication, a neuropathic pain medication, a tricyclic antidepressant or a sedative and unable to cease the medication; were suffering from severe depression or suicidal thoughts (score of &#x02265;20 on the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) or a score of 2 or 3 on question 9); or had a contraindication(s) to pregabalin.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Intervention</title><p>All participants received advice (reassurance, advice to stay active and avoid prolonged bed rest) and a study medication pack containing either pregabalin or placebo. Participants commenced by taking one 75&#x000a0;mg capsule, twice daily. Follow-up consultations (once a week for up to 8&#x000a0;weeks) with a study doctor monitored individual progress, tolerability and adverse events to titrate the dosage to the participant&#x02019;s optimal dose, up to a maximum 600&#x000a0;mg per day. &#x02018;Adequate improvement&#x02019; was defined as a pain rating of 0 or 1 out of 10, for leg pain, for a minimum of 72&#x000a0;hours, with no or tolerable side effects. If adequate improvement was achieved before the maximum 8&#x000a0;week regimen was completed, early titration down to cessation was possible. In addition, usual care could be provided by the study doctor to all participants during the study and could include a referral for physical or manual therapy and/or prescription of analgesic medication. It was recommended that the study doctors follow the World Health Organisation (WHO) pain ladder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] for analgesic medication prescription, and refrain from prescribing additional medicines for neuropathic pain (for example, antidepressants, selective serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors, gabapentin and other anticonvulsant medications) or scheduling interventional procedures. The maximum treatment period was 8&#x000a0;weeks.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Randomisation and allocation</title><p>Study medicines were packaged and labelled according to a pre-generated random number sequence; each sealed box had a unique participant number. Allocation to either group (pregabalin or placebo) was at a 1:1 ratio. All study medicines were identical in appearance. The study doctor provided a pre-packaged study medication pack to each eligible participant. All study personnel, study clinicians and participants were blind to the group allocation. A participant was considered randomised into the study once informed consent and baseline data were obtained and the participant was instructed to break the seal on the study medicine.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Outcome variables</title><p>Outcomes were collected at baseline and at weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 26 and 52 (unless otherwise stated). Data were collected either by telephone, where a research assistant first entered the data on paper (source data) and then transcribed the data into the study electronic database, or by participants completing the study questionnaires online, with the data directly entered into the secure electronic database. Manual data checking procedures ensured correctness of data transfer of source data.</p><p>The primary outcome was leg pain intensity, measured by a Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS). The NPRS asks participants to rate their leg pain on a scale of 10, with 0 being &#x02019;no leg pain&#x02019; and 10 being the &#x02019;worst pain imaginable&#x02019;, as an average over the last 24&#x000a0;hours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].

This assumed a standard deviation of 2.5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and a two-tailed alpha of 0.05, and allowed for 10 % of dropouts and 20 % non-compliance. The between-group difference of 1.5 units out of 10 in leg pain was based on previous trials of pregabalin for neuropathic pain conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The sample size also had 90 % power to detect a difference between groups of 3 on the 23-point Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire for Sciatica, the key secondary outcome, at week 8. This was based on the between-group difference of 3 and standard deviation of 4 from one of our previous sciatica trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], and the same assumptions taken for the primary outcome calculation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Statistical analysis</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Analysis principles</title><p>Two analysts, blind to group allocation, will conduct independent analyses of the primary and key secondary outcomes. Results will be compared and discrepancies resolved. Other analyses will be conducted by one analyst with the codes reviewed by a senior statistician. A dummy dataset will be used to confirm statistical procedures, with discrepancies resolved before unblinding. Analyses will be consistent with the intention-to-treat principle. Participants will be analysed according to group allocation, estimating the mean difference at week 8 between pregabalin and placebo treatment groups regardless of the treatments received after randomisation. All statistical tests will be two-tailed and a <italic>p</italic> value of &#x0003c;0.05 considered significant. Continuous variables will be summarised using standard measures of central tendency and dispersion, either as mean and standard error, or median and interquartile range. Dichotomous or categorical variables will be summarised by frequencies or denominators and percentages. Percentages will be calculated using the number of participants for whom data is available as the denominator. Analyses will be conducted using SAS software version 9.3 or above (SAS Institute Inc. 2012). No interim analysis will be conducted or has been planned, as pregabalin is used under its approved label use.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Data integrity</title><p>Integrity of trial data is monitored regularly by scrutinising data files for omissions and errors. Double data entry will be conducted for the primary (leg pain intensity) and key secondary (disability) outcomes. Other outcomes (that is, secondary outcomes excluding the key secondary) will be checked using a risk-based approach. This approach will be used for data collected by telephone, in which a random 10 % sample of participants&#x02019; paper files (source data) will be cross-checked against the electronic database. If the rate of error is greater than 10 %, another 10 % sample is drawn and checked. The acceptable error rate for this new sample is then 9 %. If the error rate is again higher than the acceptable rate (9 %), then another 10 % sample is drawn for checking and the next acceptable error rate is reduced by another 1 %. This process continues until the observed error rate is below the acceptable threshold. All inconsistencies will be investigated and rectified. For participants who directly completed their questionnaire(s) online, no cross-checking is required. Range checks will be performed on all variables.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Blinding</title><p>All researchers involved in the preparation of the analysis plan had no access to trial data broken down by treatment allocation. Once data quality checks are satisfactory and the database is locked, we will undertake a blind review to quantify missing data of the entire dataset (that is, not separated by group) and allow for any final amendments to the statistical analysis plan. During analysis and interpretation, group allocation will be masked using dummy group names (for example, group A, group B). The true group allocation will be unmasked only after the final statistical report has been completed and interpretation agreed upon.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Methods for handling missing data</title><p>In case more than 10 % of the primary outcome data (leg pain intensity) at week 8 is missing, multiple imputations will be used to conduct sensitivity analyses for the longitudinal linear mixed model of the primary outcome. Ten imputations using chained equations will be used to replace missing leg pain data across all visits.
