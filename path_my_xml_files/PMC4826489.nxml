We also examined whether the subjective urge to smoke was associated with the pharmacokinetics of nicotine.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This open-label, randomized, two-period, two-sequence crossover study conducted in 28 healthy smokers assessed the pharmacokinetics of nicotine after single and <italic>ad libitum</italic> use of the THS 2.1 or CCs. During the 7-day confinement period, blood samples were drawn for pharmacokinetic analysis. Subjective effects related to THS 2.1 or CC use were assessed using the Questionnaire of Smoking Urges (QSU-Brief).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The nicotine delivery rate was similar with the THS 2.1 and CCs after single and <italic>ad libitum</italic> use. The time to the maximum nicotine concentration was 8 minutes after single use of the THS 2.1 and CCs. The time to the peak concentration following <italic>ad libitum</italic> use was similar between the THS 2.1 and CCs. The maximum plasma nicotine concentration after single use of the THS 2.1 was 8.4ng/mL, 70.3% of that obtained with CCs. A transient reduction from baseline in the urge to smoke of 40% was observed 15 minutes after the single use of both the THS 2.1 and CCs. The mean QSU-Brief total scores following single and <italic>ad libitum</italic> use were similar for the THS 2.1 and CCs.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These results suggest that the THS 2.1 effectively delivers nicotine and achieves similar pharmacokinetic profiles to CCs. The THS 2.1 also reduced the urge to smoke similarly to CCs.</p></sec><sec><title>Implications:</title><p>Reducing exposure to toxicants and safer delivery of nicotine are among the strategies that may reduce the harm of smoking-related diseases. In the present study, we investigated the pharmacokinetics of nicotine and their effects on the urge to smoke using the THS 2.1. It was developed to replicate the ritual of smoking as closely as possible by providing nicotine in a way that mimics CC smoking, but limits pyrolysis and combustion by heating tobacco at a much lower temperature than CCs (heat-not-burn).</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="7"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Reducing exposure to toxicants and safer delivery of nicotine are among the strategies that may reduce the harm of smoking-related diseases.<sup><xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Several products aimed at reducing exposure to toxicants have been developed, including products with lower levels of toxicants such as smokeless tobacco, electronic cigarettes that vaporize nicotine-containing liquids, and products that heat instead of burn tobacco.<sup><xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2&#x02013;5</xref></sup> Decreased exposure to the toxic constituents of tobacco smoke is necessary but not sufficient for effective harm-reduction.<sup><xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> The alternative tobacco product should not only be available but compete with combustible cigarette (CC) smoking to make consumers switch to the tobacco product with less exposure to harmful constituents.

</p><p content-type="indent">In the present study, we investigated the pharmacokinetics of nicotine and their effects on the urge to smoke using the Tobacco Heating System (THS 2.1). The THS 2.1 was developed with the objective of replicating the ritual of smoking as closely as possible by providing nicotine in a way that mimics CC smoking, but limits pyrolysis and combustion by heating tobacco at a much lower temperature than CCs (heat-not-burn). In vivo and in vitro toxicity assessments revealed that earlier THS prototypes reduced exposure to harmful and potentially harmful constituents present in cigarette smoke.<sup><xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> A recent open-label, randomized, confinement clinical study showed that switching from CCs to THS 2.1 reduced selected biomarkers of exposure by 72.1% to 93.0% as compared with continuing to use CCs for 5 days.<sup><xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> These biomarkers of exposure measured exposure to harmful and potentially harmful constituents, and included carbon monoxide, benzene, 1,3-butadiene, and acrolein.

The study was conducted at Celerion GB Ltd, Northern Ireland, United Kingdom, between May 2012 and June 2012. The study was approved by an Independent Ethics Committee (Office for Research Ethics Committees, Customer Care &#x00026; Performance Directorate, Northern Ireland, United Kingdom) in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practices principles and the Declaration of Helsinki (2008), and was registered at <uri xlink:href="www.clinicaltrials.gov">www.clinicaltrials.gov</uri> (NCT01780688). All participants provided written consent to participate in the study.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Subjects</title><p>Subjects were recruited via the clinical site&#x02019;s database and by advertisements. The sample size calculation was based on the maximum concentration (C<sub>max</sub>) with an intra-subject geometric coefficient of variation of 25%.<sup><xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> A total of 28 smokers were needed to estimate the geometric mean C<sub>max</sub> ratio between THS 2.1 and CC and ensure the 90% confidence interval did not exceed the 0.80 and 1.25 limits with 80% power. Male and female healthy Caucasian smokers aged 23&#x02013;65 years were eligible to participate if they had smoked cigarettes for at least 3 consecutive years before screening. The subjects should have smoked at least 10 commercially available non-menthol CCs per day for the last 4 weeks prior to screening, with a maximum International Organization for Standardization (ISO) yield of 1mg nicotine per CC, as labeled on the cigarette pack. Subjects were excluded if they had a body mass index of less than 18.5 or 30kg/m<sup>2</sup> or more, a urinary cotinine level less than 200ng/mL at screening, or smoked hand-rolled cigarettes, cigars, pipes, bidis, or other noneligible nicotine-containing products, including electronic cigarettes. Smokers unable to abstain from smoking for up to 2 consecutive days and subjects with clinically relevant diseases or a medical condition requiring smoking cessation were ineligible. The subjects were provided financial compensation for their time and the inconvenience of participating in the study, which was approved by the ethics committee.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Procedure</title><p>On the day of admission to the 7-day confined study period, the subjects were asked to try a maximum of three heatsticks on the THS 2.1 to familiarize themselves with the product. The confinement comprised two consecutive periods. Each period consisted of a 24-hour (at least) nicotine wash-out period, 1 day of single product use, and 1 day of <italic>ad libitum</italic> product use. On the second day of confinement, 28 subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of two sequences, taking into account a marginal distribution of at least 40% of subjects of each sex and the nicotine level of the subject&#x02019;s preferred CC brand at admission (ISO nicotine levels &#x02264;0.6mg and &#x0003e;0.6 to 1mg). Randomization was performed using an Interactive Web Response System. The subjects assigned to Sequence 1 used the THS 2.1 in Period 1 and CCs in Period 2. The subjects assigned to Sequence 2 used CCs in Period 1 and the THS 2.1 in Period 2.</p><p content-type="indent">The CCs were non-menthol, manufactured, commercially available cigarettes, with a maximum ISO yield of 1mg nicotine per cigarette. The subjects were asked to purchase a sufficient quantity of a single, preferred CC brand before admission to provide sufficient cover for the study duration.</p><p content-type="indent">The THS 2.1, developed by Philip Morris International, has three components, the heatstick, the holder, and the charger. The heatstick has a tobacco plug containing processed tobacco cast leaf, which is covered by a paper wrap. Except for the much shorter length than CCs, the overall appearance of the heatstick is similar to that of a CC. The holder includes a battery, controlling electronics, and the heater element. The heatstick is inserted into the holder and heats the tobacco via an electronically controlled heating blade. The charger recharges the holder. The energy capacity of the holder is sufficient to maintain a product use session for up to 6 minutes.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Measures</title><sec id="s7"><title>Baseline Characteristics</title><p>The recorded baseline characteristics of subjects included age, sex, body mass index, and the ISO nicotine yield of the type of CCs smoked by the subject.

On <italic>ad libitum</italic> use days, 13 venous blood samples were collected for each subject. The first blood sample was collected within 15 minutes before the first product use in the morning. The second and third blood samples were collected immediately after the first product use, and immediately before the next product use, respectively. Thereafter, three blood samples were collected during each of three time intervals (12:00 to 16:00 hours, 16:00 to 20:00 hours, and 20:00 to 23:00 hours), similarly to the first three blood samples. The final blood sample was collected after 24 hours on the wash-out days. During <italic>ad libitum</italic> use, <italic>T</italic>

Factor 2 includes items representing an anticipation of relief from the negative effects of smoking with an urgent desire to smoke. On the single use days, the QSU-Brief was completed before using the allocated product in the morning, and then at 15, 30, and 45 minutes, at 1, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, and 2 hours, and then hourly thereafter until 23:00 hours.

The visual analog scale assessed how bothersome the cough was to the subject ranging from &#x0201c;not bothering me at all&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;extremely bothersome.&#x0201d; The subjects were also asked to assess the intensity and frequency of cough and the amount of sputum produced during the previous 24 hours on Likert scales. The intensity of cough was assessed on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 to 5, where 1 = very mild, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, 4 = severe, and 5 = very severe. The frequency of cough was assessed on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 to 5, where 1 = rarely, 2 = sometimes, 3 = fairly often, 4 = often, and 5 = almost always. The amount of sputum produced was assessed on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 0 to 3, where 0 = no sputum, 1 = moderate amount of sputum, 2 = larger amount of sputum, and 3 = very large amount of sputum. The subjects were also asked whether they had any other important observations that they would like to share with the investigator about their coughing.

Most AEs were mild in severity. No AEs were reported by the investigator based on coughing symptoms. No notable changes in spirometry parameters were observed from baseline to the end of the study in either exposure group. The most frequently reported AEs (number of subjects in the THS 2.1 and CC groups) were: nausea (4 and 5), headache (5 and 2); dizziness (4 and 2); presyncope (1 and 4); and abdominal pain (0 and 2).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s20"><title>Discussion</title><p>Smokers can modulate their nicotine intake by controlling their smoking profile, including the number of heatsticks/CCs used, duration and volume of puffs, or the depth/intensity of inhalation.<sup><xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> We did not apply a fixed puffing regimen, but instead the subjects controlled their own puffing behavior, which allows for a realistic evaluation of a tobacco consumer product. In the <italic>ad libitum</italic> phase, the products were used between 6:30 to 23:00, and blood samples were scheduled depending on the subject&#x02019;s specific use of the products. An advantage of this adaptive approach is that the C<sub>peak</sub> and C<sub>trough</sub> are estimated more reliably than with a fixed time sampling schedule. In fact, the peak exposure is likely to occur immediately after the product use, and the lowest nicotine concentration associated with the peak may occur either just before the product use or before the next product use.</p><p content-type="indent">The pharmacokinetics of nicotine following smoking a single CC, including <italic>t</italic>

<sub>max</sub> and <italic>t</italic>
<sub>peak</sub> following single and <italic>ad libitum</italic> use of the THS 2.1 were not <italic>markedly</italic> different from those obtained using CCs, which suggests that the THS 2.1 delivers nicotine via inhalation and absorption similar to CCs. However, the THS 2.1 provided lower exposure to nicotine of about 30% compared with CCs, based on AUC<sub>last</sub> and C<sub>max</sub>. This difference could be explained by incomplete adaptation to the THS 2.1, and that each THS 2.1 heatstick delivered 0.3mg nicotine (per ISO smoking machine) compared with up to 1mg for each CC in this study. Following <italic>ad libitum</italic> product use, incomplete adaptation may also cause greater variability of the C<sub>peak</sub> and C<sub>trough</sub> values observed for the THS 2.1 compared with CCs. Similar to single use exposure, nicotine exposure in terms of C<sub>peak</sub> and C<sub>trough</sub> following <italic>ad libitum</italic> use was lower with the THS 2.1 compared with CCs; this could explain the greater number of CCs used per day (16.7 CCs/d) compared with THS 2.1 heatsticks (10.9 heatsticks/d) during <italic>ad libitum</italic> use.</p><p content-type="indent">The QSU-Brief measures the desire to smoke and was considered to be a pharmacodynamic measure of this subjective effect to inform about the craving control of THS 2.1 compared with CCs.<sup><xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25&#x02013;27</xref></sup> Our results show that the magnitude and the time course of the reduction in the urge to smoke following single and <italic>ad libitum</italic> use were comparable for both products. Overall, the rapid delivery of nicotine and the reduction in the urge to smoke suggest that the THS 2.1 can satisfy smokers, and this system could offer a viable replacement for CCs.</p><p content-type="indent">Limitations of the study are that it involved a relatively small sample (28 subjects) and that the study duration was short (1 week). Furthermore, subjects could use the THS 2.1 on just 2 days, which is too short to allow the subjects to fully adapt their smoking behaviors to a new product.<sup><xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> In order to assess whether the THS has the potential to induce switching behavior at a sufficient level, other studies are required that take into account the complexity involved in smoking behaviors under real-world conditions. Such longer-term studies are underway to assess the acceptance and possible role of the THS-heated tobacco platform to switch adult smokers to reduced risk tobacco-containing products. Despite the limitations of this study, the results suggest that the THS 2.1 effectively delivers nicotine and reduces the urge to smoke, similarly to CCs, and warrants further development work.</p></sec><sec id="s21"><title>Supplementary Material</title><p>
