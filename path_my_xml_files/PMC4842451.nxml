neuromuscular facilitation neck pattern exercise on the ability to control the trunk and
balance in chronic stroke patients. [Subjects and Methods] A total of 30 study subjects
were selected and randomly divided into an experimental group of 15 subjects, who received
the proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation neck pattern exercise, and a control group
of 15 subjects, who received a traditional rehabilitation treatment. [Results]
Statistically significant changes in all the items of the Trunk Impairment Scale, the
Trunk Impairment Scale total score, and the Berg Balance Scale were observed in both the
experimental group and the control group. significant between-group differences were found
in all items among the subitems of the Trunk Impairment Scale except the static sitting

However, few studies have investigated the improvement in trunk control in chronic stroke

exercise on the ability to control the trunk and balance in chronic stroke patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects of this study were patients who were diagnosed with stroke through CT or MRI

The subjects had a duration of illness of six months or longer, a MMSE-K
score over 24, manual muscle testing results for neck flexion and extension graded as better
than fair, and the ability to sit and stand independently. Those who were incapable of
training, including patients with high-risk heart disease or musculoskeletal disease, were
excluded from the sample. Prior to the experiment, the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at
Daegu Fatima Hospital approved the study. This research was conducted after signed
agreements to participate in the study were received from the patients and their
guardians.</p><p>After 30 research subjects were selected, they were divided randomly and evenly into an
experimental group in which the PNF neck pattern was applied and a control group in which
traditional rehabilitation therapy was applied. Traditional rehabilitation therapy was
applied daily for 30 minutes to both groups five times a week for six weeks. The
experimental group received additional application of the PNF neck pattern, while the
control group received additional application of 30 minutes more traditional rehabilitation
therapy per day, three times a week for six weeks. One physiotherapist conducted all the
exercises, which are described below.</p><p>First, the patients were instructed to assume the preparation position. The patients sat on
a mat that was knee height with their feet placed shoulder width apart and their hands on
their knees. For the neck pattern, both the flexion pattern and extension pattern were
performed. The neck-flexion pattern exercise was performed as follows. The experimenter
stood behind the patient on the right side and put the tip of his right finger below the
chin of the patient. The experimenter then put his left hand slightly left of the top of the
patient&#x02019;s head in a diagonal direction. The experimenter pulled the patient&#x02019;s chin so that
it was lifted and the neck was extended. Hence, in the preparation position, the patient&#x02019;s
head was tilted and rotated towards the right side. The preliminary exercise was performed
with sufficient explanation so that the patient could accurately recognize the exercise
direction. The experimenter then issued the following instructions to the patient: &#x0201c;pull
your chin in&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;look at your left hip.&#x0201d; Hence, the patient&#x02019;s head, neck, and upper
thoracic spine had sufficient extension, left rotation, and left lateral flexion. The
experimenter provided resistance against left rotation, flexion, and lateral flexion by
providing traction to the patient&#x02019;s chin. The identical method was applied on the opposite
side.</p><p>For the neck extension pattern, the preparation position was the same as described above.
The experimenter stood behind the patient on the right side. He put his right thumb on the
right side of the patient&#x02019;s chin and placed his left hand slightly right of the top of the
patient&#x02019;s head in a diagonal direction. The patient assumed the preparation position in
which the chin was pulled, the neck was flexed, and the head was rotated and tilted to the
left. The experimenter issued the following instructions to the patient: &#x0201c;lift your chin&#x0201d;
and then &#x0201c;lift your head to look above.&#x0201d; Hence, the patient&#x02019;s head, neck, and upper thoracic
spine had complete extension, right rotation, and right lateral flexion. Resistance against
right rotation, extension, and lateral flexion was provided during the exercise in order to
induce strong muscle contractions.</p><p>In this study, the Trunk Impairment Scale (TIS) was used to evaluate the ability to control
the trunk. The TIS consists of 17 subitems in three categories: static sitting balance,
dynamic sitting balance, and coordination. Because the TIS has high reliability and
validity, it is used to evaluate the degree of motor damage to the trunk in stroke
patients<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the TIS, static sitting
balance has a minimum score of zero and a maximum score of seven, dynamic sitting balance
has a minimum score of zero and a maximum score of 10, and coordination has a minimum score
of zero and a maximum score of 6; the maximum TIS score is 23. The Berg Balance Scale (BBS),
which has proven reliability and validity, was used to examine the ability of patients to
balance before and after the exercise<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.
The BBS consists of 14 items, each of which has a minimum score of zero and a maximum score
of four; the maximum score is 56.</p><p>PASW Statistics for Windows 18.0 was used to analyze results of the experiments. The
nonparametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test was performed to compare the TIS and BBS scores
before and after the intervention. The nonparametric Mann-Whitney test was performed for
comparisons between groups. The statistical significance level &#x003b1; was set at 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Statistically significant changes in all items of the TIS, TIS total score, and BBS were

functions of the hands and the upper limbs<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Improvement in the ability to control the trunk is necessary to
enhance the ability to balance in chronic stroke patients<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Hence, this study applied the PNF neck pattern to chronic stroke
patients in order to investigate the effects on their ability to control the trunk and to
maintain balance.</p><p>Mobility and ability of the trunk to maintain balance are important factors in the
functional independence of stroke patients<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Moreover, improved motor control of the trunk is known to assist
independent performance of daily tasks in stroke patients<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Both the experimental group and the control group showed a
significant difference in the BBS and TIS after the intervention. This implies that both
traditional rehabilitation therapy and PNF neck pattern exercises are effective in enhancing
the ability of chronic stroke patients to control the trunk and to maintain balance.</p><p>Using the TIS, Park predicted falling among patients with subacute stroke, reporting that a
TIS score between 14.5 and 15.5 corresponded to the range of risk for falling<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the present study, both groups showed
average TIS scores of 14.0 before the intervention, which was within the range of risk for
falling. After the intervention, the average improved to 18.5 in the experimental group and
15.7 in the control group. The improvement in both groups exceeded the range of risk for
falling. The experimental group showed greater improvement than the control group did. It is
possible that the PNF neck pattern exercise contributed to the ability to control the trunk
and maintain balance more than the traditional rehabilitation therapy did, eventually
decreasing the risk of falling. Moreover, Park observed that better TIS dynamic sitting
balance was connected to a lower risk of falling. In the present study, significant results
were found for all items except TIS static sitting in the between-group comparison. This
indicates that the PNF neck pattern exercise resulted in stronger improvement in TIS dynamic
sitting balance, TIS coordination, and BBS scores compared with the traditional
rehabilitation therapy. In particular, the improvement in dynamic sitting balancing was
expected to contribute to the prevention of falling<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup></p><p>Overall, the PNF neck pattern exercise was shown to have a positive effect on increasing
the ability to control the trunk and maintain balance in the chronic stroke patients in this
study. However, because of the small number of subjects, the results of the study cannot be
generalized. Thus, in future research, studies should be conducted to apply the PNF neck
pattern exercise to a large sample of chronic stroke patients.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Gong</surname><given-names>W</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>The effects of trunk stability exercise using PNF on the
