However, toxicity was a concern and without continued treatment the efficacy disappeared by 24 months. We hypothesized that a two-year course of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) would be safer, better tolerated and produce longer lasting improvements than CYC.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>METHODS</title><p id="P3">Patients with SSc-ILD meeting defined dyspnea, pulmonary function and high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) criteria were randomized in a double-blind, two-arm trial at 14 medical centers. MMF (target dose 1500 mg twice daily) was administered for 24 months in one arm and oral CYC (target dose 2&#x000b7;0 mg/kg/day) administered for 12 months followed by placebo for 12 months in the other arm. The primary endpoint, change in forced vital capacity as a percent of the predicted normal value (FVC %) over the course of 24 months, was assessed in a modified intention-to-treat analysis using an inferential joint model combining a mixed effects model for longitudinal outcomes and a survival model to handle non-ignorable missing data. The study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00883129, and is closed.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>RESULTS</title><p id="P4">Between November, 2009, and January, 2013, 142 patients were randomized. 126 patients (63 MMF; 63 CYC) with acceptable baseline HRCT studies and at least one outcome measure were included in the analysis. The adjusted FVC % (primary endpoint) improved from baseline to 24 months by 2.17 in the MMF arm (95% CI, 0.53&#x02013;3.84) and 2&#x000b7;86 in the CYC arm (95% confidence interval 1&#x000b7;19&#x02013;4&#x000b7;58) with no significant between-treatment difference (p=0&#x000b7;24), indicating that the trial was negative for the primary endpoint. However, in a post-hoc analysis of the primary endpoint, within-treatment improvements from baseline to 24 months were noted in both the CYC and MMF arms. A greater number of patients on CYC than on MMF prematurely withdrew from study drug (32 vs 20) and failed treatment (2 vs 0), and the time to stopping treatment was significantly shorter in the CYC arm (p=0&#x000b7;019). Sixteen deaths occurred (11 CYC; 5 MMF) with most due to progressive ILD. Leukopenia (30 vs 4 patients) and thrombocytopenia (4 vs 0 patients) occurred more often in patients treated with CYC. In post-hoc analyses, within- (but not between-) treatment improvements were also noted in defined secondary outcomes including skin score, dyspnea and whole-lung HRCT scores.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>INTERPRETATION</title><p id="P5">Treatment of SSc-ILD with MMF for two years or CYC for one year both resulted in significant improvements in pre-specified measures of lung function, dyspnea, lung imaging, and skin disease over the 2-year course of the study. While MMF was better tolerated and associated with less toxicity, the hypothesis that it would have greater efficacy at 24 months than CYC was not confirmed. These findings support the potential clinical impact of both CYC and MMF for progressive SSc-ILD, as well as the current preference for MMF due to its better tolerability and toxicity profile.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>FUNDING</title><p id="P6">National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute/National Institutes of Health with drug supply provided by Hoffmann-La Roche/Genentech.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Scleroderma-related interstitial lung disease</kwd><kwd>mycophenolate mofetil</kwd><kwd>oral cyclophosphamide</kwd><kwd>lung function</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S7"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p id="P7">Progressive interstitial lung disease (ILD) is the leading cause of death attributed to systemic sclerosis (SSc)<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> and treatment options are limited.

Contrary to the central component of the primary study hypothesis, no significant difference was observed between the two treatment arms in the course of FVC % over 24 months. If considered in isolation, one would consider this as a &#x0201c;negative study&#x0201d;. However, the failure to identify a difference between treatments was not due to a lack of efficacy. As hypothesized, both treatments produced improvements in lung function, making this the first prospective randomized controlled trial to document a positive response in patients with SSc-ILD after treatment with MMF. The average peak improvement from baseline occurred at 18&#x02013;21 months in both treatment arms (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>), similar to findings with CYC from the SLS I study. What did not occur as originally hypothesized was the nearly-complete loss of efficacy beyond 18 months (i.e., beyond 6 months after the study drug was discontinued) in those patients assigned to the CYC arm. While the average FVC % did decline between 21 and 24 months, this occurred in both arms and was modest in magnitude.</p><p id="P31">It is important to consider alternative explanations, other than loss of efficacy, for the observed decline in lung function between 18&#x02013;24 months. One consideration is that the values between 18 and 24 months reflect a weighted mean effect &#x02013; i.e. the impact of having subjects who prematurely withdrew from treatment (and did worse) return for the final outcome measures. Indeed, at the 24 month time-point there were 15 such patients in the CYC arm and 4 in the MMF arm. Furthermore, in a secondary analysis we observed that the change in FVC % from baseline to 24 months improved over time in the overwhelming majority of patients who completed therapy (CYC = 80&#x000b7;6%; MMF = 75&#x000b7;5%) whereas the majority of subjects who had prematurely withdrawn from treatment but returned for the primary outcome measure experienced a loss of lung function over time (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). The net impact of including data from all subjects at the 24-month time point would therefore appear as a terminal decline in lung function.</p><p id="P32">Applying this explanation, the observed differences in treatment responses between SLS I and SLS II might represent the recent trend of using alternative types of disease modifying therapy in those doing poorly with CYC. Of the 15 subjects in SLS II who withdrew from or failed treatment but returned for final study outcome measures, 12 indicated that they were switched to potentially disease-modifying therapy (MMF, intravenous CYC, rituximab, tocilizumab, intravenous immunoglobulin, or azathioprine) and these alternative therapies could have influenced the results.</p><p id="P33">Another possible explanation for the outcome difference between SLS I and II is that the SLS II patient population might have been more responsive to treatment. In a post-hoc analysis of SLS I data we had identified three independent baseline variables that appeared to predict responsiveness to CYC therapy.<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> As previously reported,<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> the subjects enrolled into SLS II exhibited significantly more dyspnea at baseline (BDI score, p&#x0003c;0&#x000b7;0001) and more extensive lung fibrosis (QLF-LM score, p&#x0003c;0&#x000b7;04) than did those enrolled into SLS I. These features represent two of the three baseline characteristics that may predict a superior response to CYC.<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> If so, superior responsiveness could have contributed to a better course of disease between 18&#x02013;24 months.</p><p id="P34">While improvements from baseline in % predicted FVC of 3.0&#x000b1;1.2% and 3.3&#x000b1;1.1% were observed within the CYC and MMF treatment arms, respectively, one may question the clinical relevance of these relatively modest changes. However, the same response patterns observed for the change over time in FVC % (the primary outcome) occurred for a number of pre-defined secondary outcomes. Both treatments resulted in improvements from baseline to 24 months in skin thickness, self-reported dyspnea, and the quantitative extent of ILD (QILD) in the whole lung, even though no between-treatment differences were found for these outcome measures. In most cases, improvements in the mRSS and TDI exceeded pre-defined minimal clinically important changes.<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> Collectively, the secondary outcomes reinforce the impact of both CYC and MMF on lung function and suggest a clinically relevant effect. Other secondary outcomes, including cough and general and scleroderma-specific health-related quality of life measures, are currently being analyzed and will be reported separately. As already noted, the absence of a true placebo is an important limitation and the clinical significance of all findings should be considered inferential rather than direct.</p><p id="P35">The only significant between-treatment differences in pre-specified efficacy outcomes were that the DLCO %-predicted and DL/VA %-predicted decreased less during the course of treatment in the MMF arm than in the CYC arm (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> &#x00026; <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 3A &#x00026; 3B, web appendix pp 14&#x02013;15</xref>), suggesting a possible benefit of MMF in moderating the destructive effects of SSc-ILD on gas transfer. A positive effect of MMF on pulmonary vascular remodeling has been suggested by its protective effects in a rat model of pulmonary arterial hypertension.<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> In an observational study in patients with scleroderma-related pulmonary hypertension, treatment with MMF also resulted in a survival advantage.<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup></p><p id="P36">Since scleroderma-associated pulmonary vasculopathy could affect several outcomes including dyspnea, DLCO and early withdrawal, patients known to have clinically significant resting pulmonary hypertension requiring treatment were specifically excluded from the trial. While an ECHO was not required per-protocol, 121 of the 142 patients (85%) had an ECHO and an additional 14 (10%) had undergone RHC prior to enrollment, only 3 of whom had values (2 of the 3 only slightly) exceeding the investigators&#x02019; agreed-on thresholds for pulmonary hypertension warranting therapy (estimated pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) of &#x0003e;45 mm Hg on ECHO or a mean PAP &#x0003e;30 mm Hg on RHC). Furthermore, of the 20 patients with a DLCO &#x0003c;40% predicted, cases that required an ECHO or RHC to exclude pulmonary hypertension, only one patient (who was assigned to CYC) had a mild elevation of mean PAP on RHC and was inadvertently randomized. During the course of the trial only 2 cases (1 CYC and 1 MMF) were diagnosed with new onset of pulmonary hypertension. While ECHO estimates of PAP are not always reliable, these data make it unlikely that pulmonary hypertension was prevalent or a significant factor in the overall outcome,</p><p id="P37">In addition to predicting a differential effect of treatment on FVC % over time, part of our primary hypothesis was that MMF would be less toxic and better tolerated. Consistent with this, hematopoietic suppression (specifically leukopenia and thrombocytopenia) occurred in a greater percentage of patients treated with CYC. However, this did not translate into a greater number of pneumonias, infections, SAEs or deaths. In terms of tolerability, a greater proportion of subjects in the CYC arm discontinued the drug prematurely and assignment to CYC was associated with a significantly shorter time to premature withdrawal from study drug. Moreover, most patients in the MMF arm achieved and maintained close to the target dose of MMF, whereas the tolerated dose of CYC declined over time to approximately 75% of the target dose (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 6, web appendix p 18</xref>). The latter findings might have accounted for the apparently slower onset of improvement in FVC % predicted among patients in the CYC arm.</p><p id="P38">While deaths occurred in approximately twice as many participants in the CYC arm than in the MMF arm, neither the difference in mortality nor the time to death between the two treatments was statistically significant. However, the study was not powered to detect a mortality difference between the two treatment arms.</p><p id="P39">It is important to consider the particular strengths and weaknesses associated with this trial. As the second large multi-center clinical trial conducted by the SLS Investigators, it builds upon their past experience, extensive training and methods for standardization. We also employed a placebo-controlled RCT design using a unique drug administration protocol that allowed maintenance of blinding while administering two active drugs with different dosing and administration schedules.</p><p id="P40">On the other hand, potential limitations included the premature withdrawal of a significant proportion of subjects over the 24 month treatment phase (CYC 32/73, 43&#x000b7;8%; MMF 20/69 = 28&#x000b7;9%). However, this was partially mitigated by anticipating a 30% drop-out in the study design and employing a modified joint model in which patients were encouraged to return for study outcome measures even after premature withdrawal from treatment. Indeed, 15 patients in the CYC arm and 4 in the MMF arm who had discontinued their study medication prematurely returned for one or more of the 18&#x02013;24 month visits and these data were included in the primary analysis. However, as already noted, the majority of these patients received potentially disease-modifying therapy that could have influenced the results. While the joint model was specifically intended to minimize such biases it does not eliminate them.<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup></p><p id="P41">Another limitation was that baseline HRCT scans from 5 patients did not meet minimal image acquisition criteria and these subjects had to be excluded from the primary analysis as they lacked the requisite CT image score as a pre-specified covariate. However, in the absence of a placebo arm (as was present in SLS I), baseline fibrosis score was not identified as a statistically significant covariate in SLS II. As a result, we performed a secondary analysis using a version of the joint model that did not require a baseline HRCT fibrosis score. However, adding back these 5 missing patients had no identifiable impact on the primary outcome. There were also 11 subjects who did not have at least 3-month outcome data and who were excluded from the analysis. However, a comparison of the baseline characteristics for all 16 excluded subjects (those without baseline CT or at least a 3 month follow-up) with the 126 subjects who were included in the analysis did not reveal any consistent or significant differences except for the presence of a higher skin score of borderline significance (p=0.042) in the subjects without outcome data.</p><p id="P42">Some might also consider our choice of oral CYC over IV CYC as a limitation given evidence suggesting that IV CYC might be safer and better tolerated. However, IV CYC was not considered logistically or financially feasible for a large blinded study compared to MMF and we are left to speculate regarding its relatively efficacy, tolerability and durability compared to MMF. Finally, given that gastrointestinal (GI) involvement is a common feature of SSc and GI toxicity is commonly associated with the administration of both MMF and oral CYC, it is possible that absorption of MMF and/or CYC might have been impaired, potentially influencing the study outcomes. Indeed, GI AE&#x02019;s were the second most frequently reported category of AE&#x02019;s recorded during the course of the study (<bold>see</bold>
<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 4, web appendix p 16</xref>) although a significant between-treatment difference in the frequency of patients with GI AEs was not identified. While serum levels of MMF might have provided some insight, they were not obtained.</p><p id="P43">In summary, in patients with symptomatic SSc-ILD, we failed to find a significant difference in the primary endpoint (course of the FVC % over the 24-month trial) when comparing treatment with MMF for 24 months to CYC for 12 months followed by placebo. However, in post-hoc analyses of the primary and secondary outcomes, we found that treatment with either MMF or CYC resulted in improvements over 24 months in FVC % predicted, TDI and mRSS without any significant between-treatment differences. These responses occurred primarily between 9 and 24 months, despite the discontinuation of CYC treatment at 12 months, and they support the slow onset but potentially disease-modifying effects associated with immunosuppression in SSc-ILD. As hypothesized, MMF appeared to be better tolerated than CYC based on the time to patient withdrawal, number of treatment failures, and incidence of leukopenia and thrombocytopenia, although the latter was not associated with any difference in the incidence of infections or bleeding.

context</title></caption><sec id="S26"><title>Evidence before this study</title><p id="P45">Cyclophosphamide (CYC) was the first agent found to stabilize the progression of SSc-ILD in RCTs. Two high quality RCTs demonstrated efficacy of oral or pulse CYC compared with placebo for SSc-ILD. These findings were consistent with prior uncontrolled studies designed to assess the efficacy of CYC for SSc-ILD. However, the benefits of CYC in SSc-ILD came at the expense of a high degree of adverse effects, and an analysis of SLS I data one year after treatment cessation revealed the loss of CYC-related benefits.</p><p id="P46">Because the benefit to risk ratio of CYC for SSc-ILD is somewhat inconclusive, researchers have been actively pursuing the study of alternative agents for SSc-ILD. Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is an immunosuppressive agent with both anti-fibrotic and immunomodulatory effects and appears to be well tolerated in SSc. In a study of 172 SSc patients with or without ILD investigators found a lower frequency of clinically significant pulmonary fibrosis, as well as improved survival, in the MMF-treated subgroup (N=109), compared with the subgroup receiving other immunosuppressive medications (N=63). In another prospective trial of 13 patients with SSc-ILD, all of whom presented with a significant decrease in forced vital capacity (FVC) in the 12 months preceding trial entry, investigators observed a significant improvement in FVC after 12 months of treatment with MMF. Additional prospective, observational studies have affirmed that MMF is safe, well-tolerated and may prevent pulmonary function deterioration in SSc-ILD.</p><p id="P47">Given the favorable effects of MMF on SSc-ILD in observational studies, we designed Scleroderma Lung Study (SLS) II, the first randomized controlled trial to compare MMF and CYC for the treatment of symptomatic SSc-ILD. CYC was included as an active comparator since it is the only agent that has been found in previous RCTs to demonstrate efficacy in SSc-ILD.</p></sec><sec id="S27"><title>Added value of this study</title><p id="P49">As the only randomized controlled trial to date to assess the benefits and risks of MMF in patients with SSc-ILD, this study avoids the pitfalls and biases that limit the interpretation of observational and retrospective studies.</p></sec><sec id="S28"><title>Implications of all the available evidence</title><p id="P51">The findings from SLS II are consistent with the evidence from previous (mostly uncontrolled) studies demonstrating the efficacy of both CYC and MMF in improving lung function in patients with progressive SSc-ILD. Moreover, MMF was shown to be less toxic and better tolerated than CYC with significantly fewer withdrawals from the study medication. Concurrent improvements in skin scores suggest an overall systemic benefit and improvements in dyspnea reveal improvements in patient-centered outcomes. Taken together, these findings support the increasingly common practice of prescribing MMF for patients with symptomatic SSc-ILD.</p></sec></boxed-text></floats-group></article>
