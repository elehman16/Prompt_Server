In the human society, burns are accidents or disasters associated with injuries and wounds, which darken the beautiful images of life and reveal pain and suffering. Burn is traumatic, painful, and often debilitating,[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and is one of the most uncomfortable traumas for patients. Patients with severe burns describe the pain as the worst kind and excruciating.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] The pain of burns is often due to damaged skin or treatments created especially to change the dressings.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Changing the dressing of the burnt area is one of the most effective and painful treatments, which is usually performed daily for the patients and causes an exacerbating pain for the patients during the day. It can also delay the unbearable pain of recovery and the wound healing.</p><p>Appropriate pain control is considered the most important critical care in patients with burns. There are a variety of methods to relieve pain in patients with burns. The use of narcotic and non-narcotic drugs is the simplest and most common method of pain relief.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Morphine, which is a commonly used analgesic opium for pain relief in these patients, has unpleasant side effects such as nausea and vomiting, dizziness, drowsiness, hypotension, constipation, respiratory depression, and increased tolerance to the drug.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Most non-pharmacological methods or complementary therapies have fewer side effects and risks and can be used alone or in combination with other methods. Moreover, it is assumed that they can reduce the amount of consumed pain medications or drugs.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>In recent years, aroma therapy as a complementary method to reduce pain has been significantly used in most countries, compared to other methods. In addition, it can be used in medical programs alone or in combination with other methods, with fewer side effects and risks.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Nurses can reduce anxiety and pain in some patients in certain situations using aromatherapy.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Aromatic plant extracts and oils, aroma of flowers, and other natural fragrant materials were commonly used in ancient civilizations and even in small communities and primitive tribes to maintain health, strengthen and improve physical and mental abilities, and to dominate and influence people and forces of nature. In China, the use and application of medicinal plants and natural minerals has 1000 years of history. Fragrant materials (including herbal, mineral, and animal products such as musk and amber) had extensive uses for aromatherapy. Today, aromatherapy is one of the natural remedies used in holistic medicine in China.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Thousands of years ago, aromatic plant oils were used in Egypt and India to treat various diseases.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Today, aromatherapy has even been accepted by the United States' State Board of Nursing as part of holistic nursing.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Inhalation aromatherapy using different essential oils can be effective in reducing pain, stress, anxiety, fatigue, and depression. However, controversy exists regarding the effects of different fragrances in different literatures as the exact mechanism of the effect of aromatherapy through these fragrances is unknown.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] In the standard method of inhalation aromatherapy, the desired aroma is chosen based on the purpose of the treatment and then inhaled by the patient by soaking a cloth with the desired essential oil or using an aroma diffuser.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p><italic>Rosa damascena</italic> is one the most important roses in the world and the most famous plant in the history of gardening (this flower is one of the 308 species of the Rosaceae family). It contains vitamins C, A, B1, B2, B3, and K, citric acid, malic acid, tannis, pectin, flavonoids, and carotenoids.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Some studies have reported the palliative, sleep-inducing, anticonvulsant, and relaxation effects of rose.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] However, few studies have been conducted in relation to its effect on pain relief.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Therefore, the effects of inhalation of <italic>R. damascena</italic> essence on pain after dressing wounds in patients with burns has been evaluated in this study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ATERIALS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>This was a randomized clinical trial registered with the code IRCT201302249759N4 at the Iran Clinical Trials Registry center. Convenience sampling was performed on 50 patients in two groups of experimental and control in the burn ward of Besat Therapeutic and Educational Center of Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran, from May to October 2013. Inclusion criteria were: Being a burn patient of 18&#x02013;65 years of age, able to speak and having vision, able to communicate effectively, having second-degree or second- and third-degree burn wounds, and lack of inhalation or electrical burns, burns on the face and the eyes, history of allergy or respiratory diseases, or deliberate burns. In contrast, the exclusion criteria included showing allergy to rose essence inhalation during the study and unwillingness to participate in or continue the study for any reason.</p><p>The minimum sample size was calculated as 23 patients per group. It was calculated through the formula of determination of the number of samples in two independent groups, and by considering the significance level of &#x003b1; = 0.05, statistical power of 80%, and 95% confidence level, according to the study by Hadi and Hanid.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Considering a 15% sample loss, 27 people were evaluated in each group, making a total of 54 patients. During the intervention, two subjects of the experimental group were excluded from the study due to discharge from the hospital and intolerance to aroma inhalation. In the control group also, two people were excluded from the study due to discharge from the hospital and lack of cooperation. The researcher obtained permission from the Ethics Committee of Hamadan University of Medical Sciences and registered the study in the Iran Registry of Clinical Trials center. Then, the researcher referred to Besat Therapeutic and Educational Center and obtained written informed consent forms from the patients who met the inclusion criteria. The patients were allocated to the intervention group and the control group using a coin according to trial profile [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Trial profile</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJNMR-21-247-g001"/></fig><p>Sampling was performed through gradual referral of the patients and evaluation of patients who met the inclusion criteria. It should be noted that all the patients received analgesic and sedative drugs, including routine injections of morphine sulfate 5 mg and diazepam 5 mg, before (1 h before wound dressing) and after wound dressing (immediately after wound dressing and returning to their room). The data collection tool was a questionnaire consisting of two parts. The first part of the questionnaire included questions on age, gender, the leading cause of burns, and depth and breadth of the burns. The second part of the questionnaire evaluated pain intensity using a visual analog scale (VAS). The VAS for pain intensity was based on the patients' subjective assessment. Its value was determined on a longitudinal 10 cm axis graded from 0 to 10, with 0 representing no pain, and 1&#x02013;3 indicating mild pain, 4&#x02013;6 showing moderate pain intensity, and 7&#x02013;10 indicating severe pain.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p><p>First, the questionnaire was read to the patients by the researcher and was completed based on self-report.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Then, pain intensity was recorded 30 min before entering the wound dressing room. The intervention was performed for 2 days. For 20 min, patients in the intervention group inhaled five drops of 40% Damask Rose essence in distilled water. In the control group, the patients inhaled five drops of distilled water as placebo through the same procedure. Using a pipette, the essential oil of rose essence or distilled water was dropped on a 10 &#x000d7; 10 cm gauze which was attached to the collar of the patient's shirt, about 20 cm from their nose.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] This was performed by one of the unit nurses, as an assistant, without the researcher's knowledge (the researcher's nose was covered with an aromatic mask). After 20 min, the gauze was detached from the patient's shirt by the assistant and the patient was sent to the wound dressing room. Patients' pain intensity was measured by the researcher 15 and 30 min after they left the dressing room using the VAS. Inhalation aromatherapy was performed using rose essence on two consecutive days during the morning shift. The patients in the experimental group received aromatherapy in a separate room. Data were analyzed using SPSS software (version 18; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and descriptive and inferential statistics.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>R<sc>ESULTS</sc></title><p>Most of the patients were male (60% in the experimental group and 52% in the control group).

The mean age of patients in this study was 30 years. The increased incidence of burns in young males might be due to their professions that involved greater contact with caustic substances and fire. The majority of patients had education lower than diploma (90%) and was employed (60%) and married (78%), which shows the effect of education, job, and family troubles on burn accidents. The most common cause of burns among adults in this study was flame (96%). The mean duration of hospitalization in this study was 22.66 days. The high mean of hospitalization duration in this study compared to other studies, in addition to factors such as quality of care and treatment, extent and depth of burns, and age might be due to factors such as the waiting list for surgery and not being able to pay the high healthcare costs.</p><p>The mean extent of burns in this study was 24.04%. The depth of the burns in this study was mostly second degree and third degree (50%). The extent and depth of burns depend on how the burns occurred, their cause, gender, duration of exposure to caustic substances, first aid, and cooling the burnt area. These factors have been reported differently at different centers for burns.</p><p>The findings indicated a significant decrease in pain level in the experimental group compared to the control group. The mean distribution of pain scores before and after the intervention in the experimental and control groups was evaluated using independent <italic>t</italic>-test. This showed a significant difference at 15 and 30 min after the intervention on the first and second days of intervention. The statistical tests showed significant differences between the severity of pain in the two groups at 15 min (<italic>P</italic> = 0.010) and 30 min after treatment on the first and second days (<italic>P</italic> = 0.010). Therefore, inhalation aromatherapy using rose essence has an effect on pain reduction in patients with burns after wound dressing.</p><p>Pain caused by burns is a unique and complex challenge for all healthcare workers and patients. In spite of the advances in the treatment of burn wounds, the pain due to burns is generally inadequately treated.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] Uncontrolled pain due to burns is associated with depression, chronic pain, and the desire to commit suicide after getting discharged.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] A large number of patients complained of pain before the interventions and revealed that the daily care procedures such as removal of dressings, cleaning, debridement, and dressing burns were the main reasons for their pain.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Thus, an increase in pain after dressing was not unexpected. Nevertheless, as the results of this study show, this increase in pain was lower in the experimental group compared to the control group. This difference was statistically significant. Considering that untreated acute pain has serious physiological and psychological consequences, many studies have been conducted in this regard.</p><p>Han <italic>et al.</italic> studied the effect of aromatherapy with essential oils of lavender, rose, and sage on pain of dysmenorrhea in women and found that the mean pain severity scores in the aromatherapy group were significantly lower than in the group without intervention.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] This finding was consistent with the present study results regarding further reduction in pain intensity score of the aromatherapy group compared to the control group. The results of the study by Kim <italic>et al.</italic> showed that pain intensity after aromatherapy had no significant difference in the control and experimental groups.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] However, patients in the aromatherapy group had greater satisfaction regarding pain control than the patients in the control group. These results were not consistent with the present study results, and perhaps, the reason of pain in dysmenorrhea is more related to internal factors such as hormones and so on.</p><p>The reason for the significance of the results may be memory, which is a factor associated with the impact of scents. Scents trigger memories and enable the person to review the details of the events and emotions. The scent of <italic>R. damascena</italic> caused lack of focus on pain and prevented an increase in pain perception of the patients in the experimental group, as reported by Seifi <italic>et al.</italic> that positive or negative memories can influence the intensity of perceived pain.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</p><p>According to the study, aromatherapy, using <italic>R. damascena</italic> essential oils, is a moderately effective nursing intervention for pain relief from burns. In this study, age, lack of mental disorders, and lack of addiction to drugs and alcohol were the controlled variables or limitations considered by the researcher and were controlled through uniformity and homogeneity. It is recommended that a more comprehensive review of the effects of aromatherapy using <italic>R. damascena</italic> and other essential oils and other complementary medicinal techniques be performed on stress, anxiety, and pain.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>Non-pharmacological methods such as inhalation aromatherapy using <italic>R. damascena</italic> can be used in combination with analgesics to relieve pain in patients after burns, in order to reduce the consumption of narcotics and non-narcotic drugs and their several side effects and patients' various responses to analgesics.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This article was a part of the research project of Master's thesis in Medical-Surgical Nursing, registered at Hamadan University of Medical Sciences (No. 287/9/35/16/D/P).
