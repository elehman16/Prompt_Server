Patients who, at the time of surgery, were in cardiogenic shock, required renal dialysis, or had an additive EuroSCORE of more than 10 were excluded from the study. The primary end points were: time to extubation (ET), and length of stay in the PACU or ICU (PACU/ICU LOS respectively).

The resulting prolonged postoperative ventilation and intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay (LOS) were considered acceptable compromises. Rising costs and the need for faster ICU turnover due to increased demand and reduced resources led to reducing the length of ICU stay after cardiac surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Since the mid-1990s, intensified postoperative rehabilitation has established itself as the optimal approach to patient recovery. Fast-track treatment has become a popular and accepted standard because it allows for early extubation within six hours and consequently reduced LOS in the ICU and hospital [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. A significant reduction in time to extubation (ET) without compromising patient's safety has been demonstrated in numerous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Zhu <italic>et al</italic>. described in <italic>Cochrane Database Systematic Review</italic> a mean reduction of 5.99 hours (2.99 to 8.99 hours) due to implementation of a time-directed extubation protocol without increasing the risk of postoperative complications compared to standard care. Low-dose opioid anaesthesia will reduce mean ET by 7.40 hours (10.51 to 4.29 hours) compared to high-dose opioid anaesthesia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>Implementation of a dedicated fast-track protocol that allows not only for earlier extubation but also for earlier transfer from the ICU or post-anaesthetic care unit (PACU) to a step-down unit has been shown to be very effective in reducing ICU-LOS and the total length of hospital stay in retrospective studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Zhu <italic>et al</italic>. showed in a review that low-dose opioid anaesthesia was associated with 3.7 hours (&#x02212;6.98 to &#x02212;0.41) lower ICU LOS. Time-directed extubation protocols had 5.15 hours (&#x02212;8.71 to &#x02212;1.59) shorter length of stay in the ICU (0.4 to 8.7 hours) compared to conventional groups, as Zhu <italic>et al</italic>. described, although LOS in hospital was similar in both groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>Utilised in combination, this approach has been associated with both significant cost savings, and also increased ICU bed capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Most fast-track treatment protocols for cardiac surgery patients to date, however, have been implemented within the conventional ICU setting.</p><p>In general, it is possible to perform an extubation in the operating room (OR) with selected patient groups (OPCAB, MIDCAB and so on). This could make sense if no postoperative care unit is available or the fast-track concept is not continued at the ICU. There is still an ongoing discussion about the advantage of an early extubation in the OR. Straka <italic>et al</italic>. and Montes <italic>et al</italic>. were not able to show a reduced ICU LOS in cardiac surgery patients who get extubated in the OR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Chamchad <italic>et al</italic>. found in a non-randomized observational study shorter ICU and hospital LOS. With an average ICU LOS of 27 hours, this study showed no additional benefit compared to early extubation in a PACU/ICU [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>Nicholson <italic>et al</italic>. investigated in a randomized trial the effect of immediate extubation after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery compared to at least three hours ventilation before starting weaning on the pulmonary function. The study was performed in a PACU. They concluded that early extubation will not affect pulmonary function after extubation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>Our fast-track concept consists of direct postoperative treatment in a PACU with the primary goal of early extubation, followed by transfer to a step-down unit as soon as specific discharge criteria are met [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, no prospective randomized study has been published which compares fast-track treatment in the ICU versus fast-track treatment in the PACU. The hypothesis of the study was that patients treated in the PACU would be extubated earlier, and be discharged to a step-down unit earlier than patients treated in the ICU. Accordingly, the objectives of our study were to compare ET and LOS in the PACU or ICU.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The study was approved by our local ethics committee (Ethics Committee, Medical Faculty, University of Leipzig, Haertelstrasse 16&#x02013;18, 04107 Leipzig, Reference number 097&#x02013;2008, trial registration number ISRCTN71768341, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN71768341/">http://www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN71768341/</ext-link>, registered 11 March 2014), and was conducted as a prospective, randomized, single-blinded, single-centre trial.</p><p>For each patient, written informed consent was obtained prior to any protocol-related activities. As part of this procedure, the principal investigator or designee explained orally and in writing the nature, duration, and purpose of the study in such a manner that the patient was aware of the potential risks, inconveniences, or adverse effects that may occur. The patient was informed that he/she was free to withdraw from the study at any time. The patient received all information that was required by local regulations and International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines.</p><p>During the premedication visit the day before surgery, every patient scheduled to undergo CABG, valve surgery, or combined CABG and valve surgery was screened for inclusion in the study (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

Inclusion criteria were: haemodynamically stable (systolic blood pressure &#x0003e;90 mmHg and heart rate &#x0003c;120 bpm; adrenaline or noradrenaline &#x0003c;0.04 mcg/kg/min), normothermic (&#x0003e;36&#x000b0;C core body temperature), and no bleeding. Exclusion criteria followed risk factors identified by Constantinides <italic>et al</italic>. and Akhtar <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]: impaired left ventricular function (ejection fraction below 35%), cardiac assist devices pre- or postoperative and cardiopulmonary instability postoperative (high inotropic support, lactate &#x0003e;5 mmol/l, Horowitz index below 200) After the decision to include the patient into the study, the patient was randomized to either postoperative care in the PACU (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;100) or ICU (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;100). For that purpose an envelope was picked out of a box containing 200 sealed envelopes (100 for PACU, 100 for ICU admission) and removed from the box subsequently. A further intra-operative exclusion criterion was lack of an available bed in either the PACU or ICU. In such cases, the patient was not randomized, but was sent to the unit with an available bed, and excluded from the study and further analysis. The medical and nursing staff in the ICU and PACU had been informed about the design and the conduct of the study but were not informed as to which patients were enrolled in the study.</p><p>Data collection and analysis was performed by an independent person who was not part of the anaesthetic, surgical or ICU team, and who was not blinded to treatment allocation.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Fast-track anaesthesia protocol</title><p>Anaesthetic management consisted of oral premedication with clorazepate dipotassium (20 to 40 mg) the evening before and midazolam (3.75 to 7.5 mg) on the day of surgery. Anaesthesia was induced with fentanyl (0.2 mg) and propofol (1.5 to 2 mg/kg). A single dose of rocuronium (0.6 mg/kg) was used to facilitate intubation. Analgesia was maintained throughout the case with a continuous infusion of remifentanil (0.2 mcg/kg/min), and for hypnosis during the pre- and post-cardiopulmonary bypass (CBP) period sevoflurane (0.8 to 1.1 minimum alveolar concentration (MAC)) was administered whereas during CPB a continuous propofol infusion (3 mg/kg/h) was used. A recruitment manoeuvre was carried out prior to weaning from CPB in order to prevent atelectasis. An external convective warming system with an underbody blanket (Bairhugger&#x02122;, Arizant Healthcare; Eden Prairie, MN, USA) was used after weaning from CPB to ensure a core temperature of at least 36&#x000b0;C was maintained. For early postoperative analgesia, 1 g paracetamol was administered intravenously to each patient before skin closure. In difference to other studies, we did not include all patients or selected fast-track patients only preoperatively. All patients received the fast-track anaesthesia in the OR. We carefully selected fast-track patients at the end of surgery following the criteria identified as risk factors for fast-track failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The final decision to continue the fast-track protocol postoperatively was taken after the end of surgery. As our primary end point was postoperative ventilation time, we defined fast-track failure as postoperative ventilation of more than six hours. That was decided due the literature research where it ranged between three and nine hours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Treatment in PACU</title><p>All patients were transferred to the PACU intubated, mechanically ventilated with a remifentanil infusion of 0.1 mcg/kg/min. Administration of hypnotic agents was discontinued in the OR.</p><p>Postoperative analgesia consisted of an bolus of piritramide (0.1 mg/kg) on discontinuation of the remifentanil infusion, followed by bolus doses as required in 2 to 4 mg aliquots, plus regular paracetamol (1 g every six hours) to achieve a pain score between 2 and 4 on an analogue pain scale from 0 to 10. Patients were extubated when they were conscious and obeyed commands, had stable spontaneous ventilation with pressure support of 10 to 12 cmH<sub>2</sub>O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH<sub>2</sub>O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO<sub>2</sub>) of &#x02264;0.4, were haemodynamically stable, not bleeding (&#x02264;100 ml/h), and with no significant electrocardiographic abnormalities.</p><p>All patients received non-invasive bi-level positive airway pressure ventilation via a face mask for one hour (Elisee 350&#x02122;, Saime, Savigny-le-Temple, France), immediately after extubation. Initially non-invasive ventilation was commenced at a pressure support of 10 to 15 cm H<sub>2</sub>O and a PEEP of 5 cmH<sub>2</sub>O. The FiO<sub>2</sub> was 0.4. During the period of non-invasive ventilation the pressure support was adapted to patients&#x02019; needs.</p><p>Criteria for discharge to the intermediate care unit (IMC) were that patients must be awake, cooperative, haemodynamically stable (without inotropes) and have both acceptable respiratory pattern and blood gas analysis (pO<sub>2</sub>&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;70 mmHg, pCO<sub>2</sub>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;50 mmHg).

A pain scale was not used on a regular basis for assessing pain. The need for an analgesic medication was estimated by nurses. Extubation criteria were identical to those in the PACU. Non-invasive ventilation after extubation was not implemented routinely.

We were able to demonstrate a reduction of ventilation time and a significantly reduced utilisation of ICU capacity after cardiac surgery. Although we did not calculate the cost savings, Cheng <italic>et al</italic>. have clearly shown that early extubation results in reduced costs and better resource utilisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Hantschel <italic>et al</italic>. have also demonstrated that postoperative treatment in a PACU after cardiac surgery results in a 52% cost reduction compared to conventional ICU treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Opening a PACU for 8.5 hours a day should lead to reduced personnel costs compared to a 24-hour ICU.</p><p>An ET of less than six hours after cardiac surgery is considered an important criterion for successful fast-tracking after cardiac surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In the PACU group 97% of the patients fulfilled this criterion but only 33% in the ICU group (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c;0.001). In a recent review, Zhu <italic>et al</italic>. showed that using a low-dose-opioid anaesthesia reduces ventilation times by 7.40 hours. Using a weaning protocol reduced ventilation times by 5.99 hours. In our study, we were able to reduce ventilation times by 6.46 hours, which is comparable to the reduction reported in other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Our protocol used low-dose opioid anaesthesia with the short-acting opioid remifentanil. We defined a weaning protocol, which included early stop of anaesthesia, a protocol-driven postoperative pain management and non-invasive ventilation after extubation for at least 60 minutes.</p><p>Another fast-track criterion is reduced LOS in ICU, usually defined as less than 24 hours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. According to this criterion, successful fast-track-treatment was achieved in 95% of the PACU patients compared to 71% patients in the ICU group (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c;0.001). Zhu <italic>et al</italic>. reported in a review a reduction in ICU LOS for low-dose-opioid anaesthesia of 3.7 hours (&#x02212;6.98 to &#x02212;0.41) and by using a weaning protocol of 5.15 hours (&#x02212;8.71 to &#x02212;1.59) compared to high-dose-opioid anaesthesia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In our study, we achieved a reduction in PACU/ICU LOS by 14.6 hours to 3.3 hours. This early discharge to a step-down unit allows using an ICU bed more than once a day. Gooch <italic>et al</italic>. developed a model of demand elasticity of ICU bed utilization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The authors discussed that ICU beds created their own demand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Under the model of demand elasticity the case mix of patients in the ICU changed depending on bed availability. If enough beds are available or no actual patient needs an ICU bed, it is more likely that patients in the ICU who are not as critically ill do not benefit from ICU stay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. By bypassing the ICU for fast-track patients, we possibly reduced this effect of demand elasticity and were able to show a reduction in ICU bed utilization. Still, if we included the readmission and direct transfers from the PACU to the ICU, we found a significant reduction for ICU LOS of 14.4 hours (secondary ICU LOS PACU vs. ICU 3.5 to 17.9 hours).</p><p>Published figures for fast-track failure rates range from 11% to 49% depending on the patient population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In contrast to studies that included all patients undergoing cardiac surgery, our study population was preselected according to our existing fast-track protocol. We primarily excluded patients with a defined risk for fast-track failure during the premedication visit (patients who were scheduled for emergency surgery, were in cardiogenic shock, were dialysis dependent, or had an additive EuroSCORE of more than 10) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Another explanation for the low fast-track failure rate of 5% for the PACU group is the fact that the final decision for inclusion of the patient to fast-track treatment was made at the end of the surgery. Wong <italic>et al</italic>. identified need for inotropic support and bleeding as risk factors for delayed extubation as well as delayed LOS in ICU [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In our study, 52 out of the 423 patients primarily included were excluded before randomisation because of hemodynamic instability or bleeding at the end of the operation. This underlines the hypothesis that not only careful preselection of potential fast-track patients during the premedication visit is important, but also that re-evaluation of patient suitability at the end of the operation can lead to a reduction of fast-track failure. The relatively high fast-track failure rate for the ICU group (67% time to extubation &#x0003e;6 hours and 29% PACU/ICU LOS &#x0003e;24 hours) may be attributable to several factors: first, the much better physician-to-patient ratio in the PACU (1:3 in the PACU vs. 1:12 in the ICU) allows the physician to effectively implement and manage an early goal-directed therapy. Since the study from Rivers <italic>et al</italic>. in septic patients we know that early hemodynamic stabilisation is beneficial for the patient and this is certainly also true for cardiac fast-track patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Several other studies have shown that an early goal-directed fluid management in postoperative cardiac surgery patients results in an improved hemodynamic stability and can reduce ventilation time and ICU LOS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Second, due to the fact that one physician in the ICU cares for 12 patients the preselected fast-track patients will not get the same attention as the patient who really needs ICT. One to two severely compromised patients out of the 12 will result in the fact that weaning of the fast-track patient on ICU will be delayed. Kumar <italic>et al</italic>. have shown that the presence of an intensivist results in reduced ETs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Third, the limited opening times for the PACU may positively motivate the involved staff to treat the patients optimally including early extubation and hemodynamic and respiratory stabilisation so that the patient can be transferred to the IMC for further treatment.</p><p>Also, the more focused adherence to the fast-track and enhanced-recovery principles including specifications for medication, postoperative pain control and discharge criteria favours the PACU compared to the ICU. van Mastrigt <italic>et al</italic>. showed in a meta-analysis that a defined weaning-and-extubation protocol is an important key to reduced intensive care LOS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Although this protocol was the same for the PACU and the ICU, the more disciplined execution of the fast-track protocol and application of non-invasive ventilation in our PACU might be another important factor for success of early extubation. In a prospective randomized study, Zarbock <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated a significant reduction in reintubation and readmission to ICU/IMC in cardiac surgery patients using continuous positive airway pressure therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p>We found a lower incidence of reintubation in the PACU with 2.5% (five) vs. 5% in the ICU (ten) patients and a lower readmission rate of the PACU (four) vs. the ICU (seven) patients from step-down unit (IMC) to the ICU without reaching significance. Zhu <italic>et al</italic>. reported a risk of reintubation in the fast-track group of 1.4% and in the conventional group of 1.7%, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], which is lower as in our study. However, this study is underpowered to allow any conclusion to the reintubation rate compared to other studies.</p><p>The incidences of low cardiac output syndrome, prolonged respiratory insufficiency, cardiac arrest, and death tended to be lower in the PACU group without reaching statistical significance. Because these complications were not primary end points, our study was underpowered for demonstrating significant differences between groups. The incidence of renal failure, stroke, resurgery, and mortality was similar for the PACU and the ICU group. Our study does not allow any conclusion about the safety of our fast-track concept. However, a significantly lower incidence of common postoperative complications for fast-track patients was demonstrated in a prospective study of 1,488 patients by Gooi <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Svircevic <italic>et al</italic>. could not find any evidence for increased risk of adverse outcomes in 7,989 patients undergoing fast-track cardiac surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In a recent review, Zhu <italic>et al</italic>. came to the conclusion that fast-track interventions have similar risks of mortality and major postoperative complications to conventional (not fast-track) care, and therefore appear to be safe in patients considered to be at low to moderate risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>In contrast to other studies on fast-track in cardiac surgery, which included only patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery, our patient population was mixed regarding type of operations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].

Overall, in our patient population of n&#x02009;=&#x02009;200 patients only 41.5% were CABG patients (41 vs. 42). A total of 6.5% of all patients (four vs. nine) underwent combined procedures (for example aortic and mitral valve surgery or valve surgery and CABG). We have also shown that fast-track treatment utilising a dedicated PACU can be successfully implemented for different types of cardiac operations.</p><sec id="Sec13"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p>Our demographic data show that there is a significant difference in gender (more female patients in the PACU group). In several studies, female gender was found to be a risk factor for delayed postoperative extubation and prolonged ICU length of stay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. This might have favoured the ICU group. Anaesthesia and surgery time in the ICU group was significantly longer, but there was no difference in XCL and cardiopulmonary bypass time, which were (amongst others) identified as risk factors for delayed postoperative extubation (&#x0003e;6 hours) and prolonged ICU LOS (&#x0003e;24 hours) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Regarding anaesthesia and surgery time, we observed only weak correlations with our outcome variables in both PACU and ICU groups. Hence, it is unlikely that this imbalance in baseline characteristics affects the main conclusion of our study.</p><p>Regarding the adverse events, the study was not adequately powered to identify significant differences between the groups.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our study showed that our fast-track treatment in a dedicated PACU leads to a high rate of success (95%) compared to the ICU (33%). We attribute this difference to better physician-to-patient ratio, allowing for more focused, early postoperative management, and better adherence to an established fast-track protocol. Delaying the decision about patient suitability for fast-track treatment until the end of surgery may also contribute to reducing the incidence of fast-track failures. Running a PACU separated from the ICU in a different part of the hospital, an excellent physician-patient ratio and strong adherence to the fast-track protocol is from our point of view one of the success factors for our study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Key messages</title><p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>ET for cardiac surgery patients in a fast-track protocol is significantly shorter in a dedicated PACU than in ICU</p></list-item><list-item><p>PACU-LOS is significantly shorter than ICU-LOS</p></list-item></list></p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-list><def-item><term>AVR</term><def><p>aortic valve replacement</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CABG</term><def><p>coronary artery bypass graft</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CBP</term><def><p>cardiopulmonary bypass</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>COPD</term><def><p>chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ET</term><def><p>time to extubation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FiO<sub>2</sub></term><def><p>fraction of inspired oxygen</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICT</term><def><p>intensive care treatment</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICU</term><def><p>intensive care unit</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IMC</term><def><p>intermediate care unit</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LOS</term><def><p>length of stay</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MAC</term><def><p>minimum alveolar concentration</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MVR</term><def><p>mitral valve replacement/repair</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NYHA</term><def><p>New York Heart Association</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OR</term><def><p>operating room</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PACU</term><def><p>post-anaesthetic care unit</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PEEP</term><def><p>positive end-expiratory pressure</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>XCL</term><def><p>cross-clamp</p></def></def-item></def-list></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p>Stefan Probst and Christof Cech these authors contributed equally to this work.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>SP contributed to conception and design of the study, interpretation of data, manuscript writing and final approval of the manuscript.
