Assuming 30% of enrolled patients would not reach randomisation (at 6&#x02005;months), and a 10% attrition rate after month six, 250 patients were planned to be enrolled to ensure at least 180 patients randomised with 90 patients per arm.</p><p>The difference between the two treatment arms in the mean change in DAS28 from 6 to 12&#x02005;months was calculated using the mean square error from analysis of variance adjusting for covariates at randomisation: private and public reimbursement; &#x0003c;2 and &#x02265;2&#x02005;years of disease duration; DAS28 &#x0003c;3.2 and &#x02265;3.2. Secondary endpoints were summarised with descriptive statistics and two-sided 95% CIs. Proportion of patients achieving low disease activity (LDA) and remission as well as European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) response at month 12 were summarised by relative risk (RR) (ETN+MTX relative to ETN) with 95% CIs.

Over the 6&#x02005;months following randomisation, 21 (19.6%) patients in the combination group and 32 (32.7%) from the monotherapy group discontinued treatment. The most common reason for early withdrawal in the randomised groups was disease progression (ie, response achieved, then loss of response; or insufficient response achieved; or response achieved but disease flared). Eleven (10.3%) patients in the combination group and twenty (20.4%) in the monotherapy group withdrew due to disease progression. Four (3.7%) and six (6.1%) patients in the combination and monotherapy groups, respectively, withdrew due to AEs.

From 6 to 12&#x02005;months, DAS28 was stable in patients on ETN+MTX and increased slightly in patients on ETN monotherapy. However, the mean difference between treatment groups was 0.45; thus, in some patients, the difference may not be clinically meaningful, whereas in others, their change in DAS28 after stopping MTX was clinically meaningful. One can potentially determine which patients may benefit from continuing MTX for the next 6&#x02005;months vs stopping MTX. The subset of patients with LDA at 6&#x02005;months achieved a similar DAS28 and EULAR response at 12&#x02005;months whether on monotherapy or combination therapy. Conversely, patients with MHDA at 6&#x02005;months performed better on combination therapy.</p><p>CAMEO, unlike other studies, focused on the disease state required to sustain ETN monotherapy regardless of the disease state at randomisation, with a prespecified outcome of patients achieving LDA. This is the first study that demonstrates the need to achieve a specific disease state in order to effectively discontinue MTX in MTX-IRs on combination therapy. Future data from this trial will evaluate the durability of monotherapy versus combination therapy and whether radiographic progression is different between the groups.</p><p>The data in this study are consistent with the JESMR study, where better clinical outcomes were observed with combination therapy, compared with monotherapy, even though the mean dose of MTX was very small. Rates of DAS28 remission and mean progression of erosion score were significantly better with ETN+MTX compared with ETN at 52&#x02005;weeks in JESMR,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> though the probability of radiographic progression using probability plots was only slightly different between groups. In contrast, the ADORE study reported comparable efficacy between monotherapy and combination therapy<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>; however, the study had only a short follow-up period of 16&#x02005;weeks. Other studies have examined tapering of treatment, following combination therapy. In an open-label extension study by Kremer <italic>et al</italic>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> RA patients with MTX-IR treated with ETN+MTX were permitted dose reductions for MTX or, in some cases, corticosteroid after at least 3&#x02005;months of combination therapy. Assessment at 3&#x02005;years showed that 62% (n=41) of patients were able to discontinue or decrease the dose of MTX without apparent worsening of ACR response rates.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p><p>The need for a low disease state or remission with combination of a biologic and MTX, before changes in therapy are attempted, is indirectly supported by studies of biologic dose reduction in MTX-IRs, such as the PRESERVE trial.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Here, patients had to achieve a sustained period of LDA before dose reduction was attempted. For patients with moderate disease activity who then reached LDA/remission after 36&#x02005;weeks of ETN+MTX, similar rates of LDA/remission were reported at 88&#x02005;weeks, whether patients had continued on a full or half dose of ETN, combined with MTX.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> PRESERVE did not address whether patients would have done equally well on ETN monotherapy compared with combination therapy. Thus, CAMEO provides important information on the disease state required to stop MTX and maintain response with ETN monotherapy and suggests that a clinical response alone, such as change in DAS28 or an ACR response, is inadequate for such adjustment.</p><p>Some questions remain to be addressed, such as whether MTX in combination with ETN can yield longer-term durability compared with ETN monotherapy, and if so, what dose of MTX would be sufficient? Would sustainability improve if remission is achieved before MTX dose reduction? How long should remission be maintained for optimal results with dose reduction? Also, could MTX be reintroduced if effectiveness wanes, and could ETN also be reduced in those with long-term remission on combination or monotherapy with ETN?</p><p>The CAMEO study reflects real-world practice. Since it involved multiple centres, the drug was acquired in usual care, there were very few inclusion/exclusion criteria and many patients were on other background DMARDs at the time of ETN initiation where the non-MTX DMARDs were discontinued, the results are very generalisable. However, it has some limitations. The study was open label; the drop-out rate prior to randomisation was higher than expected, so more patients had to be enrolled to achieve an adequate number randomised. Although the per protocol population did not meet its target sample size at randomisation, ITT results are adequately powered and have consistent outcomes. CAMEO does not allow for comparison of outcomes based on length of time in remission, as the study lacks time points earlier than 6&#x02005;months. However, the study continues for 18&#x02005;months after randomisation, a total of 2&#x02005;years, so more data of sustained remission will be obtained over time.</p><p>Gaining an understanding of long-term treatment is important in order to optimise disease control for patients with RA when using ETN therapy. Overall, maintaining MTX with ETN yields a better change in DAS28 than stopping MTX. However, for patients who achieve LDA by 6&#x02005;months and desire to stop MTX, ETN monotherapy provides an effective alternative to combination therapy for the next 6&#x02005;months.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Web figures</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="annrheumdis-2013-203684-s1.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e874" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><caption><title>Web table</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="annrheumdis-2013-203684-s2.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e879" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the following contributors, the clinical investigators of the CAMEO study, who provided and cared for study patients: Dr Algis Jovaisas, ON; Dr Ali Shickh, ON; Dr Andrew Chow, ON; Dr Anna Jaroszynska, ON; Dr Arthur Karasik, ON; Dr Boulos Haraoui, QC; Dr Carter Thorne, ON; Dr Eric Grant, NB; Dr Edward Keystone, ON; Dr Hyman Tannenbaum, QC; Dr Isabelle Fortin, QC; Dr Janet Markland, SK; Dr Janet Pope, ON (lead); Dr John Watterson, BC; Dr Juris Lazovskis, NS; Dr Louis Bessette, QC; Dr Majed Khraishi, NL; Dr Mark Hazeltine, QC; Dr Michel Gagn&#x000e9;, QC; Dr Milton Baker, BC; Dr Murray Baron, QC; Dr Nabil Attie, QC; Dr Raman Joshi, ON; Dr Saeed Shaikh, ON; Dr Timothy McCarthy, MB; and Dr William Bensen, ON.
