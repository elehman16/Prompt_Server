Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are beneficial probiotic organisms that contribute to improved nutrition, microbial balance, and immuno-enhancement of the intestinal tract, as well as diarrhea and constipation effect. The objective of this study was to investigate the efficacy of this LAB supplement in the management of nursing home residents.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Nineteen subjects (8M, 11F; mean age 77.1 &#x000b1; 10.1) suffering with chronic constipation were assigned to receive LAB (3.0 &#x000d7; 10<sup>11 </sup>CFU/g) twice (to be taken 30 minutes after breakfast and dinner) a day for 2 weeks in November 2008. Subjects draw up a questionnaire on defecation habits (frequency of defecation, amount and state of stool), and we collected fecal samples from the subjects both before entering and after ending the trial, to investigate LAB levels and inhibition of harmful enzyme activities. Results were tested with SAS and Student's t-test.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Analysis of questionnaire showed that there was an increase in the frequency of defecation and amount of stool excreted in defecation habit after LAB treatment, but there were no significant changes. And it also affects the intestinal environment, through significantly increase (<italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 0.05) fecal LAB levels. In addition, tryptophanase and urease among harmful enzyme activities of intestinal microflora were significantly decreased (<italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 0.05) after LAB treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>LAB, when added to the standard treatment regimen for nursing home residents with chronic constipation, increased defecation habit such as frequency of defecation, amount and state of stool. So, it may be used as functional probiotics to improve human health by helping to prevent constipation.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Constipation is prevalent in modern societies and is a common symptom in clinical practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>Constipation involves the large intestine and is a symptom rather than a disease. It is characterized by a constellation of symptoms and complaints, the most common of which are low defecation frequency (e.g. less than 3/week), irregular stool expulsion, painful and strained defecation, hard and dry stool consistency, a feeling of incomplete rectal defecation, and passing of abnormally small stools (e.g. less than 50 g/day) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>The prevalence of constipation and its impact on quality of life are most significant among elderly individuals, with a reported incidence among ambulatory adults 65 years of age and older of 26% in men and 34% in women. The prevalence of constipation is usually higher among elderly people living in nursing homes and hospitals than those living in the community. Once admitted, other factors may contribute to constipation (eg, changes in food and action, lack of exercise, loss of privacy or personality factors). More than 80% of nursing home and/or extended-care facility residents are reported to suffer from constipation. This population includes persons with higher frequency of risk factors (immobility, polypharmacy, and chronic medical conditions).</p><p>Dementia was reported as a risk factor for constipation, and such residents may be more difficult to manage than cognitively intact patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Other risk factors for constipation include the use of certain drugs (eg, anticholinergic antidepressants, opioid analgesics, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs] including aspirin). In clinical practice, however, the drugs that may be causing constipation may need to be continued in spite of their negative effects on bowel function. In constipation care studies, it was concluded that the nursing staffs' performance of constipation care-related tasks was time consuming and costly in the long-term care setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>LAB are currently used in the prevention and treatment of disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], specifically in the intestinal environment, by inhibiting harmful bacteria through the lowering of the intestinal pH, vitamin synthesis and blood cholesterol levels. LAB are also used to treat intestinal disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], for improving lactose malabsorption and immune function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], prevention of cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and particularly to improve diarrhea or constipated conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, we used LAB supplements containing <italic>Lactobacillus acidophilus </italic>(affects acute diarrhea and colitis), <italic>Pediococcus pentosaceus </italic>(has anti-viral effects), and <italic>Bifidobacterium longum </italic>SPM1205 (demonstrates in vivo inhibitory effects on harmful enzyme activities of intestinal microflora) to demonstrate any potential probiotic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>We aimed to investigate the efficacy of this LAB supplement in the management of nursing home residents with chronic constipation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Bacterial strains</title><p>The origins of the strains used in this study are shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>.

Male and female nursing home residents with chronic constipation, and who were presently receiving intervention (eg. laxatives, enemas and other invasive procedures, such as manual removal of fecal impaction) were evaluated for enrolment in the study. Because a significant number of the study participants were nursing home residents, it was not always feasible to obtain a diagnosis according to "Rome II" criteria for constipation as a prerequisite for the inclusion criteria. Such a diagnosis would require a level of communication with the patient that was not always possible in this study. The exclusion criteria were participants with ileus, renal failure, dialysis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and chronic abdominal pain. Thus, we screened 25 participants and included 8 male and 11 female participants that chose to participate in the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Treatment</title><p>This study was designed to assess the effects of LAB (3.0 &#x000d7; 10<sup>11 </sup>CFU/g) in the regimen of nursing home residents suffering from chronic constipation, the dispensing of standard treatment by nursing home staffs and on costs of care and medications. Participants with chronic constipation were defined as residents who used laxatives at least once a week.</p><p>The study protocol and the informed consent forms were reviewed and approved by the Eden Adventist Hospital. Each participant, or his or her legal guardian, was informed both orally and in writing. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants, or from their legal guardians, before participation in the study.</p><p>Subjects were instructed on the aim and content of the trial, as well as test methods. All 19 subjects were assigned to receive LAB twice (to be taken 30 minutes after breakfast and dinner) a day for 2 weeks in November 2008.

The results showed that there were no significant changes in defecation habits, but there was an increase in the frequency of defecation and amount of stool excreted, after LAB treatment. In frequency of defecation, 'once more than three days' was decreased from 11 (57.9%) to 6 (31.6%), whereas 'once two days' and 'once a day' were increased from 3 (15.8%) to 7 (36.8%) and from 4 (21.1%) to 6 (31.6%), respectively. In amount of stool, 'small' was decreased from 4 (57.9%) to 2 (31.6%), whereas 'large' was increased from 4 (21.1%) to 8 (42.1%).</p><p>We also found that fecal LAB levels were significantly increased from 4.4 log10 CFU/g to 7.3 log10 CFU/g after LAB treatment (<italic>p </italic>= 0.024). That is, LAB survive passage through the upper-gastrointestinal tract after oral feeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], and LAB treatment affects the intestinal environment to favor LAB colonization.

In addition, this LAB improved the balance the intestinal microflora, which exert beneficial effects by decreasing harmful enzymes activities such as trytophanase and urease. Furthermore, it also affects the intestinal environment, through increase of fecal LAB levels. Therefore, LAB may be used as functional probiotics to improve human health by the management of constipation, helping to prevent colon cancer. Thus, the results of this study warrant follow-up with a larger multicenter study to further assess efficacy.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>This study was conceived by NJH and designed by NJH, KOL and JGP.
