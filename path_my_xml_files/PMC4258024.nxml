In recent years, the incidence of chronic diseases associated with MetS, such as hypertension, diabetes and dyslipidemia, have rapidly increased in China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In 2009, modified fasting therapy was initially applied as a therapeutic option for the management of overweight, obesity and MetS in South China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>Modified fasting therapy is defined as a form of very-low-calorie-diet (VLCDs), which has been applied in an integrative medicine ward in Germany for decades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. It is a regimen whereby juicy food intake is limited to 350 Kcal per day in the short-term. As an effective approach to MetS, modified fasting therapy has long been employed as a lifestyle modification in Europe. However, when it was initially applied to the Chinese population, fasting-induced persistence fatigue and intense hunger were found to be the main obstacles to achieving therapeutic benefits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Energy deficiency may be the leading cause of fatigue and intense hunger during the fasting period. It is well known that lipid mobilization is the main metabolic adaptation to starvation. Accumulating evidence suggested that facilitating fatty acid oxidation with free L-carnitine (&#x003b2;-hydroxy-&#x003b3;-N-trimethylaminobutyric acid) contributes to energy production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>L-Carnitine is an essential nutrient in lipid metabolism, which promotes the transportation of long-chain-fatty-acids across the mitochondrial membrane, thus allowing the cells to break down fat and release energy from reserves of stored fat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. All tissues that use fatty acids as an energy source require carnitine for normal function during fatty acid oxidation. In addition to its requisite role in fatty acid oxidation, it can facilitate glucose disposal by modifying the mitochondrial acetyl-CoA/CoA ratio [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Excessive acetyl-CoA production in the process of &#x003b2;-oxidation inhibits the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, leading to mitochondria stress in hepatocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Accordingly, Calabrese et al. proposed that free L-carnitine might contribute to the alleviation of starvation-related stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In addition, evidence strongly demonstrates that long-term oral L-carnitine administration is effective for fatigue during weight loss induced by chronic disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Therefore, we postulated that L-carnitine supplementation could ameliorate the adverse effects of starvation.</p><p>However, when compared to traditional orally administrated drugs, the pharmacokinetic properties of L-carnitine are complex, since it exhibits poor intestinal absorption and bioavailability, very high renal clearance, and uptake into tissues through a high affinity transporter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Therefore, repeated-dose carnitine supplements only modestly increase the plasma L-carnitine concentration in muscular tissue even when very high oral doses are administrated, (i.e., more than 2 g per day) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. L-carnitine administrated intravenously should substantially increase the L-carnitine concentration. However, since the tubular reabsorption occurs via an active transporter, once the transporter is saturated by the high plasma L-carnitine concentrations achieved by intravenous administration, the circulating L-carnitine is rapidly excreted. In addition, because the acylcarnitine ester pool in the extracellular fluid is increased following the L-carnitine infusion, L-carnitine can enter the intracellular pool for utilization before clearance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Accordingly, we proposed that a large dose of L-carnitine administrated intravenously was responsible for alleviating starvation discomfort including persistence fatigue and intense hunger over the short term.</p><p>Recently, Awad et al. also posed the viewpoint that L-carnitine should help attenuate the adverse effects of perioperative fasting and lead to improved patient outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. To verify this hypothesis, we designed a randomized controlled study to determine the effect of 4 g/day of intravenous L-carnitine administration on fatigue, hunger, body mass, lipid profile, and other CHD risk factors in MetS patients during a modified fasting period.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Subjects and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Subjects</title><p>This randomized, single-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical study was conducted in MetS patients at the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University in Guang Zhou, China and has been registered with the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (No. <italic>ChiCTR-TNRC-12002835</italic>). 30 overweight or obese (body mass index [BMI] &#x02267;25.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) patients aged from 27&#x02013;65 years in whom MetS was diagnosed according to the updated National Cholesterol Education Program/Adult treatment Panel III criteria for Asians were enrolled into the study.

The fasting treatment consisted of 2 days with moderate calorie restriction (700&#x02013;800 Kcal/day), 5 days of intense calorie restriction (200 Kcal/day), followed by 3 days with the stepwise reintroduction of a normal diet. Fasting was initiated with the intake of 10&#x02013;20 g of thenardite powder on fasting day 1 for bowel-cleansing purposes. During the 5-day fasting period, the subjects were asked to drink at least 2 L of water. During the fasting period, they were prescribed a diet of 200 Kcal/d that consist of one serving of the liquid meal replacement and two cups of light vegetable soup. Each serving of the liquid diet provided approximately 150 Kcal: 7.9 g protein, 2.8 g fat, and 22 g carbohydrate. The liquid diet was prepared by mixing the powdered product with 250 mL water and was to be consumed at dinner. Two bowls of vegetable soup provided about 50 Kcal and were given at breakfast and lunch. All patients were required to engage in low-level physical activity consisting of 2 hours slow walking per day.

Furthermore, there were no drop outs during the study period. Of the participants in the CT group, one man experienced mild gingival bleeding and one woman had premature menstruation during the fasting period. As for the LC group, one man experienced mild gingival bleeding and two women complained of transient nausea during the study period.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This is the first study to show that the intravenous administration of 4 g/day of L-carnitine reduced the perception of hunger and fatigue and magnified body mass reduction in MetS patients during modified fasting. We also found that it was able to normalize sitting blood pressure and alleviate cholesterol and hepatic enzyme abnormalities induced by starvation.</p><p>In our study, the results showed that L-carnitine administration could alleviate perceived hunger in MetS patients during the modified fasting period. It was well known to us that modified fasting therapy was an effective approach for weight management, however, persistence hunger and fatigue during the fasting period affected compliance with modified fasting therapy. Modified fasting therapy has been used as an effective regime for initial lifestyle modification for chronic metabolic disease, and has been utilized for decades in Germany. However, until now weight reduction induced by modified fasting therapy has not been proved to be effective for long-term weight management. Moreover, it has been proven that gorging induced by obvious hunger after zero-calorie fasting has a harmful effect on health, especially with respect to weight gain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In our study, we demonstrated that perceived hunger scores were significantly increased during the modified fasting period, while intravenously administered high-dose L-carnitine weakened the sensation of hunger during this period. Thus, we hypothesized that hunger-free fasting was more effective than traditional fasting on long-term weight management, although this requires further study.</p><p>Furthermore, it has been reported that fatigue induced by progressive disease is often coupled with weight loss and anorexia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. However, evidence proved that orally administered L-carnitine was effective in alleviating fatigue syndrome induced by chronic metabolic disease and improving quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. In our study, L-carnitine infusion not only ameliorated the sensation of hunger, but improved fatigue with significant weight loss during the modified fasting period. White AM and colleagues previously reported that blood concentrations of ketone bodies were directly associated with fatigue during weight loss under a low carbohydrate/high protein diet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. L-carnitine administration was able to reduce the production of ketone bodies in the hepatocyte under starvation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Therefore, it can be postulated that reduction of blood concentrations of ketone bodies with L-carnitine administration contributed to the improvement in fatigue syndrome.</p><p>Interestingly, together with fatigue improvement, weight loss and anorexia was significantly promoted with intravenous L-carnitine administration during modified fasting therapy in our study. Furthermore, our results suggest that increased WHR during the period was reversed by L-carnitine supplementation. In addition, a reduction in WC was also seen in the LC group. Based on these results, it was inferred that L-carnitine was able to promote lipolysis and contribute to preservation of lean body mass during modified fasting.</p><p>In experimental research, oral L-carnitine supplementation was proved to increase total energy expenditure in obese rats with insulin resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In addition, L-carnitine supplementation could promote weight loss in calorie restricted cats that received 40% of maintenance energy requirement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Subsequently, they demonstrated that increasing the basal metabolic rate was the underlying cause of L-carnitine on weight loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. However, these results differ from previous results, which revealed that oral L-carnitine supplementation had no effect on weight loss during calorie restriction in impaired glucose metabolic patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] and during aerobic training in obese women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. These paradoxical results may be related to the poor bioavailability following oral L-carnitine administration. Oral L-carnitine only mildly increased plasma and muscular L-carnitine concentrations even when very high oral doses are administrated as compared with intravenous administration. Despite high clearance of intravenous administration, L-carnitine could enter the intracellular pool for utilization before clearance during the modified fasting period.</p><p>In addition, our study suggested that L-carnitine supplementation facilitated insulin concentration reduction with blood glucose stabilization during modified fasting. It has been shown that hypercarnitinemia stimulated nonoxidative glucose disposal in healthy subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Prohibited glucose disposal under starvation contributes to the prevention of hypoglycemia; however, L-carnitine administration induced no hypoglycemia events in our study. On one hand, glucose homeostasis in this situation may be attributed to a significant decline in insulin secretion. Interestingly, blood glucose concentration appeared to decrease with intravenous administration of L-carnitine. Accordingly, lipolysis promotion with L-carnitine increasing endogenous glucose synthesis may be the main cause of glucose homeostasis.</p><p>Recently, it has been demonstrated that L-carnitine supplementation can improve insulin resistance and glucose disposal in insulin-resistant humans and rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. However, our results showed that it exerted no obvious effect on HOMR-IR improvement in MetS patients during modified fasting, although there was significant insulin concentration reduction. Modified fasting may play a primary role in HOMR-IR reduction, not L-carnitine. Nevertheless, the combination of modified fasting plus L-carnitine could be applied as an effective approach for hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance. The mechanism underlying this combination may be correlated with carnitine homeostasis and distribution.</p><p>The intracellular carnitine homeostasis and distribution are controlled by the novel organic cation transporter (OCTN) among which OCTN2 is the most important. Its main functions are to operate on intestinal and renal reabsorption of L-carnitine and play a vital role in the distribution. It has been demonstrated that fasting and calorie restriction significantly increased the expression of OCTN2 and carnitine concentrations in the muscular tissues, liver and kidney [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Interestingly, impairment of carnitine absorption in calorie-restricted rats probably attenuates the carnitine concentration increment induced by repeated dietary L-carnitine administration during calorie restriction. Thus, repeated intravenous L-carnitine supplementation may produce a greater increase the total carnitine concentration in skeletal muscle than oral L-carnitine during the modified fasting period.</p><p>Likewise, decreased carnitine in muscle, liver and kidney has been found to be a common trait of the insulin resistant state, including diet-induced obesity, genetic diabetes and aging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Thus, these findings prompted us to hypothesize that increases in the total content of carnitine in skeletal muscle may lead to beneficial effects on weight loss and insulin sensitivity. We have demonstrated that intravenous L-carnitine administration enhanced weight loss and insulin concentration reduction during modified fasting therapy. To determine whether increased weight reduction is associated with skeletal muscular carnitine concentration remains to be studied in the future.</p><p>Moreover, sitting blood pressure of participants engaging in the modified fasting regimen in the CT group revealed significant reductions, which could be ameliorated by L-carnitine. It has been mentioned that postural hypotension often occurred by the second week of fasting due to dehydration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. So we suggested that L-carnitine appears to be able to maintain normal sitting blood pressure by increasing resistance to dehydration during this period.</p><p>Lipid profile abnormalities induced by zero-calorie fasting was another controversial issue restricting the application of fasting therapy. As we introduced a 200 Kcal diet to modified fasting, cholesterol abnormalities including increased serum TC, LDL cholesterol and apoB concentrations were found in accordance with zero-calorie fasting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Interestingly, LDL cholesterol was markedly decreased in obese patients during the modified fasting period with a nutritional energy intake of 300 kcal per day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. However, the decreased HDL cholesterol and apoA1 concentrations induced by modified fasting are contradictory to that reported in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] which showed that these parameters increased during the zero-calorie fasting period. The patients recruited in this study were of older as compared to previous studies, which may have contributed to the variable results. A previous study using labeled cholesterol has demonstrated that the circulating cholesterol level was elevated during the zero-calorie fasting period due to the release of the lipid droplets from adipose tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Furthermore, decreased LDL cholesterol uptake by the liver could be an alternative mechanism contributing to increased LDL cholesterol concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Interestingly, our findings showed that incremental TC concentrations were significantly reversed with L-carnitine administration.</p><p>Nevertheless, triglycerides and FFA concentrations were reduced for lipolysis during the fasting period, which revealed that L-carnitine administration exerted no obvious effect. Furthermore, our data showed that L-carnitine was unable to reduce the lp(a) concentration increment induced by starvation. It has been suggested that it could significantly reduce the lp(a) concentration in diabetic and non-diabetic patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Nonetheless, this contradicts the study by Rahbar et al. that reported that oral L-carnitine administration could not significantly reduce lp(a) concentration in type IIdiabetic patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Accordingly, we hypothesized that metabolic cholesterol abnormalities may be associated with free carnitine depletion during the fasting period, which warrants further investigation.</p><p>Hepatic enzyme aberrations, including ALT and AST increases, were observed due to oxidative stress during modified fasting. Furthermore, it has been shown that 24&#x02013;72 hour zero-calorie fasting causes liver mitochondrial oxidative stress in rats by increasing mitochondrial free radical leak and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation at complex III level in vivo studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. L-carnitine has been shown to protect human hepatocytes against oxidative stress through its ability to scavenge free radicals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. We found that L-carnitine administration was able to attenuate AST and ALT increases during modified fasting.</p><p>&#x003b3;-GGT is widely regarded as a biomarker of alcohol consumption and fatty liver. However, it also has been found to be associated with insulin resistance syndrome including obesity, fat distribution, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and cardiovascular disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Our results showed that hunger-free fasting was able to reduce &#x003b3;-GGT concentrations to a greater extent than modified fasting. It could be postulated that hunger-free fasting was more effective than modified fasting in fatty liver management, because 10-20% of the dose may enter the liver during the first 2 hours after administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>Hyperuricemia was found during modified fasting in accordance with previous studies during short-term zero-calorie fasting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Interestingly, previous studies suggested that increased UA may be associated with protein decomposition and forging behavior during the fasting period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Our results showed that hunger-free fasting seemed to slow the increment of UA concentration which confirmed the forging hypothesis. More details about forging behavior during fasting need to be elucidated in further studies. In summary, we hypothesized that hunger-free fasting could be beneficial for long-term weight management for contributing to appetite control.</p><p>Despite the limited number of patients, this study revealed no adverse effects with L-carnitine administration. The limited population sample in this study and failure to determine the lean body mass and fat loss in both groups were the two main limitations of this study. Moreover, the intense sensation of hunger in the CT group may force participants to ingest more than allowed by the study design. Nevertheless, the results of this study showed that L-carnitine had a positive impact on weight loss with reduced hunger and improved fatigue.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, to the best knowledge, the present study is the first to demonstrated that intravenous L-carnitine administration boosted the effects of modified fasting therapy on weight loss and alleviated metabolic abnormalities. L-carnitine infusion also relieved the sensation of hunger and fatigue during the modified fasting period. Our regimen might offer a potential new approach for abdominal obesity management in MetS patients.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interest</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>All of the authors participated in the preparation of the manuscript.
