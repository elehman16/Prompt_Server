All patients, except the peripheral placebo group, received 5 days of G-CSF. In the IC groups, this was followed by bone marrow harvest and IC infusion of cells or serum on Day 6. The primary endpoint was LVEF change from baseline to 3 months, determined by advanced cardiac imaging. At 3 months, peripheral G-CSF combined with IC BMC therapy was associated with a 5.37% point increase in LVEF (38.30% &#x000b1; 12.97 from 32.93% &#x000b1; 16.46 <italic>P</italic> = 0.0138), which was maintained to 1 year.

Clinical investigation of cytokine therapy alone has been limited and has failed to deliver long-lasting improvements in cardiac function.<sup><xref rid="EHV390C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Autologous bone marrow-derived cell (BMC) therapy has moved rapidly from proof of concept in preclinical experiments to clinical trials of cardiac repair in the most part in patients with acute myocardial infarction or heart failure secondary to ischaemic heart disease. Although these early Phase I/II clinical trials have demonstrated mixed results, meta-analysis has suggested that autologous cell therapy with or without adjunctive cytokine has therapeutic potential in these patient groups.<sup><xref rid="EHV390C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> However, improvements in the intermediate outcome measures used in these trials has been modest, suggesting that adjunctive or alternative types of cell therapy may be needed to achieve clinically meaningful results.</p><p>Patients with DCM are a small proportion of those entered into these early stage trials.

All trial procedures were carried out at the London Chest Hospital. Inclusion criteria were a diagnosis of non-ischaemic DCM with no secondary cause found, an LVEF of &#x0003c;45% (assessed by echocardiography at referral), symptoms classed as New York Heart Association (NYHA) 2 or greater and on optimal medical treatment (established for at least 6 months). Secondary cardiomyopathy was defined as pathological myocardial involvement associated with systemic disorders, e.g. endocrine and metabolic disorders, alcohol and drug toxicity, infiltrative disorders, and neuromuscular diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Randomization and masking</title><p>After consenting for the trial, patients were randomized using a dedicated trial software system (IHD Clinical Bishops Stortford, Herts, UK) in a 1 : 1 : 1 : 1 simple randomization to one of four groups.

Intracoronary injection was standardized to deliver cells equally between the major epicardial vessels via the stop flow method as previously described.<sup><xref rid="EHV390C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> It was not possible for the study to be blinded across all four groups due to the invasive nature of the IC arm.

Secondary endpoints also included change in NT-proBNP levels, exercise capacity (VO<sub>2</sub> peak) NYHA classification and quality of life as assessed by European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ5D), and Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) at 3 months and 1 year compared with baseline. Mortality and adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) defined as all-cause death, myocardial infarction, hospitalization for heart failure, or major arrhythmias were assessed at 3 months and 1 year.

Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor alone did not have a beneficial effect on cardiac function supportive of recent meta-analysis data.<sup><xref rid="EHV390C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> The G-CSF/IC BMC patients demonstrated a 5.37% increase in LVEF at 3 months, which was maintained at 1 year. This LVEF improvement was associated with significant improvements in the clinical parameters of NYHA class, exercise capacity, quality of life decrease in NT-pro BNP at 1 year. The remaining treatment groups failed to show evidence of improvement in any of these endpoints at either 3 months or 1 year. These results therefore demonstrate the beneficial effects across multiple clinical and intermediate parameters of combined cell and cytokine therapy in a randomized control trial of patients diagnosed with DCM. Since the trial was designed to test whether BMC in addition to G-CSF provided added benefits it is not clear whether cell therapy alone would have had a similar effect.</p><p>Similar beneficial effects on cardiac function with BMC therapy have been shown in other early phase studies,<sup><xref rid="EHV390C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="EHV390C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> with the most recent demonstrating improvements out to 5 years post therapy.<sup><xref rid="EHV390C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> However, no study has been performed with a randomized interventional control group blinded to the investigators. Previous studies have also used G-CSF alone but few have controlled for the possibility that this cytokine may have a direct effect on cardiac function as has been previously suggested.<sup><xref rid="EHV390C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> REGENERATE-DCM is the first trial designed with a separate interventional and cytokine only control group. Although the peripheral G-CSF group did not show an improvement in intermediate and clinical endpoints, there was an improvement in quality-of-life scores highlighting the need for rigorous study design involving appropriate control arms as previously suggested.<sup><xref rid="EHV390C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup></p><p>The results presented here also support the hypothesis that the additional beneficial effects of IC BMC in combination with G-CSF compared with G-CSF alone are in part mediated by the local delivery of an enriched CD34+ cell population. Here CD34+ concentrations in the infused cell product are shown to be an order of magnitude above circulating CD34+ concentrations achieved by mobilization with G-CSF alone (491 CD34+/&#x003bc;L in cell product compared with 56.8 CD34+/&#x003bc;L in the circulation <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://eurheartj.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/eurheartj/ehv390/-/DC1">Supplementary material online, <italic>Tables S1</italic> and <italic>S2</italic></ext-link>).</p><p>The enrolled study population was typical of a DCM population with similar baseline characteristics and medical therapy to patients in other published trials.<sup><xref rid="EHV390C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="EHV390C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> The biochemical markers indicating severity of heart failure were similar across all groups with a plasma NT-proBNP concentration &#x0003e;1000 pg/mL suggestive of significant left ventricular dysfunction. The patient population had high levels of optimal medical therapy and appropriate levels of &#x02018;device therapy&#x02019; in all groups in keeping with current European guidelines.<sup><xref rid="EHV390C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup></p><p>While patients were enrolled to the trial and randomized on the basis of referring echo criteria of LVEF &#x0003c;45%, their baseline LVEF measurements by MRI and CT were in some instances &#x0003e;45%, which is a recognized limitation of the study. Furthermore, although the baseline LVEF in the IC serum arm was increased compared with the other three groups, there was no significant between-group difference. It must also be noted here that although rate of MACE was not different between the treatment groups two deaths occurred within the IC BMC group which were unrelated to trial procedures and non-cardiac in aetiology. Although it is unusual that both events occurred within one group, a mortality rate of 2/60 may be reasonable in such a high-risk study population.</p><p>The results of the REGENERATE-DCM trial suggest a beneficial effect of combination G-CSF and BMC therapy; however, this is a Phase II trial powered around intermediate efficacy measures. The trial met its statistical endpoint criteria despite the small sample size, which was supported by relevant changes in the secondary endpoints. It is likely that small study size accounted for a failure to see significant changes in LVESV and LVEDV, that corresponded to improvement of LVEF, observations that have been linked in large meta-analyses.<sup><xref rid="EHV390C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> ***LVESV and LVEDV have a combined effect on LVEF therefore increasing sample size may have revealed significant changes. The study could not be completely blinded across all arms due to the invasive nature of the IC arm. Nonetheless, the investigators and patients were blinded within arm between active treatment and placebo and data analysers were blinded to all treatment groups. Although patients underwent either MRI or CT analysis since the scans were paired and the primary endpoint was based on within group measures any modality-related differences in the measurements of cardiac function would not account for the significant findings. Furthermore, the standard error of measurement of MRI and CT was similar.</p><p>Therefore, results of REGENERATE-DCM demonstrate improvement in a panel of measures of cardiac function accompanied by improvement in symptoms. In particular the change in plasma NT-proBNP at 1 year suggest that cell therapy may lead to a long-term outcome benefit in these patients and therefore warrants further investigation using the methodology described in this manuscript in a Phase III trial.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The IC infusion of autologous unfractionated BMC in combination with G-CSF therapy in patients with DCM appears to be safe and is associated with an improvement in LVEF 3 months after therapy, which is maintained at 1 year.
