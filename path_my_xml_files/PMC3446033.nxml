Fecal disimpaction prior to maintenance therapy is recommended to ensure successful treatment. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and patient's compliance of the two methods of paraffin oil administration (oral and rectal route) with the purpose of disimpaction in treatment of children with functional constipation.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Methods</title><p>A total of 80 children (49 males and 31 females) aged 1&#x02013;12 years, with functional constipation according to Rome III criteria, whose rectal examination confirmed fecal impaction were divided into two groups randomly. Group I received 3 ml/kg/day paraffin oil orally and group II received 3ml/kg/day paraffin oil rectally during 3 consequent days. Successful treatment was defined as no detectable fecal impaction in rectal examination after at most 72 hours. Patient compliance and family satisfaction also was evaluated using a scored questionnaire.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Findings</title><p>Response to the treatment in both groups was with 92.5% and 82.5% in group I and II, respectively. So, there was no significant difference between the two methods of therapy. Family satisfying and compliance were obviously more achieved in group 1 (87.5% vs 57.5%) than in Group 2 (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001). No parents in group I complained about type of treatment while 12.5% of parents in group II were unsatisfied with the mode of paraffin oil administration. The most common side effect of paraffin oil in both groups was anal oil seepage (27.5%). Nausea and abdominal pain were more common side effects in group 1 and 2 respectively.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>It seems that using paraffin oil per oral route in comparison with rectal route could be a preferred option for disimpaction in children causing less anxiety to the family.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Fecal impaction</kwd><kwd>Constipation</kwd><kwd>Chronic constipation</kwd><kwd>Functional Colonic Diseases</kwd><kwd>Paraffin oil</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S0001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Constipation is a common reason of referring a child to a pediatric gastroenterologist. There is no underlying organic disease in 97% of cases[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0001">1</xref>]. Even though it creates a significant amount of distress and anxiety to the families[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0002">2</xref>] indeed, it could be the most common cause of acute abdominal pain[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0003">3</xref>].</p><p>Management of chronic constipation in the first step is disimpaction of feces that itself produces more anxiety for the families, especially in an unexperienced family. In the second step, prevention of constipation with increasing fiber intake and using mineral oil (liquid paraffin), lactulose or poly ethylene glycol (PEG) is suggested as a maintenance therapy.</p><p>Among different methods of medical treatment, fecal disimpaction has priority. There are various methods for disimpaction including, enema and giving various materials orally like bulking agents, osmotic laxatives, lubricating laxatives and stimulating laxatives[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0005">5</xref>].</p><p>Successful treatment of fecal impaction with PEG has been reported by Youssef et al[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0006">6</xref>]. Rectal disimpaction can also be performed with phosphate sodium enema (fleet), saline, or mineral oil enema followed by a phosphate enema[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0002">2</xref>]; this kind of enema should be used with some caution because of its major complications such as metabolic derangements in serum phosphate, magnesium, sodium, calcium and potassium[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0007">7</xref>]. In our country, the first line compound usually used for this purpose is paraffin oil[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0008">8</xref>]. It is also recommended as a first step medication in childhood constipation by North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (NAPSGN)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0004">4</xref>].</p><p>Mineral (paraffin) oil has been proved as a safe and useful lubricating laxative in the treatment of chronic constipation. It is composed of saturated hydrocarbons obtained from petroleum. It acts by coating and lubricating stools, reducing colonic absorption of fecal water and facilitating the evacuation of the stools.</p><p>However, lipoid pneumonia as a result of mineral oil aspiration was reported[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0009">9</xref>]. So, it should not be used in patients with tendency for regurgitation or pulmonary aspiration. In general, it does not interfere with fat soluble vitamins absorption[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0010">10</xref>]. Although liquid paraffin is the most popular compound as maintenance treatment for constipation, we couldn't find comparative studies between the two methods of using it for disimpaction in children in the literature.</p><p>As the parents and child should be involved in the decision regarding the appropriate route, we hypothesize that oral route of disimpaction can be more acceptable, because of less anxiety to the family and suffering child. So, we designed the study to compare the effectiveness and family acceptance of oral method versus rectal method of using paraffin oil in disimpaction of childhood constipation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S0002"><title>Subjects and Methods</title><p>A prospective randomized clinical trial study was performed on 80 children with diagnosis of functional constipation referred to pediatric gastroenterology clinic of Children's Medical Center. Physical examination showed fecal impaction.</p><p>According to Rome III criteria, functional constipation was defined as having two out of the following symptoms for at least two months: &#x02264;2 defecations per week, &#x02265;1 episode per week of incontinence after the acquisition of toileting skills, history of excessive stool retention or history of painful or hard bowel movements, presence of large fecal mass in the rectum, history of large diameter stools that may obstruct the toilet for children &#x0003c;4 years[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0012">12</xref>].</p><p>The study had two parallel groups, single blind, and randomized, prospective comparative design and was performed in the academic Children's Medical Center in Iran. The study was approved by the research ethics board of the Children's Medical Center and written informed consent was obtained from the parents.</p><p>Baseline characteristics including sex, age, weight, duration of the problem, and finding of rectal examination was recorded for every patient in interview with his/her parents and after physical examination. Then patients were assigned into two groups by simple randomized sampling method.</p><p>Group I (23 males and 17 females) received 3ml/kg/day liquid paraffin oil per oral route in two divided doses; and Group II (26 males and 14 females) received the same dose of paraffin rectally. Both groups were asked to increase daily fiber intake and try to defecate after each meal for 15 minutes (three times a day).</p><p>During treatment parents were asked to record clinical efficacy and tolerability as well as side effects of the medication in a dairy. After 3 days of intervention, efficacy, time of response, tolerability, patients' and parents' compliance were assessed using scored questionnaire and all patients were examined again for detecting the fecal impaction by a second examiner.</p><p>Treatment was interpreted successful if rectal examination revealed no fecal impaction; and remaining fecal impaction was defined as unsuccessful treatment. Family satisfying was evaluated based on recorded dairy that was filled out by parents and classified into very good, good, neutral, bad and very bad scores.</p><p>Collected data was analyzed statistically by SPSS software 11.5, and tested by Student's <italic>t</italic> test or non-parametric Mann-Whitney U tests according to the distribution of values. <italic>P-value</italic> less than 0.05 was considered significant.</p></sec><sec id="S0003"><title>Findings</title><p>Within one year, 80 children (aged 1&#x02013;12 years) with chronic functional constipation and fecal impaction were enrolled in the study; their characteristics are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T0001">Table 1</xref>.

Although slower response to oral route of disimpaction in comparison with enema was previously reported[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0015">15</xref>], our study proved that oral route can result in disimpaction within 48 h after taking mineral oil as rapidly as rectal route.</p><p>In our study, the side effects of oral route were fewer and less important than those of rectal route, which is in agreement with results of other studies[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0013">13</xref>]. However, our study showed that abdominal pain as an unusual side effect in Group 1 in comparison to Group 2 (2.5% vs 30%); more common side effects were oil seepage and nausea in Group 1 (30% vs 17.5%) and abdominal pain and oil seepage in group 2 (30% vs 25%). 10% of patients in Group I and 2.5% of cases in Group II showed no side effects.</p><p>Dosage of paraffin oil in this study was 3 ml/kg/day that was slightly higher than the dose given in other studies (1.72&#x000b1;0.13 ml/kg/ day)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0013">13</xref>]. The high dose of paraffin that we used in our study, showed no significant additional side effects in comparing to other studies. Some limitations should be taken into account. First, because of lack of quantified parameters, we used clinical symptoms and individual judgment for assessment of family satisfying that led to some unavoidable biases. Second, the relatively low number of patients in this study, although comparable to those in other studies, may have underpowered the significance of differences between patient groups.</p></sec><sec id="S0005"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results showed that administering paraffin oil per oral route was more acceptable with fewer and less important side effects than using it per rectal route; most of the cases preferred the oral route.</p><p>As we know, the main part of the treatment in children with constipation are; children's compliance and parent's participation. It seems that using paraffin oil per oral route for disimpaction in patients aged 1 year - 15 years who are suffering from chronic functional constipation could be a preferred option, considering the fact that it should not be used for the patients who are at risk for aspiration and avoiding to feed paraffin oil with force.</p><p>Since mineral oil is the most common compound that is used for treatment of functional constipation in our country, we recommend designing more clinical trials.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>The authors thank Research Board of the Children's Medical Center for their cooperation, Dr Nima Rezaee for editorial assistance, Dr Zahra Khazaee for statistical analysis and Maral Sayyad for assistance with the tables.</p></ack><sec id="S0006"><title>Conflict of Interest</title><p>None</p></sec><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="CIT0001"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Loening-Baucke</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Prevalence, symptoms and outcome of constipation in infants and toddlers</article-title><source>J Pediatr.</source><year>2005</year><volume>146</volume><issue>3</issue><fpage>359</fpage><lpage>63</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15756220</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CIT0002"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Rahhal</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Uc</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><person-group person-group-type="editor"><name><surname>Walker</surname><given-names>RE</given-names></name><name><surname>Kleinman</surname><given-names>IR</given-names></name><name><surname>Sanderson</surname><given-names>O</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Functional constipation</article-title><source>In Pediatric Gastrointestinal Disease-Physiology, Diagnosis, Management</source><year>2008</year><edition>5th ed</edition><publisher-loc>Hamilton, Ontario</publisher-loc><publisher-name>BC Decker</publisher-name><fpage>675</fpage><lpage>82</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="CIT0003"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Loening-Baucke</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name><name><surname>Swidsinski</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Constipation as cuase of acute abdominal pain in children</article-title><source>J Pediatr.</source><year>2007</year><volume>15</volume><issue>6</issue><fpage>666</fpage><lpage>9</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">18035149</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CIT0004"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Baker</surname><given-names>SS</given-names></name><name><surname>Liptak</surname><given-names>GS</given-names></name><name><surname>Colletti</surname><given-names>RB</given-names></name><name><surname>Croffie</surname><given-names>JM</given-names></name><name><surname>Di Lorenzo</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Ector</surname><given-names>W</given-names></name><name><surname>Nurko</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Constipation in infants and children: evaluation and treatment.
