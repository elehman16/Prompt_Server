Interventions designed to implement recommended behaviours can reduce this variation. Using theory to inform intervention development is advocated; however, there is no consensus on how to select or apply theory. Integrative theoretical frameworks, based on syntheses of theories and theoretical constructs relevant to implementation, have the potential to assist in the intervention development process. This paper describes the process of applying two theoretical frameworks to investigate the factors influencing recommended behaviours and the choice of behaviour change techniques and modes of delivery for an implementation intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A stepped approach was followed: (i) identification of locally applicable and actionable evidence-based recommendations as targets for change, (ii) selection and use of two theoretical frameworks for identifying barriers to and enablers of change (Theoretical Domains Framework and Model of Diffusion of Innovations in Service Organisations) and (iii) identification and operationalisation of intervention components (behaviour change techniques and modes of delivery) to address the barriers and enhance the enablers, informed by theory, evidence and feasibility/acceptability considerations. We illustrate this process in relation to one recommendation, prospective assessment of post-traumatic amnesia (PTA) by ED staff using a validated tool.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Four recommendations for managing mild traumatic brain injury were targeted with the intervention. The intervention targeting the PTA recommendation consisted of 14 behaviour change techniques and addressed 6 theoretical domains and 5 organisational domains. The mode of delivery was informed by six Cochrane reviews. It was delivered via five intervention components : (i) local stakeholder meetings, (ii) identification of local opinion leader teams, (iii) a train-the-trainer workshop for appointed local opinion leaders, (iv) local training workshops for delivery by trained local opinion leaders and (v) provision of tools and materials to prompt recommended behaviours.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Two theoretical frameworks were used in a complementary manner to inform intervention development in managing mild traumatic brain injury in the ED. The effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the developed intervention is being evaluated in a cluster randomised trial, part of the Neurotrauma Evidence Translation (NET) program.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Intervention design</kwd><kwd>Intervention development</kwd><kwd>Theory use</kwd><kwd>Theoretical domains framework</kwd><kwd>Diffusion of innovations in service organisations</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Guidance for developing complex interventions, such as those focussed on implementation, advocate the use of theory in the intervention development process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. It is argued that interventions are more likely to be effective if they target causal determinants of behaviour and behaviour change, and theory can be useful in gaining an understanding of these causal mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In addition, there have been calls for better descriptions and reporting of implementation interventions to enable replication and refinement of interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Few studies report the rationale, process of development and detailed description of the intervention content, mode of delivery and the setting in which it is delivered to inform replication and/or refinement of interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>There are several approaches to the use of theory for developing interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], but there is currently no consensus on how best to select or apply theory. Multiple theories and theoretical frameworks of individual and organisational behaviour change exist, but choosing an appropriate theory can be challenging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Drawing on multiple relevant theories rather than a single theory is considered to facilitate a more comprehensive assessment of potential determinants of change and therefore an intervention that is more likely to be effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>The Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] is a comprehensive framework of 14 theoretical domains from 33 behaviour change theories and 128 constructs. It was developed using an expert consensus and validation process to identify an agreed set of theoretical domains that could be used when studying implementation and developing implementation interventions. The TDF has been successfully used in a wide range of settings, including the emergency department (ED) setting, to explore factors influencing clinical behaviour change and to design implementation interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The ED environment is complex and has unique characteristics that can have an impact on its responsiveness to change, e.g. high staff turnover, lack of follow-up and a high number of decisions per unit of time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) or concussion accounts for up to 90&#x000a0;% of patients who present to the ED with a traumatic brain injury (TBI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and has an incidence rate of between 100 and 300/100,000 inhabitants per year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. A recent study from the USA found that between the years 2006 and 2010, the rate of increase in TBI visits was eightfold greater than the rate of increase of total ED visits, and this increase was largely due to mTBI patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Mild TBI patients are predominately managed in the ED and discharged within hours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. While the majority will make a full recovery within a few weeks or months, approximately 15&#x02013;25&#x000a0;% of patients will go on to have post-concussion symptoms, e.g. subjective, self-reported ongoing headaches and cognitive problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. A small minority (approximately 1&#x000a0;%) deteriorate and require neurosurgical intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p>Evidence-based guideline recommendations are available to guide the care of patients with mTBI in the ED. However, studies indicate there is variability in management practices and care is often inconsistent with guideline recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The Neurotrauma Evidence Translation (NET) program is a 5-year knowledge translation program that aims to increase the uptake of research evidence to inform the care of patients who have sustained a TBI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. One of the program&#x02019;s objectives is to systematically develop and evaluate a targeted, theory- and evidence-informed intervention to increase the uptake of evidence in the ED management of mTBI. The intervention will be implemented in EDs across the states of Australia and its effectiveness will be evaluated in a cluster randomised trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p><p>Previous implementation research undertaken in the ED setting has identified influential factors at the levels of the individual clinician, the environment and the organisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Although some organisational constructs are represented in the TDF (e.g. under the domains &#x02018;Environmental Context and Resources&#x02019;, &#x02018;Social Influences&#x02019;, &#x02018;Social/Professional Role and Identity&#x02019; and &#x02018;Behavioural Regulation&#x02019;), further elaboration of the framework to include organisation-level influences has been suggested as a means of enhancing the usefulness of the framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Therefore, a conceptual model for considering potential factors influencing the organisational context of organisations was chosen to elaborate these domains. There are several frameworks available to explore the contextual factors influencing implementation of interventions in complex organisations such as the ED [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Context can be defined as &#x02018;influences which interact with each other, and interact with the implementation process&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. The Model of Diffusion of Innovations in Service Organisations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] was chosen as it was developed through a systematic review of the literature, covering 13 research areas in various disciplines (e.g. sociology, psychology, organisation and management), and the domains exploring organisational characteristics were comprehensive and deemed relevant for this setting. It identifies the main domains or areas in which factors influence the uptake and implementation of interventions in organisations. This model is only one way to investigate this issue but it is important to apply a model that has been developed from a strongly organisational perspective.</p><p>This paper describes the process of developing a targeted, theory- and evidence-informed intervention aiming to improve the management of mTBI in the ED, drawing on these two theoretical frameworks. It discusses the manner in which these frameworks were used in a complementary way to develop the intervention components and provides descriptions of the behaviour change techniques (BCTs) and modes of delivery used in the intervention and the causal processes targeted by the BCTs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><p>A stepped approach was used to develop the intervention (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) and is described in detail below. This approach was developed drawing on the methods outlined by French et al.

Recommendations from guidelines that met our quality criteria were extracted from the EBGs and included in a recommendation matrix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. To determine the focus of our study, we identified strong evidence-based recommendations (i.e. grade A or B) in key clinical management areas (i.e. present in the majority of included EBGs). An additional search of the literature from the date of the last search of the most up to date EBG was undertaken to identify additional studies. Evidence overview tables were developed that incorporated the supporting evidence from the recommendation matrix and the additional studies. These tables were discussed at an international consensus meeting to agree upon the evidence statements. Eleven participants attended the meeting representing a range of organisations located in Australia, the USA and Canada including major trauma centres and/or foundations. All participants had a background in (clinical) research with all but three of the participants being clinically trained. Two local stakeholder meetings were then held in conjunction with relevant local clinical conferences in Melbourne, Australia to discuss the relevance of these evidence statements to the Australian ED setting, and to develop recommendations in the form of statements about who does what, when and how. The 1.5&#x000a0;h meetings were attended by 15 participants representing stakeholders in metropolitan and rural hospitals throughout Australia, in a variety of (clinical) roles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Identify the evidence-practice gap</title><p>In order to quantify gaps between the recommendations agreed in &#x02018;<xref rid="Sec4" ref-type="sec">Identify or develop locally applicable, actionable evidence-based recommendations</xref>&#x02018; section and current practice, two activities were undertaken: (i) a scoping search of the literature to identify studies conducted measuring practice patterns relevant to the management of mTBI patients in the ED, and (ii) a retrospective audit of the medical records of consecutive adult patients presenting with mTBI to the EDs of two inner-city hospitals in the Australian state of Victoria over a 2-month period (April to May 2011) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Identify the barriers and enablers that need to be addressed using theoretical frameworks</title><p>Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with a sample of ED staff in the Australian state of Victoria to explore barriers and enablers to practice change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Using a topic guide, questions relating to the TDF were used to investigate each of the recommended clinical behaviours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and questions relating to the Model of Diffusion of Innovations in Service Organisations were used to explore the organisational context in which the management of mTBI and change occurs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Interviews were recorded and recordings were transcribed verbatim and anonymised. The interview transcripts were coded using thematic content analysis according to theoretical domains.

No space in the patient notes to include PTA information. ED has large workload and staff has increasing pressure to discharge patients quickly to free up beds.</td></tr><tr><td>Skills</td><td>Limited skills and training on how to assess PTA using validated tools.</td></tr><tr><td>Beliefs about consequences</td><td>Senior doctors do not see the additional benefits of using a validated tool to assess PTA, comfortable using their clinical experience. Using a tool to assess PTA is perceived as being more time consuming than using clinical questions and experience.</td></tr><tr><td>Social/professional role and identity</td><td>Assessing for PTA is seen as outside the role of the ED. Unsure of who is responsible for completing and promoting use of the validated PTA tool.</td></tr><tr><td>Beliefs about capabilities</td><td>Some ED clinicians find amnesia assessment difficult and there is inconsistency in assessment. Junior doctors find it more difficult due to their limited clinical experience.

Some overarching intervention components such as the stakeholder meeting and recruitment of local opinion leaders to deliver local training and the provision of reimbursement were proposed to overcome important organisational barriers and enhance enablers. These components were designed to address factors relevant to more than one clinical behaviour and, more broadly, to increase the compatibility of the intervention with the organisational setting. For instance, the primary reason for selecting local stakeholder meetings was to enhance organisational buy-in, e.g. provide the ED senior leadership with an opportunity to express commitment; to start the conversation with local stakeholders such as neuropsychologists and/or occupational therapists (as changes in ED practice may influence others in the hospital); to discuss how the recommended clinical behaviours fit with their current practices (e.g. protocols or pathways as relevant) and whether they foresaw any potential hurdles in introducing the intervention from an organisational point of view. The stakeholder meeting was also a first opportunity to introduce some of the BCTs selected to address TDF factors in relation to each recommended clinical behaviour (e.g. persuasive messages). Other organisational factors influenced decisions regarding the mode of delivery or feasibility of decisions (e.g. the high staff turnover rate in combination with an environment that is stretched means that local sessions need to be very brief, so they can be delivered frequently, and back-up materials (e.g. presentations with spoken script) need to be available for (new) staff to watch outside scheduled training moments.

Interactive workshops target knowledge, attitudes and skills. Practicalities: commonly used with the main cost related to the release time for healthcare professionals and feasible in most settings.</td><td>Educational meetings alone or combined with other interventions can improve professional practice and the patient healthcare outcomes. The effect on professional practice tended to be small and varied between studies, and the effect on patient outcomes was generally less. It is not possible to explain the observed differences in effect with confidence but it appeared that higher attendance at the meetings was associated with greater effects, that mixed interactive and didactic education was more effective than either alone, and that the effects were less for more complex behaviours and less serious outcomes.</td><td>81 randomised controlled trials (11,000+ health professionals). Median absolute improvement in care of 6.0&#x000a0;% (IQR +1.8&#x000a0;% to +15.3&#x000a0;%).</td><td>Mixed interactive workshops and didactic education.

Dependent on the existence of intact social networks within professional communities. Practicalities: resources required include cost of the identification method, training of opinion leaders and additional service costs.</td><td>Opinion leaders alone or in combination with other interventions may successfully promote evidence-based practice, but effectiveness varies both within and between studies. These results are based on heterogeneous studies differing in terms of type of intervention, setting, and outcomes measured. In most of the studies, the role of the opinion leader was not clearly described, and it is therefore not possible to say what the best way is to optimise the effectiveness of opinion leaders.</td><td>18 randomised controlled trials (296 hospitals and 318 primary care physicians). Median absolute improvement in care of 12&#x000a0;% (IQR +6.0&#x000a0;% to 14.5&#x000a0;%).</td><td>Local opinion leaders (clinical champions) to be nominated at each site and their characteristics and role to be clearly described.</td></tr><tr><td>Printed educational materials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]</td><td>Distribution of published or printed recommendations for clinical care including clinical practice guidelines, audio-visual materials and electronic publications.

Can be used to target motivation when written as a &#x02018;persuasive communication&#x02019; but little evidence of being used in this way. Practicalities: commonly used and relatively low cost and feasible in most settings.</td><td>Printed educational materials when used alone and compared to no intervention may have a small beneficial effect on professional practice outcomes. There is insufficient information to reliably estimate the effect of PEMs on patient outcomes, and clinical significance of the observed effect sizes is not known. The effectiveness of PEMs compared to other interventions, or of PEMs as part of a multifaceted intervention, is uncertain.</td><td>14 randomised controlled trials and 31 interrupted time series studies (ITS). Median absolute risk difference in categorical practice outcomes was 0.02 when PEMs were compared to no intervention (range from 0 to +0.11).</td><td>Clinical guideline and key research publications to be provided.</td></tr><tr><td>Audit and feedback [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]</td><td>Any summary of clinical performance of healthcare over a specified period of time to change health professional behaviour as indexed by objectively measured professional practice in a healthcare setting or healthcare outcomes.</td><td>Target: &#x02018;healthcare provider/peer groups&#x02019; perceptions of current performance levels and useful to create cognitive dissonance within healthcare professionals as a stimulus of behaviour change&#x02019;. Practicalities: resources required to deliver audit and feedback including data extraction, analysis and dissemination costs. Feasibility dependent on availability of meaningful routine administrative data for feedback.</td><td>Audit and feedback generally leads to small but potentially important improvements in professional practice. The effectiveness of audit and feedback seems to depend on baseline performance and how the feedback is provided. Audit and feedback may be most effective when: (1) the health professionals are not performing well to start out with, (2) the person responsible for the audit and feedback is a supervisor or colleague, (3) it is provided more than once, (4) it is given both verbally and in writing and (5) it includes clear targets and an action plan.</td><td>140 randomised controlled trials. Median adjusted RD was 4.3&#x000a0;% (IQR 0.5&#x000a0;% to 16&#x000a0;%).</td><td>Regular audit and feedback provided by senior work colleague, provided in verbal and written format.

Practicalities: resources necessary vary across the delivery mechanism.</td><td>Point of care computer reminders generally achieve small to modest improvements in provider behaviour. A minority of interventions showed larger effects, but no specific reminder or contextual features were significantly associated with effect magnitude. Further research must identify design features and contextual factors consistently associated with larger improvements in provider behaviour if computer reminders are to succeed on more than a trial and error basis.</td><td>28 randomised controlled trials.

Practicalities: considerable resources including the costs of detailers and preparation of materials.</td><td>Educational outreach visits alone or when combined with other interventions have effects on prescribing that are relatively consistent and small, but potentially important. Their effects on other types of professional performance vary from small to modest improvements, and it is not possible from this review to explain that variation.</td><td>69 randomised controlled trials involving 15,000&#x02009;+&#x02009;health professionals. Median adjusted risk difference (RD) in compliance with desired practice was 5.6&#x000a0;% (IQR 3.0&#x000a0;% to 9.0&#x000a0;%). The adjusted RDs were highly consistent for prescribing (median 4.8&#x000a0;%, IQR 3.0&#x000a0;% to 6.5&#x000a0;% for 17 comparisons), but varied for other types of professional performance (median 6.0&#x000a0;%, IQR 3.6&#x000a0;% to 16.0&#x000a0;% for 17 comparisons). EOVs appeared to be slightly superior to audit and feedback.</td><td>[Note: Although it was found that EOVs were effective, its use in improving prescribing practice was deemed the most consistent result. As prescribing is not included in the target behaviours, its applicability was questioned. The considerable cost of including this component in an intervention that will be implemented in a large number of hospitals, located in diverse locations was also seen as a reason for not including it as an intervention component.]</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>

The discussions resulted in the identification of five intervention components: local stakeholder meetings, identification of local opinion leader team (one medical and one nurse in each site), a train-the-trainer workshop for identified local opinion leaders, local training workshops facilitated by the trained local opinion leaders and the provision of tools and materials to prompt recommended behaviours. Several intervention components were deemed not feasible for implementation in the ED setting due to the limited time and resources available. These included changes to the electronic patient record system whereby a patient cannot be discharged without a patient information leaflet being printed out and the provision of regular audit and feedback data to clinical staff. Although there is evidence that regular audit and feedback can lead to improvements in professional performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>], the outcomes of interest (including the primary outcome for the cRCT) are not routinely collected, and it was not feasible to deliver across the 34 included EDs.

Four evidence-based recommendations were identified to improve the care of this patient group, and the intervention components targeting the PTA behaviour consisted of 14 behaviour change techniques and addressed 6 TDF domains and 5 organisational domains. The modes of delivery were informed by six Cochrane reviews. There were five intervention components.</p><p>The TDF is frequently being used by researchers to explore clinical behaviour change and develop implementation interventions. It covers a range of behavioural influences including capability, motivation and opportunity; further elaboration of the domains to include organisation-level influences has been suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. It is recommended that studies targeting multiple levels (e.g. clinician and organisational) should draw upon multiple theories [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. The benefit of studying change at the organisational level using organisational level theory, to complement the analyses regarding each recommended behaviour using the TDF, is that it facilitates exploration of the organisational context in greater detail and facilitates the inclusion of intervention components to directly target these influencing factors. There are limited practical examples in the literature of how to use theoretical frameworks when developing implementation interventions and this is, to our knowledge, the only study in the ED setting that has explicitly demonstrated how to use multiple theoretical frameworks to explore behaviour change and use these data to identify BCTs and develop intervention components.</p><p>The content of the intervention was designed to target hypothesised influences on behaviour and organisational change. This was achieved by selecting overarching strategies that were designed to address some of the organisational factors and/or maximise the likelihood that the intervention was fit for an organisational setting (e.g. stakeholder meetings and local opinion leaders), in addition to specifying BCTs relevant and tailored to each particular clinical behaviour. Synthesised evidence of professional behaviour change interventions and practical considerations of the mode of delivery informed development alongside theory and increased the likelihood that the end product was evidence-informed, feasible to deliver and acceptable to the ED community [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>].</p><p>The core components of the intervention, the training of local opinion leaders to deliver local training workshops, addressed the majority of the identified facilitators of behaviour change using the TDF. The TDF domain &#x02018;Environmental context and resources&#x02019; was not covered by the training components, and this domain was addressed with the provision of online and printed tools and materials, e.g. PTA assessment sheets and point of care reminder stickers. Intervention components, such as the involvement of senior leaders in local stakeholder meetings to create buy-in and the nomination of &#x02018;multidisciplinary&#x02019; local opinion leaders to provide regular, brief training sessions in the ED, were chosen to target key organisational factors. There were, however, several intervention components that were deemed as not feasible for the ED setting. A major strength of this study, and the process used, is the documentation of decisions, throughout the process, of why intervention components were chosen and why they may have been modified. This enables researchers to understand the reasons for selecting content.</p><p>On conceptual grounds, there is reason to propose that the intervention, being based on robust theories and methods, is more likely to be effective than interventions that are not based on theory and evidence. However, it requires a cluster randomised controlled trial (cRCT) to address the empirical question as to whether this robust process leads to measurable effectiveness. The effectiveness of this intervention to improve care of patients with mTBI will be evaluated in a cluster randomised controlled trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] and outcome measures of behaviour change and factors thought to mediate the effect of the intervention along the proposed pathway of change will be assessed. These include mediators of behaviour change (e.g. beliefs about capabilities, beliefs about consequences), measures of practitioner behaviour (e.g. primary practitioner outcome is appropriate PTA screening), patient outcomes and cost. The evaluation of the factors along the causal pathway will be complemented by other components that form part of a process evaluation. The details of these outcomes and the process evaluation measures are reported separately [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Implementation research is a cumulative science, and this intervention is in the process of a robust evaluation that will add to the evidence of the effectiveness of theory-informed interventions to improve clinical practice.</p><p>Although there have been a number of publications on the development of theory-informed interventions to improve clinical practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>], to our knowledge there have been few studies of this kind undertaken in the ED setting. A theory-informed intervention to implement two paediatric clinical pathways in the ED is being developed by Jabbour et al., but this is at the protocol stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. Gould et al. are developing two theoretically enhanced audit and feedback interventions to improve the uptake of evidence-based transfusion practice using the TDF in combination with the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. The study is not focussed in the ED setting and is at the protocol stage. The research detailed in this paper may offer insights and guidance to those wanting to design implementation interventions in the ED setting and to those interested in using multiple theoretical frameworks, in addition to evidence and feasibility considerations in the design of implementation interventions.</p><p>One of the criticisms of past implementation research is the difficulty of understanding what intervention components were selected and their hypothesised mechanism of action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. This study followed a systematic process detailing how the intervention was developed and providing detailed descriptions of the intervention content. The intervention components have been described according to the WIDER and TIDieR Guidance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and in terms of BCTs and modes of delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. This differentiation between intervention content (BCTs) and models of delivery enables other researchers to explore the effectiveness of the BCTs when a different mode of delivery is applied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>].</p><p>The recent validation and refinement of the TDF domains has strengthened the rationale for its methodology and use in implementation research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The validation of the TDF was published after the conduct of the interviews and therefore the original TDF was used to explore barriers and enablers with ED staff [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Although the BCTs were mapped to the original TDF domains, this process was supplemented with the BCTs proposed in the validation paper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] linking the BCT Taxonomy v1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] to the refined TDF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. This taxonomy was recently updated to include 93 BCTs and 14 domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>].</p><p>If theory is poorly operationalised, it will be less useful in identifying factors that influence outcomes in specified settings. Thus, an intervention may be ineffective due to the research team&#x02019;s operationalisation of theory when developing the intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. This is potentially a methodological limitation of this study; although we used a systematic and replicable process to operationalise the theoretical domains in terms of appropriate intervention components, the process was conducted by just one research team. There is, however, little research on how best to operationalise theory in the context of intervention development and selecting or designing intervention components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. The research team did, however, include a wide range of ED clinicians, behavioural scientists and evidence-based researchers to incorporate a breadth of experience.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This paper provides a systematic, theory- and evidence-informed approach to developing an intervention aiming to change professional practice in the ED setting. Theoretical frameworks, evidence-based behaviour change techniques, evidence about the effects of modes of delivery (EPOC systematic reviews) and feasibility information were systematically brought together to develop an intervention that aims to improve the management of mTBI patients in the ED.
