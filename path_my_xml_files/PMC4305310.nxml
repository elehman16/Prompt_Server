Randomized double-blind placebo-controlled crossover trials were performed, separated by a 4-week washout. Healthy young men were randomized into two groups and received capsule containing either 5 mg of Rg1 or Placebo one night and one hour before exercise. Muscle biopsies were conducted at baseline, immediately and 3 h after a standardized 60-min cycle ergometer exercise. While treatment differences in glycogen depletion rate of biopsied quadriceps muscle during exercise did not reach statistical significance, Rg1 supplementations enhanced post-exercise glycogen replenishment and increased citrate synthase activity in the skeletal muscle 3 h after exercise, concurrent with improved meal tolerance during recovery (P&#x0003c;0.05). Rg1 suppressed the exercise-induced increases in thiobarbituric acids reactive substance (TBARS) and reversed the increased TNF-alpha and decreased IL-10 mRNA of quadriceps muscle against the exercise challenge. PGC-1 alpha and GLUT4 mRNAs of exercised muscle were not affected by Rg1. Maximal aerobic capacity (VO<sub>2max</sub>) was not changed by Rg1. However, cycling time to exhaustion at 80% VO<sub>2max</sub> increased significantly by ~20% (P&#x0003c;0.05). Conclusion: Our result suggests that Rg1 is an ergogenic component of ginseng, which can minimize unwanted lipid peroxidation of exercised human skeletal muscle, and attenuate pro-inflammatory shift under exercise challenge.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was supported by National Science Council (101-2622-H-154-001-CC2), University of Taipei, and NuLiv Wellness, Taiwan.

However, previous scientific studies present mixed results [<xref rid="pone.0116387.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0116387.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. One major limitation in ginseng research is its inconsistent ginsenoside profile due to differences in variant type, harvesting season, and cultivated soil [<xref rid="pone.0116387.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0116387.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. To circumvent such shortcomings, bioactive components of ginseng, which can modulate metabolism and physical performance, need to be identified and studied independently in order to standardize ginseng and make it a reliable ergogenic or health-promoting nutraceutical.</p><p>Ginsenosides as a class of glycosylated steroids found in many types of ginseng have been the major target of ginseng research in recent years. However, the existing ginsenoside reports on physiological and metabolic functions are mostly limited in animal studies or <italic>in vitro</italic> cultured human cell models. To date, empirical evidence demonstrating ginsenosides can improve human physical performance and metabolism is unavailable. It has been documented in one animal study that 4 days of ginseng saponin supplementation (10 and 20 mg/kg/day) can significantly increase endurance performance of rats exercising at approximately 70% of maximal oxygen consumption (VO<sub>2max</sub>). Ginseng saponin devoid of Rg1 and Rb1 failed to demonstrate this positive effect, suggesting that these major steroidal compounds of ginseng may be responsible for the performance-enhancing attribute [<xref rid="pone.0116387.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Exercise challenge inevitably generates unwanted molecular modification on cellular lipid components as a result of increasing metabolic stress. Increasing lipid peroxidation could result in compromised mitochondria function and carbohydrate metabolism [<xref rid="pone.0116387.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0116387.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In a previous study involving race horses, a close association between pre-competition TBARS (biomarker of lipid peroxidation) level and endurance performance was reported, suggesting that accumulation of oxidized lipid components can undermine physical performance [<xref rid="pone.0116387.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Therefore, minimizing such molecular attrition of lipid components in skeletal muscle during intensive exercise is essential for maintaining uncompromised metabolic function, physical performance, and post-exercise recovery/adaptation. Although the free radical scavenging effect of ginseng has been documented in several <italic>in vitro</italic> studies [<xref rid="pone.0116387.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0116387.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], no existing literature has reported whether ginsenosides from ginseng contribute to the effect in exercised human skeletal muscle.</p><p>Oxidation-specific epitopes of lipids are danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMP) of cells that trigger inflammation [<xref rid="pone.0116387.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Once inflammation is triggered, pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF&#x00251; and IL-6 are released from challenged tissue to orchestrate the local inflammation events aiming to clear damaged cells and reconstruct the tissues [<xref rid="pone.0116387.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In contrast, the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 inhibits the inflammation process when the tissue is sufficiently restored [<xref rid="pone.0116387.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0116387.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Thus, inflammatory balance can reflect the health status or robustness of skeletal muscle against an acute bout of physical challenge [<xref rid="pone.0116387.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In this study, inflammatory responses were measured to evaluate the influence of pre-workout ginsenoside Rg1 supplementations on the coping capability of human skeletal muscle against an exercise challenge.</p><p>Here, we hypothesized that Rg1 can improve endurance performance at high intensity exercise and modulate inflammatory balance in exercised skeletal muscle. Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trials were conducted to evaluate TNF-alpha and IL-10 mRNAs in the exercised human skeletal muscle and the ergogenic outcomes, including aerobic fitness and endurance performance at 80% VO<sub>2max</sub>, after pre-workout Rg1 supplementations. Training adaptation markers of skeletal muscle, including citrate synthase activity and glycogen storage rate from biopsied <italic>vastus lateralis</italic> were also determined immediately and 3 h after a standardized 60-min exercise.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec002a"><title>Ginsenosides Rg1</title><p>Rg1 (NuLiv Science, Inc., Walnut, California, USA) is a major ginsenoside compound of <italic>Panax Notoginseng</italic>, which has a steroid core structure and covalently bonded with sugars (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0116387.g001">Fig. 1</xref>), also existing in most species of ginseng.</p><fig id="pone.0116387.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0116387.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Chemical structures of Rg1.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0116387.g001"/></fig></sec><sec id="sec002b"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>Human trials, which include inform consent procedure, were approved by Institutional Review Board of The University of Taipei before the study began.

One night prior to the exercise challenge (~12 h), all subjects were instructed to take a standard diet (plus can of Ensure) along with their first dose of either Rg1 or placebo capsule provided by a research assistant in the laboratory at University of Taipei. For each trial, subjects consumed a bottle of mineral water (Taiwan Yes Deep Ocean Water Co., Ltd., Hualien, Taiwan) on the day of the experiment, and 1-h prior to the exercise challenge when subjects received their 2<sup>nd</sup> dose of Rg1 or Placebo.</p><p>Research committee recommended that the group receives 50&#x02013;100% of the lowest dose of Rg1 according to preliminary animal results, which generates the most favorable glucose tolerance. Each Rg1 capsule contains 5 mg of Rg1 with flour powder, whereas placebo capsule contains same amount of flour. Effects of Rg1 were always evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover fashion with a 4-week washout period to remove possible residual effects of oral ginsenoside intake. Participants were randomly assigned to one of two parallel groups, initially in 1:1 ratio, to receive either Rg1 or Placebo under supervision of a staff to ensure subject compliance. The Rg1 and Placebo were in capsule form with identical in appearance. They were placed in a container and consecutively numbered for each participant according to the randomization schedule. Each participant was assigned an order number and received the capsules in the corresponding bag. A computer-generated list of random numbers was used for allocation of the participants. Project manager enrolled participants. A research staff assigned participants to interventions. Except for the interventionists, investigators and staff were kept blind to supplement assignment of the participants. The trial maintained separation between staff that take outcome measurements and staff that deliver the intervention. Staffs and participants were kept masked to outcome measurements and trial results.</p><p>Trial 1 (n = 14, untrained healthy men, age 21.1&#x000b1;1.3 years, weight 72.6&#x000b1;7.8 kg, height 176.6&#x000b1;1.0 cm, VO<sub>2max</sub> 3.1&#x000b1;0.2 L/min) was designed to measure glycogen recovery of skeletal muscle and meal tolerance after 1 hour of exercise at 70% VO<sub>2max</sub>.

The extracted RNA was dissolved in RNase free water. Reverse transcription reactions were performed on extracted RNA using an iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad Labatories, Inc., Herciles, CA, USA) in a reaction volume of 40 &#x003bc;l. Primers and TaqMan probes were designed using BioRad Beacon Designer (BioRad Labatories, Herciles, CA, USA). All primers and TaqMan probes were supplied from the same vender (Sigma Proligo, Singapore). We quantified gene expression against 18S rRNA as a reference gene, using a critical threshold (CT) method using the MyiQ real-time PCR detection system (BioRad Labatories, Herciles, CA, USA). A CT value reflects the cycle number at which the DNA amplification is first detected. PCR amplification was carried out in 25 &#x003bc;l reactions of iQ supermix, 400 nM forward primer, 400 nM reverse primer, and 300 nM TaqMan probe. Each reaction was made up to volume with DNase-free water. Fold changes against control were calculated using the 2&#x02212;&#x00394;&#x00394;CT method.

These untrained participants were able to undertake approximately 20% additional work on a cycle ergometer compared with Placebo trial. Muscle contraction unavoidably increases oxidative attrition on cellular components, as shown by increased TBARS as a byproduct of lipid peroxidation, which can result in a transient weakening of cellular function. Thus, the improvement in endurance performance by Rg1 could be associated, in part, with better preservation of native lipid structure in skeletal muscle during exercise.</p><p>Optimization of physical performance demands uncompromised metabolic function in the maintenance of ATP regeneration, substrate replenishment, and tissue repair during and after exercise. Here we observed relative to a placebo control a suppressed accumulation of lipid peroxidation in exercised skeletal muscle after Rg1 administration, coincident with enhanced meal tolerance, glycogen accumulation, and mitochondria enzyme adaptation during recovery. Increasing lipid peroxidation is well-known to cause a fundamental impact on metabolic function, such as decreased insulin sensitivity of skeletal muscle [<xref rid="pone.0116387.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and deterioration in mitochondria function [<xref rid="pone.0116387.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Thus, results of the study suggest that improved endurance performance and accelerated functional recovery of skeletal muscle are associated with the buffering action of Rg1 against oxidative stress induced by exercise.</p><p>Accumulated oxidative damage is a form of DAMP recognized by receptors of innate immunity to initiate inflammation [<xref rid="pone.0116387.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Along with an increase in lipid peroxidation following exercise, we found significantly increased TNF&#x00251; mRNA and decreased IL-10 mRNA in human skeletal muscle, indicating an inflammatory potentiation. This potentiation is eliminated after pre-workout Rg1 supplementations. The elimination of this pro-inflammatory shift by Rg1 administration appeared to be associated with elimination of TBARS after exercise. Inflammation is a mechanism of multicellular organisms to initiate the local healing process in response to traumatic stimuli by removing unhealthy cells and triggering repopulation of the tissue. IL-10 has been considered an anti-inflammatory cytokine that functions to inhibit early stage of inflammation process when the tissue is returning healthy. The result of the study demonstrates that Rg1 can modulate inflammation status of human skeletal muscle after an acute bout of exercise. Thus, this observed response after Rg1 administration might be associated with a decreased production of oxidation-specific epitopes in exercised skeletal muscle.</p><p>An increase in citrate synthase activity in skeletal muscle is widely considered an indication of increased mitochondria density following exercise training. This adaptive response takes place slowly and is not generally observed within 3 h of post-exercise recovery. Therefore, Rg1 administration may stabilize the infrastructure of exercised muscle, reduce the need for tissue repair, and pave the way for a faster functional recovery and adaptation.</p><p>It is unclear how Rg1 protects lipid components of skeletal muscle against exercise-induced oxidative stress. We speculate that the antioxidant effect of Rg1 may be a result of plasma membrane stabilization of skeletal muscle against exercise. After a traumatic challenge, activated macrophage during inflammation can further increase local free radicals. Decreased membrane fluidity is associated with increased oxidative stress [<xref rid="pone.0116387.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Plasma membrane is an important site where cell signaling is taking place. A previous <italic>in vitro</italic> study reported an increased membrane fluidity after Rg1 treatment [<xref rid="pone.0116387.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. We propose that incorporation of the bulky steroid moiety of Rg1 into cellular membrane lipid may enhance molecular complexity and mechanical stability of the cell and mitochondrial membranes against temperature shifts and ionic leakage across membranes during a changing rate of oxidation [<xref rid="pone.0116387.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0116387.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Temperature shifts typically occurs during and after exercise. Thus, molecular stabilization of membrane lipid structures after Rg1 supplementations may increase the robustness of skeletal muscle to withstand the challenged created by temperature shift during exercise. This buffering action may preserve the health of skeletal muscle, which is essential for adaptive response in both mitochondria biogenesis and transmembrane insulin signaling system.</p><p>It is surprising that no glycogen accumulation occurs during the 3 h recovery in Placebo trial. The depth of needle biopsy has been controlled to superficial area. In animals, muscle fiber composition varied markedly between deep and superficial muscle samples [<xref rid="pone.0116387.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], which may affects glycogen turnover. Superficial muscle fiber containing more type 2 fiber, which tends to be less insulin sensitive in glycogen storage and thus may explain why glycogen of exercised muscle has not been recovered in 3 h.</p><p>In conclusion, our study discovers that the ginseng-based steroid Rg1 can offer ergogenic benefits for humans. The accelerated post-exercise recovery and mitochondria enzyme adaptation after Rg1 pre-treatment appears to be mediated by its capability to buffer exercise-induced oxidative stress in human skeletal muscle. This is evidenced by the observation that Rg1 suppressed an increase in TBARS and attenuated a pro-inflammatory shift caused by prolonged exercise challenge.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0116387.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
