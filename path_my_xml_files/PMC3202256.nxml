The child suffers from intense itching, grittiness, discharge, redness, lacrimation, photophobia, and so on, thereby, decreasing his learning hours. The troublesome features are aggravated in the spring season / hot climate that lasts for years together and rarely persists after adolescence. Mast cell stabilizers, topical Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and steroids are the available treatment options that too with symptomatic relief and potential side effects, which limits the long-term use of these medicines. The clinical picture of vernal keratoconjunctivitis / spring catarrh is very similar to <italic>Kaphaja Abhishyanda</italic>, and <italic>Triyushnadi Anjana</italic> Bhaishajya Ratnavali (B.R.), and its treatment was clinically tried on the patients attending the Netra Roga OPD of the R.G. Government P.G. Ayurveda College Hospital at Paprola (H.P.). A proper protocol and performa was adopted with strict inclusion and exclusion criteria. In the first phase, a pilot study was conducted on 38 clinically diagnosed patients with vernal keratoconjunctivitis, and it gave 100% relief in photophobia, foreign body (FB) sensation, and lacrimation, with marked relief in other features. Encouraged by this pilot work, <italic>Triyushnadi Anjana</italic> (TA) and 2% sodium cromoglycate (mast cell stabilizer) eye drops in the second-phase clinical trial on 32 patients were tried clinically to evaluate the comparative efficacy. In the second clinical trial, the patients were randomly divided into two groups and Group I was given sodium cromoglycate 2% eye drops and Group II was given TA. The outcome of this study verified the results of the first phase pilot study, and on comparison of the results of the two groups in the second clinical study it was observed that the TA-treated group showed better results. Transient irritation in the eyes was reported by all patients after application of TA, which was relieved by keeping the eyes closed for a few minutes. None of the patients reported any adverse action of the trial drug. Thus, it can be concluded that TA is a safe, cost-effective, and potent Ayurvedic alternative in the treatment of vernal keratoconjunctivitis / spring catarrh.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>Kaphaja Abhishyanda</italic></kwd><kwd> vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC)</kwd><kwd><italic>Triyushnadi Anjana</italic> (TA)</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Awareness, environment, and health are so closely interlinked that ignoring any one of them will lead to a disturbed ecosystem as well as the well-being of the society as a whole. Ayurveda, a perfect life science has laid its full emphasis on nature, natural resources, and environment, for the maintenance of a healthy life as well as for combating the disease condition. Thus, the key to man's health lies largely in the environment one lives in; and the study of the disease is really the study of man and its environment. In fact, much of a man's ill-health can be traced to environmental factors. Adverse environmental factors disturb the natural rhythmic circadian and seasonal rhythms leading to an altered homeostasis. This disharmony directly / adversely affects the immune system of the body and the disease resistance power.</p><p>In such circumstances, even minor exo- and endogenous etiological factors cause the human body to suffer serious disease. The skin, eyes, and respiratory tract show immediate response to the exogenous factors called allergens. The oral cavity being continuously flushed with saliva is at the least risk. Sensitivity to allergies may develop any time in life, although greater propensity for the development of allergic diseases appears to occur in childhood and adolescence.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>]</p><p>Allergic conjunctivitis in childhood and adolescent age is common and often mistaken for infective conjunctivitis. Among the different varieties of allergic conjunctivitis, vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC) is the most troublesome, wherein, the child suffers from intense itching grittiness, mucoid discharge, redness, lacrimation, photophobia, and so on. The disease is chronic / refractory and becomes worse during the warm months.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] Pollens are considered to be the main allergens, but recent observations show that VKC appears perennially, and that the pollens are not the sole cause behind it.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>]</p><p>Although the disease does not affect the vision, it is an extremely discomforting disease of childhood, decreasing the learning hours of the child, and may last for years. Rarely it may cause corneal ulcer[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] or keratoconus effecting vision.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>]</p><p>Mast cell stabilizers (e.g. sodium cromoglycate), NSAIDs and topical corticosteroids are the treatment options, but only symptomatic relief is the outcome.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] On the other hand, drug sensitivity, increasing resistance, preservative-induced dry eye, as well as the complications of the corticosteroids, for example, cataract, glaucoma, and increased risk of bacterial and fungal infections restrict the long-term use of these medicines.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>]</p><p>With this background profile about the disease and keeping in view the high number of patients with this problem in Paprola (H.P.), it is felt that it may be due to the high vegetativeflora and pollen. A study was planned, to search for a permanent, cost-effective, safe, and effective remedy for the treatment of spring catarrh-VKC.</p><p>The spring catarrh nomenclature of the disease is indicative of seasonal (<italic>Vasanta Ritu</italic>) incidence, and as per the Ayurvedic principles, it is the <italic>Kapha Prakopa</italic> period of the year.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] Childhood age group is the <italic>Kapha</italic> dominating period of life[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] and the clinical features of the disease simulate those of <italic>Kaphaja Abhishyanda</italic>. The <italic>Lekhana</italic> type of therapeutic procedure is the main line of treatment forn <italic>Kaphaja Netra Rogas</italic> in the classics.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>]</p><p>The literature of the <italic>Shalakya Netra Roga Chikitsa</italic> (ophthalmology) was therefore explored, to select a classical formulation indicated in the treatment of the <italic>Kaphaja</italic> type of eye disease, having <italic>Lekhana</italic> therapeutic values. The contents of the drug had to be easily available, and had to have no controversy. <italic>Triyushnadi Anjana Gutika</italic>, a collyrium that is mentioned in the <italic>Bhaishajya Ratnavali Netra Chikitsa</italic> chapter fulfilled our criteria for drug selection,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] and was selected for the trial.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-2"><title>Aims and Objectives</title><p>

All the contents of the formulation were powdered to the finest possible level and an equal quantity of each ingredient was taken in a pestle and mortar and again triturated / ground for three days.

This observation also verified the fact reported on the shifting nature of the onset of VKC. In both the studies, patients having a <italic>Kapha Pittaja / Pitta Kaphaja</italic> temperament dominated in number, which proved our hypothesis that VKC was a <italic>Kapha</italic> dominating (<italic>Raktaja</italic>)recessive disease.</p><p>In the first and second studies, the incidence of clinical features, such as, itching (100 and 100%), discharge (60.52 and 46.87%), lacrimation (84.21 and 81.25%), burning sensation (60.52 and 34.37%), photophobia (39.47 and 65.62%), FB sensation (34.21 and 46.87%), conjunctival congestion (100 and 90%), bulbar conjunctival hypertrophy (100 and 93.75%), and palpebral conjunctival hypertrophy (50 and 37.5%) was noted.</p><p>In the follow-up period, there was not much variation in the relief profile; however, those patients who continued the Anjana after the follow-up period, for two months more, got rid of their problem. VKC being a chronic eye ailment, needed a longer duration for a complete cure.</p><p>Itching, discharge, and conjunctival hypertrophy are <italic>Kapha</italic> dominating features, whereas, lacrimation, burning, lacrimation photophobia, and congestion are the <italic>Pitta / Rakta</italic> dominating features of the disease. The FB sensation is the Vata dominating clinical feature of the disease.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-14"><title>Clinical study</title><p>In the first study 100% relief in lacrimation, photophobia, and FB sensation was observed. Ninety percent relief in discharge, 88.88% relief in burning sensation, and 84% relief in itching was reported by the patients. Palpebral and bulbar conjunctival congestion reduced to the extent of 69.41 and 50%, respectively, whereas, palpebral and bulbar hypertrophy got relieved by 89.47 and 65 &#x02013; 95%, respectively.</p><p>By this outcome, it was inferred that the inflammatory features / pathology were most targeted by this compound TA, whereas, hypertrophic changes at the cellular level took a longer time to be reversed.</p><p>In the second study, the compound TA was compared with sodium cromoglycate. It was observed that the percentage level of efficacy was better in the TA-treated group (II). In both the groups, the percentage relief in itching was 57.77 / 89.60, lacrimation 60 / 86.95, discharge 63 / 71.85, photophobia 81.96 / 100, burning sensation 84 / 100, and FB sensation 75 / 100, respectively. Other clinical features too had a better level of relief in the case of group II (TA treated group). It was also noted that in both studies TA-treated patients showed almost similar results.</p><p>The conjunctival smear examination in the case of the pilot study (i.e., the first study) revealed that three to four eosinophils per 50 objective fields were seen in each patient. The histopathological study of the conjunctival tissue in the second study showed type I and type IV hypersensitivity reactions in the case of VKC, which was also as per the classical references.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-15"><title>Mode of action</title><p>As discussed earlier in this section, VKC / spring catarrh is a <italic>Kapha</italic> dominating <italic>Raktaja</italic> ocular surface disorder.
