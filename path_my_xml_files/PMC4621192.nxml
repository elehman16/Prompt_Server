The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of dicloxacillin after single and multiple oral dose in healthy Chinese volunteers.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A single-center, open-label, randomized, two-phase study was conducted in 16 subjects. In the single-dose phase, subjects were randomly assigned to receive single doses of 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 g of dicloxacillin sodium capsule in a 4-way crossover design with a 5-day washout period between administrations. In the multiple-dose phase, subjects were assigned to receive 0.25 or 0.5 g every 6 hours for 3 days in a 2-way crossover design. Plasma and urine pharmacokinetic samples were assayed by a validated high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated and analyzed statistically. Safety assessments were conducted throughout the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Following a single oral dose of 0.25&#x02013;2.0 g dicloxacillin sodium, the maximum plasma drug concentration (C<sub>max</sub>) and the corresponding values for the area under the concentration&#x02013; time curve from 0 to 10 hours (AUC0&#x02013;10 h) increased in a dose-proportional manner. The mean elimination half-life (t<sub>1/2</sub>) was in the range of 1.38&#x02013;1.71 hours. Dicloxacillin was excreted in its unchanged form via the kidney, with no tendency of accumulation, and varied from 38.65% to 50.10%. No appreciable accumulation of drug occurred with multiple oral doses of dicloxacillin. No serious adverse events were reported. Adverse events were generally mild.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Dicloxacillin was safe and well tolerated in the volunteers and displayed linear increases in the C<sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>0&#x02013;10 h</sub> values.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>dicloxacillin</kwd><kwd>safety</kwd><kwd>tolerability</kwd><kwd>pharmacokinetics</kwd><kwd>healthy volunteers</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Dicloxacillin is a semisynthetic isoxazolyl penicillin antibiotic. It can be given by injection or by mouth as its sodium salt has significant activity against gram-positive &#x003b2;-lactamase-producing microorganisms.<xref rid="b1-dddt-9-5687" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Compared with isoxazole penicillins in current clinical use, namely, oxacillin, cloxacillin, and flucloxacillin, dicloxacillin has been proved as active against <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic>, <italic>Streptococcus pneumonia</italic>, <italic>Streptococcus epidermidis</italic>, <italic>Streptococcus viridans</italic>, <italic>Streptococcus agalactiae</italic>, <italic>and Neisseria meningitidis</italic>.<xref rid="b2-dddt-9-5687" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b4-dddt-9-5687" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> It is currently used in the treatment of bacterial infections such as pneumonia and bone, ear, skin, and urinary tract infection.<xref rid="b5-dddt-9-5687" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b8-dddt-9-5687" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><p>Dicloxacillin is characterized by time-dependent bactericidal activity, which means that drug concentration higher than the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for an adequate percentage of time in a dosing interval (%T &#x0003e; MIC) must be maintained for efficacy. For these agents, increasing the concentration does not necessarily increase the rate or extent of killing; the best results are achieved by optimizing the duration of exposure to effective concentrations. Previous study indicated that a dosing regimen of 1 g dicloxacillin every 6 hours should be effective for <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> infections with a mean MIC value of 0.125 &#x000b5;g&#x000b7;mL<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (achieving 67%T &#x0003e; MIC).<xref rid="b9-dddt-9-5687" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p><p>T &#x0003e; MIC is dependent on the half-life (t<sub>1/2</sub>) of dicloxacillin and its serum concentration. Previous studies have proved that it is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, with the higher and more prolonged serum concentration than other isoxazole penicillins.<xref rid="b10-dddt-9-5687" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b11-dddt-9-5687" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> A previous pharmacokinetic study reported that the mean absolute bioavailability of dicloxacillin was higher than cloxacillin (48.8% versus 36.9%) in healthy volunteers, with the higher cumulative urinary excretion in their unchanged form after oral administration of 2 g dicloxacillin or 2 g cloxacillin (74.1% versus 48.5%).<xref rid="b12-dddt-9-5687" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> The t<sub>1/2</sub> was slower than cloxacillin (42 minutes versus 33 minutes). Furthermore, James et al reported that the higher protein binding of dicloxacillin did not prevent it having equal or superior antistaphylococcal activity, comparing with cloxacillin, oxacillin, and nafcillin, when given at equal doses.<xref rid="b13-dddt-9-5687" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b15-dddt-9-5687" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p><p>Several studies on its pharmacokinetic properties have been carried out in Western population, including healthy subjects<xref rid="b16-dddt-9-5687" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="b17-dddt-9-5687" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> of young and old age, children,<xref rid="b18-dddt-9-5687" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> and hemodialysis subjects.<xref rid="b12-dddt-9-5687" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> These studies revealed that its pharmacokinetics may vary between healthy subjects and patients, as well as between younger and older subjects, so further investigation of dicloxacillin pharmacokinetics was required for these different subgroups. Because the drug is not marketed in mainland China, its pharmacokinetics in Chinese population is poorly understood. Furthermore, race, age, body weight, hepatic, and renal functions or co-administered drugs, genetic polymorphism of drug metabolism enzymes, and drug transporters are important causes of pharmacokinetic variation, which may affect their safety, efficacy, and dosage. There-fore, the ability to extrapolate clinical efficacy and safety data from one region to another requires an understanding of ethnic similarities and differences in drug pharmacokinetics. The present study was conducted to determine the pharmacokinetics and tolerability of a generic formulation of dicloxacillin sodium in healthy Chinese adult subjects. The effect of sex on the pharmacokinetics of dicloxacillin was evaluated as a secondary objective. The study was conducted to meet China Food and Drug Administration requirements for marketing of the new generic formulation. These results will facilitate the understanding of pharmacological characteristics of dicloxacillin and provide a basis for better clinical use of the drug in Chinese population in the future.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Subjects</title><p>Healthy male and female subjects, aged 18&#x02013;45 years, with body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 25 kg&#x000b7;m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>, were eligible to participate in this study.

This single-center, open-label, two-part (parts 1 and 2) study was conducted in healthy adult subjects. It was conducted from October 8, 2013 to January 25, 2014.</p><p>Part 1 was a randomized 4-way crossover, open-label, single-dose study in which 16 subjects received each of the following four treatments in a randomized sequence: 0.25&#x02013;0.5&#x02013;1.0&#x02013;2.0 g, 0.5&#x02013;1.0&#x02013;2.0&#x02013;0.25 g, 1.0&#x02013;2.0&#x02013;0.25&#x02013;0.5 g, and 2.0&#x02013;0.25&#x02013;0.5&#x02013;1.0 g according to a computer-generated randomization schedule (SAS 9.1, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Treatments were separated by 5-day washout periods. All subjects fasted (ie, no food and liquid except water) for at least 10 hours prior to administration of study drug and continued fasting for 4 hours thereafter. Water was allowed as needed for up to 2 hours before drug intake and from 2 hours after intake.</p><p>In brief, 15 subjects (eight males and seven females) who completed the single-dose phase, and another female volunteer rescreening were enrolled in the multiple-dose phase (Part 2). They were randomly assigned to receive 0.25 or 0.5 g every 6 hours for 3 days in a 2-way crossover design. Subjects were confined to the study center, received standard meals daily (at 8 am, 11 am, and 5 pm) for two consecutive days. At approximately 7 am on day 3, subjects received the last dose of their assigned treatment in the fasted state. Standard meals were provided to all subjects at 4 and 10 hours after study drug administration.</p><p>For both parts of this study, dicloxacillin sodium capsules (0.25 g per capsule; lot 9130574) were supplied by Bright Future Pharmaceuticals Factory (Yuen Long, N.T., Hong Kong).

The physicians were responsible for determining the clinical significance of the AEs. All information, including undesirable symptoms or medical conditions after dosing, were recorded on the case-report form by investigators regardless of the suspected relationship to the study drug.</p></sec><sec><title>Pharmacokinetic parameters and assessment</title><p>In Part 1 of the study (single dosing), blood samples (4 mL) were collected from an indwelling venous catheter into heparinized tubes before each dose (0 hours) and at 0.167, 0.333, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.25, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 10 hours after each dose. The blood samples were centrifuged at 3,000&#x000d7; <italic>g</italic> for 10 minutes at 4&#x000b0;C, and the plasma samples were stored at &#x02212;70&#x000b0;C until analyzed. Urine samples were collected from 0 hours (pre-dose) and from 0 to 2, 2 to 4, 4 to 6, 6 to 8, 8 to 12, and 12 to 24 hours after each treatment. At the end of the interval, the urine bottles were shaken and the overall urinary excretion was measured and noted with accuracy. Approximately 15 mL of urine from each volunteer was collected and stored at &#x02212;70&#x000b0;C for future experiments.</p><p>In Part 2 (0.25 or 0.5 g q6h for a total of nine doses), blood samples were collected at 0.167, 0.333, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.25, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 10 hours after the last dose. Additional blood samples were obtained before the seventh, eighth, and ninth dose administration to determine the plasma drug concentration at a steady state. Other experimental conditions were the same as in the single-dose phase.</p><p>Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was used to measure the concentrations of dicloxacillin in plasma and urine samples. The LC-MS/MS system included an Agilent 1200 high-performance liquid chromatography and Agilent 6410 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA). Chromatography was performed with an Agilent ZORBAX SB-Aq column (3.0 mm &#x000d7;100 mm, 3.5 &#x000b5;m) and the mobile phase was water with 0.5% formic acid (A)&#x02013;acetonitrile (B) at a flow rate of 0.5 mL&#x000b7;min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. The gradient elution program: 0&#x02013;4.5 minutes, 55%A/45%B; 4.6&#x02013;6.0 minutes, 95%A/5%B; 6.1&#x02013;8.0 minutes, 55%A/45%B.</p><p>Samples were analyzed by LC-MS/MS in multiple reaction monitoring mode using electrospray ionization as the ionization technique. The optimized instrumental parameters for mass spectral acquisition were as follows: capillary voltage was set to 4,000 V; nitrogen was used as a nebulizer gas and nebulizer pressure was set at 35 psi; desolvation gas (nitrogen) was heated to 300&#x000b0;C and delivered at a flow rate of 8 L&#x000b7;min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. In order to precipitate proteins, plasma samples were pretreated with two volumes of acetonitrile. The resulting supernatant (10 &#x000b5;L) was injected into the LC-MS/MS system for analysis. Calibration curves were constructed at concentrations of 0.1808&#x02013;72.32 &#x000b5;g&#x000b7;mL<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> for plasma. Plasma samples above the limit of quantitation were diluted and reanalyzed to yield results within the calibrated range. Stability tests showed that plasma sample decomposition was &#x0003c;15% for all conditions examined (6 hours at room temperature, 3 freeze&#x02013;thaw cycles [&#x02212;70&#x000b0;C], and 127 days after storage at or below 70&#x000b0;C). Separate sets of analytical quality control samples (for concentrations of 0.3619, 5.424, and 54.24 &#x000b5;g&#x000b7;mL<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) were used to assess assay precision and accuracy. The intra- and inter-day precisions (relative standard deviation, %RSD) were &#x02264;3.77% and &#x02264;6.52%, respectively. The intra- and inter-day recovery rates were 94.02%&#x02013;108.13% and 95.86%&#x02013;106.55%, respectively.</p><p>Urine samples were diluted using 1 mL of acetonitrile&#x02013;water (40:60 [vol/vol]), and the supernatant (2 &#x000b5;L) was injected into the LC-MS/MS system for analysis. Two calibration curves were used for analyzing dicloxacillin in urine. The calibration curves showed the linear correlation (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>&#x02265;0.9991) within the range of 0.9288&#x02013;928.8 &#x000b5;g&#x000b7;mL<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and 461.1&#x02013;7377.0 &#x000b5;g&#x000b7;mL<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>.

Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by a non-compartment method using WinNonlin 6.3 software (Phar-sight Corporation, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). The following pharmacokinetic parameters were obtained for Part 1: maximum plasma concentration (C<sub>max</sub>), time to maximum plasma concentration (T<sub>max</sub>), elimination half-life (t<sub>1/2</sub>), area under the concentration&#x02013;time curve from time zero to the last quantifiable concentration (AUC<sub>0&#x02013;10 h</sub>), AUC from time zero extrapolated to infinity (AUC<sub>0&#x02013;&#x0221e;</sub>), apparent oral clearance (CL/F), apparent volume of distribution during the terminal elimination phase following extravascular administration (V<sub>z</sub>/F). For multiple-dose study, the time to reach peak concentration (T<sub>max,ss</sub>) and maximum and minimum plasma concentration at the steady state (C<sub>max,ss</sub> and C<sub>min,ss</sub>) were determined directly from experimental observations. The accumulation ratio was calculated as the ratio of AUC<sub>0&#x02013;&#x003c4;,ss</sub> to AUC<sub>0&#x02013;&#x003c4;</sub> (single dose), and the fluctuation ratio was calculated by (C<sub>max,ss</sub> &#x02212; C<sub>min,ss</sub>)/C<sub>avg</sub>, where C<sub>avg</sub> is the average steady-state drug concentration during multiple dosing, which is calculated as AUC<sub>0&#x02013;&#x003c4;,ss</sub>/&#x003c4;, where &#x003c4; is the dosing interval (6 hours). t<sub>1/2</sub>, CL/F, and V<sub>ss</sub>/F (volume of distribution at the steady state) were calculated using the same method as for single-dose period. In addition, the amount of drug excreted into the urine from time zero to time 24 hours (Ae<sub>0&#x02013;24</sub>) and renal clearance were determined for each single-dose pharmacokinetic group from the urine drug concentration&#x02013;time data.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters were expressed using arithmetic means and standard deviations, except for T<sub>max</sub>, for which median values and ranges are reported.

To test dose proportionality in the single-dose range studied, log-transformed pharmacokinetic parameters AUC and C<sub>max</sub> were analyzed by using the power model, PK = A &#x000d7;(Dose)<sup>&#x003b2;</sup>, where PK is the pharmacokinetic parameter, A is the intercept, and &#x003b2; is the dose-proportionality coefficient. A 90% confidence interval (CI) for the dose-proportionality parameter &#x003b2; was then calculated. Note that a slope of 1 would correspond to perfect dose proportionality. A <italic>t</italic>-test was used to determine whether the multiple-dose pharmacokinetic parameters were consistent with those in the single-dose phase. The results for T<sub>max</sub> were evaluated using the Wilcoxon rank-sum analysis.

In our study, common AEs, such as fever, diarrhea, nausea, hypersensitivity symptoms, and increased ALT, AST, or &#x003b3;-glutamyl transferase levels, associated with the treatment of dicloxacillin in patients with infections, were not found. Clinical significant shifts from a normal to below normal range were noted for white blood cell count and for neutrophil count in 6.25% (1/16) subjects. The reason for fewer AEs in our study lies in the small number of enrolled subjects; further evaluation in larger Chinese population will provide a more exact safety profile of dicloxacillin.</p><p>In single-dose study, our results demonstrated that dicloxacillin was rapidly absorbed after dosing, with median T<sub>max</sub> being attained within 0.75&#x02013;1.25 hours, and the exposure of dicloxacillin increased in a dose-dependent manner. The reported pharmacokinetic parameters in a Mexican population after oral administration with 0.5 g of dicloxacillin<xref rid="b17-dddt-9-5687" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> showed a similar T<sub>max</sub> (0.75&#x02013;1.0 hours) as our study. In our study, interindividual variability in C<sub>max</sub> values was considerable, with the coefficient of variation (CV) ranging from 28.3% to 44.2% for each treatment group. In the 0.25 g group, the CV of C<sub>max</sub> was lower than that in the other treatment groups (28.3% in the 0.25 g group, 44.2% in the 0.5 g group, 41.5% in the 1.0 g group, and 43.1% in the 2.0 g group). Of the 16 subjects (No 8) in the 2.0 g group, one showed higher clearance (16.89 L&#x000b7;h<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) than average (10.4 L&#x000b7;h<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>), so C<sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>0&#x02013;&#x0221e;</sub> of the subject were lower (21.99 &#x000b5;g&#x000b7;mL<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and 111.10 &#x000b5;g&#x000b7;h&#x000b7;mL<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, respectively) than average C<sub>max</sub> (79.97 &#x000b5;g&#x000b7;mL<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) and AUC<sub>0&#x02013;&#x0221e;</sub> (207.40 &#x000b5;g&#x000b7;h&#x000b7;mL<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>). Furthermore, the mean plasma C<sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>0&#x02013;&#x0221e;</sub> were approximately four times and five times higher in healthy Chinese subjects, respectively, compared with the corresponding PK parameters observed in a healthy Western population.<xref rid="b17-dddt-9-5687" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> There are several reasons for this difference. First, as dicloxacillin previously was reported to be a P-glycoprotein substrate,<xref rid="b24-dddt-9-5687" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> the duodenal expression and activity of P-glycoprotein could have been one of the reasons for the large interindividual variability in systemic exposure of dicloxacillin. Second, the lower body weight may result in greater dicloxacillin exposure compared with healthy Western population. Third, dosing in the fast or fed state may affect the extent of absorption. In addition, the difference in the bioavailability of the various dicloxacillin formulations is also an important reason for the difference. A longer t<sub>1/2</sub> was obtained in the present study (0.92&#x02013;2.21 hours) than that obtained in Mexican subjects (0.7&#x02013;0.92 hours). These differences were unclear, but may be associated with differences in sample processing, analytical methods, age, and possible racial differences.</p><p>In the multiple-dose study, the median T<sub>max,ss</sub> of dicloxacillin on day 3 was 0.33&#x02013;3.0 hours. The average half-life on day 3 was 0.97&#x02013;2.35 hours. These parameters were similar to single-dose study. No appreciable accumulation occurred when study drug was administered at total daily doses of up to 8 g in the q6h regimen. This observation was consistent with the relatively short half-life.</p><p>This pharmacokinetic study had some limitations that should be considered. First, these results were obtained from healthy subjects, so the pharmacokinetics of dicloxacillin cannot be extrapolated to an older population or to patients with a disease. Second, despite the fact that a modest number of subjects per treatment group are usually acceptable for Phase I trial, the sample size of the present study was relatively small. Furthermore, the study was only conducted in the fasted state, the absorption rate at the fed state of dicloxacillin was unknown. Therefore, future studies are needed to investigate tolerability, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics including the effect of food in Chinese patients.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors deeply appreciated the contributions of the study team during the conduct of this study.
