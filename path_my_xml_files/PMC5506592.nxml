The Camino Verde cluster-randomised controlled trial in Mexico and Nicaragua assessed the impact of evidence-based community engagement in dengue prevention. The Mexican arm of the trial was conducted in 90 randomly selected communities in three coastal regions of Guerrero State. This study reports an analysis of a secondary outcome of the trial: household use of and expenditure on anti-mosquito products. We examined whether the education and mobilisation activities of the trial motivated people to spend less on anti-mosquito products.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">We carried out a household questionnaire survey in the trial communities in 2010 (12,312 households) and 2012 (5349 households in intervention clusters, 5142 households in control clusters), including questions about socio-economic status, self-reported dengue illness, and purchase of and expenditure on insecticide anti-mosquito products in the previous month. We examined expenditures on anti-mosquito products at baseline in relation to social vulnerability and we compared use of and expenditures on these products between intervention and control clusters in 2012.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">In 2010, 44.2% of 12,312 households reported using anti-mosquito products, with a mean expenditure of USD4.61 per month among those who used them. Socially vulnerable households spent less on the products. In 2012, after the intervention, the proportion of households who purchased anti-mosquito products in the last month was significantly lower in intervention clusters (47.8%; 2503/5293) than in control clusters (53.3%; 2707/5079) (difference&#x000a0;&#x02212;&#x000a0;0.05, 95% CIca &#x02212;0.100 to &#x02212;0.010). The mean expenditure on the products, among those households who bought them, was USD6.43; 30.4% in the intervention clusters and 36.7% in the control clusters spent more than this (difference&#x000a0;&#x02212;&#x000a0;0.06, 95% CIca &#x02212;0.12 to &#x02212;0.01).

Prevenci&#x000f3;n y Control de Dengue 2013&#x02013;2018</italic>) confirmed a protocol to identify dengue fever patients as potential carriers of the disease, and to register them in the National Epidemiological Surveillance System (<italic>Sistema Nacional de Vigilancia Epidemiol&#x000f3;gica</italic>) to locate cases in time and space. The programme includes guidelines for prevention and control measures to be carried out during visits by health workers to patients&#x02019; homes and neighboring households, during which a larvicide, temephos, is placed in water containers, and the area surrounding each home is fumigated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par12">Studies in Latin America have estimated the direct and indirect costs of in- and out-patient dengue cases, workdays lost due to the disease, and disability- or quality-adjusted life years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].

However, we have not found any published report of a randomised controlled trial of dengue prevention that examined the impact of the trial intervention on household expenditures on prevention. The study reported here describes household expenditures on personal protection measures for dengue prevention and examines the impact on these expenditures as a secondary outcome of the Mexican arm of the Camino Verde trial of community-based activities for dengue prevention, undertaken in Mexico and Nicaragua [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Our analysis examines whether Camino Verde&#x02019;s education and mobilisation activities helped to motivate people to control mosquito breeding in their homes and neighbourhoods by non-chemical means and to spend less on personal protection measures.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par13">The methods of the Camino Verde trial are described in detail elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. This study is based on findings from the Mexican arm of the trial. The study included a random sample of 90 communities from the most recent census in the three coastal regions in the state of Guerrero, Mexico. After the 2010 baseline household survey, we stratified clusters according to evidence of recent dengue virus infection in children aged 3&#x02013;9&#x000a0;years and vector indices, and allocated half to receive the intervention. The intervention encouraged community mobilisation using results from the baseline survey. Each intervention cluster adapted the basic intervention - chemical-free prevention of mosquito reproduction - to its own circumstances. However, the government-run dengue control programme, including temephos application to household water containers and fumigation, continued in all clusters. The impact survey of the trial took place in 2012. Both the baseline and the impact survey included a household questionnaire, an entomological survey of larvae and pupae of <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> in water containers, and paired saliva samples in children aged 3&#x02013;9&#x000a0;years to look for evidence of recent dengue infection (doubling of specific IgG levels). The primary trial outcomes included self-reported dengue cases in the past year, serological evidence of recent dengue virus infection, and conventional entomological indices of <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> infestation. A secondary outcome measure in the trial was household expenditure on personal protection measures for dengue prevention.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Estimation of personal protection expenditures</title><p id="Par14">The household questionnaire in the baseline and impact surveys included questions about use of anti-mosquito products such as insecticide sprays or spirals, the frequency of their use, and the amount spent on these products during the month before the survey.</p><p id="Par15">We estimated the average monthly expenditure per household on insecticides, among households that reported any expenditure on these products during the last month. We also estimated the mean expenditure in the last month across all households, including those who spent nothing. In the surveys the amounts spent were reported in Mexican pesos (MXN). During the years 2010 to 2012 the US dollar (USD) exchange rate for the Mexican dollar fluctuated around MXN13.00 to USD1.00 so we have used that rate for convenience here [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par16">Using the data from the baseline survey, we compared the average monthly expenditure on anti-mosquito insecticides between groups of households according to characteristics potentially related to the use of these products: being covered by the healthcare services&#x02019; temephos (Abate&#x000ae;) distribution programme; reporting at least one case of dengue illness in the previous year; and having evidence of recent dengue infection among children aged 3&#x02013;9&#x000a0;years. We also examined expenditure on insecticides according to six household social vulnerability characteristics: socioeconomic region; area of residence; ethnicity; household type; education level of the household head; and employment status of the household head. We considered households to be more vulnerable if they were: located in the Costa Chica region; located in rural areas; inhabited by indigenous people; buildings with impermanent construction; headed by someone with a third-grade education or lower; or headed by someone unemployed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Extrapolation of expenditure figures</title><p id="Par17">We extrapolated from expenditures reported by households in the sample in the baseline survey to estimate expenditure on insecticide anti-mosquito products by the whole population of Guerrero State&#x02019;s three coastal regions. We estimated the number of inhabited households per region by dividing the population of the region, from the census by the state average of 4.2 people per household [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. We applied the proportion of households who reported spending on insecticides in the baseline sample to the estimated number of households in the regions, then calculated the mean total expenditure per region by multiplying by the reported monthly expenditure in the sample households who reported expenditure. To estimate annual expenditure in each region we multiplied the monthly figure by 12. The baseline survey was carried out between January and June 2010, and the reported monthly expenditure in these months would be expected to be relatively low as it is not the main season for mosquitoes. For a more conservative estimate, we multiplied the monthly expenditure by 6, on the assumption that there may be little or no expenditure for six months of the year.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Analysis</title><p id="Par18">Trained operators entered data, using EpiData software, with double data entry and validation to minimise keystroke errors.

We calculated the mean and standard deviation (SD) for reported monthly household expenditure on insecticides and tested the significance of differences in expenditures between sub-groups using an unpaired t-test or the Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric test for sample difference when variances were different between the groups. We tested the significance of the associations between household reported insecticide use (yes or no) and self-reported dengue cases and serologically-defined dengue infection, using the Mantel-Haenszel procedure and reporting the Odds Ratio (OR) and cluster-adjusted 95% confidence intervals (95% CIca) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p id="Par19">From the impact survey, we tested the significance of differences between intervention and control clusters in proportions of households reporting expenditure on insecticides, and in proportions of spending households, and of all households, spending more than the mean amount on these products in the last month, using a cluster t-test.

The impact survey included 10,491 households, 5349 in 45 intervention sites and 5142 in 45 control sites. The reduced number of households in the impact survey was related to the deteriorating security situation in Guerrero State; some people had moved out of the country or to other, more secure, communities.

A quarter (24%; 1293/5407) of households reported using anti-mosquito products daily, 20% (1074/5407) used them two or three times a week, 19% (1019/5407) used them once a week, and 37% (2021/5407) used them every two or more weeks.

</p><p id="Par31">In the baseline survey, we found an association between a self-reported case of dengue illness in the household and a greater likelihood of the household purchasing insecticide anti-mosquito products. We have to be cautious in interpreting this finding from a cross-sectional enquiry. It could be that the response of the health services to a case of dengue, which includes placing temephos into water containers in the index household and surrounding households, as well as fumigation of the area, encourages the residents to use more anti-mosquito products.</p><p id="Par32">Our finding of more expenditure on insecticides with more education of the household head (see Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) runs contrary to the idea that more educated households would be more aware of the health dangers of insecticides so would use them less. However, there is little concern about toxicity of insecticide products in Mexico [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and the higher expenditure on such products when the household head is educated probably reflects the better economic status of such households. Other authors have also reported more expenditure on insecticide products when the household head is more educated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. A small study in Sri Lanka found no association between level of education and awareness about mosquito-borne diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. As described in the main report of the Camino Verde trial, there was a small but significant increase in knowledge of the dengue vector related to the intervention; but the impact survey questionnaire did not ask about knowledge of health effects of insecticides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par33">A key aim of our study was to estimate the impact of the Camino Verde trial on a stated secondary outcome of the trial: use of and expenditure on insecticide anti-mosquito products. Our findings indicate that after the trial intervention, fewer households in the intervention clusters purchased insecticide anti-mosquito products, and those who did buy them spent less on them than did households in the control clusters. Discouraging the use of insecticide sprays or spirals as protection against mosquitoes and the illnesses they are associated with, such as dengue, was not an explicit activity in the intervention design. However, community educators, called <italic>brigadistas</italic>, encouraged reflection and dialogue about various options for controlling mosquitoes, and the emphasis in the educational messages, which involved showing householders where mosquito larvae and pupae were lurking on their own premises and explaining to them how the mosquito development cycle could be interrupted, was on non-chemical solutions. The cost implications of the brigadistas&#x02019; interventions and discussions with householders are considered in another article about the Camino Verde trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p id="Par34">Our finding that vulnerable households spent less on insecticides for personal protection against mosquitoes (see Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) could suggest that these personal protection measures might be too expensive for the poorest section of the population. Non-chemical control methods are accessible to all households, and are an effective means of prevention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par35">The evidence from this study supports the hypothesis that the participatory intervention of Camino Verde, based on bringing the community voice to action for dengue prevention, can lead to a more sustainable physical and biological control of the <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> vector, with a lower number of houses purchasing anti-mosquito products and less expenditure on these products. Added benefits of reduced reliance on insecticides for mosquito control are a reduction in their potential to harm human health and the environment. The household resources saved can be available to meet other household needs.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>95% CI</term><def><p id="Par6">95% confidence interval</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>95% CIca</term><def><p id="Par7">95% confidence interval cluster adjusted</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MXN</term><def><p id="Par8">Mexican Peso</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>USD</term><def><p id="Par9">US dollar</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><p>Francisco Laucirica translated the original Spanish draft into English.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par36">This research and this publication were supported by The UBS Optimus Foundation.
