It was hypothesised that providing access to a psychologically enhanced website would result in greater reductions in drinking and related problems than giving access to a typical alcohol website simply providing information on potential harms of alcohol. DYD-RCT Trial registration: ISRCTN 31070347.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>A two-arm randomised controlled trial was conducted entirely on-line through the Down Your Drink (DYD) website. A total of 7935 individuals who screened positive for hazardous alcohol consumption were recruited and randomized. At entry to the trial, the geometric mean reported past week alcohol consumption was 46.0 (SD 31.2) units. Consumption levels reduced substantially in both groups at the principal 3 month assessment point to an average of 26.0 (SD 22.3) units. Similar changes were reported at 1 month and 12 months. There were no significant differences between the groups for either alcohol consumption at 3 months (intervention: control ratio of geometric means 1.03, 95&#x00025; CI 0.97 to 1.10) or for this outcome and the main secondary outcomes at any of the assessments. The results were not materially changed following imputation of missing values, nor was there any evidence that the impact of the intervention varied with baseline measures or level of exposure to the intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>Findings did not provide support for the hypothesis that access to a psychologically enhanced website confers additional benefit over standard practice and indicate the need for further research to optimise the effectiveness of Internet-based behavioural interventions. The trial demonstrates a widespread and potentially sustainable demand for Internet based interventions for people with hazardous alcohol consumption, which could be delivered internationally.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>Controlled-Trials.com <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.controlled-trials.com/isrctn/pf/31070347">ISRCTN31070347</ext-link>

The European Union (EU) is the heaviest drinking region of the world, drinking an average of 11 litres of pure alcohol per adult each year <xref rid="pone.0014740-Anderson1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. In the UK, deaths from cirrhosis are rising, and in some age groups the increase has been nearly 10 fold over one generation of 30 years <xref rid="pone.0014740-Chief1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Despite the strong evidence supporting use of brief and less intensive interventions in people with alcohol use disorders, only a small minority actually receive help. Data from the Alcohol Needs Assessment Research Project indicates that in the UK fewer than 1 in 18 people with an alcohol misuse disorder access appropriate treatment, due to a combination of missed screening opportunities, limited availability of appropriate alcohol services, stigma associated with access and the wish to resolve problems alone <xref rid="pone.0014740-Drummond1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Psychologically enhanced interventions delivered via the Internet could address all of these factors at minimal incremental cost, with potentially major public health implications.</p><p>Population access to the Internet is increasing rapidly, and in 2009 penetration was estimated to be 77&#x00025; in the UK, 64&#x00025; in the EU as a whole, and 74&#x00025; in the US <xref rid="pone.0014740-Internet1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Psychologically enhanced web-based interventions make use of digital technologies to deliver a range of tailored behavioural techniques via the Internet, and have been shown to be associated with improved knowledge, self-efficacy, perceived social support, health behaviours and clinical outcomes <xref rid="pone.0014740-Murray1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. There is growing evidence about the use of the Internet to deliver smoking cessation interventions, where automated, self-help interventions tested in on-line randomized controlled trials have recruited large numbers of participants and yielded differences in abstinence rates ranging from 8&#x00025; to 20&#x00025; <xref rid="pone.0014740-Shahab1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Despite evidence that large numbers of people with risky drinking behaviours access Internet based interactive interventions <xref rid="pone.0014740-Linke1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, research in this area has been limited, with most studies employing brief normative feedback to college student samples recruited off-line <xref rid="pone.0014740-Bewick1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0014740-Khadjesari1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Additionally small trials of on-line interventions in adult populations have recruited through advertisements in newspapers, health related web-sites and telephone population surveys <xref rid="pone.0014740-Riper1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0014740-Cunningham2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.</p><p>On-line trials can have major advantages over traditional face-to-face studies. Once the development costs have been met, they have minimal incremental running costs thus offering the ability to recruit very large numbers of participants. Different components of Internet technology allow rapid assessment, recruitment and randomisation, instantaneous collection of standardised and secure data, and delivery of on-line interventions in a controlled and uniform manner. Adoption of Internet based trial methods is increasing despite associated problems of high rates of attrition <xref rid="pone.0014740-Paul1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0014740-Eysenbach1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Studies have indicated that on-line trials are most suitable when the intervention is safe, the medical disorder can be confirmed by remote means and outcome measures assessed using electronically transmissible technologies <xref rid="pone.0014740-McAlindon1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. This paper reports the results of a large scale pragmatic on-line trial which satisfied all of these criteria.</p><p>The aim of the trial was to compare the relative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of an on-line, psychologically enhanced, interactive computer-based intervention (DownYourDrink, DYD) in reducing alcohol consumption with a flat, text-based information website in hazardous and harmful drinkers.

It was conducted in three phases: pilot, main trial and main trial extension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0014740-g001">Figure 1</xref>). There were only minor differences in design between each phase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0014740.s003">Box S1</xref>), and as these were deemed unlikely to affect outcomes materially, analysis was undertaken on data pooled from all three phases.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Ethics and data protection</title><p>This study was conducted according to the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki. Ethics approval for the study was granted by the University College London Research Ethics Committee, and all data were kept in accordance with provision of the UK Data Protection Act 1998. All patients provided written informed consent for the collection of data and subsequent analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Trial registration number</title><p>SRCTN 31070347</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Intervention and comparator websites</title><p>For the duration of the trial, both the intervention and the comparator websites were located at a single website address: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.downyourdrink.org.uk">www.downyourdrink.org.uk</ext-link>. The intervention website, hereafter known as DownYourDrink, or DYD, was a theoretically informed programme, based on brief intervention and psychological treatment principles. It offered three phases, each of which was divided into levels with different materials and associated exercises and tasks. If followed in order they provided a natural progression through three stages: decision making (Phase 1, <italic>&#x0201c;It's up to you&#x0201d;</italic>); implementing change (Phase 2, <italic>&#x0201c;Making the change&#x0201d;</italic>); and relapse prevention (Phase 3, <italic>&#x0201c;Keeping on track&#x0201d;</italic>). However, users were free to design their own route through the programme, and could use it as often or as seldom as they wished. Phase 1 was based on the principles of motivational enhancement therapy, phase 2 used computerised cognitive behavioural therapy and behavioural self control principles, and phase 3 was based on principles of relapse prevention. There were a number of interactive &#x0201c;e-tools&#x0201d; including a &#x0201c;thinking drinking diary&#x0201d; in which users could record their alcohol consumption along with emotional and behavioural triggers and responses. Further details about the development and content of the intervention are available elsewhere <xref rid="pone.0014740-Linke2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.</p><p>The comparator website used a similar graphical design and style to present simple, text-based information about the harms caused by excess alcohol consumption. It did not contain any interactive components, and users did not have access to the e-tools. For the duration of the trial, this comparator website was also referred to as DownYourDrink so that participants were not aware whether they had access to the intervention or comparator site.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Recruitment</title><p>Participants were people who came across DownYourDrink while browsing the web. An earlier, simplified form of DYD had initially been launched in 2000 <xref rid="pone.0014740-Linke3" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> and by the start of the trial had accrued a large number of users <xref rid="pone.0014740-Linke1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Most new users came to DYD from a web-search engine, such as Google or Yahoo, or from the home page of Alcohol Concern, the UK's largest alcohol charity. When users reached the home page they were invited to take a screening test (the three item Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test or AUDIT-C <xref rid="pone.0014740-Bush1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>). Users who scored 5 or more on the AUDIT-C were informed they were potentially at risk from their alcohol consumption, and invited to join the trial. They were informed that the trial was comparing different areas of the DownYourDrink website to see which was the most effective, and that for the duration of the trial, access to DYD was only available to trial participants. Eligible participants who consented to participate were asked to register, which included providing a user name, password and valid e-mail address. This e-mail address was used to send an automated link which gave participants access to the intervention or comparator site according to their randomised allocation. The AUDIT-C scores from users who did not consent to participation in the trial were discarded automatically for ethical reasons.</p><p>Eligibility criteria were deliberately kept broad. Eligible participants were adults (aged 18 or over), scoring 5 or more on the AUDIT-C, who provided informed consent. Participants were required to have internet access. Participants who declared themselves unable to understand written English, or unwilling to complete follow-up questionnaires were excluded. People who were excluded from the trial, or who chose not to participate, were directed toward other on-line alcohol websites.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Randomisation</title><p>Randomisation occurred in two stages. The first randomisation occurred after completion of consent and core baseline data. At this point, participants were stratified by age and gender and randomised to one of four secondary outcome measures (see below). Once all baseline measures were completed, participants were randomised to either the intervention or the comparator website. This second randomisation marked the trial entry point. Both randomisation procedures were automated, using centrally-allocated computer-generated random numbers. Thus there was no possibility of any of the trial team influencing the allocation of participants and concealment of allocation was complete.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Outcome measures</title><p>Reactivity to assessment, or the effect of measurement itself on alcohol consumption is a well-documented phenomenon in alcohol research <xref rid="pone.0014740-Kypri1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0014740-McCambridge1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. For this reason, the total burden of assessment was kept to the minimum. All participants completed the primary outcome measure which was the TOT-AL <xref rid="pone.0014740-Khadjesari2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. The TOT-AL is a validated on-line measure which provided a drop-down menu for the selection of type, brand and size of beverage, and calculated the cumulative unit content of the drinks consumed over the previous 7 days (1 unit is equivalent to approximately 8 g ethanol). All participants also completed the 5 item quality of life measure, the EQ-5D <xref rid="pone.0014740-Rabin1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> for the purposes of health economic analysis. We designed two single item measures to determine self-efficacy (confidence in one's ability to change behaviour) and intention, both important predictors of behaviour and intermediate variables along the pathway of change <xref rid="pone.0014740-Armitage1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. In addition, participants were asked to provide some basic demographic data at baseline (age, highest level of education attained, marital status, children, ethnicity and country of residence).</p><p>Participants were randomly allocated to one of four secondary outcome measures, each of which addressed different domains of alcohol-related harm: the Alcohol Use Disorders Test (AUDIT) <xref rid="pone.0014740-Saunders1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, the Leeds Dependence Questionnaire (LDQ) <xref rid="pone.0014740-Raistrick1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, the Alcohol Problem Questionnaire (APQ) <xref rid="pone.0014740-Williams1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, and the ten item Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation (CORE) (a measure of mental health) <xref rid="pone.0014740-Evans1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Data collection</title><p>All data were collected on-line. At follow-up participants were sent an automated e-mail with an embedded hyperlink to the assessment questionnaires. Data collected at follow-up consisted of the primary outcome measure, the EQ-5D, single item measures of self-efficacy and intention, and the same secondary outcome measure completed at baseline. Up to three reminders were sent at 7 day intervals to non-responders, with the final reminder containing a request for participants to tell us their past week alcohol consumption only.</p><p>The duration of follow-up varied in the three phases of the trial. During Phase 1 (pilot), follow up was at 1 and 3 months; in the main trial follow-up was at 3 and 12 months, and in the main trial extension, follow-up was at 3 months only (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0014740.s003">Box S1</xref>). The main reasons for extending the main trial were ethical concerns. The steady recruitment, combined with unsolicited free text emails from participants, suggested that DYD was meeting a need not met by alternative services. For this reason, we were reluctant to follow our original plan which had been to make DYD unavailable to new users once our target sample size had been achieved. Equally, we could not make the intervention freely available to new users for fear of contaminating the existing trial. Hence we decided to extend recruitment to the trial, but alter the consent and follow-up procedures so that follow-up was only requested at three months. After the end of Phase 3 (main trial extension), we made the control site freely available to new users for three months, and after all data collection had been completed, made the intervention site freely available to all users.</p></sec><sec id="s2i"><title>Statistical methods</title><sec id="s2i1"><title>Sample size calculation</title><p>A 20&#x00025; reduction in past week alcohol consumption, irrespective of initial level, is typical of non-internet brief interventions <xref rid="pone.0014740-Whitlock1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. In an earlier cohort study of DYD the observed mean reduction in alcohol consumption was 35&#x00025; in men and 17&#x00025; in women <xref rid="pone.0014740-Linke1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. In this study the standard deviation of weekly alcohol consumption was slightly less than the mean in both men and women at both baseline and follow-up. Making a conservative assumption that the standard deviation would be equal to mean, led to the calculation that 430 participants providing follow-up data at the principal end-point in each arm would be required to give 90&#x00025; power at the 5&#x00025; significance level to detect a 20&#x00025; difference in the past week's reported alcohol consumption between intervention and control groups <xref rid="pone.0014740-Murray2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2i2"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Statistical analysis was carried out according to a pre-specified plan, comparing groups as randomised at each follow-up point. TOT-AL data were skewed and were therefore log-transformed (after adding 1 unit/week) before analysis. Means of the log-transformed data were transformed back to the original scale and are described as geometric means <xref rid="pone.0014740-Bland1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. For those unused to geometric means, the value of the geometric mean is very similar to the value of the median. To enable comparison of our data with other alcohol intervention trials we also report the arithmetic mean in the text, as this measure has often been used in reporting trial data despite the presence of skew in the data <xref rid="pone.0014740-Khadjesari1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Adjusted analyses were performed using linear regression models of outcome on randomised group, adjusting for baseline values of the respective outcome measure, AUDIT-C, age, education, self-efficacy, log (TOT-AL&#x0002b;1), EQ5D and gender. Missing data were handled in three stages. First, primary analyses used all available results but without imputation of missing data. Second, alternative analyses used last observation carried forward (LOCF) and multiple imputation of missing outcomes from other outcomes and website use data. Third, sensitivity analyses for missing data assumed plausible arm-specific differences between responders and non-responders <xref rid="pone.0014740-White1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Because the above analyses estimated only the effect of allocation to the intervention website, we additionally undertook a complier-average causal effect analysis to estimate the effect of compliance with the intervention <xref rid="pone.0014740-Dunn1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. This was initially performed defining compliance as more than 1 session or access to more than 10 pages within the first 3 months from randomisation, and subsequently assuming benefit&#x000a0;to be proportional to number of page downloads and estimating the benefit of downloading 100 pages using instrumental variable methods <xref rid="pone.0014740-FischerLapp1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Both these analyses used multiple imputation to handle missing outcome data.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2j"><title>Health economics</title><p>Costs of the intervention included resources required in the original development of the DYD internet site and revisions undertaken for the trial by a development group comprising academics, clinicians and lay members and programmed by web consultants. Development of the control website was assumed to take a minimal proportion (5&#x00025;) of overall costs. Care was taken to separate development of the intervention from research costs. Invoices for programming costs were separated into research, intervention and control costs, with 20&#x00025; of the development group's time assumed to be concerned with research issues. All figures are at 2008 price levels. The primary outcome for economic evaluation was quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) based on EQ-5D questionnaire responses valued by the UK Social Tariff valuations <xref rid="pone.0014740-Kind1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Recruitment and follow-up</title><p>The recruitment period was from February 2007 until May 2009 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0014740-g001">Figure 1</xref>).

There were no differences in levels or patterns of alcohol consumption or secondary outcome measures between participants allocated to the intervention or control groups, at either the primary or secondary follow-up points. Participants in the intervention group made more use of the intervention than those in the control group, but we have no data on the relative satisfaction of the users in the two groups.</p><p>Both groups showed evidence at all follow-up points of striking improvements from baseline values in levels and patterns of alcohol consumption and in all secondary outcome measures. There are various potential explanations for these findings. Although there is clearly no difference between the effectiveness of the two interventions, it is not clear whether both interventions were effective or both were ineffective. The improvements demonstrated by trial participants could be partly due to regression to the mean (where people are motivated to join a trial at the time that their problem is most severe and through the natural history of a waxing and waning condition show an improvement over time) or to the effects of the trial assessment procedures. The therapeutic effect of assessment on alcohol consumption in trials has been well documented <xref rid="pone.0014740-Kypri1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> and even minimal assessment, such as completing the 10 item AUDIT has been shown to have an effect size of 0.23 (95&#x00025; CI 0.01&#x02013;0.45) at 2&#x02013;3 months follow-up <xref rid="pone.0014740-McCambridge1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Although we went to considerable lengths to reduce the burden of assessment it is still probable that completion of the primary outcome measure along with other aspects of study participation contributed to the observed reduction in alcohol consumption. The findings could also have been due in part to non-response bias, though this is not supported by the results of statistical analyses undertaken to deal with this anticipated aspect of the on-line trial performance. There was a marked differential in response rates between the intervention and control groups at 1 and 3 months, which had reduced but not vanished by 12 months. This differential response, with participants in the control group being more likely to respond than those in the intervention group has been seen in previous alcohol trials <xref rid="pone.0014740-Kaner1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Our data cannot illuminate the reason for this differential, but it is possible that participants in the control group particularly welcomed the opportunity to undergo assessment, recognising this as an opportunity to reflect on their drinking behaviours.</p><p>The annual maintenance costs of DYD intervention were estimated at &#x000a3;12,065. Even modest recruitment rates of 50 new entrants per week evidenced in the latter stages of the trial would yield a cost of only &#x000a3;4.64 per person. A mean improvement in health in terms of QALYs of only 0.01 over a 12 month period would make the intervention highly cost-effective (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of &#x000a3;464 per QALY). As reduced drinking is also associated with a reduction in public sector spending and improved health, such interventions taken up by those not currently accessing services could well be cost neutral and potentially significantly cost saving.</p><p>To our knowledge this is the largest pragmatic trial of an alcohol Internet intervention undertaken in the general population. It succeeded in attracting website visitors with hazardous alcohol consumption, recruiting numbers which substantially exceeded initial expectations. The study employed an innovative on-line methodology well suited to the nature of the Internet based intervention and control websites. This presented significant methodological challenges in relation both to the exclusive use of on-line assessment and to compliance with the intervention and follow-up. An extensive evidence base indicates that self reporting of alcohol consumption is at least as reliable as face to face, though uncertainty remains about the performance of these measures in on line trials <xref rid="pone.0014740-DelBoca1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0014740-Whitford1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Many on-line trials have experienced high rates of attrition from follow-up <xref rid="pone.0014740-Bull1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref> so we tested several methods to optimise response and employed a range of relevant statistical methods both to impute missing values and to estimate the effects of different levels of compliance with the intervention. Nonetheless, uncertainties remain, including the possibility of bias, as a result of the high rates of attrition from follow-up, and these need to be fully recognised in interpreting the findings.</p><p>Our results differ from previous trials of online alcohol interventions and this may reflect differences in study populations, trial procedures and comparator interventions <xref rid="pone.0014740-Riper1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0014740-Cunningham2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. The trial population in the present highly naturalistic study were web-browsers, whereas other studies used at least some off-line recruitment procedures, either for obtaining consent <xref rid="pone.0014740-Riper1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, or for initial identification of potential participants <xref rid="pone.0014740-Cunningham1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0014740-Cunningham2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. This is likely to have implications for the study population. In this trial we used a non-interactive website which provided information about the harms of excessive alcohol consumption and advice on how to cut down. This contrasts with the Riper trial, where a pdf version of a psycho-educational brochure was used as a comparator <xref rid="pone.0014740-Riper1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Our decision was made partly on ethical grounds so that all participants would receive something at least as good as widely available self-help sites, and partly on research grounds to ensure trial participants were not made aware of which arm they had been randomised to.</p><p>The trial has indicated a potentially widespread and sustainable demand for Internet based interventions for people with hazardous alcohol consumption. Our findings do not provide any support for the hypothesis that psychologically enhanced interactivity confers additional benefit. However, the substantial improvement in quantity and patterns of alcohol consumption reported by participants in both arms of the trial suggests potential benefit from access to either website type, providing support for continued development and implementation of Internet applications of this kind.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting
