The principal aim of treatment of a venous thromboembolism with heparin and warfarin is to prevent extension or recurrence of clot. However, the recurrence rate following a deep vein thrombosis remains approximately 10% per annum following treatment cessation irrespective of the duration of anticoagulation therapy. Patients with raised D-dimer levels after discontinuing oral anticoagulation treatment have also been shown to be at high risk of recurrence.</p><p>Post thrombotic syndrome is a complication of a deep vein thrombosis which can lead to chronic venous insufficiency and ulceration.

VTE is considered as a chronic disease with pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) being different manifestations of the same disease process.</p><p>Currently, patients with a first episode of unprovoked proximal DVT or PE, with no apparent other risk factors for recurrent VTE, are given a course of oral anticoagulation (warfarin in the UK) treatment which is then discontinued. The optimum duration of warfarin therapy depends on the individual patient and has not been defined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Concern in terms of duration of treatment is due to the risk of bleeding from prolonged warfarin treatment. Several studies have investigated the optimal duration of anticoagulant therapy with the British Committee for Standards in Haematology (BCSH, 1998) recommending between six weeks and six months, depending upon the aetiology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>A substantial proportion of patients &#x02013; up to 17% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] go on to have a recurrent episode of VTE which can be a potentially life-threatening condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. If recurrence occurs, the patient is normally managed thereafter with long-term warfarin, provided there are no contraindications. Although optimal duration of anticoagulation treatment for patients with a first idiopathic VTE remains uncertain, randomised trials have suggested that patients should be treated for a minimum of three months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] but beyond that the duration of anticoagulation has little effect on the rate of recurrence<sup>3</sup>. There is an annual recurrence rate following a first VTE of approximately 10% per annum following treatment cessation, irrespective of the duration of warfarin therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. This suggests that some patients with a first unprovoked VTE should continue warfarin in the long-term however we are currently unable to identify this population. Studies of extended treatment with low dose warfarin have confirmed that maximal benefit is conferred at standard therapeutic targets rather than fixed low dose regimes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>It would be very useful to have an accurate predictor of recurrence of VTE to decide which patients with a first episode of unprovoked proximal DVT or PE would be most likely to benefit from long term oral anticoagulation, and also which patients should only receive short term therapy.</p><p>D-dimer is a fibrin degradation product, present in the blood after a blood clot is degraded by fibrinolysis and levels of D-dimer can be tested using laboratory and point-of-care (POC) testing devices. The primary clinical use of D-dimer testing has been in conjunction with probability scores to determine whether further investigation is required for the diagnosis of VTE. More recently interest has been shown in studies which have investigated whether D-dimer can be utilised as a guide for determining who is at risk of recurrent VTE following treatment of the initial acute episode [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>Previous small studies outside the UK have suggested that D-dimer levels could act as a useful predictor of recurrent thromboembolism in patients whose warfarin is discontinued [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. There are limited data on utility of the D-dimer as a predictor in patients still on therapy, but Rodgers <italic>et al.</italic> have shown that D-dimer can be used to predict recurrence in low risk female patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In addition to D-dimer levels a recent meta-analysis has suggested that age and gender may be effective in predicting recurrent VTE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. This study concluded that men are at greater risk of developing a recurrent VTE after a first unprovoked episode and that age could be used as predictor in women. Therefore D-dimer levels could be a potentially useful clinical tool to decide which patients, with a first episode of unprovoked proximal DVT or PE, would most likely benefit from long-term warfarin therapy.</p><p>The conclusions of 2 systematic reviews of D-dimer testing after stopping treatment for VTE, (7 studies with a total of 1888 patients) were: &#x0201c;additional research is needed to establish the optimal interval between stopping anticoagulation and performing D-dimer testing, to identify the optimum cut-off that predicts recurrence and to develop a clinical prediction rule for recurrent DVT.&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], and &#x0201c;strategies which incorporate a number of high performing baseline and post-baseline predictors could be more effective in predicting recurrent VTE and should be tested. If oral anticoagulation is continued, there is no evidence on the duration of this extended therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].&#x0201d;</p><p>The only UK data included in these reviews were from a prospective cohort study of 272 patients with a first episode of venous thrombosis that was unprovoked or provoked by a non-surgical trigger. They undertook D-dimer testing 1&#x02009;month after cessation of warfarin therapy and found a non-significant difference in recurrence (5.5/100 patients years in D-dimer + ve <italic>vs.</italic> 4.1/100 patient years in D-dimer &#x02013;ve) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>PTS is a frequent and costly complication of DVT which can lead to chronic venous insufficiency and ulceration. PTS has a cumulative incidence after 2&#x02009;years of around 25% and it has been postulated that prolonged treatment with oral anticoagulants could prevent the development of PTS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The only data available from a randomised trial suggested no association between long-term low dose warfarin treatment and development of PTS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The prevalence of PTS in this study was 37% after 2.2&#x02009;years, with severe PTS in 4%. A recent study demonstrated an association between D-dimer level and the development of PTS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], this is something that will be investigated during the course of this study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Aims and objectives</title><p>Considering patients with a first unprovoked proximal DVT and PE who have been treated with 3&#x02013;6&#x02009;months oral anticoagulation, the aims of the study are:</p><p>&#x02022;To investigate the effect of extending treatment with oral anticoagulation in terms of reduction in incidence of VTE and PTS</p><p>&#x02022;To develop an algorithm to predict high/low recurrence rates in these patients</p><p>As part of this we will be investigating the following:</p><p>&#x02022;To establish the performance characteristics of D-dimer testing whilst still on treatment as a prediction tool for recurrence of VTE in patients with first unprovoked proximal DVT or PE.</p><p>&#x02022;To establish factors which contribute to the recurrence of VTE in patients with a first unprovoked proximal DVT or PE.</p><p>&#x02022;To determine the cost-effectiveness of the measurement of D-dimer and subsequent extended treatment with anticoagulation.</p><p>&#x02022;To determine patient preferences and utilities with regard to extended warfarin treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Participants</title><p>Patients will be recruited through a number of primary care and secondary care anticoagulation clinics in the wider Midlands area over a two year period.</p><p>Patients identified as receiving warfarin for a first unprovoked proximal DVT or PE and who are eligible for the trial (Table&#x02009;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) will receive a brief information sheet about the study during their anticoagulant clinic appointment.

Health sector costs will include additional costs of D-dimer testing and prolonged treatment (anticoagulation) costs. Patient level data will be collected on treatment and condition-specific health service utilisation (primary and secondary care), thrombotic episodes, PTS and bleeding events. Information on costs incurred by patients when attending anticoagulation clinics (e.g. time and travel costs) will also be collected with a patient cost questionnaire. Information on resource use will be collected from patient notes. Unit costs will be obtained from standard sources and health care providers.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Sample size</title><p>Initially, patients will be randomly assigned to warfarin (Group W) or no treatment (Group O) arms Following the flow chart for analysis (Figure&#x02009;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) will result in 6 study populations, those with normal D-dimer at point of randomisation who were randomly allocated to the warfarin treatment arm (group NW), those with elevated D-dimer at point of randomisation who were randomly allocated to the treatment arm (group RW), those with normal D-dimer at point of randomisation who were randomly allocated to the no treatment arm and then produced a normal D-dimer off treatment (NNO), those with normal D-dimer at point of randomisation who were randomly allocated to the no treatment arm and then produced an elevated D-dimer off treatment (RNO), those with elevated D-dimer at point of randomisation who were randomly allocated to the no treatment arm and produced a normal D-dimer off treatment (NRO) and those with elevated D-dimer at point of randomisation who were randomly allocated to the no treatment arm and then produced an elevated D-dimer off treatment (RRO). (Thus in the two or three letter code the last letter indicates the arm a patient is randomised to, the previous letter indicates the outcome of the D- dimer test performed on the same visit as randomisation and, in the case of those randomised to no further treatment, the first letter relates to the D-dimer result produced after randomisation). A 10% loss to follow up rate is assumed from the beginning of the trial. The Data Safety Monitoring Board will inform the research team if recruitment is below target as the study progresses and if so further hospitals will be recruited.</p><p>Total sample size will be sufficiently large to show a significant difference in recurrence rates between those showing a positive D-dimer on treatment who receive warfarin (RW) and those showing a positive D-dimer who receive no treatment (RNO plus RRO). Following Palareti [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] this means a sample size for each group of 79 in order to give 90% power to a 5% significance test when comparing 2&#x02009;year recurrence rates of 21.4% and 4.3%. Assuming a 50% positive D-dimer rate this implies a total of 79 &#x000d7; 2 &#x000d7; 2/0.9 = 352 patients taking part in the study (and 316 completing the study). Allowing a 50% participation rate this means that 704 patients need to be approached initially. With such a sample size an overall comparison of recurrence rates between the arms W and O can be made with power of between 86 and 99% assuming recurrence rates of between 1.4% and 4.3% for the warfarin arm (Group W, depending on what recurrence rate patients with normal D-dimer on warfarin produce) and 14.2% for the No treatment arm.</p><p>One of the objectives of the study is to determine an optimal cut off on a D-dimer result taken when the patient is receiving treatment. In a study of 272 patients, Baglin <italic>et al.</italic> report that 170/272 patients had a D-dimer in excess of 500&#x02009;ng&#x02009;mL-1 and their ROC analysis suggests an optimal cut off of 500&#x02009;ng/ml [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The circumstances of their study differ from ours but using their data will give some indication of the precision with which we will be able to estimate an optimal cut off with slightly more patients than Baglin <italic>et al.</italic> With some assumptions, a rough calculation of the precision with which a cut off in the region of 500 could be estimated with our sample size of 316 would be within about 7% (95% confidence interval).</p></sec><sec><title>Randomisation</title><p>Randomisation will be performed within the computerised clinical case report form (CRF) produced in Primary Care Clinical Sciences, University of Birmingham. When a patient is identified as being eligible for the study and has given written consent to take part, the research nurse will enter details into the computerised CRF and will be issued immediately with a dedicated randomisation code allocating the patient to either continuing warfarin therapy or stopping warfarin therapy.</p><p>Patients will be randomly allocated at this point to either continue warfarin (Group W) for a further 2&#x02009;years or to discontinue treatment (Group O). Randomisation will be stratified by DVT and PE to ensure there are equal numbers in both groups W and O.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis and statistical methods</title><p>Intention to treat analysis will be used. The types of analysis proposed are Chi-square, generalized linear models, logistic regression and survival analysis, t-tests, ANOVA and non-parametric equivalents.</p><p>Analysis will be carried out at the end of the study, as there is likely to be insufficient power for interim analyses. Quality control of data collection will be conducted by a trial management committee throughout the study and by a statistician independent of the research team.</p><p>Logistic regression would be used to relate D-dimer result and other patient data to events such as recurrence, bleeding episodes and PTS separately on the two arms (Group W and Group O) of the trial and together. Baglin <italic>et al</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], with their 272 patients, showed a significant association between age and D- dimer (p &#x0003c; 0.001) and our total sample, allowing for loss to follow up, of 316 should be ample to incorporate such a relationship. In comparing D-dimer levels between genders they achieved a significance level of p = 0.18 with 272 individuals. A rough calculation would suggest a p value of 0. 15 for the same level of difference in D-dimer (approximately 80&#x02009;ng/ml) in our total sample of 316 patients.</p><sec><title>Cost effectiveness analysis</title><p>The analysis will determine the cost-effectiveness of the measurement of D-dimer and subsequent extended treatment with anticoagulation. Data collection will be for all trial patients so that a stochastic cost analysis can be undertaken. A cost-consequence analysis will initially be reported, describing all the important results relating to costs and consequences. Subsequently, a cost-effectiveness analysis will be conducted using data on the clinical events of interest (thrombotic and bleeding events). An incremental analysis will be undertaken to calculate the cost per major outcome averted. A cost-utility analysis will also be undertaken using patient responses to the EQ-5D questionnaire, to calculate the cost per additional Quality-Adjusted Life Year (QALY) gained.</p><p>The analysis will be from an NHS perspective, however patient costs will be incorporated in a sensitivity analysis in order to consider cost-effectiveness from a broader perspective. The data for costs is likely to have a skewed distribution therefore the plan is to explore the nature of the distribution of costs. If the data is not normally distributed, the non parametric comparison of means (e.g. bootstrapping) will be undertaken. Efforts will be made to minimise the problem of missing data, but if this does pose a problem at the economic analysis stage then imputation techniques will be used.</p><p>In addition to the trial-based economic evaluation, longer term costs and consequences will be explored by extrapolating beyond the end of the trial. Decision modelling will be undertaken using data from the trial and from non-trial sources, in order to determine the long-term cost-effectiveness of the intervention, with results reported as cost per additional QALY gained.</p><p>The robustness of the results will be explored using sensitivity analysis. This will explore uncertainties in the trial based data itself, the methods employed to analyse the data and the generalisability of the results to other settings. Uncertainty in the confidence to be placed on the results of the economic analysis will be explored by estimating cost effectiveness acceptability curves. These plot the probability that the intervention is cost effective against threshold values for cost effectiveness.</p></sec><sec><title>Data validation</title><p>Data cleaning will take place by a series of logical checks on the electronic data using specific queries.

This strategy would allow those people who require extended anticoagulation treatment to receive it whilst ensuring that those who only require short term treatment are not exposed to unnecessary and potentially dangerous treatment.</p><p>Identifying the potential for utilisation of D-dimer POC testing will make feasible the identification of those high risk patients within a primary care setting negating the necessity for costly and inconvenient referral elsewhere. Thus people with a first unprovoked proximal DVT or PE could be managed differently to current management with the potential for significant improvements in health outcomes and patient well being.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>VTE: Venous thromboembolism; DVT: Deep vein thrombosis; PE: Pulmonary embolism; PTS: Post thrombotic syndrome; NW: Randomised to Group W with normal D-dimer at point of randomisation; RW: Randomised to Group W with elevated D-dimer at point of randomisation; NRO: Randomised to Group O with elevated D-dimer at point of randomisation and then produced a normal D-dimer off treatment; RRO: Randomised to Group O with elevated D-dimer at point of randomisation and then produced an elevated D-dimer off treatment; NNO: Randomised to Group O with a normal D-dimer at point of randomisation and then produced a normal D-dimer off treatment; RNO: Randomised to Group O with normal D-dimer at point of randomisation and then produced an elevated D-dimer off treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>None of the authors have any competing interests arising from this research.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>DF, EM, FDRH, PR, and WL were responsible for identifying the research question.
