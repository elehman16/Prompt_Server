More than 80% people using computers for more than 4 h complain of back pain.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Objective:</title><p>To compare the effectiveness of multidisciplinary treatment approach and conventional treatment approach amongst computer users.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>A prospective interventional study was carried out at a private spine clinic amongst the computer users with the complaint of low back pain. The study participants were randomly distributed in two groups. The first group comprised the study participants treated by conventional approach and the second group was treated by multidisciplinary approach. Primary outcomes analyzed were pain intensity, sick leave availed, and quality of life.

Intensity of pain was reduced significantly in the group treated by multidisciplinary approach (<italic>t</italic> = 5.718; <italic>P</italic> = 0.0001). Similarly only 4 (19.19%) of the study participants of the group treated by multidisciplinary approach availed sick leave due to low back pain, while 14 (63.63%) study participants availed sick leave in the other group (<italic>P</italic> = 0.02).

Eight out of ten people working more than 8 h in front of computers have back pain. Although medical costs for back pain are high, hidden costs like absenteeism and reduced productivity are significant. Early identification of clinical, psychosocial, and professional risk factors is important to prevent the progression to chronic low back pain.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>]</p><p>There is no established protocol or model which a back pain sufferer goes through after having a first episode of back pain. A general physician or an allied health professional is the first point of contact in such cases. After the initial screening, painkillers are often prescribed and only a few times specialist consultation is sought. Conventional treatment which usually includes orthopedic consultation and physical therapy is the preferred choice of treatment when pain and discomfort during work increases at a secondary or tertiary care unit. Many different rehabilitation programs of unclear efficacy are currently in use.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>] Multidisciplinary treatment approaches including biopsychosocial rehabilitation are scarcely practiced treatment methods in India. There is strong evidence that intensive multidisciplinary biopsychosocial rehabilitation with functional restoration improves function in chronic and nonspecific back pain. The flaw in most rehabilitation approaches is that they are unidirectional and involve only the physical aspect of rehabilitation.</p><p>In our study, we compared the multidisciplinary treatment approach with the conventional treatment approach for the low back pain. We found that multidisciplinary treatment approach was better than conventional treatment approach when certain outcomes like intensity of pain, number of sick leave availed due to low back pain, and perceived health status were considered.</p><p>The randomized trial conducted by Moffett <italic>et al</italic>. revealed the superiority of combined exercise and behavioral treatment in primary care management, and they concluded that rather than the intensity of pain, the ability to cope was improved.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>] Nicholas <italic>et al</italic>. reported superior improvement in patients with chronic low back pain after a combined psychological and physiotherapeutic treatment over those treated by exercise and discussion sessions.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>] Turner <italic>et al</italic>. in a randomized trial compared behavioral treatment, exercise, and a combination of both in an outpatient and a group setting for back patients mostly not in sick leave; whilst short-term effects were superior after the combination therapy, all significant differences disappeared after 6 months due to small sample sizes.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>] A systematic review concluded that a high dose, biopsychosocial therapy improves function and pain considerably compared to biomedical therapy; in terms of sick leave, their conclusions were contradictory.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>]</p><p>To conclude, this study supports the evidence that the multidisciplinary treatment approach in low back pain is a better option over the conventional treatment approach. Larger studies, especially randomized controlled trials, are recommended to confirm the evidence in Indian scenario.</p><sec id="sec2-7"><title>Limitation of the study</title><p>The study was
