Effects of personality factors on the therapeutic effect of acupuncture have not been investigated. This study aimed to find the effects of the traits of personality on the objective outcome when different acupuncture techniques were used in treating patients with Bell's palsy.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Methods:</title><p>We performed a secondary analysis of a prospective multicenter randomized controlled trial of acupuncture for Bell's palsy. Patients were randomly assigned to the de qi and control groups, respectively. The primary outcome was facial nerve function at month 6.

The results have proved that acupuncture may also have clinically significant effects on objective functional outcome.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] According to RCTs with subjective outcomes, compared with waiting list controls or &#x0201c;treatment as usual&#x0201d;, both placebo acupuncture and real acupuncture might play important roles.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] The difference between acupuncture and no acupuncture in effectiveness is often much greater than the difference between acupuncture and so-called &#x0201c;placebo acupuncture&#x0201d;. Thus, psychosocial factors other than needle placement might be relevant to subjective outcomes of acupuncture. In particular, patients&#x02019; beliefs about acupuncture could predict treatment outcomes in acupuncture for pain to a significant extent.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>According to the traditional Chinese acupuncture theory, two critical principles that are of the same importance in ensuring the effectiveness of acupuncture are &#x0201c;zhi shen&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;de qi&#x0201d;. The one principle called &#x0201c;zhi shen&#x0201d;is gaining full control over the spirits of the patients and the acupuncturists.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] The other one is named &#x0201c;de qi&#x0201d;, a composite of unique sensations induced by needle insertion into the acupoint which has been widely investigated in recent years.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] To ensure the effectiveness of acupuncture, during the whole acupuncture process including before needling, performing needling, and after needling, the acupuncturists were required to attend closely to the spiritual state of both acupuncturists and patients. The acupuncturists administrated the insertion until de qi was achieved by their patients. However, this important concept &#x0201c;zhi shen&#x0201d; in traditional Chinese acupuncture theory is hardly mentioned in western literature and emphasized in clinical practice in Western countries. What's more, among various kinds of needle sensations, what kind of needle sensation can predict outcomes of acupuncture treatment also remains undetermined. Thus, we analyzed the data on psychosocial factors from the above mentioned RCT to examine whether some quantifiable psychosocial measurements could improve the therapeutic effects of acupuncture treatment. Through rating different kinds of needle sensations by a visual analog scale, this study attempted to explore the relationship between each needle sensation and therapeutic effect of acupuncture.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Data source</title><p>The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, and was conducted in accordance with the provisions of the <italic>Declaration of Helsinki</italic> (1975, amended 1983) and <italic>Good Clinical Practice guidelines</italic>.

The HB scale is based on a six-grade score: Grade 1 indicates normal function and Grade 6 indicates complete paralysis. Patients were asked to show four standard facial expressions: at rest, raised eyebrows, eyes tightly closed, and showing teeth, which were recorded by a digital camcorder.

Data extraction and statistical analyses were conducted using SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) and the R Statistical Environment, package &#x0201c;grplasso&#x0201d;. For each group, we used the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm for variable selection and refit the model using a standard logistic regression. Candidate variables of the model included center, gender, age (divided by 10 years), education status, occupation, side of palsy, time between onset of palsy and start of treatment (divided by 72 h), the HB score on day 1, attention (1: correctness ratio &#x02264;97%, 2: &#x0003e;97% correctness ratio &#x02264;99%, 3: correctness ratio &#x0003e;99%), and the scores of PMQ and 16PF.</p><p>To examine the association of feeling factors with HB score at month 6, we used multivariable logistic regression analysis after controlling for all confounding variables, including gender, age, treatment, interval between the onset of palsy and the start of treatment, and HB score on day 1. HB scores of patients at month 6 were grouped into two categories in our logistic regression: 1 for normal function and 0 for others. To prevent the model from multicollinearity and overfitting, 10-fold cross-validation with minimax concave penalty (MCP)-penalized method was used for variable selection (R: package &#x0201c;ncvreg&#x0201d;).</p><p>After variable selection, path analysis was used to test the causal relations among the variables specialized in the model. It allowed for the simultaneous conduction of multiple linear regression analyses and could determine and illustrate whether the data were consistent with the researcher's casual hypothesis. In our previous research, variables such as treatment, HB score on day 1, and Vigilance and Tension scores in 16PF may influence the value of HB score at month 6. All these variables were selected as the path analytic model's exogenous variables. Besides, all the feelings which selected by the cross-validation process and HB score at month 6 were selected as the path analytic model's endogenous variables. Path coefficients were computed via two multiple regression analyses based on the hypothesized model. Note the dependent (endogenous) variable HB score at month 6 was a binary variable for logistic regression but a continuous variable for path analysis (raw data: score 1&#x02013;6).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>R<sc>ESULTS</sc></title><p>Totally, 316 subjects with complete variable records were analyzed and the patients were divided into two groups: de qi group (<italic>n</italic> = 159) and control group (<italic>n</italic> = 157).

HB: House-Brackmann; 16PF: 16 Personality Factor Questionnaire.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="CMJ-129-1789-g004"/></fig></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec1-4"><title>D<sc>ISCUSSION</sc></title><p>The findings to date suggested that a number of psychosocial factors, in particular, patients&#x02019; beliefs about acupuncture, predict treatment outcomes in acupuncture for pain to a significant extent.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] As for objective outcomes in acupuncture treatment, there is almost no report in literature exploring in this regard. Our findings suggested that different personality traits played the different roles on the objective outcome when using acupuncture treating patients with Bell's palsy. The score of experience and belief in acupuncture questionnaire, gender, age, education status, occupation, and attention had no prominent effects on objective outcome after 6 months. After 6 months, patients in the de qi group had a better facial function (adjusted <italic>OR</italic>: 4.16, 95% <italic>CI</italic>: 2.23&#x02013;7.78). In control group, recovery of facial nerve function was generally attributed to spontaneous recovery and prednisone. Moreover, in de qi group, it is attributed to acupuncture, in addition to spontaneous recovery and prednisone. We found that low Social Boldness score in 16PF was associated with better facial nerve function in de qi group, which was distinguished from the control group. According to Cattell's 16PF, the patients with low Social Boldness score in 16PF tend to be shy and hesitant, showed more obedience to their acupuncturists. Therefore, low Social Boldness score in 16PF might strengthen therapeutic effects of acupuncture with de qi-related techniques. That was contrary to common belief that introversion usually led to more physical health problems. &#x0201c;De qi&#x0201d;, an internal compound sensation of soreness, tingling, fullness, aching, cool, warmth, heaviness, and a radiating sensation at and around acupoints, is elicited by manipulation of the needles (rotated as well as being moved upward and downward). The explanation is most likely that the patients with low Social Boldness score would be more easily to believe the words of the acupuncturists and pay more attention to their body and their sensations elicited by needles, thereby gaining more benefit from de qi acupuncture treatment. This interesting phenomenon calls for further investigations, which ought to shed light on the underlying mechanism of acupuncture.</p><p>As expected, low HB score on day 1 was associated with better recovery in both groups, such that those with worse facial nerve function at baseline would have worse facial nerve function at month 6. However, it was found that low Vigilance score in 16PF was associated with better outcome in the control group. In contrast to the patients with high Vigilance score who were tense and frustrated, those with low Vigilance score were more relaxed and tranquil, they could concentrate their attention to the whole acupuncture process and response to their acupuncturists&#x02019; instructions optimistically. It is implied that people who were trusting, unsuspecting, and accepting might have better therapeutic effects mainly from spontaneous recovery and medication. What's more, people with low Apprehension score got better therapeutic effects. It might be that they were more inclined to worry about their states as to ask for assistance and be more confident in acupuncturists and their therapeutic schedules.</p><p>It has been corroborated by systematic reviews that acupuncture is an effective treatment in a wide variety of diseases. Nevertheless, few studies have investigated the relationship between different kinds of needle sensations and outcomes of acupuncture. We found that the intensity of needle sensation fullness might predict outcomes in Bell's palsy, which suggested that the intensity of different needle sensations should be paid more attention in the future practice and research.</p><p>The previous studies found that high expectation for acupuncture might be positive to outcome of pain,[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and it was more significant in patients receiving verum acupuncture than in patients receiving minimal acupuncture or validated sham acupuncture.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] However, our study did not find similar results when outcome was objective. That was, positive pretreatment mediators might not have effects on objective outcome during acupuncture treatment. To the best of our knowledge, no RCTs have been conducted to investigate the effects of personality traits and attention on the objective functional outcome of acupuncture treatment. We found that some certain personality traits could strengthen the therapeutic effect of acupuncture and attention might not be a significant predictor of outcome after acupuncture treatment.</p><p>Our study also had several limitations. First, personality traits are so complex that we were unable to fully assess one's personality traits with only one questionnaire. In fact, there are many assessments can help. However, we finally chose the 16PF because it was easier to administrate and less expensive. Second, the insufficient sample size could have influenced our results.</p><p>In conclusion, among various kinds of needle sensations, only the needle sensation of fullness could predict better facial function. The needle sensation of fullness claims more of our attention in acupuncture practice and research. Personality traits may have different effects on the objective outcome when different acupuncture techniques are used to treat patients with Bell's palsy. Among patients treated with the strong stimulation (de qi) acupuncture, low Social Boldness score in 16PF may strengthen the therapeutic effect of acupuncture. In acupuncture treatment and research, personality traits should be considered seriously. Fostering such positive patient attitudes (e.g., realistic and ethical) might be one way in which clinicians could further improve their effectiveness. Acupuncture treatment is not simply needle placement.</p><p><italic>Supplementary information is linked to the online version of the paper on the Chinese Medical Journal website</italic>.</p><sec
