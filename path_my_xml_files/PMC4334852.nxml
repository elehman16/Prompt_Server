Test products provided ~280&#x000a0;kcal/serving and similar fat (12&#x02013;14&#x000a0;g) and fiber contents (0&#x02013;1&#x000a0;g). Visual Analog Scale ratings for appetite (hunger, fullness, prospective consumption, desire to eat) and repeated blood sampling for plasma glucose and insulin concentrations were assessed throughout each test day.

Postprandial glucose and insulin excursions were lower following the 30&#x000a0;g and 39&#x000a0;g protein conditions vs. the low-protein condition, with smaller responses following the 39&#x000a0;g vs. 30&#x000a0;g protein condition (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05 for all).

This may be particularly true when protein is consumed at breakfast versus later in the day, as studies that have fed protein at lunch or dinner have shown more variable results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Acute intervention studies have shown that protein-rich breakfast meals reduce appetite and increase satiety throughout the morning relative to moderate or low-protein breakfast meals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Protein-rich breakfast meals have also been shown to reduce energy intake at a subsequent <italic>ad libitum</italic> lunch meal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Such effects have been demonstrated at protein intakes &#x02265;20&#x000a0;g, and most consistently at intakes &#x02265;30&#x000a0;g of protein per meal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>The effects of a protein-rich breakfast may extend beyond the immediate postprandial period. Several investigators have reported reduced energy intakes over the 24&#x000a0;hour period following egg-based breakfast meals rich in protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], although not all studies have produced similar results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Leidy et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] found that higher protein intake at breakfast (35 vs. 13&#x000a0;g) was associated not only with greater satiety and less hunger throughout the morning, but also with reduced energy intake from snacks in the evening hours, particularly high-fat snacks.</p><p>Limited data exist regarding postprandial glucose and insulin excursions and their relationships to appetitive responses following high vs. lower protein meals. In addition to the satiety properties of dietary protein, the consumption of higher protein meals has been proposed to improve glucose homeostasis. Several meta-analyses from long-term, higher protein, weight loss and/or weight maintenance diets report reductions in glycated hemoglobin and/or fasting insulin concentrations with higher vs. normal protein diets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Since larger postprandial glucose elevations have been shown to be associated with an increased risk for the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and cardiovascular disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], it is of interest to identify dietary strategies, such as higher protein intake at breakfast, that might improve glucose homeostasis through the reductions in these responses.</p><p>Average dietary protein intake in the US is adequate based on current recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. However, data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) survey suggest that the majority of dietary protein is consumed at dinner, with protein intakes at breakfast averaging ~10&#x000a0;g in women and 15&#x000a0;g in men, well below levels shown to favorably affect appetite and metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In addition, approximately 20% of US men and women do not consume breakfast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In an analysis of NHANES data, our group found that higher protein intake at breakfast was inversely associated with energy intake at lunch, and higher non-protein intake at breakfast was positively associated with energy intake at lunch [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>Given ready-to-eat cereals and other foods requiring little preparation are frequently consumed at breakfast, convenient breakfast options high in protein would be potentially beneficial for individuals interested in reducing morning hunger and energy intake later in the day as well as glycemic excursions. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the effects of consuming two higher-protein sausage and egg-based frozen convenience breakfast meals, providing 30 or 39&#x000a0;g of protein, compared with a lower-protein, higher carbohydrate frozen convenience breakfast meal (pancakes and syrup, 3&#x000a0;g protein), and breakfast skipping, on appetite ratings, postprandial glycemic and insulinemic responses, and <italic>ad libitum</italic> energy intake at a lunch meal in normal weight to overweight, premenopausal women.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design</title><p>This was a randomized, controlled, crossover study conducted at Biofortis Clinical Research (Addison, IL) according to Good Clinical Practice Guidelines, the Declaration of Helsinki (2000), and the United States 21 Code of Federal Regulations.

Repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to assess differences between test conditions for continuous outcome variables. Initial models contained terms for treatment condition, sequence, period, age and baseline BMI, with subject included as a random effect. Models were reduced in a stepwise manner until only significant terms or treatment condition remained in the model. The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to assess normality of the distribution of residuals in the analysis models. The normality assumption was rejected for palatability, energy intake at lunch, and preload plus energy intake, therefore rank transformations were employed and the models were rerun using the transformed data. When treatment condition main effects were detected, pairwise comparisons between conditions were conducted using Tukey&#x02019;s adjustment for multiple comparisons. Sensitivity analyses were conducted using the overall liking palatability score as a covariate in models for appetite ratings and energy intake at lunch with the no breakfast condition excluded.</p><p>For the appetite and food intake outcomes, the primary efficacy analysis was completed on an efficacy evaluable (EE) sample that included all subjects who consumed the 39&#x000a0;g protein breakfast and at least one other condition.

The protein-rich breakfast meals also resulted in reduced energy intake at the <italic>ad libitum</italic> lunch meal, although results only reached significance for the 39&#x000a0;g protein meal. Thus, consumption of a high protein, sausage and egg-based, ready-to-heat meal may be an option for facilitating satiety throughout the morning, reducing postprandial glycemic and insulinemic excursions, and moderating energy intake at lunch.</p><p>The satiety and food intake findings are similar to results reported by other investigators in acute intervention trials using breakfasts based on solid food sources of protein. Eggs and meat as sources of protein, in particular, have been associated with greater perceived satiety and/or improved glycemic control in several studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. For example, Ratliff et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] compared the effects of an egg-based breakfast to a bagel-based breakfast in a group of healthy men. Similar to the results of the present study, perceived hunger, glucose, insulin, and energy intake at the lunch meal were all reduced following the higher protein breakfast. However, to the best of our knowledge, very few prior studies have evaluated the appetitive effects of protein-based, frozen convenience meals. Such meals serve as an easy to prepare option, compared to other high-protein foods traditionally consumed at breakfast in the U.S. (e.g., fresh breakfast meats, fresh eggs), which require a greater degree of preparation. This is further supported by data indicating that a primary barrier associated with breakfast is the lack of availability and convenience [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p>The present work included two levels of protein served as part of a commonly consumed breakfast meal. There were minimal differences in responses between the protein-containing meals, suggesting that both protein levels were sufficient to elicit a greater satiety response and to reduce postprandial glycemic and insulinemic excursions compared with the low-protein meal. The differences in glucose and insulin responses elicited by the test meals were expected because a substitution of protein for carbohydrate was employed, thus reducing the available carbohydrate load. Nevertheless, chronic reduction of dietary carbohydrate has been demonstrated to produce notable metabolic effects, including lowering the circulating concentration of triglycerides, reducing blood pressure, and lessening the demand for insulin production by the pancreatic beta-cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Moreover, ingestion of protein at a meal tends to increase insulin secretion without significantly increasing the plasma glucose concentration (compared to water ingestion) in the postprandial period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Lastly, elevations in plasma insulin and glucose have been shown to reduce appetitive sensations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Thus, it is notable that the appetitive effects observed with higher protein and lower carbohydrate were present despite lower insulin and glucose concentrations.</p><p>Other investigations utilizing beverages or semi-liquid applications (e.g., yogurt or custard) to evaluate the satiating properties of protein have shown similar effects to those observed in the present study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. However, such vehicles are not among the top breakfast choices in the U.S. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Further, the present work included overweight and normal weight women, a group more likely to engage in strategies to reduce body weight than their male counterparts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Results from several long-term intervention trials have provided evidence that higher protein, reduced carbohydrate diets may help to enhance weight loss and/or maintain lean body mass during weight loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Increased satiation, and therefore better adherence to caloric restriction, is one potential mechanism by which high protein diets may facilitate weight loss. High protein, easy to prepare breakfast options with greater satiating potential would likely facilitate the consumption of calorically-restricted, protein-rich diets.</p><p>The mechanisms whereby dietary protein promotes satiety are not completely understood. It has been hypothesized that a high-protein meal may modulate the post-absorptive release of hormones and neurochemicals in the gastrointestinal tract that down-regulate appetite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. In particular, consumption of high-protein meals has been shown to decrease levels of the hunger-stimulating hormone ghrelin and/or promote the increase in the satiety-stimulating hormones peptide YY (PYY) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), resulting in increased perceptions of satiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Unfortunately, data for ghrelin, PYY, and GLP-1 for the present study are not available. A majority of studies that have assessed the relationship between postprandial insulin levels and appetite sensations have suggested that insulin has an acute effect to suppress appetite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], although conflicting results have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Intracerebroventricular or systemic injections of insulin suppress food intake in a dose-dependent manner in animal models, suggesting a direct involvement in satiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. It is therefore notable that appetite ratings were reduced with the high protein conditions compared to the low protein (higher carbohydrate) breakfast, despite lower insulin (and glucose) responses. Some investigators have suggested that increased thermogenesis following consumption of high-protein meals, as well as changes in substrate oxidation may influence appetitive signals that affect food intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Additional studies will be needed to more fully define the mechanisms responsible for the effects of substituting protein for carbohydrate observed in the present study. It is also suggested that additional research is needed to assess the substitution of protein for dietary fat. Future research of interest would also include studies in which protein is substituted for fat, since the current study cannot separate the effects of increasing the protein content of the study breakfast meals from those of reducing the carbohydrate content.</p><p>Both buffet lunch and uniform food models, such as the tortellini and sauce lunch used in the present study, have been used extensively in appetite research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. A uniform food model was used in the present investigation because the main objective was related to energy intake rather than food selection. Thus, a limitation of the study is that possible differences in food or macronutrient preferences at lunch could not be assessed.</p><p>Another limitation is the short-term nature of the measurement period. It is possible that appetitive sensations or energy intake would increase later in the day to compensate, or even overcompensate, for reductions in energy intake observed at the lunch meal. However, results from Leidy et al.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] suggest that this may not be the case, as total daily energy intake was reduced when a high-protein breakfast was consumed, compared with a lower protein breakfast meal. Notably, in that trial, a 7-day period of acclimation was employed for both breakfast conditions, suggesting that the effects of higher protein breakfasts on appetite do not dissipate, at least after several days of consumption.</p><p>The possibility cannot be ruled out that expectations surrounding each breakfast condition and differences in the sensory characteristics influenced the results. The present trial evaluated commercially-available breakfast options, therefore matching the sensory properties of the test conditions was not possible. However, all products were considered to be relatively well-liked and there were only measurable differences in the palatability of the highest protein condition relative to the low protein and 30&#x000a0;g protein conditions. Inclusion of the overall palatability rating as a covariate in sensitivity analyses for appetite ratings and energy intake at lunch did not significantly reduce the unexplained variance, suggesting that differences in palatability were unlikely to have materially influenced the results.</p><p>Differences in the physical characteristics of the study products may have also influenced orogastric transit time. In an effort to control this to the degree possible, subjects were instructed to eat a portion of each condition at specific intervals over a 12-minute period (approximately one-third during each of three 4-min periods). However, we cannot rule out the possibility that differences in consumption patterns (e.g., chewing) or orogastric transit time influenced our findings. Further, the weight and volume of the products differed. Such characteristics have been previously shown to affect perceived satiety, however our objective was to evaluate conventional breakfast options at an equivalent caloric level, and as such, differences in weight and volume were unavoidable due to the nature of the breakfast meals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec14" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, the results of the present investigation suggest that sausage/egg convenience meals providing 30&#x000a0;g or 39&#x000a0;g protein per serving produce greater appetite control, reduce postprandial glycemic and insulinemic responses, and lower energy intake at lunch relative to a lower-protein, higher carbohydrate, breakfast meal.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>TR, HL, KM, KS, and AL received research funding from Hillshire Brands.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>TR, HL, and KM conceived the study concept and design and analyzed/interpreted the data.
