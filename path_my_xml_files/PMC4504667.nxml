We initially identified the baseline rate of inappropriate use of antibiotics at our institution including risk factors that trigger inappropriate antibiotic use. We then used these findings to develop an educational initiative in the general internal medicine teaching unit (CTU) of one hospital with the CTU in the second hospital serving as the control.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec010"><title>Patients and Methods</title><sec id="sec011"><title>Study setting</title><p>The study was conducted at two academic, tertiary acute care hospitals in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, with 412 and 370 beds, respectively. Consecutive patients with a positive urine culture from January 30<sup>th</sup> to April 17<sup>th</sup>, 2012 (baseline) were assessed for the presence of ABU and whether antibiotic treatment was initiated. Patients on the CTU of both hospitals with 68 and 75 beds respectively and similar patient populations, were included in the intervention phase (January 30<sup>th</sup> and April 30<sup>th</sup>, 2013), with educational sessions on the CTUs every 4 weeks at the intervention site and no education on the CTUs at the control site. As an ongoing quality improvement project, the educational sessions were continued at the intervention site after the original study period, and the control site CTU began with educational sessions to the medical residents as well as nursing staff in September/October 2013. In contrast, education for nursing staff was not started until July 2014 at the intervention site. Due to resource limitations, only the CTUs of both hospitals are provided with ongoing education on a regular basis. The study was approved by the Hamilton Integrated Research Ethics Board, which waived the need for written informed consent.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Definitions and inclusion criteria</title><p>We included patients with first positive urine culture, defined as growth of &#x02265;10<sup>5</sup> colony forming units per milliliter (CFU/mL) with either bacteria or fungi.

Inappropriate antibiotic use was defined as the use of an antibiotic to treat ABU in the absence of pregnancy or urologic procedures when bleeding is anticipated.[<xref rid="pone.0132071.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Patients were excluded if the urine culture had mixed growth, defined as the presence of &#x02265;3 organisms.</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Microbiology laboratory</title><p>Urine analysis test strips were processed on the Siemens Clinitek analyzer.

Staff physicians on the intervention unit were notified upfront. At the end of January 2013, 15-minute educational sessions were conducted for the residents with a new session during morning rounds held every block, on a 4-week cycle. On average, 10 residents attended the sessions which were mandatory as part of the morning rounds. If the senior author was not available, another infectious diseases physician delivered the session. The teaching session consisted of a) an overview of the evidence, b) feedback of findings during baseline assessment c) clarification of misconceptions related to ABU management (i.e. risk factors associated with inappropriate treatment of ABU identified during the period of baseline data collection), d) feedback about the initiative, e) discussion of cases that residents had recently encountered and f) appropriate indication for urine cultures, specifically, for patients with symptoms of UTI. Also, the residents were provided with a UTI treatment algorithm that also emphasized non-treatment for ABU. The residents received verbal feedback on patients that had been identified as being inappropriately managed on an ongoing basis by the intervention team, and during subsequent presentations.</p><p>In addition, the microbiology lab added a message to all broadcasted positive urine culture reports starting in January 2013 indicating that antibiotic treatment is only indicated for symptomatic patients. This intervention was instituted at both the intervention and control site and was introduced prior to implementation of the education strategy. No other interventions that is, algorithms or protocols, were introduced on the control unit.</p></sec><sec id="sec015"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Student t-test was used for continuous data and Chi-square statistics were used for categorical data.

With this approach, we were able to reduce inappropriate use of antibiotics for ABU to less than 10% without affecting patient outcomes. Simple non-controlled before-after studies were published on educational interventions on ABU management which showed similar outcomes to the current study. Kelley et al. conducted a highly resource intensive initiative that included in-service presentations on ABU for physicians and pharmacists, notifications, pocket cards with algorithms, and the antimicrobial stewardship team reviewing common antimicrobials for treatment of UTI.[<xref rid="pone.0132071.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] They observed a reduction in inappropriate treatment for ABU from 66/107 (62%) to 28/107 (26%). Another before-after study in a community hospital setting consisted of clinical scenarios, pocket cards, and raising guideline awareness, and demonstrated a reduction from 30/64 (47%) to 2/13 (15%).[<xref rid="pone.0132071.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Interestingly, we were able to achieve a larger effect than both of these studies despite the comparably low resource requirement of our approach. One may hypothesize that this is related to the fact that we were able to use our in-house data to raise awareness. A similar effect was recently shown by Leis et al, when they no longer routinely reported results from urine cultures, but despite that, the authors saw a significant proportion of asymptomatic patients get ordered urine cultures.[<xref rid="pone.0132071.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] This is a common problem seen throughout other institutions.[<xref rid="pone.0132071.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] We did observe that there was an increase in the number of positive cultures that were taken from symptomatic patients in the intervention period, this could have been due to fewer patients being excluded compared to the baseline phase, or because the intervention period being longer by 2 weeks.</p><p>With educational interventions, sustainability is a major concern. However, as shown in the study by Zabarsky et al., educational initiatives and their effect can be sustained.[<xref rid="pone.0132071.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] While continuing with monthly educations sessions and systematic audits since the end of this study, we have identified a sustainable model to provide education to medical residents while maintaining gains that were achieved during the intervention period. Additionally, we launched this educational intervention at the control site and have observed a reduction in the number of patients inappropriately treated for ABU.</p><p>A major strength of our study was the use of a control group. Also, our intervention was based on evidence collected at the same study sites at baseline, thus demonstrating the need for improvement and allowing us to focus on local misconceptions for managing ABU. Furthermore, we combined review of physician progress notes with interviewing the nursing staff to ascertain symptoms. However, individual patient assessment may have further improved our ability to capture urinary symptoms. Our findings may not be generalizable to non-teaching hospitals and non-Medicine wards where medical residents may play a more limited role in daily patient care. The overall sample size was not large enough to fully evaluate the safety of not treating patients with ABU, however the safety of not treating patients with ABU has been well established.[<xref rid="pone.0132071.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Finally, we accepted delirium as a potential symptom of UTI in all patients, although in some cases, delirium may have been attributed to an alternate diagnosis.</p><sec id="sec020"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, this study demonstrates that short educational sessions geared towards medical residents combined with feedback including in-house data can significantly reduce inappropriate use of antimicrobials for asymptomatic bacteriuria. The effect of our intervention has proven to be sustainable during long-term follow-up of over two years.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We acknowledge Alexander Carducci, BSc and Allen Cheng, BSc from the faculty of pharmacy at the University of Waterloo, and Daniel JS Lee, MD of the University of Toronto for collecting and analyzing data.
