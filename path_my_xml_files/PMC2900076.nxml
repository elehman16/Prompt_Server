Tranexamic acid is an antifibrinolytic agent which decreases the total blood loss. Patients had unilateral / bilateral cemented TKA using combined spinal and epidural anaesthesia. In a double-blind fashion, they received either placebo (n=25) or tranexamic acid (n=25)10 mg.kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> i.v., just before tourniquet inflation, followed by 1 mg kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> h-1 i.v. till closure of the wound. The postoperative blood loss, transfusion requirement, cost effectiveness and complications were noted. The groups had similar characteristics. The mean volume of drainage fluid was 270 ml and 620 ml for unilateral(U/L) and bilateral(B/L) TKR patients in placebo group. Whereas it was 160ml and 286 ml respectively in unilateral(U/L) and bilateral(B/L) TKR patients who received tranexamic acid. This was considered statistically significant. Control group patients received 26 units of PRBC as compared to 4 units in tranexamic acid groups (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.001). This was again statistically significant. None of the patients in any of the groups developed deep vein thrombosis. Tranexamic acid decreased total blood loss by nearly 54% in B/L TKR and 40% in U/L TKR and drastically reduced (&#x0003e; 80%) blood transfusion.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Tranexamic acid</kwd><kwd>TKR</kwd><kwd>blood loss</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Major orthopedic procedures including hip and knee replacement and spine surgery, are associated with severe bleeding because of extensive dissections through bony and fibrotic tissue, increased fibrinolysis due to tourniquet application and surgery and inability to cauterize bleeding bony surfaces.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT2">2</xref></p><p>Tissue and vascular damage during surgery or trauma, stimulates cascade of coagulation leading to clot formation to prevent blood loss.

Plasminogen binds to lysine residues on the surface of fibrin and is converted to plasmin by an activator released from endothelial cells [tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA)] that simultaneously binds to fibrin. Plasmin then degrades fibrin into soluble fibrin degradation products. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT3">3</xref> Tranexamic acid is a synthetic derivative of the amino acidlysine, which exerts antifibrinolytic effect through reversible blockade of lysine binding sites on plasminogen molecules.

All patients were monitored with five-lead electrocardiography (ECG), pulse oximetry; end tidal carbon dioxide, core temperature through nasal probe and non invasive blood pressure monitoring.</p><p>The anaesthetist, surgeon and the observer were blinded to the study drug. A person not further involved in the study prepared and started the test/placebo drug before tourniquet inflation. In Group TU and TB, Tranexamic acid was given immediately before inflation of the tourniquet. After a test dose of 1mL, patients received a dose of 10 mg.kg<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> IV followed by an infusion of 1 mg.kg<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>1hr<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> until skin closure. Patients in Group CU and CB received an equivalent volume of physiologic saline. Pneumatic tourniquet around the upper thigh was inflated to a pressure of 250-300 mm Hg in all patients before incision and deflated at the end of surgery. Before the surgery, Hb transfusion trigger point was determined for each patient according to the following criteria: for patients over 60 yr and associated cardiopulmonary disease the transfusion trigger was 10 g dL<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> whereas for other patients, the transfusion trigger was 8 g dL<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>.</p><p>Intraoperative blood losses were negligible because of tourniquet. Postoperative blood losses were assessed by measuring wound drainage until drains withdrawal (&#x000b1; 24 hr). During surgery and in postoperative period, measured blood losses were replaced with Ringer's lactate in a 3:1 ratio and/or with pentastarch 10% (maximum dose 1500 mL) in a 1:1 ratio until Hb concentration fell below the transfusion trigger point. Thereafter, patients received leuco depleted allogenic packed red blood cells. Factors known to influence intraoperative and postoperative blood losses were noted. These included tourniquet time and pressure, length of surgery, mean arterial blood pressure maintained during surgery and minimal core temperature achieved.</p><p>After surgery patients were shifted to post anaesthesia care unit for further management. Post operative pain was managed with epidural infusion of 0.125% bupivacaine with clonidine 1.5 mcg.ml @ 4-6 ml/hr. Hemoglobin concentration, platelet count; coagulation profile and renal function tests were measured in the immediate postoperative period, after 4 hours and on postoperative day one. Drains were removed after 24 hours in the postoperative period.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-3"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>For tests of differences between quantitative data, two-sided t-tests were used.

The volume of distribution is 1.0 litre kg<sup>-1.</sup> and the plasma half-life approximately 80 min.

The higher effectiveness in B/L TKR patients can be explained by the fact that in B/L TKR patients the bleeding is more as fibrinolytic system is already activated when second joint is operated.</p><p>The results are comparable to Cochrane review on &#x0201c;antifibrinolytic use for minimizing perioperative blood transfusion&#x0201d;.
