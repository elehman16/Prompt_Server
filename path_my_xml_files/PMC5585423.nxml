The rate of acute cellular rejection and long-term renal function were similar in both groups.

We performed 109 operations during this period but excluded patients who died within 3 months after transplantation, in which cases, tacrolimus was mainly administered by intravenous formula (9 cases) and who cyclosporine was initially introduced after the operation (12 cases). This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by institutional review board.</p></sec><sec><title>Posttransplant Immunosuppressive Treatment</title><p>We changed the protocol for the initiation of tacrolimus. Twenty-eight patients between January 2005 and December 2008 received TAC-BID (Prograf, Astellas Pharma Japan Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) after transplantation, and 26 recipients between January 2009 and August 2011 received 1 dose of TAC-BID immediately after transplantation, followed by TAC-PR (Graceptor, Astellas Pharma Japan Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) in a once-daily protocol from postoperative day (POD) 1 as we described previously.<sup><xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Thirty-four recipients immediately received TAC-PR after transplantation. We distributed the 88 cases into 2 groups: TAC-BID group (n = 28) and TAC-PR group (n = 60).</p><p>Initially, 0.05 mg/kg of each TAC was given through a nasogastric tube just after arrival at the intensive care unit after liver transplantation, and the tube was clamped for 1 hour. The TAC dose was adjusted based on the morning trough level from PODs 1 to 3, and then the subsequent doses of TAC were adjusted according to the trough level on the previous day. The dose was held or skipped when the trough level was greater than 20 ng/mL, and additional dose was administered when the trough concentration of TAC was suboptimal. Our target trough level of tacrolimus was 8 to 12 ng/mL within 21 days after liver transplantation, and reducing progressively to 6 to 10 ng/mL between 21 and 90 days after liver transplantation. After 3 months, 4 to 8 ng/mL was set as the target trough level. Corticosteroids were used together with TAC, starting with 1 g methylprednisolone during the surgery, then tapering from 100 to 5 mg/d in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, or autoimmune hepatitis, or tapering off in recipients with liver failure of other etiologies. Mycophenolate mofetil was added in patients with renal impairment, rejection episodes or others as needed. An elementary diet tube (8Fr, silicon, Create Medic Co., Ltd, Yokohama, Japan) was placed into the jejunum during the surgery and an elementary diet was started as soon as possible. Oral intake of medicine, including TAC, was started when water intake was fully possible and followed oral intake of food.</p></sec><sec><title>Short-term and Long-term Outcomes</title><p>Short-term outcomes compared between the 2 groups were the incidence of skipping or adding TAC, ACR, renal toxicity evaluated by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and morbidities during the first 3 months after surgery.

No significant difference was found, but patients in the TAC-PR group tended to have a lower incidence of BPAR by POD 90 (13.3% vs 28.6%, <italic>P</italic> = 0.084). All of the patients with BPAR were treated by steroid pulse and the addition of mycophenolate mofetil, and then acute rejection was improved immediately. Trough levels of tacrolimus were almost similar between the 2 groups throughout the 3 months (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Trough levels in the TAC-PR group were slightly out of target trough level ranges on PODs 1, 2, and 5, as they were lower on PODs 1 and 2 and higher on POD 5.

Even though the necessity of additional TAC administration was greater in the TAC-PR group, the trough levels were almost within the target trough levels with less incidence of overshooting. In addition, a lower BPAR rate was achieved in the TAC-PR group. This is potentially valuable study because it is mostly performed on partial grafts from living donors. In Japan, living donor liver transplantation has a very important role due to chronic lack of brain-dead donors.<sup><xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Oral administration of twice-daily TAC for de novo liver transplantation is still widely accepted because the graft size is small in living donor liver transplantation and more careful attention to the control of TAC administration should be necessary.<sup><xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> The administration of TAC-PR in the early phase of liver transplantation seemed to lead to postoperative adverse effects, such as acute rejection or infectious complications, due to difficulty controlling the trough level of TAC. The other regimens for TAC-PR administration in liver transplantation recipients are oral administration of traditional twice-daily TAC or temporary intravenous administration of TAC, and then conversion to TAC-PR. However, conversion of administration carries the risk of fluctuating the concentration of TAC. As long as the concentration is well controlled, the immediate start of TAC-PR should be better because of its simplicity and unnecessary conversion of the TAC formula.<sup><xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup></p><p>In this study, not only long-term outcomes, but also short-term outcomes, including the adjustment of TAC dose early after transplantation, were compared to evaluate the difference between the TAC-BID and TAC-PR protocol in detail. The incidence of additional TAC due to low trough levels was higher in the TAC-PR group than the TAC-BID group, but this was probably because adjustments could be managed by increasing the evening dose of TAC in the TAC-BID group without adding TAC administration timing in most cases. Although the concentration of TAC did not tend to achieve the target trough levels until POD 2 in the TAC-PR group, we supposed that the delay to reach the target trough could be permitted because the high amount of corticosteroid was used during this acute phase. TAC has a narrow therapeutic index, and many clinical and genetic factors, such as cytochrome P450(CYP) 3A5 and ATP-binding cassette B1 polymorphisms can affect the pharmokinetics of TAC.<sup><xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Especially in the early posttransplantation period, TAC blood levels are influenced by the dramatic change of absorption and metabolism. Our initial dose of TAC was relatively low, and we started with the same dose regardless of the formulation of TAC. After that, we adjusted the dose of TAC by monitoring the blood trough level. Our results support the immediate start of oral TAC-PR being feasible and safe compared with conventional TAC-BID in de novo liver transplantation.</p><p>Renal dysfunction after liver transplantation is a major problem,<sup><xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>-<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> and renal insufficiency is strongly associated with an increased relative risk of death more than 1 year after liver transplantation.<sup><xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> In our study, renal function gradually worsened during the first 6 months after transplantation and thereafter remained stable throughout the follow-up period. Overall, there were as many as 24 (27.2%) recipients developed CKD according to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes guidelines. Among these 24 patients, 4 (4.5%) patients developed stage 4 or 5 CKD.</p><p>It is reported that the lower trough concentration of tacrolimus in the early posttransplant period by using TAC-PR was beneficial in reducing drug-related side effects without increasing the incidence of ACR by randomized controlled trial and systematic reviews.<sup><xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> In addition, lower tacrolimus trough levels possibly contribute to reduction in renal impairment,<sup><xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> lower HCC recurrence,<sup><xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> less progression of fibrosis,<sup><xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> and improvement of long-term patient and graft survival.<sup><xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> Early tacrolimus exposure, in the immediate posttransplant period, might be the key to improve renal function in future. In our study, target trough levels of tacrolimus were set to 8 to 12 ng/mL within the first 3 weeks after transplantation, and 6 to 10 ng/mL until 3 months after transplantation. We paid attention not to overshoot these target trough ranges.</p><p>In this study, HCC recurrence after liver transplantation was observed only in TAC-BID group, and the recurrence rate in TAC-BID group was 14.3%. In the baseline characteristics, the patients in TAC-BID group had more advanced stage and aggressive features of HCC. The rate of HCC over Milan criteria was higher in the TAC-BID group (46%) than the TAC-PR group (25%), and the preoperative value of AFP was higher in TAC-BID group. In addition, the pathological tumor differentiation was quite different in 2 groups; the rate of poorly differentiated HCC was significantly higher in the TAC-BID group. From these differences of baseline factors in 2 groups, it is supposed that HCC recurrence was shown only in patients of TAC-BID group. The influence on HCC recurrence by administering of immunosuppressive drug of TAC-BID versus TAC-PR could not be fully ascertained from this study due to the tumor characteristics differences in the 2 groups.</p><p>Our study has several limitations. In this study, 26 recipients who received 1 dose of TAC-BID immediately after transplantation, followed by TAC-PR in once-daily protocol from POD 1 were included in the TAC-PR group. We performed this protocol as a bridge to immediate start of TAC-PR from POD 0. As a result, our TAC-PR group included 2 subgroups. However, our policy concerning TAC administration was consistent, and we had kept almost the same way of administration. In addition, this was a single-center nonrandomized retrospective study, and we did not examine the incidence of nonadherence of TAC. As for immunosuppression nonadherence, we have plenty of evidence that nonadherence is associated with increased late ACR and graft loss in adult renal transplant populations, but similar evidence is scanty for adult liver transplant patients.<sup><xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>-<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> Improved adherence to TAC-PR might in turn lead to improved patient prognosis. There are few facilities where the immediate start of TAC-PR is introduced in de novo liver transplant recipients, and little information is available about the clinical experience. Our results clearly demonstrate that the TAC-PR protocol was well tolerated with closely controlled adjustment.</p><p>In conclusion, the TAC-PR protocol was feasible and favorable with strict adjustment compared with the traditional TAC-BID protocol in terms of both short- and long-term outcomes.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p>Published online 23 August, 2017.</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The authors declare no funding or conflicts of interest.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>Y.O., T.N., H.E., and S.M. designed the study.
