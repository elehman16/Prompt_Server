During the first year of observation, 21 control patients (38%) and five treated patients had recurrences. After a follow-up period of 36 months, 12 of the treated patients (25%) and only seven controls (13%) were still alive. At that point, the median survival was 13.6 months for the 55 untreated patients and 20.4 months for the 48 treated patients, a significant difference. We found a survival advantage for patients treated with the EPI-LV-5-FU regimen and a consistent delay in the appearance of recurrent or metastatic cancer. Acute toxicity was mild and treatment was well accepted by all patients. There was no long-term toxicity or any cardiac toxicity. We conclude that this particular chemotherapy, administered shortly after gastric resection, improves survival rate in node-positive gastric cancer patients, even although final assessment of this particular adjuvant approach must await completion of the trial.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00032-0139.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="549" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00032-0140.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="550" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00032-0141.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="551" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00032-0142.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="552" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
