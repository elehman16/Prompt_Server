The current Danish national clinical practice guidelines recommend pivmecillinam as a first-line drug (i.e.<italic>,</italic> 400&#x000a0;mg&#x000a0;t.i.d. for 3&#x000a0;days). Pivmecillinam is also one of the first-line drugs recommended in the international guidelines for LUTIs (i.e.<italic>,</italic> 400&#x000a0;mg b.i.d. for 5&#x000a0;days). The international recommended duration is based on evidence saying that a 7-day regimen is better than a 3-day regimen. However, no data says that a 5-day regimen is superior to a 3-day regimen. With this study we aim to identify and to compare the efficacy of pivmecillinam 400&#x000a0;mg&#x000a0;t.i.d in a 3-day respectively 5-day regimen, against community acquired uncomplicated LUTI, i.e.<italic>,</italic> in women at the age of 18&#x02013;70 year old.</p></sec><sec><title>Method/design</title><p>The general practitioner will at consultation give a suitable patient the opportunity to participate in the study. If the patient will give her consent, a double-blinded kit (i.e.<italic>,</italic> the antibiotic with/without placebo, questionnaires and self-urinary samples) will be given to the patient. We aim for 161 evaluable patients in each arm.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Pivmecillinam is an excellent choice against urinary tract infections and we believe this study will fill in the gaps and strengthen the evidence on the treatment against one of the most common infections in our society.

Most patients are otherwise healthy women, and these infections are often the main reason of exposure to antibiotics for these patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Uncomplicated LUTIs are primarily community acquired and diagnosed as well as treated in primary care. The most common pathogen is <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], and diagnosis can be made clinical with 90% positive predictive value (i.e. new onset dysuria, pollakisuria and urgency, together with absence of vaginal discharge or pain) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>In Denmark, the current clinical practice recommendations is pivmecillinam (i.e.<italic>,</italic> 400&#x000a0;mg&#x02009;<italic>t.i.d</italic> for 3&#x000a0;days) as the first line drug against uncomplicated LUTIs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Pivmecillinam is a prodrug of mecillinam. It is an amidinopenicillin, selective and highly effective against Gram-negative bacteria, especially <italic>E. coli.</italic> The side effects are few; most commonly reported are mild gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g. nausea) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. It has for a long time primarily been used for UTIs in the Scandinavian countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Several studies have shown pivmecillinam to be a safe and effective agent in the treatment of LUTIs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Even in countries where it is well used, there seems to be low rates of resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] (e.g. 5% resistance in <italic>E. coli</italic> of the Danish primary sector [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]), and indications of a low rate of collateral damage and low risk of clonal spread of resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>The current international and European clinical practice guidelines for acute uncomplicated UTI recommend pivmecillinam as one of the first line drugs, the therapy is recommended to be 400&#x000a0;mg <italic>b.i.d</italic> for 5&#x000a0;days. Although, at the same time saying 400&#x000a0;mg <italic>b.i.d</italic> in any duration between 3 and 7&#x000a0;days is an appropriate choice, but pointing out a 5-day or a 7-day course probably is superior to a 3-day course [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The recommended duration is, however, based on evidence showing a 7-day course is better than a 3-day course [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Clinical studies on pivmecillinam treatment of LUTI caused by ESBL producing bacteria shows different success rates, i.e. 56% (200&#x000a0;mg&#x02009;<italic>t.i.d</italic>.) and 80% (mainly 400&#x000a0;mg&#x02009;<italic>t.i.d</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The higher success rate of 400&#x000a0;mg is supported by Monte Carlo simulations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Thus, evidence point to a superiority of 400&#x000a0;mg dose.</p><p>With this knowledge, we wanted to compare the efficacy of a 400&#x000a0;mg&#x02009;<italic>t.i.d.</italic> 3-day versus 5-day regimen of pivmecillinam against uncomplicated LUTI.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design</title><p>This study will be a prospectively, double-blinded, randomized, multi-center placebo-control trial, comparing the efficacy of a 3- and 5-day regimen of pivmecillinam 400&#x000a0;mg. <italic>t.i.d.</italic> against uncomplicated urinary tract infections.

</p><p>We will then make contact and recommend another more suitable antimicrobial therapy.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Adverse effects/risks</title><p>Pivmecillinam has been proven in RCTs to be safe and effective in the treatment of UTIs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The risk off selecting and spreading off for mecillinam resistant bacteria is at very low risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], and mecillinam has a minor impact on the normal microflora [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Side effects are not more common than in any other penicillin, severe side effects are very rare, and the most common side effects are gastrointestinal complaints (i.e. nausea). Other common side-effects are rash and vulvovaginitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In the questionnaires the patients will be asked for possible adverse effects on day 1&#x02013;7 and day 28. Any adverse reactions, serious adverse reactions or events during the study period will be reported according to GCP principles and in concordance with the Danish National Health and Medicine Authority.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>Discussion</title><p>Pivmecillinam is an excellent choice against urinary tract infections, and has shown to be both safe and effective against UTI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], with a clear superiority to placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and superiority to sulftamethiazole [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In these days, with the concerning rise of multidrug-resistant bacteria, pivmecillinam has shown to be of an especial advantage; demonstrating low collateral damage (i.e. minor impact on the normal microflora [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], low resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], low selectivity and clonal spread of resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]), as well as indication of clinical and bacteriological effective against ESBL producing Enterobacteriaceae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Hence, there are good evidences backing pivmecillinam as a first line of drug in the treatment of LUTI, as stated in the international guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], and as long time practiced in the Scandinavian countries.</p><p>Ferry et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] have demonstrated that a 7-day regimen is superior to a 3-day regimen against uncomplicated LUTI. However, the current guidelines do not recommend a 7-day therapy, because of the increased risk of side effects (i.e. GI-problems). Nevertheless, there are no data comparing the 3-day vs. the 5-day therapy. With the 5-day therapy possibly to be more effective and with non-significant increased risk of side effects than the 3-day; a 5-day therapy might be a more cost-beneficial duration for the patient in the treatment of uncomplicated LUTI. Thus, with this study we want to strengthen and fill the gaps of evidence in our guidelines.</p><p>We have chosen the 400&#x000a0;mg dose <italic>t.i.d.,</italic> since that is the dose we recommend in Denmark; and we believe 200&#x000a0;mg&#x02009;<italic>t.i.d</italic> to be an insufficient dose (i.e. supported by pharmacokinetic mouse models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and the recent study from Soraas et al<italic>.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]). With this knowledge, we believe it to be unethical of us to use a 200&#x000a0;mg dose, and have therefore excluded a treatment arm with 200&#x000a0;mg.</p><sec id="Sec32"><title>Design and definitions</title><p>We designed this protocol similarly to previous similar clinical studies on uncomplicated LUTI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], in order to be able to compare results in the future in a more accurate way. We define uncomplicated LUTI in concordance with the acknowledged definition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], with one difference; we choose to include post-menopausal women in our study, since we do not necessarily believe them to always be of complicated LUTI. Hence, if a post-menopausal woman has no other complicated conditions (see exclusion criteria) we believe her to be a potential candidate.</p></sec><sec id="Sec33"><title>Procedures</title><p>We want the inclusion procedures to be as realistic as possible. Therefore, the consulting with the GPs will be changed as little as possible and restricted to the inclusion day. However, patients will be clearly instructed to return to the GP as usual at sign of treatment failure, or if they wish to consult for any other reason.</p></sec><sec id="Sec34"><title>Outcomes</title><p>The primary outcome we want to focus on is the clinical effect, since that is of most importance to the patient. However, it is important to know that the bacteria disappear and not cause clinical relapses in the future; therefore, we included two follow-up urine sample at day-4 and day-28, respectively.</p><sec id="Sec35"><title>Scientific and societal perspective</title><p>This study will give us the knowledge of what drug therapy of pivmecillinam that is most effective and sufficient. If the 5-day therapy will show to be significantly superior to the 3-day regimen, the current guidelines will have to be changed in best interests of the patients. Also through the perspective of the patients, it will be beneficial if the 3-day regimen is proven to be non-inferior to the 5-day regimen (i.e. higher rate of compliance, and less antimicrobial consumption cause less economic and ecological loads), and we can keep using the 3-day regimen in concordance with the principles of evidence-based medicine.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec36"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We believe this study will fill the scientific gaps and provide sufficient evidence for the most efficient dose duration of pivmecillinam against uncomplicated lower urinary tract infections. Thus, strengthening the guidelines for one of the most common community acquired infections in our society.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>b.i.d</term><def><p>Two times daily</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DCM</term><def><p>Department of clinical microbiology</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ESBL</term><def><p>Extended Spectrum Beta-Lactamase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GCP</term><def><p>Good clinical practice</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GP</term><def><p>General practitioner</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ITT</term><def><p>Intention-to-treat</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LUTI</term><def><p>Uncomplicated Lower Urinary Tract Infections</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NTT</term><def><p>Need-to-treat</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PP</term><def><p>Per-protocol</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>t.i.d.</term><def><p>Three times daily</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><p>We want to thank the personnel at the DKM, Hvidovre Hospital and the collaborating GP clinics for making the study possible to conduct.</p><p>
