In placebo-controlled clinical trials in adult patients with RA, the most common adverse event (AE) with adalimumab was injection site reactions, including erythema and/or itching, hemorrhage, related pain, and swelling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The overall incidence of such reactions was 20.3% in patients who received adalimumab versus 13.8% who received placebo; these reactions are the most commonly reported AE across all indications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>Pain related to subcutaneous injection can be influenced by various factors, including the inactive ingredients of the formulation (e.g., citrate buffer) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], injection volume [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], and needle size and sharpness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. A 40&#x000a0;mg/0.4&#x000a0;mL formulation of adalimumab was developed to address pain associated with injection. The active ingredient in both formulations remains adalimumab derived from the same master cell bank using identical isolation processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>The 40&#x000a0;mg/0.4&#x000a0;mL formulation differs from the current formulation of adalimumab in that it has fewer excipients (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;1); particularly, there is no citrate buffer. Further, the citrate-free formulation has a higher concentration of adalimumab that allows a smaller injection volume (40&#x000a0;mg adalimumab delivered in 0.4&#x000a0;mL instead of 0.8&#x000a0;mL), and the 40&#x000a0;mg/0.4&#x000a0;mL formulation is delivered via a syringe that has a smaller (29 vs 27 gauge) needle than the 40&#x000a0;mg/0.8&#x000a0;mL formulation.</p><p>This report details the results of two phase 2, randomized crossover studies in patients with RA that assessed injection site-related pain, safety, and tolerability of the 40&#x000a0;mg/0.4&#x000a0;mL adalimumab formulation versus the 40&#x000a0;mg/0.8&#x000a0;mL formulation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study Designs</title><p>Two phase 2, randomized, single-blind, two-period crossover studies of identical design were conducted (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

The 40&#x000a0;mg/0.8&#x000a0;mL formulation is delivered via a prefilled syringe with a 27-gauge needle. The 40&#x000a0;mg/0.4&#x000a0;mL presentation uses a prefilled syringe with a 29-gauge needle, a latex-free needle shield, and a plunger stopper that is coated to minimize leaching (Physiolis&#x02122;; Becton, Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Patients</title><p>Injection site pain is a commonly reported AE across all populations for which adalimumab is indicated; patients with RA were selected as a representative population to investigate pain on injection for the two formulations. Eligible patients were men and nonpregnant, nonlactating women &#x02265;18&#x000a0;years of age with a diagnosis of RA, as defined by the 1987 revised American College of Rheumatology (ACR) classification criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] or the ACR/European League Against Rheumatism 2010 criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], and who required adalimumab 40&#x000a0;mg every other week (eow) or every week (ew), per the local adalimumab label. Patients were either biologic-naive, or current users of 40&#x000a0;mg/0.8&#x000a0;mL adalimumab. The latter group had rated their average injection site-related pain as &#x02265;3&#x000a0;cm on a pain visual analog scale (VAS) of 0&#x02013;10&#x000a0;cm in the past month and had received &#x02265;6 consecutive doses of adalimumab before screening. All patients had a negative tuberculosis (TB) screening assessment as determined by a tuberculin skin test (QuantiFERON-TB Gold<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> test; Cellestis, Inc., Valencia, CA, USA) or equivalent test, and a chest radiograph. If there was evidence of a latent TB infection, patients had to have completed &#x02265;2&#x000a0;weeks of anti-TB therapy before baseline assessment. All patients must have been able and willing to provide written informed consent and comply with the requirements of the protocol. Patients were ineligible if they had an infection requiring intravenous anti-infectives within 30&#x000a0;days of, or oral anti-infectives within 14&#x000a0;days of, the first study visit; chronic recurrent infections; hepatitis B infection; an active systemic viral infection or any active infection that would make the patient an unsuitable candidate for the study based on the investigator&#x02019;s assessment. Patients were excluded if they had a history of invasive infection; human immunodeficiency virus; demyelinating disease; heart disease (including moderate to severe heart failure or recent cerebrovascular accident); dysplasia or malignancy (except for successfully treated nonmetastatic cutaneous squamous cell or basal cell carcinoma or localized carcinoma in situ of the cervix); or clinically significant hematologic, renal, or liver disease. Patients were also excluded if they had received any live vaccine within 3&#x000a0;months of the study or if they had prior exposure to natalizumab or efalizumab. Patients who were receiving chronic medications prior to the study, including nonbiologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, continued on medications at their same prestudy doses.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Treatment</title><p>After a screening visit (within 30&#x000a0;days of baseline), patients were centrally randomized using an interactive voice response system/interactive web response system in a 1:1 ratio to one of two sequences of adalimumab [either the 40&#x000a0;mg/0.8&#x000a0;mL or 40&#x000a0;mg/0.4&#x000a0;mL formulation at visit 1, followed by the other formulation at visit 2 in a blinded manner (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>)]. The timing of the second visit was based on the regularly scheduled doses of adalimumab required by the patient&#x02019;s prescribed on-label dosing schedule (eow or ew).</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Assessments</title><p>Patients reported injection site pain on the four-item short-form McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ-SF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], which included (1) a VAS on which the current pain level was marked on a scale from 0&#x000a0;cm (no pain) to 10&#x000a0;cm (worst possible pain); (2) evaluation of overall pain intensity on a six-point scale [no pain (0), mild (1), discomforting (2), distressing (3), horrible (4), excruciating (5)]; (3) sensory and affective dimensions of the pain experience, rated on a four-point scale from 0 (none) to 3 (severe) for each of 15 pain descriptors (sensory: throbbing, shooting, stabbing, sharp, cramping, gnawing, hot/burning, aching, heavy, tender, and splitting; affective: tiring/exhausting, sickening, fearful, and punishing/cruel); and (4) assessment of needle pain (yes, no), including cause of pain (needle entry or solution that was injected). On each visit, items 1&#x02013;3 were administered twice: immediately (within 2&#x000a0;min) and 15&#x000a0;min after the injection. Item 4 was administered to the patient after completion of item 3, immediately after the injection.</p><p>Qualified site staff used the Draize scale to score injection site hemorrhage/petechiae, erythema, edema, and pruritus (scale details are found in Supplementary Material). Assessments were performed 10 and 30&#x000a0;min after the injections on both visits. The study site personnel who administered injections were different from those who administered the MPQ-SF, or completed the Draize scale.</p><p>Safety was evaluated on the basis of AEs, physical examinations, vital signs, and standard laboratory tests. Spontaneous reports of injection site pain or reactions were considered AEs; any injection site pain or reactions reported/observed after the 30-min Draize scale evaluation was completed were also considered AEs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Statistical Methods</title><p>Based on a prior investigation, it was reasonable to assume a mean pain level of 3.00 and 2.00&#x000a0;cm on the 10-cm VAS for 40&#x000a0;mg/0.8&#x000a0;mL and 40&#x000a0;mg/0.4&#x000a0;mL formulations, respectively, with a standard deviation of 2.60 for the difference. From this assumption, it was estimated that a two-sided level <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.05 test for superiority with 83% power would require a total of 60 patients.</p><p>Injection site pain was analyzed in the crossover intent-to-treat population, defined as all patients who were randomized and completed both periods and received study drug in each period of the study. The primary endpoint was the patient&#x02019;s immediate pain after injection on the VAS. The 95% confidence intervals (CI) and <italic>P</italic> values for the difference between 40&#x000a0;mg/0.8&#x000a0;mL and 40&#x000a0;mg/0.4&#x000a0;mL formulations were calculated using a two-period crossover analysis of variance (ANOVA) model with period, sequence, and treatment as fixed effects, and subject as a random effect. The same statistical model was also used for the pooled analysis of injection site pain and for continuous endpoints in the individual studies. The two identical studies were pooled to obtain a more reliable estimate of the treatment effect. The percent difference between the two formulations in immediate pain after injection was calculated for each patient and analyzed using descriptive statistics. Based on a minimal clinically important difference (MCID) of 1.3&#x000a0;cm in VAS immediately following injection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], the proportion of patients who achieved &#x02265;1.3&#x000a0;cm less pain on the VAS while receiving the 40&#x000a0;mg/0.4&#x000a0;mL formulation than while receiving the 40&#x000a0;mg/0.8&#x000a0;mL formulation was calculated; a two-sided exact binomial test was performed to assess whether this proportion differed from 50%. The exploratory analyses assessing percentage differences and proportion of patients who achieved MCID were performed post hoc.</p><p>For analysis of VAS results by category, injection site pain was classified as mild (&#x02264;3&#x000a0;cm), moderate (&#x0003e;3 to &#x0003c;7&#x000a0;cm) or severe (&#x02265;7&#x000a0;cm) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. For dichotomous endpoints, Fisher&#x02019;s exact version of the Mainland&#x02013;Gart test was used for analysis. Demographic and baseline characteristics were summarized and compared between the two sequence groups. Homogeneity for continuous variables was assessed using a one-way ANOVA model using treatment arm as the independent factor. Homogeneity of discrete variables was evaluated using Fisher&#x02019;s exact test. Unless otherwise stated, all statistical tests were conducted at an <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.05 level. The analyses were performed using SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).</p><p>The safety population consisted of all patients who received &#x02265;1 dose of study drug. AEs were summarized. Treatment-emergent AEs were defined as those that began on or after the first dose of study drug and up to 70&#x000a0;days after the last dose of study drug.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Patients</title><p>In Study 1, 71 patients were screened and 64 were randomized, 33 to the sequence of 40&#x000a0;mg/0.8&#x000a0;mL to 40&#x000a0;mg/0.4&#x000a0;mL formulation and 31 to the sequence of 40&#x000a0;mg/0.4&#x000a0;mL to 40&#x000a0;mg/0.8&#x000a0;mL formulation.

On the Draize scale, well-defined erythema was reported 10 and 30&#x000a0;min post-dose, and constant pruritus was reported 30&#x000a0;min after the injection. The second patient (biologic-naive) reported injection site reaction pruritus, which lasted for 30&#x000a0;min. No pain was reported on the VAS at the time of injection or 15&#x000a0;min after, and there was no pruritus at 10 or 30&#x000a0;min post-dose on the Draize scale.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Discussion</title><p>Results of these two phase 2, randomized crossover studies in patients with RA were consistently in favor of a 40&#x000a0;mg/0.4&#x000a0;mL formulation compared with the 40&#x000a0;mg/0.8&#x000a0;mL formulation of adalimumab with regard to injection site-related pain. The primary endpoint, significantly lower immediate pain after injection for the 40&#x000a0;mg/0.4&#x000a0;mL versus the 40&#x000a0;mg/0.8&#x000a0;mL formulation, was met for both studies. The mean difference on the patient-reported VAS for the pooled data (&#x02212;2.48&#x000a0;cm) was also clinically relevant, based on assessments of the MCID in other settings. The MCID has been reported to range between 1.0 and 1.6&#x000a0;cm in settings of acute pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], and between 0.5 and 1.1&#x000a0;cm in observational studies of chronic pain in patients with RA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>Most other patient-reported endpoints were statistically significantly in favor of the 40&#x000a0;mg/0.4&#x000a0;mL formulation immediately after injection in Study 1 and at both time points after injection for Study 2. As observed for the primary and most other endpoints, differences between formulations were of larger magnitude in Study 2 compared with Study 1. The reasons for dissimilar pain ratings for these two identically designed studies are unclear, but they may relate to population differences where the studies were conducted (Belgium and the Czech Republic versus Australia, Canada, and Germany).</p><p>The MPQ-SF pain experience scale assesses both sensory and affective dimensions of the pain experience. It should be noted that differences that were observed between formulations were mainly related to sensory aspects of pain. Affective dimension scores were generally low for both formulations and differed significantly between formulations only in Study 2. In patients able to distinguish between the pain of needle entry versus injected solution, pain was most often attributed to the solution with the 40&#x000a0;mg/0.8&#x000a0;mL formulation and to needle entry with the 40&#x000a0;mg/0.4&#x000a0;mL formulation. The effect of volume on the ability to distinguish pain was not tested.</p><p>Results of the Draize scale, which was assessed by site staff, suggested that both formulations were similar with regard to the presence and severity of injection site hemorrhage/petechiae, erythema, edema, and pruritus. Notably, scores for each of four scale items were generally low for the 40&#x000a0;mg/0.4&#x000a0;mL and 40&#x000a0;mg/0.8&#x000a0;mL formulations of adalimumab, indicating the generally good tolerability of both formulations. There were no unexpected safety signals with the 40&#x000a0;mg/0.4&#x000a0;mL formulation.</p><p>An important strength of these studies was that the populations included patients who might be expected to experience injection site pain: 40&#x000a0;mg/0.8&#x000a0;mL users of adalimumab who had rated their average injection site pain score as &#x02265;3&#x000a0;cm on a pain VAS during the month preceding the study, and patients who were biologic-naive. However, results were limited to only one injection of each formulation, administered ew or eow based on each patient&#x02019;s regular adalimumab dosing schedule.</p><p>Results of both studies consistently demonstrated lower injection site-related pain with the 40&#x000a0;mg/0.4&#x000a0;mL formulation; however, it is not clear which feature(s) of the 40&#x000a0;mg/0.4&#x000a0;mL formulation (composition, volume, and/or needle size) is most responsible for pain reduction. Citrate-based buffers have been identified by others as a key ingredient in injection site pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Results of two phase 2, randomized crossover studies in patients with RA demonstrated that the 40&#x000a0;mg/0.4&#x000a0;mL formulation of adalimumab is associated with less injection site-related pain compared with the currently available formulation. Although this study was conducted in patients with RA, similar outcomes would be expected in other immune-mediated inflammatory diseases for which adalimumab is approved.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec18"><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.
