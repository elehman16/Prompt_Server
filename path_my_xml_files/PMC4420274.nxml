Although evidence suggests that rates of new HIV infections in heterosexual populations are slowing, rates of new infection associated with URAI in men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgendered women are stable or increasing [<xref rid="pone.0125363.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The recent approval of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) of HIV infection is a major step forward for HIV prevention; however, suboptimal adherence to oral PrEP can significantly reduce PrEP efficacy [<xref rid="pone.0125363.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0125363.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].Consequently, there is an urgent need to develop alternative approaches to PrEP, including a safe and effective RM. An RM that could be used in a pericoital fashion by men or women, especially if it had properties that made the product suitable for use as a sexual lubricant, might be an attractive PrEP option for individuals at risk of HIV infection through URAI.</p><p>Attention is currently being focused on the development of tenofovir (TFV) gel as a potential RM. The vaginal formulation of TFV used in the CAPRISA 004 study [<xref rid="pone.0125363.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] has been evaluated in a Phase 1 rectal safety study (RMP-02/MTN-006) [<xref rid="pone.0125363.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Use of the gel was associated with mild to moderate gastrointestinal symptoms including bloating, pain, urgency, and diarrhea. The vaginal formulation (VF) of TFV is hyperosmolar (3111 mOsmol/kg) and these symptoms may have been linked to product osmolality [<xref rid="pone.0125363.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Consequently, the TFV gel used in a second Phase 1 study (MTN-007) was formulated with a lower glycerin concentration (5% w/w rather than the 20% w/w used in the RMP-02/MTN-006 vaginal formulation) to yield a product osmolality of 836 mOsmol/kg [<xref rid="pone.0125363.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This reduced glycerin vaginal formulation (RGVF) was better tolerated by participants in the MTN-007 study [<xref rid="pone.0125363.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and is currently being evaluated in a Phase 2 expanded safety study (MTN-017; ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01687218). As part of an ongoing program grant from the National Institutes of Health Integrated Preclinical-Clinical Program (IPCP) for HIV Topical Microbicides, we have developed a third rectal-specific formulation (RF) TFV gel. Compared to the RGVF TFV gel, the RF TFV gel contains less glycerin (2.5% w/w) and added carbopol (0.5% w/w), with a neutral pH and is nearly iso-osmolar (479 mOsmol/kg); it was also safe and effective in preclinical evaluation [<xref rid="pone.0125363.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>The purpose of the Combination HIV Antiretroviral Rectal Microbicide (CHARM)-01 study was to directly compare the safety, acceptability, and pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) profiles of the aforementioned TFV gel formulations in a crossover study. A second study (CHARM-02) was designed to complement the CHARM-01 study by evaluating systemic PK, the luminal distribution and clearance of the three gels, and their impact on mucosal permeability (manuscript in progress). The design of the CHARM-01 study includes multicompartmental PK, detailed assessment of mucosal safety (including histology, flow cytometry, and rectal microflora), and a PD component that utilizes an <italic>ex vivo</italic> colorectal HIV-1 challenge assay to generate preliminary efficacy data [<xref rid="pone.0125363.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0125363.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The goal of the CHARM-01 study was to provide a comprehensive data set that could guide decisions as to which TFV formulation should be advanced to later stage, larger, and more expensive studies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec007"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see <xref rid="pone.0125363.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 CONSORT Checklist</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0125363.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Protocol</xref>.</p><sec id="sec008"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>The study was designed by the investigators with collaborative input from CONRAD and the NIAID/DAIDS/Prevention Sciences IPCP for HIV Topical Microbicides, as stipulated in the award notice, and reviewed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

The study also had an exploratory objective to assess the preliminary efficacy of each formulation in suppressing <italic>ex vivo</italic> HIV-1 viral replication in colorectal tissue. The CHARM-01 study was a Phase 1, double blind, randomized crossover trial in which participants received the three TFV gel formulations (VF, RGVF, and RF) in a randomized sequence. Each phase of product administration lasted 7 days with a 21 (&#x000b1; 7) day washout period between phases of product administration (<xref rid="pone.0125363.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>).

As the majority of participants in the RMP-02/MTN-006 rectal safety trial who received VF TFV gel experienced gastrointestinal side effects (bloating, abdominal discomfort, and diarrhea) [<xref rid="pone.0125363.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], it was considered unethical to ask participants to use more than one dose of VF TFV gel.</p><p>The study was conducted at two clinical sites (The University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. and the David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California at Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California). Enrollment began in March 2013 and the last participant completed the study in October 2013. The target sample size was 18 (nine participants at each site) and enrolled participants were assigned at random to one of the three study formulation sequences. Randomization was done in blocks of three at each site to ensure balance between formulation groups and the sequence of administration between sites. The randomization scheme was stratified by site and generated by the University of Pittsburgh, Center for Research on Health Care Data Center, using computer-generated random numbers.</p><p>The randomization assignments for up to 12 participants (24 total per site) were delivered to the Director of Pharmacy Affairs at the Magee-Womens Research Institute (MWRI) who held primary responsibility for maintaining the blinding and generated the product labels.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Study population</title><p>The study population consisted of healthy, RAI-abstinent, HIV-uninfected, adults (male and female) aged 18 years or older at time of screening who had been successfully vaccinated for hepatitis B virus (HBV) or who had naturally acquired immunity to HBV, as evidenced by HBV antibody titers. An additional inclusion criterion for female participants was the active use of an acceptable form of contraception (e.g., barrier method, intrauterine device, hormonal contraception, surgical sterilization, or vasectomization of the male partner). Individuals with abnormalities of the colorectal mucosa, significant gastrointestinal symptoms (such as a history of rectal bleeding), evidence of rectal <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic> (CT) or <italic>Neisseria gonorrhea</italic> (GC) infection, chronic HBV infection, or a requirement to use drugs that were likely to increase the risk of bleeding following mucosal biopsy were excluded from the study.</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Study products</title><p>The VF TFV gel, the RGVF TFV gel, and the Universal HEC placebo gel were manufactured under direction from CONRAD (Arlington, VA) by DPT Laboratories (San Antonio, TX). DPT Laboratories also manufactured the RF TFV gel under direction of Dr. Lisa Rohan&#x02019;s Group at MWRI. HTI applicators (HTI Plastics, Lincoln, NE) were used to deliver gel in the CHARM-01 study. These applicators had been initially designed for vaginal use and have been used in all of the previous vaginal microbicide trials with TFV gel. They have also been used rectally in the RMP-02/MTN-006 and MTN-007 studies [<xref rid="pone.0125363.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0125363.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Each opaque pre-filled applicator was packaged with a plunger and labeled with a code to preserve the identity of the formulation. Each pre-filled applicator contained a dose of approximately 4 mL of TFV gel or the HEC placebo. The pre-filled applicators were shipped directly to study site pharmacies and were stored by and dispensed from the site pharmacy.</p><p>Each participant was assigned applicators based on the randomization number. At Visits 3, 6, and 9 the participant&#x02019;s first dose of study product was administered by the clinical staff. During the period of daily administration, study participants were instructed to insert one dose of gel into the rectum once daily for five days. A final dose of study product was administered by clinic staff at Visits 4, 7, and 10.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Study procedures</title><p>There were a total of eleven study visits and one follow-up phone call. After obtaining informed consent all participants were screened with a thorough medical history, a targeted physical examination, a digital rectal examination, and rectal swabs for CT/GC nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT). Urine was also collected for CT/GC NAAT and for pregnancy testing in the female participants (pregnancy testing was repeated at all subsequent clinical visits). Blood was collected for safety labs (complete blood count, urea nitrogen, creatinine, alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase) and serology (syphilis, HIV-1, hepatitis B, and herpes simplex 1 and 2). Participants who met the aforementioned inclusion criteria during the Screening Visit were enrolled into the study. The Enrollment Visit occurred within 28 days of screening. At the Enrollment Visit, participants were randomized, a web-based behavioral questionnaire was administered, and a rectal examination and focused physical examination were performed. Rectal swabs were collected for CT/GC. Rectal sponges for quantification of cytokines/chemokines in rectal secretions, and PK were also collected. Participants then received a normal saline pH 7.4 enema. A flexible sigmoidoscope was inserted into the rectum and 21 biopsies were collected at approximately 15 cm from the anal verge. Biopsies were used for histology, gene expression, flow cytometry, PK, and <italic>ex-vivo</italic> tissue challenges. At Visits 3, 6, and 9 (Treatment Initiation Visits), all participants had a single applicator of study gel inserted into the rectum. Prior to product insertion, samples were collected for CT/GC, microflora and cytokines. At Visits 4, 7, and 10 (Last Dose Treatment Visits) sponges were collected for quantification of cytokines in rectal fluid. A normal saline enema was then administered followed by a single dose of study product. Approximately 30 minutes later (&#x000b1; 15 minutes) blood, and in females, self-collected vaginal sponges were collected for PK studies. A sigmoidoscope was then inserted and the same rectal tissue biopsy samples were collected as described during the Enrollment Visit. Additional blood and rectal/vaginal sponges were collected at 2 hours (&#x000b1; 30 minutes) and 4 hours (&#x000b1; 30 minutes) after product insertion. At Visits 5, 8, and 11 (conducted 18&#x02013;30 hours after Visits 4, 7, or 10) blood and rectal/vaginal sponges were collected for PK. Rectal swabs were collected for assessment of microflora after gel use. A web-based questionnaire was also conducted at the end of each period of gel use. At Visit 11 only, blood was collected for HBsAg serology. A brief qualitative interview was conducted after Visit 11 to assess overall product acceptability.

SAS version 9.2 was used for the statistical analyses. The primary outcome of safety was assessed at the 5% type I error rate. The target sample size of 18 was chosen to ensure an 85% probability of observing at least one Grade 2 or higher adverse event in an arm when the true event rate is 10%. Each of the secondary outcomes was assessed at the nominal significance level without adjustments for multiplicity.</p><sec id="sec023"><title>Safety</title><p>For safety analysis, the number and frequency of &#x02265; Grade 2 adverse events (AEs) were tabulated for each of the three study formulations. To determine the extent of AEs, the proportion of subjects that experienced an AE was calculated for each study formulation. The rate of safety events was compared between the RF formulation and either the VF or RGVF formulations using McNemar&#x02019;s test for each comparison. This was conducted after the final dosing visits (Visits 4, 7, and 10, respectively).</p></sec><sec id="sec024"><title>Acceptability</title><p>We calculated the proportion of participants who reported product characteristics that were considered to be a barrier in use, operationalized as having a rating of lower than 3 on a 5-point Likert scale, in disliking or likelihood of future barrier in use. Acceptability was defined as the converse (rating of &#x02265; 3). This was calculated for each of the following product characteristics: &#x0201c;consistency&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;color&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;smell&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;taste&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;stickiness&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;feeling inside rectum&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;need for lubrication&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;sexiness&#x0201d;. McNemar&#x02019;s test was then used to compare each pair of formulations with respect to acceptability.</p></sec><sec id="sec025"><title>Pharmacokinetics</title><p>TFV-based gel formulations&#x02019; PK were evaluated in six compartments (plasma, PBMCs, rectal fluid, rectal tissue, rectal MMCs, and cervicovaginal fluid) after rectal administration of the study product. For matrices other than tissue which were sampled multiple times after the last dose, the 24 hour post-dose concentration and time profiles were examined following the final rectal dose of each TFV-containing study product. This occurred after 7 doses for the RF and RGVF gels and after 1 dose for the VF gel). TFV (or TFV-DP in PBMCs) were characterized in terms of maximum concentration (C<sub>max</sub>), time to maximum concentration (T<sub>max</sub>), and area under the TFV concentration-time curve from 0 to 24h (AUC<sub>0-24</sub> [log-linear trapezoidal method]) using non-compartmental methods (WinNonlin v. 6.3 software, Pharsight, St. Louis, MO). Rectal biopsies, which were sampled only once with each product, were taken 30 minutes after each final study product dose to determine TFV and TFV-DP concentrations in tissue homogenates and TFV-DP in MMCs. We performed paired comparisons between RF and RGVF using the Wilcoxon rank sum test with exact two-sided significance test (alpha &#x02264; 0.05). VF PK was not compared to either RF or RGVF due to non-steady state conditions; only one TFV-containing dose was given during the VF phase of the study.</p></sec><sec id="sec026"><title>Mucosal Immunotoxicity</title><p>The association of mucosal parameters with study products was examined. Flow cytometry and histopathology parameters were collected at the enrollment/baseline visit (Visit 2) as well as after the 7<sup>th</sup> dose of each formulation (Visits 4, 7, and 10). Changes between each of the latter visits and the baseline visit were calculated for the flow cytometry parameters and used as the outcome for the analysis. Microflora anaerobic and facultative parameters were collected at the 1<sup>st</sup> dose (Visits 3, 6, and 9) and 24hr post dose for each formulation (Visits 5, 8, and 11), and changes between each 1<sup>st</sup> and 24hr post dose (i.e. Visit 5 minus Visit 3, Visit 8 minus Visit 6 etc.) were calculated and used as the outcome. GEE models were utilized for all outcomes with different link functions to account for the distributional nature (i.e. continuous versus binary). In addition, we assumed an exchangeable within-subject correlation, which assumes the correlation between any two visits is the same. Predictors in the model included drug formulation, visit (or stage), and their interaction. We first tested the interaction to confirm the non-existence of a drug formulation carryover effect. If significant, we based our inference on information at Stage 1. Otherwise, we ran an additive model (w/o interaction term) as our final model. Each participant served as his or her own control and effects were tested using two-sided Wald significance tests with &#x003b1; = 0.05.</p></sec><sec id="sec027"><title>Pharmacodynamics</title><p>Cumulative p24 at Day 14 was used as the primary measure for <italic>ex vivo</italic> tissue infectibility.

Changes between each of the latter visits and the baseline visit were calculated for 14-day cumulative p24. A natural log transformation was then taken and used as the outcome for the analysis. GEE models were utilized with an identity link function and an exchangeable correlation structure to account for the within-participant correlation. Predictors in the model included drug formulation, visit (or stage), and their interaction. Due to the crossover design of the trial, we first tested the interaction to confirm the non-existence of a drug formulation carryover effect.

Rectal exposure to study products was associated with the detection of TFV in plasma, rectal fluid, and rectal tissue and TFV-DP in rectal tissue and tissue MMC but not in PBMCs. As previously reported, rectal exposure to TFV gels was also associated with detection of TFV in vaginal fluids [<xref rid="pone.0125363.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0125363.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Use of all three formulations resulted in significant suppression of HIV-1 viral replication in the <italic>ex vivo</italic> colorectal challenge assay, which correlated with local tissue concentrations of TFV.</p><p>We were unable to fully enroll the CHARM-01 study due to a combination of slow participant accrual and product expiration. In the early stage of product development microbicide gel formulations may have limited stability. It is therefore critical that the timing of studies take into consideration product expiration. However, as with our study, unanticipated regulatory delays or slow enrollment may still lead to premature closure of a study.</p><p>The majority of reported adverse events in the study were gastrointestinal and of mild severity. There were no differences in rates of adverse events across the three formulations although as mentioned above the VF TFV gel exposure was limited to one exposure which is probably why we did not see more gastrointestinal events in the VF TFV gel phase of dosing. The RGVF was evaluated and found to be safe and acceptable in the MTN-007 rectal safety study [<xref rid="pone.0125363.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and had a similar profile in the CHARM-01 study. Despite the osmolality of the RF gel being half of the RGVF TFV gel (479 versus 846 mOsmol/kg, respectively), there was no difference in their respective safety profiles.</p><p>All three formulations were acceptable to the study participants. Of note, the VF TFV gel phase of dosing in CHARM-01 only included exposure to one dose of the VF TFV gel preceded by six daily doses of a HEC placebo gel. This likely explains why exposure to the VF TFV gel was more acceptable than the seven doses of VF TFV gel participants received in the RMP-02/MTN-006 study [<xref rid="pone.0125363.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In the context of the CHARM-01 protocol, acceptability was based upon the assessment of a series of product characteristics that might be considered as potential barriers to use of these products such as taste, odor, and smell. In previous rectal and vaginal microbicide studies, including the RMP-02/MTN-006 study, acceptability has been assessed only on the basis of intentionality for future use of the product [<xref rid="pone.0125363.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>As with previous RM studies, the CHARM-01 study explored the potential impact of product administration on mucosal safety as assessed by histology, flow cytometry of gastrointestinal derived T cells, and rectal microflora. There were no histological changes noted in the study. There was a significant increase in CD3+/CD45+ T lymphocytes associated with 7 day exposure to the RF TFV gel. However, there were no significant increases in HIV-1 target cells defined by CD4+, CCR5+, or CXCR4+ phenotypes nor were there any significant changes in activation phenotype defined by CD69+, CD38+, or HLA-DR+ phenotypes. In the absence of such changes, it is unclear whether the increase in CD3+/CD45+ T lymphocytes associated with exposure to the RF gel might still be associated with a quantitative increase in HIV-1 target cells such as CD4+/CCR5+ T cells. Another limitation of this study is that we only characterized T cell phenotypes and in future it would be worthwhile broadening the flow panel to include other cells of myeloid lineage such as monocytes and macrophages that might play an important role in the mucosal response to HIV infection and that might be impacted by exposure to microbicide candidates. Flow cytometric analysis of gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) T cell populations may be more useful in evaluating products like the CCR5 antagonist maraviroc that have been associated with changes in activation phenotype and CCR5 expression in GALT [<xref rid="pone.0125363.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Such studies are currently ongoing in the HPTN-069 study of oral PrEP (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01505114) and will be used in the CHARM-03 study which will evaluate rectal and oral maraviroc products. Modest, but significant changes in rectal microflora were noted for five of the 24 organisms evaluated using semi-quantitative culture techniques. It is uncertain whether these changes could be associated with exposure to the TFV gels. However, it is known that zidovudine has antibacterial activity [<xref rid="pone.0125363.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The clinical significance of these changes is uncertain and may be better understood after longer term studies and/or the use of newer technologies to characterize and quantify the rectal microbiome in microbicide trials [<xref rid="pone.0125363.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. An alternative approach to the assessment of mucosal safety is to incorporate systems biology to characterize the mucosal transcriptome and proteome before and after microbicide exposure. Using this approach, we have previously documented significant changes in rectal mucosal biology associated with TFV exposure including significant changes in mitochondrial function [<xref rid="pone.0125363.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Similar evaluations are ongoing with samples from CHARM-01 participants and will be reported separately.</p><p>The compartmental PK data from CHARM-01 are similar to PK data generated in the RMP-02/MTN-006 study [<xref rid="pone.0125363.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0125363.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]): rectal exposure to TFV gels is associated with minimal systemic exposure, lack of drug detection in PBMCs, high concentrations in rectal tissue/fluid, and detection in vaginal fluid. MMC TFV-DP trended toward ~2-fold greater concentrations following RF when compared to RGVF. Otherwise, there were no PK differences between these two products.</p><p>Single dose VF PK values cannot be fairly compared to the drug accumulation in steady-state RF and RGVF PK values after 7 doses. For example, based on our single dose VF PK data and the long TFV and TFV-DP half-life within most of the matrices tested [<xref rid="pone.0125363.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], accumulation of TFV and TFV-DP after 7 daily VF doses would match or exceed the concentrations seen with the RF and RGVF products in this study.</p><p>The <italic>ex vivo</italic> HIV-1 tissue biopsy challenge assay has become an important component in the evaluation of candidate microbicides [<xref rid="pone.0125363.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and has been used to generate preliminary efficacy data in several RM studies [<xref rid="pone.0125363.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0125363.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In the CHARM-01 study, all three formulations were associated with <italic>ex vivo</italic> viral suppression in colorectal tissue are these data are in keeping with previous Phase 1 RM studies where the use of both VF TFV gel and UC781 was associated with significant inhibition of explant infection [<xref rid="pone.0125363.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0125363.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. These findings are impressive, especially for the VF as only one dose of active product was delivered <italic>in vivo</italic> with tissues acquired within 15&#x02013;45 minutes following product insertion and it is known that the HEC gel used in the VF gel dosing phase does not have activity in the explant challenge model [<xref rid="pone.0125363.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. These data therefore give significant encouragement to the possibility that RM could be used in a pericoital fashion.</p><p>PK/PD modeling has been used to characterize the relationship between systemic and local drug concentrations and the ability to inhibit <italic>ex vivo</italic> viral replication in colorectal tissue [<xref rid="pone.0125363.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0125363.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. PK/PD modeling can also be used to help define therapeutic/pharmacokinetic targets for microbicide development [<xref rid="pone.0125363.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. PK/PD data from the CHARM-01 study demonstrated a significant negative correlation between increasing concentrations of TFV and decreasing levels of <italic>ex vivo</italic> viral replication in colorectal tissue. Strikingly, the relationship was significant for all PK matrices studied (plasma, rectal tissue (TFV and TFV-DP), rectal tissue-derived MMC (TFV-DP), rectal fluid (TFV)).</p><p>The primary goal of the CHARM-01 study was to compare three different formulations of TFV gel and to determine whether there were significant differences in safety, acceptability, PK, or PD parameters that might facilitate deciding which product should be advanced into late stage development as a RM. Given the unacceptable rectal safety profile of the VF TFV gel, documented in the RMP-02/MTN-006 study, it is clear that this is not a viable product to develop further as a RM The real decision is whether CHARM-01 allows us to choose between the RF and RGVF formulations of TFV gel. The CHARM-01 PK data do suggest that the RF formulation may deliver higher local concentrations of TFV-DP to the rectal mucosa than the RGVF formulation, although this did not reach significance. This is the only discriminating parameter between the RF and RGVF TFV gels in the CHARM-01 study and may be insufficient to displace the RGVF TFV gel that is currently being evaluated in the MTN-017 study, an International Phase 2 expanded safety study being conducted in the United States, Peru, Thailand, and South Africa. The results of the MTN-017 study (expected in early 2016), with approximately 192 participants, eight week periods of exposure to daily or pericoital RGVF TFV gel, as well as a PK/PD substudy of 36 participants, will have a critical role in defining the future for the RGVF TFV gel as a candidate RM for Phase 3 safety and effectiveness trials.
