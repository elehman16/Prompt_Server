Steroids are frequently administered to critically ill patients. However, the effect of steroids on lactate levels has not been adequately investigated. We studied the effect of a single intraoperative high dose of dexamethasone on lactate and glucose levels in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The Dexamethasone for Cardiac Surgery (DECS) trial was a multicenter randomized trial on the effect of dexamethasone 1&#x000a0;mg/kg versus placebo on clinical outcomes after cardiac surgery in adults. Here we report a pre-planned secondary analysis of data from DECS trial participants included at the University Medical Center Groningen. The use of a computer-assisted glucose regulation protocol&#x02014;Glucose Regulation for Intensive care Patients (GRIP)&#x02014;was part of routine postoperative care. GRIP aimed at glucose levels of 4 to 8&#x000a0;mmol/L. Primary outcome parameters were area under the lactate and glucose curves over the first 15&#x000a0;hours of ICU stay (AUC<sub>15</sub>). ICU length of stay and mortality were observed as well.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The primary outcome could be determined in 497 patients of the 500 included patients. During the first 15&#x000a0;hours of ICU stay, lactate and glucose levels were significantly higher in the dexamethasone group than in the placebo group: lactate AUC<sub>15</sub> 25.8 (13.1) versus 19.9 (11.2) mmol/L&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;hour, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c;0.001 and glucose AUC<sub>15</sub> 126.5 (13.0) versus 114.4 (13.9) mmol/L&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;hour, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c;0.001. In this period, patients in the dexamethasone group required twice as much insulin compared with patients who had received placebo. Multivariate and cross-correlation analyses suggest that the effect of dexamethasone on lactate levels is related to preceding increased glucose levels. Patients in the placebo group were more likely to stay in the ICU for more than 24&#x000a0;hours (39.2%) compared with patients in the dexamethasone group (25.0%, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.001), and 30-day mortality rates were 1.6% and 2.4%, respectively (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.759).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Intraoperative high-dose dexamethasone increased postoperative lactate and glucose levels in the first 15&#x000a0;hours of ICU stay.

Administration of a corticosteroid such as methylprednisolone or dexamethasone during cardiac surgery is associated with a reduced duration of postoperative mechanical ventilation and intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital stay, probably because of a lower risk of postoperative pulmonary complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Still, controversy regarding their use remains because of potential important adverse effects. Corticosteroids increase insulin resistance and may increase hyperglycemia and blood glucose variability. The pronounced inflammatory response following cardiac surgery and CPB contributes to decreased insulin secretion and increased insulin resistance. Although too rigid a regulation of blood glucose may increase the risk of hypoglycemia, inadequate glucose control is associated with increased ICU morbidity and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>Studies on the influence of corticosteroids on lactate levels are scarce, and their results are contradictory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Dexamethasone effectively reduces the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines during cardiac surgery and thus may reduce lactate production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] on the one hand, but increases the amount of substrate for lactate formation (pyruvate from glucose) by increasing hepatic glucose release and insulin resistance on the other. Furthermore, dexamethasone increases catecholamine production in the adrenal medulla via its stimulating effect on phenylethanolamine-M-methyltransferase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Catecholamines affect splanchnic perfusion as well as muscle Na-K-ATP-ase activity, Both of which may also lead to increased lactate production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>Because blood glucose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and lactate levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] are both well-established and important clinical outcome predictors in ICU patients, including those after cardiac surgery, we investigated the effect of a single intraoperative high dose of dexamethasone on glucose control and lactate levels after cardiac surgery. We studied a subset of patients included in the Dexamethasone for Cardiac Surgery (DECS) trial, a multicenter randomized trial recently carried out in The Netherlands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. This trial found a reduced risk of respiratory failure and infections and reduced ICU and hospital length of stay in patients who received dexamethasone. We assessed the effect of dexamethasone on postoperative lactate and glucose levels.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design and participants</title><p>The DECS trial is a multicenter randomized clinical trial in which 4,494 cardiac surgery patients were randomly assigned to receive either an intraoperative dose of 1&#x000a0;mg/kg dexamethasone or placebo. A detailed description of the design and results of the DECS trial was recently published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The institutional review board (Medical Ethics Committee, in Dutch: Medisch Ethische Toetsingscommissie, METc) of the University Medical Center Utrecht as well as the institutional review board (METc) of the University Medical Center Groningen approved the DECS trial protocol, which adhered to Good Clinical Practice guidelines and relevant national regulations and is registered in the National Institutes of Health Trial Registry (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00293592). All participants gave written informed consent.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Intervention, randomization, and blinding</title><p>According to a computer-generated 1:1 randomization scheme, patients received a single intravenous (IV) bolus of dexamethasone (20&#x000a0;mg/mL, 1&#x000a0;mg/kg, maximum 100&#x000a0;mg) or placebo (NaCl 0.9%) immediately after induction of general anesthesia. The trial pharmacy prepared the trial medication in blocks of 40 numbered, indistinguishable vials. Patients, investigators, and all of the patients&#x02019; caregivers were blinded to treatment allocation. Surgery, anesthesia, and CPB were conducted without modification for the trial.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Patient recruitment</title><p>The DECS trial recruited adult patients who required elective or urgent cardiac surgery with use of CPB, and excluded off-pump and emergency surgeries and patients with a life expectancy of less than 6&#x000a0;months. For the present study, data of all 500 DECS trial participants who underwent surgery at the University Medical Center Groningen, The Netherlands, were used, because this center routinely uses a validated computer-assisted glucose regulation protocol in the ICU.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Conduct of anesthesia</title><p>Pre-operative cardiac medication was continued until the morning of surgery. Patients were fasted from solid foods for 6&#x000a0;hours and from clear fluids for 2&#x000a0;hours prior to surgery. Patients did not receive supplemental enteral or parental feeding during the pre-operative fasting period. Standard anesthetic management consisted of propofol, sufentanil, and a non-depolarizing muscle relaxant. Etomidate was only incidentally used as an induction agent. Intraoperatively, glucose-free IV maintenance fluids were used in all patients. CPB was performed by using non-pulsatile flow of 2.4&#x000a0;L/min per m<sup>2</sup>, mild hypothermia (32&#x000b0;C to 34&#x000b0;C), and a combined glucose-free colloid/crystalloid priming solution. Myocardial protection consisted of cold blood cardioplegia or cold glucose-free crystalloid solution (Plegisol; Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, IL, USA). Postoperatively, sedation was continued with propofol and morphine. During the first 24&#x000a0;hours of ICU stay, the standard feeding protocol consisted of 25&#x000a0;g of intravenous glucose (1,000&#x000a0;mL glucose/saline solution) and no additional enteral feeding.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Lactate and glucose monitoring and insulin therapy</title><p>In the ICU, a computer-assisted glucose control protocol named Glucose Regulation for Intensive care Patients (GRIP) was used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. GRIP recommends an insulin infusion rate and glucose sampling frequency. The algorithm, which is described in more detail elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and was validated in 2,800 patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], is based on both the current glucose level (queried automatically from the hospital information system) and the change in recent glucose values. GRIP-assisted glucose control, targeting for a glucose level between 4 and 8&#x000a0;mmol/L, was applied as part of routine care during the postoperative ICU stay of all patients in this study. According to the protocol, short-acting insulin (NovoRapid, Novo Nordisk, Alphen a/d Rijn, The Netherlands) was administered intravenously via a syringe pump. Intraoperatively, anesthesiologists used a glucose regulation protocol targeting for a blood glucose level below 10&#x000a0;mmol/L but did not use GRIP. Glucose and lactate levels were obtained as part of routine intraoperative blood gas analysis. All blood samples were analyzed on point-of-care ABL Blood Gas Analyzer machines (Radiometer, Copenhagen, Denmark). The analyzers were subject to strict laboratory quality control.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Outcome measures</title><p>The primary outcome was the area under the curve (AUC) of glucose and lactate levels in the first 15&#x000a0;hours of postoperative ICU stay. The AUC was calculated by using the trapezoid rule approximation method, with no threshold for normal values. After 15&#x000a0;hours, most patients were discharged to the surgical ward, where GRIP was not used, glucose levels were measured less frequently, and lactate levels were measured rarely. When patients arrived at the ICU, glucose and lactate levels were always sampled. After that, the GRIP system determined the sampling frequency of glucose and lactate levels, so the sampling frequency differs among patients. This information is presented in Figure S1 (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). GRIP suggests a time interval to the next sample, depending on previous glucose values and insulin infusion rate. We therefore interpolated hourly glucose and lactate values to calculate the AUC. Secondary outcomes were total insulin consumption and the hyperglycemic index (HGI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The HGI is a measure of overall hyperglycemia that is not influenced by hypoglycemic episodes or unequal sampling intervals. It is calculated by dividing the area under the glucose curve that lies above the upper limit of the normal range by the observation time. The HGI was calculated for two cutoff values: 8.0&#x000a0;mmol/L as the upper end of our target glucose range and 6.0&#x000a0;mmol/L according to the original method of calculation described by Vogelzang <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Intraoperatively, glucose and lactate were routinely sampled at least three times: before, during, and after CPB. Finally, we report ICU length of stay, ICU readmissions, inotropic or vasopressor support requirement during the ICU stay, postoperative surgical site infections, gastrointestinal hemorrhages, length of hospital stay, and 30-day mortality.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Regression model</title><p>Because the effect of dexamethasone on lactate levels is not well understood, we evaluated the role of glucose as an intermediate in the relation between dexamethasone and postoperative lactate levels. In a multivariate linear regression model, we assessed the effect of dexamethasone on postoperative lactate levels (AUC of the first 15&#x000a0;hours of postoperative ICU stay) and added postoperative glucose levels (AUC of the first 15&#x000a0;hours of postoperative ICU stay) to the model as a covariable.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Subgroup analyses</title><p>Two subgroup analyses were performed. We calculated the main outcome measures separately for patients with diabetes. The findings of this analysis are presented in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. A <italic>post hoc</italic> regression analysis on the effect of beta-blocker use on the primary outcome was carried out because of a significant baseline difference between the groups.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>

In the early postoperative period, the average insulin requirement was two times the average amount required in patients who received placebo. Still, patients who received dexamethasone were more likely to be discharged from the ICU within 24&#x000a0;hours after surgery compared with patients who received placebo, as previously observed in the parent trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Bivariate correlation analysis and multivariate regression analysis suggest that the higher glucose levels in patients who received dexamethasone may largely be responsible for the higher lactate levels.</p><p>Lactate measurement and corticosteroid administration are widely used, and both arguably have a unique position in critical care. Lactate has emerged as one of the most useful prognostic laboratory parameters to predict poor outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Recent studies have demonstrated that lactate can be used to monitor the adequacy of circulatory management and that treatment targeted towards reducing lactate levels has clinical benefit in ICU patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. On the therapeutic side, corticosteroid therapy is probably the most debated intervention in critical care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Against this background, it is surprising that relatively little evidence exists on the direct impact of corticosteroids upon lactate levels. Other than the aforementioned small studies from 1997 and 2003, we are not aware of other randomized double-blind placebo-controlled studies that have studied the effect of high-dose corticosteroids on postoperative lactate levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>Our observation has practical consequences regarding the prognostic value of moderately increased lactate and glucose levels. In this study, patients who received dexamethasone had higher lactate levels, required more insulin, and had higher glucose levels, but the parent trial (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;4,494) showed that dexamethasone reduced ICU length of stay and that there was no effect of dexamethasone on major adverse events (7.0% after dexamethasone versus 8.5% after placebo, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.07) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The present substudy was underpowered to evaluate the effect of dexamethasone on major adverse events but confirmed the shorter length of stay in the ICU found in the dexamethasone group in the parent trial.</p><p>The pleiotropic effects of dexamethasone and the pleiotropic causes of hyperlactatemia make it impossible to determine the dominant pathways involved. Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> shows several potential stimulatory and inhibitory pathways that may have played a role in the induction of higher lactate levels in patients who received dexamethasone and the strong relation of this effect with high glucose levels. Dexamethasone may reduce lactate production by inhibiting the synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines associated with increased lactate production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. This effect may have been outweighed by dexamethasone&#x02019;s effects on the adrenergic stress response, which increases blood lactate directly through increased catecholamine production in the adrenal medulla. Indirectly, dexamethasone increases lactate production through its effect on insulin resistance and hepatic production of glucose, which increases blood glucose, which is a substrate for lactate production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In this study, multivariate regression suggests that the effect of dexamethasone on lactate production is dependent on its hyperglycemic effect.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>

Detailed analysis of glucose and lactate measurements in sepsis patients might address this question. In a recent retrospective study on the relation of hyperlactatemia and hyperglycemia with outcome in a cohort of nearly 8,000 ICU patients, it was observed that hyperlactatemia and hyperglycemia each had a strong relation with mortality but that the independent relation of hyperglycemia with outcome virtually disappeared when hyperlactatemia and hyperglycemia were included together. The investigators suggest that this observation indicates that stress is a common cause for increases of both lactate and glucose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. In the case of dexamethasone administration, measurements of adrenergic stress hormone and cytokine levels might further elucidate the pathways by which dexamethasone or other corticosteroids influence glucose and lactate levels. Bivariate cross-correlation analysis (presented in Table S2, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) supports the suggestion of a causal relation as reflected by the time course of the mean glucose and lactate curves, namely that the glucose peak induces a lactate peak a few hours later. Future studies with continuous monitoring of circulating glucose and lactate as well as a sampling of mediators such as epinephrine and registration of exogenous catecholamines may further clarify the apparent temporal and potential causal relation between the (postoperative) glucose peak and subsequent lactate peak.</p><p>Several limitations apply to our study. This study has a relatively short follow-up time. Most patients leave the ICU within 24&#x000a0;hours, limiting the time frame for highly frequent glucose and lactate sampling, although as the temporal data show, the period of maximal insulin resistance has clearly passed by then.</p><p>In this study population, the 30-day mortality was 2%, somewhat higher than the overall 30-day mortality in the DECS trial (1.5%). This can be explained by a difference in case mix, reflected by the higher median Euroscore of the patients operated at the University Medical Center Groningen compared with the overall Euroscore in the DECS trial: 6 (IQR 4 to 8) versus 5 (IQR 3 to 7).</p><p>This study was performed at an ICU with a validated computer-assisted glucose regulation protocol. We expect that, on average, glucose levels in both groups would have been higher if less intensive glucose control had been applied. The GRIP system advised much larger insulin doses to patients who received dexamethasone. We therefore expect that a larger difference between the glucose levels of patients who received dexamethasone versus those who received placebo would have occurred in an environment with less intensive glucose control. Because of the double blinding, modified glucose regulation algorithms for patients receiving steroids could not be used. Our results show that specific glucose regulation algorithms for cardiac surgery patients receiving corticosteroids are important to prevent early postoperative hyperglycemia.</p><p>The higher glucose levels in patients in the dexamethasone group may have indicated the treatment allocation in some patients. Still, there was a considerable overlap of postoperative glucose levels in the different treatment groups (Figure S2, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>), and insulin dose changes were prescribed by the GRIP computer system and applied by nurses, who were not involved in the analysis of the data.</p><p>A final important limitation of our study is the difference in the number of patients who used beta-blockers at baseline, despite adequate randomization. Pre-operative beta-blocker use was associated with a small but statistically significant increase in postoperative glucose levels but not lactate levels. More patients randomly assigned toward receiving dexamethasone used beta-blockers pre-operatively.
