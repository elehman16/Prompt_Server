One of such very less explored theories is that of <italic>Basti</italic>. It is supposed to be the best treatment for most of the <italic>VataVyadhi</italic> as quoted by <italic>Maharshi Charaka</italic> that &#x0201c;<italic>Basti Vataharanam Shreshtham</italic>&#x0201d;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] and also claimed as the main radical aspect of <italic>chikitsa</italic> seeking the absolute cure of disease, by eliminating its root cause.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] Almost all the <italic>Acharyas</italic> consider <italic>Basti</italic> as half or whole of the entire therapeutic measures[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] and advocated best and quickest way to provide strength and immunity to even children and old people.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] But even then, there is neither proper acceptance nor precise scientific reasoning for the <italic>Basti</italic> procedure being established. Also, there is a lot of discrepancy found in the whole process, such as many instruments are being used to administer <italic>Basti</italic> such as enema can be done with nozzle or rubber catheter or enema syringes, etc., including Classical <italic>Basti putak</italic> method. From <italic>Ayurvedic</italic> point of view, the speed of liquid during the administration of <italic>Basti</italic> is very important because it should be neither rapid nor slow. The pressure given on <italic>Basti putak</italic> is also important. The pressure of gravity differs upon height of enema where it is kept during the administration of <italic>Basti</italic>. So, it is necessary to evaluate the standard, effective, and reliable procedure for the administration of <italic>Basti. Sushruta</italic> has also explained the same, i.e., if <italic>Basti</italic> is administrated absolutely on the classical methods followed by the rules and regulations mentioned in <italic>Aturoupadrveeyadhyaya</italic>, it will make an individual to look like or posses the strength of elephant and speed and semen of horse with a heavenly luster and complexion, devoid of all the diseases.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>]</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Aims and objectives</title><p>

This difference in result may be due to the large pressure difference in administration of <italic>Basti</italic> in both the methods, which causes the increase of administration time in Enema pot method than <italic>Basti putak</italic> method.
