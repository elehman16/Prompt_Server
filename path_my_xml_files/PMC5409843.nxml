The data were collated for common measurement instruments. The performance of the placebo participants from these studies was tracked on the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale&#x02013;cognitive subscale, Mini-Mental State Examination, and Clinical Dementia Rating&#x02013;sum of boxes, and for progression on these measures to prespecified clinical study endpoints. <italic>APOE</italic> status, where available, was also analyzed for its effects.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The progression to clinical endpoints varied a great deal among the trials.

This has been of special concern in the field of Alzheimer disease (AD), since over the last decade a substantial number of compounds have been tested for efficacy with no new therapeutics being approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in over 10 years.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> A relevant factor contributing to these failures may be trial designs that do not test a well-specified hypothesis or that are not implemented sufficiently precisely to test the hypothesis.</p><p>Recently, the National Institute on Aging and the Alzheimer's Association proposed criteria for the entire AD spectrum from preclinical phases through dementia.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Intermediary in that process is the construct of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), which is typically characterized as a clinical state between normal cognition of aging and very early dementia.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup></p><p>Over the last decade, there have been several clinical trials involving participants with MCI, primarily amnestic MCI (aMCI), but all have failed to show efficacy.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> A key issue in these studies pertains to participant selection, since the variability in the performance of the placebo participants was considerable.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> MCI is a clinical syndrome like dementia and likely represents a continuum of symptoms, and with biomarkers, specificity for underlying etiology of MCI due to AD is improving. With this motivation, the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health Biomarkers Consortium in conjunction with the Alzheimer's Association launched a project to explore 7 MCI clinical trials that had been conducted in an effort to examine the extent to which placebo-treated patients from these studies behaved in a fashion commensurate with previous longitudinal studies of MCI. Specifically, the study addressed the following questions:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Were the participants equivalent at baseline in all studies?</p></list-item><list-item><p>Was the measured change in cognitive function over the follow-up period significantly different across the different studies?</p></list-item><list-item><p>Were the participants significantly different at the time of exit, i.e., progression to the endpoint in the study, considering that some studies used clinical progression to dementia while others used the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR)?</p></list-item><list-item><p>How did the participants in the various clinical trials perform in the initial 24 months of the studies since that time frame allows us to put 6 of the studies on the same scale?</p></list-item><list-item><p>Were there demographic (age, sex, <italic>APOE</italic> status) or baseline severity measures (Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE]) that can account for any differences in progression or clinical status across studies?</p></list-item></list></p><sec sec-type="methods" id="s1"><title>METHODS</title><p>Datasets from the 7 large studies with sample sizes greater than 250 participants (2 by the same sponsor using essentially identical methodologies) were collected and analyzed.

Using the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale&#x02013;cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog) as an example of how such common metrics were developed, the first step was to determine whether the individual ADAS-Cog items were collected, or only the total score was captured.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> If total scores were available, the next question was to determine if the total score was calculated using the ADAS-Cog with 11, 12, or 14 items.

Similarly, in the InDDEx, donepezil, and MRK trials, the participants seemed to improve or remain stable. These conclusions were attenuated in the completers' analysis, but the same trends were seen.

Most of the trials included participants with multidomain aMCI and the degree of impairment in the nonmemory domains varied. In addition, there may have been differences between academic and commercial sites, but this factor was not addressed. The data suggested that the studies were not equivalent with regard to the nature of the participants enrolled. In general, it appears that the ADCS and ADNI participants were very similar and were more impaired at entry than participants in Gal-11, Gal-18, InDDEx, or MRK trials. In particular, the InDDEx and MRK participants performed better at entry compared to the Gal-11 or Gal-18 participants, and performed more poorly at the time of reaching their endpoints. These conclusions can be derived from evaluations of the ADAS-Cog, MMSE, and CDR-SB data and suggest that in these trials, the participants may have been less impaired at entry but the exit criteria may have been more strict, resulting in the fact that the participants were categorized as MCI for a longer period of time yielding lower progression rates. There may have been an element of a placebo effect present as well. Therefore, while the studies appeared to be designed in a similar fashion, subtle entry, exit, and procedural differences led to vastly different outcomes for the participants.</p><p>In addition, there may have been subtle differences in the conduct of the trials that led to increased variability in performance. For example, in the InDDEx trial, the investigators made the judgment of progression to the endpoint, clinical dementia, without access to the neuropsychological test data. The clinicians were shown the ADAS-Cog and behavioral measures but not the specific components of the neuropsychology battery. In addition, the site clinicians submitted all of the data to a central review committee that required significant cognitive changes on several metrics prior to declaring that the participant had reached the point of dementia, again without access to neuropsychology test scores. It is possible that the participants in the InDDEx trial, for example, were therefore more impaired at exit than in the other trials, thus having a different threshold for reaching the endpoint of the study. Ultimately, this resulted in a lower progression rate and led to the extension of the study to 3 and 4 years in duration.</p><p>The role of <italic>APOE</italic>4 carrier status cannot be overemphasized. As is shown in the <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">table</xref>, among the trials, there appeared to be more <italic>APOE</italic>4 carriers in the ADCS and ADNI trials than in the others. Since <italic>APOE</italic>4 carrier status is associated with amyloid deposition and progression to dementia due to AD, this may have been an important factor in the progression rates observed across the trials.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> The ADCS and ADNI trials behaved in a more predictable fashion, with participants progressing in a regular fashion through the MCI state with worsening metrics on the ADAS-Cog, MMSE, and CDR-SB, and an approximate annual progression rate of 16% per year was obtained. The progression rates in the other studies were variable and less than what they had anticipated, and in part, this could be due to fewer participants being <italic>APOE</italic>4 carriers.</p><p>A complicating factor may have arisen concerning the state-dependent endpoints. That is, each study required the MCI participants to achieve the diagnosis of dementia or a surrogate, e.g., CDR 1. If a continuous cognitive measure had been used as the outcome, as suggested by the recent FDA guidelines, more consistent findings may have arisen.<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> However, this assertion must be tempered by the variable performance on one of the common measures, e.g., ADAS-Cog, as is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2</xref>.</p><p>The non-NIH trials were also conducted in many countries using multiple languages. The MCI construct was relatively new, especially during the time that these trials were conducted, and the cultural differences in characterizing participants with mild impairments as well as those reaching the dementia threshold could be variable. It is not clear what effect the translation of the multiple instruments into several languages would have on the outcome, but that likely added to the variability of the performance of the trials. Several of the trials, e.g., InDDEx trial, commented on the inclusion of participants with multiple comorbidities and exclusions of participants with other relevant conditions like depression. As such, the participant populations at the MCI stage may have been sufficiently variable with regard to comorbidities and cultural differences to add an element of complexity to interpreting the data.</p><p>There are several lessons to be learned from the comparison of these trials. No single trial was better or worse than any of the others, but there were multiple sources of variability. From the ADCS and ADNI trials, it appears that, if the studies involve a single language and culture, and include multiple academic centers, the implementation of the criteria for aMCI may be more standardized. However, given the subtle nature of the clinical abnormalities in some of these participants, there can be differences in performances of the groups. One factor affecting the outcome was the severity of the participants at the point of entry. Subtle differences in the memory impairment criteria can have a significant effect on the rate of progression of the participants. As such, those trials that had less impaired participants had lower progression rates than those with participants who were more severely impaired at entry. This may have resulted in some participants being further from the endpoint of the study at entry, and the rate of progression in participants with milder disease is known to be slower.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup></p><p>The role of <italic>APOE</italic>4 carrier status is also apparent. It is likely that those participants who were <italic>APOE</italic>4 carriers had more underlying pathology at entry than noncarriers, and that resulted in a greater degree of impairment at entry, which could then have influenced the rate of progression and time to reach the endpoint. The amount and type of data available to the clinicians to make the endpoint assessment is also important. Some trials required the clinical diagnosis of dementia with review by a central committee, and other trials used progression to CDR 1 as the endpoint. It is clear that participants can progress from MCI to dementia while still at the CDR 0.5 stage, and consequently, variability can be introduced by the nature of the endpoint.</p><p>Clinical trials designed to involve participants at the MCI due to AD stage can be improved. Clearly, through the use of AD-specific biomarkers, the clinical characteristics of the participants can be stratified and a more homogeneous group of participants can be enrolled. If the intervention is targeted at amyloid, amyloid positivity on PET scanning or CSF A&#x003b2;42 levels can be used to select participants. It is uncertain as to whether these biomarkers will overcome some of the other sources of variability encountered in the trials described, but that is a distinct possibility. The implementation of continuous outcome measures rather than clinical states may improve performance of trials, but clinical meaningfulness needs to be established. However, attention to other factors such as <italic>APOE</italic>4 carrier status, language, culture, and comorbidities still needs to be entertained in designing trials in this state of the disease. Finally, these factors are not peculiar to trials of MCI due to AD but have implications for other chronic disorders of a gradually progressive nature. Several important lessons have been derived from analyzing the previously conducted trials.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supplementary-material"><p>Supplemental data at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://neurology.org/lookup/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000003907">Neurology.org</ext-link></p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>The authors thank the FNIH staff, Judy Siuciak, Steve Hoffmann, Dorothy Jones-Davis, and Rosa Canet-Aviles for their assistance with this project.</p></ack><sec sec-type="contributions"><title>AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS</title><p content-type="contributions">Dr. Petersen: drafting/revising the manuscript for content, including medical writing for content, study concept or design, analysis or interpretation of data.
