A randomized experimental design was used. Twenty-one healthy volunteers and 22 individuals with either traumatic or nontraumatic chronic neck pain were recruited to participate in the study. The intervention consisted of two experimental verbal persuasion conditions: Increase self-efficacy and Decrease self-efficacy. The PPT was measured using a pressure algometer, the CTh was measured using a thermo test system, and CPTo was measured by submerging the participant&#x02019;s hand in ice water up to the elbow joint. On three occasions, the participants reported their self-efficacy level in performing the sensory tests. In the chronic neck pain group, there were no differences in pain threshold or tolerance. There was a difference in the self-efficacy level after verbal persuasion between the experimental conditions. In the healthy control group, the CThs increased following the condition that aimed to increase self-efficacy. No other differences were observed in the healthy controls. A short verbal persuasion in the form of manipulative instructions seems to have a marginal effect on the individual&#x02019;s self-efficacy levels in the chronic neck pain group and a slight influence on the results of sensory testing in healthy controls.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>pressure pain threshold</kwd><kwd>cold pain threshold</kwd><kwd>cold pain tolerance</kwd><kwd>self-efficacy</kwd><kwd>randomized trial</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Twenty-two percent of persons with whiplash-associated disorders (WAD) show early signs of hypersensitivity persisting over time.<xref rid="b1-jpr-9-115" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Sensory hypersensitivity measured using pressure and cold pain thresholds (CThs) was related to persistent moderate or severe symptoms in patients with WAD<xref rid="b2-jpr-9-115" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> and poor recovery after neck trauma.<xref rid="b2-jpr-9-115" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Additionally, patients with chronic neck pain without any trauma have been shown to have a decreased pressure pain threshold (PPT) in the cervical area,<xref rid="b3-jpr-9-115" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> over the trapezius,<xref rid="b4-jpr-9-115" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> and in the trigeminal region.<xref rid="b5-jpr-9-115" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Thus, patients with or without trauma seeking health care are often exposed to diagnostic sensory testing to better understand their pain-related problems.</p><p>Psychological factors could influence the results of sensory hypersensitivity tests. Rhudy and Meagher<xref rid="b6-jpr-9-115" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> reported that pain tolerance was influenced by fear and anxiety. Studies on patients with WAD have shown an association between catastrophizing, ie, a set of irrationally negative cognitive and emotional responses on actual or anticipated painful stimuli,<xref rid="b7-jpr-9-115" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> and the CTh.<xref rid="b8-jpr-9-115" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Additionally, patients with osteoarthritis who reported high self-efficacy in coping with pain showed a higher experimental pain tolerance and threshold compared to those with low self-efficacy.<xref rid="b9-jpr-9-115" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Self-efficacy beliefs are defined as a person&#x02019;s conviction to successfully perform a required behavior or activity.<xref rid="b10-jpr-9-115" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p><p>Dolce et al<xref rid="b11-jpr-9-115" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> reported a strong correlation between experimental acute pain tolerance and self-efficacy ratings. They concluded that self-efficacy expectancies are a better predictor of pain tolerance than pain intensity ratings. It could be hypothesized that verbal persuasion related to self-efficacy before diagnostic painful sensory testing could have an impact on the test results. According to Bandura,<xref rid="b10-jpr-9-115" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> verbal persuasion is one approach to increase self-efficacy. However, recent experimental studies of self-efficacy in painful diagnostic sensory testing are lacking. Because verbal persuasion influences self-efficacy, it is likely that different types of instructions conveyed to the patient from the health care staff in diagnostic sensory testing might influence the results of the sensory tests. Furthermore, there are no studies comparing the effects of sensory testing after verbal persuasion on the self-efficacy of individuals with chronic neck pain and those of healthy people. The pain itself could probably affect the perceived self-efficacy for testing, and individuals with pain could also be more sensitive to verbal persuasion related to self-efficacy compared to persons without pain.</p><p>Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate 1) the differences in CTh, PPT, and cold pain tolerance (CPTo), 2) the level of self-efficacy when self-efficacy for diagnostic sensory testing is manipulated before a testing situation, and 3) whether persuasion increases or decreases self-efficacy in persons with neck pain and in healthy controls. Furthermore, the aim was to study whether there are any differences in the self-efficacy responses for sensory tests between individuals with chronic neck pain and healthy controls. We also aimed to study if there are any changes in the level of self-efficacy over time from the period before the persuasion to the periods after the persuasion and after the sensory tests.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Ethics statement</title><p>The study was approved by the Medical Research Ethics Committee, The University of Queensland.

In contrast, in the healthy control group, the CThs increased (ie, pain was perceived at a lower temperature) following the condition that aimed to increase self-efficacy. There was a significant difference in the self-efficacy levels directly after the verbal persuasion between the experimental conditions Increase self-efficacy and Decrease self-efficacy for the patients with chronic neck pain. Those who had Decrease self-efficacy manipulation scored lower in their self-efficacy for sensory testing before the testing situation commenced compared to those in the Increase self-efficacy group. Furthermore, the results showed that there were no differences in self-efficacy at any time points between the individuals with neck pain and the healthy controls when they were compared separately in the respective experimental conditions. Thus, all of the participants were equally sensitive (or nonsensitive) to verbal persuasion. However, the results within increasing and decreasing manipulation conditions for both healthy controls and individuals with neck pain separately showed an increase over time in self-efficacy from before sensory testing to after testing.</p><p>Previous research has shown associations between psychological factors and sensory hypersensitivity in patients with neck pain.<xref rid="b8-jpr-9-115" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b9-jpr-9-115" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> This finding could imply that patients with neck pain could be sensitive to psychological manipulation in a diagnostic sensory testing situation. Our study failed to support this hypothesis, showing only one difference in sensory tests between the experimental conditions, and that in the healthy controls. Putting together the earlier studies and our results, the possibility that the instructions given before diagnostic sensory testing might have an impact on the sensory test results cannot be fully eliminated.</p><p>The results showed higher self-efficacy levels in the patients with chronic neck pain who belonged to the Increase self-efficacy manipulation group compared to those in the Decrease self-efficacy group directly after the verbal persuasion but before the tests. de Jong et al<xref rid="b20-jpr-9-115" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> concluded in their study on healthy volunteers that verbal persuasion was not enough to evoke placebo-induced pain reduction. Additionally, Ashford et al,<xref rid="b21-jpr-9-115" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> in a recent meta-analysis of ways to change self-efficacy when promoting lifestyle and physical activity, showed that verbal persuasion was associated with lower levels of self-efficacy. Lee et al<xref rid="b22-jpr-9-115" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> stated that a short instruction affected sensory threshold responses. Thus, there are mixed results on whether verbal persuasion might play a role in an individual&#x02019;s self-efficacy levels. Future studies should investigate this issue.</p><p>Both healthy controls and individuals with neck pain increased their self-efficacy over time after the tests. Mastering an experience might have a better effect on an individual&#x02019;s self-efficacy levels compared to short verbal persuasion. The experience of coping well during the tests might have been a strong trigger to increase one&#x02019;s self-efficacy despite the direction of the manipulation the individual received before the tests.</p><p>According to Bandura,<xref rid="b10-jpr-9-115" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> self-efficacy beliefs seem to regulate human functioning through four processes, ie, cognitive, motivational, affective, and selective processes. These different processes usually operate together, rather than in isolation, in the regulation of human functioning.<xref rid="b10-jpr-9-115" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Thus, irrespective of the marginal results of self-efficacy manipulation on diagnostic sensory testing, the complexity of an individual&#x02019;s regulation of functioning suggests that health care staff should consider the neutrality of the content and how the instructions in a clinical sensory testing situation are given.</p><p>Bandura<xref rid="b10-jpr-9-115" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> has claimed that self-efficacy expectancies are the most relevant issues in pain management. Self-efficacy beliefs have been reported as being related to functional capacity<xref rid="b23-jpr-9-115" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, pain-related disability<xref rid="b24-jpr-9-115" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, and coping with pain.<xref rid="b25-jpr-9-115" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> These earlier findings suggest that self-efficacy beliefs are useful predictors of disability and pain intensity. Additionally, in this study, the changes in self-efficacy levels over time might indicate that health care staff should consider the perceived impact of experiences during sensory testing situations and in other types of medical examinations. The experiences in testing and examination situations could affect a patient&#x02019;s self-efficacy both negatively and positively, which in turn might be generalized to other similar medical examinations and possibly evoke fear or distrust of health care. However, this observation requires further investigation.</p><p>Several limitations of this study need to be mentioned. A primary limitation in our study may have been the short verbal manipulative intervention. There may have been different results if the dialogue with the participants was increased. However, Lee et al<xref rid="b22-jpr-9-115" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> used a short instruction (only one sentence) in their study of interaction between active and passive coping and perceived intensity of acupuncture intervention. The authors concluded that the given instructions could affect therapeutic outcomes and sensory threshold responses. Additionally, we wanted to maintain a test situation that was similar to the testing situations in clinical practice where lack of time often limits the small talk before testing.</p><p>The self-efficacy level for sensory testing was high in both the healthy and the neck pain groups before the persuasion. Thus, the occurrence of ceiling effect is a possibility. We used a one-item measure (even though based on Bandura&#x02019;s recommendations<xref rid="b10-jpr-9-115" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) that had not been psychometrically tested, which may have contributed to the high self-efficacy scores initially.</p><p>Our sample of individuals with neck pain was combined, consisting of those with or without whiplash-related trauma. The possible heterogeneity could be one reason for the non-significant differences between the experimental conditions and between the healthy controls and the individuals with chronic neck pain. However, the participants with WAD did not differ in terms of relevant demographic variables from those without trauma.</p><p>One explanation for the lack of expected differences could be type II error, ie, the effect of the small sample size. The within-sample variation in the sensory test results could have been smaller if the sample size were larger, thus resulting in significant differences between the experimental conditions. Regarding generalizability, our sample with chronic neck pain was similar to those in previous studies regarding age,<xref rid="b26-jpr-9-115" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> pain intensity,<xref rid="b26-jpr-9-115" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> and NDI scores.<xref rid="b8-jpr-9-115" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>On a subjective level, the participants responded, in part, to self-efficacy manipulation as expected, but not on a physiological level. A short persuasion on increasing or decreasing self-efficacy in sensory tests had only a marginal effect on the sensory test results of the healthy controls and an effect on the self-efficacy levels for the individuals with chronic neck pain. All of the participants, independent of the direction of manipulation, increased their self-efficacy over time. Health care staff should be aware of the potential importance of maintaining neutrality in the instructions and the patients&#x02019; experiences in a sensory testing situation.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref
