The incidence of this cancer varies from 22.8&#x02013;28.6 per 100,000 populations among males and 6.9&#x02013;11.2 per 100,000 females in various cancer registries in India. In Thiruvananthapuram, it is estimated to be 21.4 and 9.1 per 100,000 among men and women respectively.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] The 5-year survival after treatment is poor, mainly due to residual disease following treatment or development of loco-regional recurrences or Second Primary Tumours (SPT). Most loco-regional recurrences develop during the first two years following treatment. Even among successfully treated patients with early-stage disease, about 15-20% develops SPT over a five years period.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] The clinical manifestations of carcinogenesis occurring in head and neck region support the field cancerization concept.

During each visit patients were examined for loco-regional recurrence, measurement of body weight and blood samples collected for estimation of haemoglobin, liver and renal function tests and cholesterol levels to monitor for any toxicity for the study compound. Chest X &#x02013; ray was taken at 6 monthly intervals.

Demographic, clinical and pathological characteristics and recurrence rates of subjects were compared between the intervention and control groups using Chi - squared (&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>) or Fisher's exact test. The effect of the intervention on loco-regional recurrences and second malignancies were estimated with hazard ratios (HRs) and their 95% confidence interval (CIs), derived from Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Because of the small sample size, statistical adjustment to measure the effect of the intervention was done in separate regression models for each of the following variables: age (categorized into &#x0003c;50 and &#x02265;50 years), gap between treatment and recruitment (categorized into &#x0003c;6 and &#x02265;6 m), histology {categorized into Early/Well differentiated squamous cell carcinoma (WDSCC), moderately and poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma (MDSCC/PDSCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)}, N stage (categorized into negative and positive), T stage (categorized into stages T1 - T2 and T3 - T4), composite stage (categorized into stages I - II and II I-IV) and site (categorized into oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, larynx).</p><p>The number of person-years in the intervention and control groups was estimated from the date of recruitment to date of recurrence or last follow-up visit, whichever came first. Changes in percentage of antibody positive cells were obtained by taking the difference between the values at the end of the study and the baseline values.

No major toxicity for the study compound was observed. None of patients in the intervention group had any derangement of liver and renal functions. Unlike control group, patients in the intervention group experienced lesser side effects of radiotherapy such as intolerance to spicy food and difficulty in swallowing which is usually found in patients who undergo external radiotherapy for HNCs. Patients in the intervention group also had good appetite and better taste sensation. The compliance to the study medication was good.</p><p>At the end of the follow-up, 674 months and 671 months were accrued in the intervention and control groups, respectively. The number of failures were almost identical in both groups, 10 out of 37 (27.0%) in the intervention group and 11 out of 38 (28.9%) in the control group. In the intervention group all failures were loco- regional (primary alone 3, node alone 6 and primary + node 1). None of the patients in the intervention group developed distant metastasis or second primary tumour. Total 03 out of 10 failures in the intervention group were immediately following recruitment into the study (within two months). In the control group, 01 patient developed distant metastasis, 03 patients developed second malignancy and 07 had loco-regional recurrence (primary alone 4, node alone 2 and primary + node 1).

Human lymphocytes are classified into three major populations based on their biological function and cell-surface antigen expression: T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes and Natural Killer (NK) lymphocytes. T lymphocytes express the cell surface antigen CD3; B lymphocytes express cell surface antigen CD 19 and NK cells CD16. Patients with HNC have significantly lower absolute number of CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ cells. Several investigators have observed that the decreased T cell count remain as such and never come back to normal levels even in patients who remain disease free following treatment.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] It was also observed that the decrease in the T cell count progresses with increase in stage of the disease.[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] A higher recurrence rate was observed among those who had poor CD3 count.[<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] A lower peripheral blood lymphocyte NK activity has also been reported in patients with HNC.[<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] A lower NK cell activity has been observed in patients with recurrence when compared to those who remained disease-free.[<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]</p><p>Loco-regional recurrence and second primary tumours are major determinants of survival in the HNC patients.

The mean change in CD3, CD19 and CD16 cell count was slightly lower in the control group indicating the persistently lower lymphocyte count in HNCs as observed by several other investigators.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]</p><p>The disease failure was similar in both groups. However, three out of 10 failures in the intervention group were immediately following the recruitment into the study (within two months) compared to none in the control group. The failure in these 3 patients immediately following the recruitment may be due to the presence of subclinical disease at the time of recruitment. Advanced stage at presentation and node positivity are the two important prognostic factors in HNC.[<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref><xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] The Cox regression analysis of the data in the present study showed lower failure rate in patients with advanced stage and nodal disease after adjustment for other variables in the intervention group compared to the control group. This indicates a better tumour control in patients with poor prognostic factors. Although a notable fact, this was not statistically significant may be due to the small number of patients in the study groups.</p><p>A favourable symptomatic improvement in the late effects of radiotherapy such as dryness of mouth, intolerance to spicy food, discomfort in the throat and difficulty in swallowing were observed in the intervention group and the patients in the intervention group had good quality of life, although this study was not primarily designed to evaluate quality of life issues. The compliance to medication was also good.</p><p>Immune surveillance in cancer is a complex process in which T cells and tumour cells influence each other in several ways. The present study clearly showed an immunomodulatory effect following administration of <italic>Varunadi Ghritha</italic>. Considering the fact that most of the failures in the intervention group were in the regional lymph nodes, it is possible that the T cells identified in the peripheral blood may not have the potential to migrate to the regional nodes because of the effects of previous irradiation. However, since this is a small pilot study, further investigations with more number of patients and functional studies with migratory pattern of T cell responses are needed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Administration of <italic>Varunadi Ghritha</italic> resulted in an increase in CD3, CD19 and CD16 cells in the study subjects indicating an immunomodulatory effect of the study compound. Although the survival and disease failure were similar in both groups, a trend in better disease control was observed in patients with advanced stage disease in the intervention group. A significant increase in CD3 count, a pan T cell marker, was found in patients after treatment for HNCs which has probably never been reported elsewhere. The long term significance of the immunomodulatory properties of the study compound and its role in preventing loco regional recurrence and development of second malignancy in treated HNCs need to be investigated further in a larger study with longer follow up.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgement</title><p>The authors are grateful to the Kerala State Council for Science Technology and Environment, Government of Kerala, India for providing financial assistance for the project (Council Order No. (T) 022/SRS/2005/CSTE).</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Kerala State Council for Science Technology and Environment, Government of Kerala, India</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="editor"><name><surname>Curado</surname><given-names>MP</given-names></name><name><surname>Edwards</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Shin</surname><given-names>HR</given-names></name><name><surname>Storm</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Ferlay</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Heanue</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Cancer Incidence in Five Continents</article-title><year>2007</year><volume>9</volume><publisher-loc>Lyon</publisher-loc><publisher-name>IARC Press</publisher-name></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Cooper</surname><given-names>JS</given-names></name><name><surname>Pajak</surname><given-names>TF</given-names></name><name><surname>Rubin</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Tupchong</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Brady</surname><given-names>LW</given-names></name><name><surname>Leibel</surname><given-names>SA</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Second malignancies in patients who have HNC incidence, effect on survival and implications based on the RTOG experience</article-title><source>Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys</source><year>1989</year><volume>17</volume><fpage>449</fpage><lpage>56</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">2674073</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Strong</surname><given-names>MS</given-names></name><name><surname>Incze</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Vaughan</surname><given-names>CW</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Field cancerization in the aerodigestive tract-its etiology, manifestation and significance</article-title><source>J Otolaryngol</source><year>1984</year><volume>13</volume><fpage>1</fpage><lpage>6</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">6716542</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>de Vries</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>van Zandwijk</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Pastorino</surname><given-names>U</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Chemoprevention of head and neck and lung (pre) cancer</article-title><source>Recent Results Cancer Res</source><year>1999</year><volume>151</volume><fpage>13</fpage><lpage>25</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">10337716</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Slaughter</surname><given-names>DP</given-names></name><name><surname>Southwick</surname><given-names>HW</given-names></name><name><surname>Smejkal</surname><given-names>W</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Field cancerization in oral stratified squamous epithelium;
