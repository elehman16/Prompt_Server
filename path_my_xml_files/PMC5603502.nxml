Compared with Japan[<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and Korea[<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], early gastric cancer only accounts for a small percentage in China, and most gastric cancer cases are found in advanced stages at the initial diagnosis. It is inappropriate for surgeons to perform Billroth I anastomosis after subtotal gastrectomy. In 2005, Uyama first combined LADG with uncut Roux-en-Y reconstruction; however, its use remains controversial[<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In our department, we usually prefer Billroth II and uncut Roux-en-Y reconstruction.</p><p>The current study aimed to compare these two reconstruction techniques in terms of postoperative complications, including biliary reflux and gastritis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This is a randomized controlled trial which was evaluated and approved by the ethics committee at our institution, and registered in clinicaltrials.gov with the number NCT02694081. Between February 2015 and February 2016, a total of 158 patients with gastric cancer treated at the First Hospital of Jilin University (Changchun, China), who met the inclusion criteria and provided informed consent, were randomized into one of two groups: uncut Roux-en-Y group (group U) or Billroth II group (group B). Randomization was done after laparoscopic exploration with the randomization table, which was produced using SPSS v18.0 for Windows software by the Division of Clinical Research at our hospital. Patients as well as investigators (assessing outcomes and analyzing data) were masked. The inclusion criteria were: (1) distal gastric cancer diagnosed by endoscopy, CT scan, and pathology study; (2) patients who underwent LADG; and (3) age between 18 and 75 years. The exclusion criteria were: (1) late-stage gastric carcinoma or pyloric obstruction; (2) preoperative esophageal reflux symptoms, esophagitis, or hiatal hernia; and (3) systemic disease including diabetes, severe chronic lung disease, cirrhosis, or esophageal varices.</p><p>All included patients underwent LADG with D2 lymphadenectomy, which was performed by the same surgical team. For reconstruction, a 5-cm mini-laparotomy was made to complete a delta-shaped Billroth II anastomosis using a 80 mm linear stapler[<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In the uncut Roux-en-Y group, gastrojejunostomy was performed at 25 cm distal to the Treitz ligament, and jejunum-jejunum anastomosis at 40 cm from the afferent limb. The blade of the linear stapler (Covidien GIA8038S, Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, the United States of America) was removed to perform the uncut procedure of the afferent jejunal limb, 5 cm proximal to the gastrojejunostomy in the jejunum (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> and B).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Two kinds of reconstruction after laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy.

Change of potential of hydrogen (pH) in the remnant stomach was recorded at 8:00 am on the day before surgery as well as 1-5 d after surgery.</p><p>Three months later, an upper esophagogastroduodenal series was performed in each patient with 100 mL of meglumine diatrizoate. The full emptying rate at 30 min and the ratio of partial recanalization were collected.</p><p>Twelve months later, items were monitored as follows: (1) number of patients with heartburn symptoms; (2) changes in body weight within 1 year; and (3) gastric residue, residual gastritis, and biliary reflux (RGB; monitored by endoscopy).

Some studies over the years have confirmed that this reconstruction can preserve myoneural continuity to eliminate Roux stasis syndrome[<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>-<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Because uncut Roux-en-Y is a modification of Billroth II reconstruction, it makes sense to compare Billroth II and uncut Roux-en-Y to determine the better procedure after LADG.</p><p>Our study showed there was no significant difference for the incidence of postoperative complications between the two groups (7.6% <italic>vs</italic> 10.1%, <italic>P &#x0003e;</italic> 0.05). Moreover, for the severity of postoperative complications, according to the Clavien-Dindo classification of surgical complications, there was no significant difference (<italic>P</italic> = 0.954). A-loop syndrome does not occurred in the uncut Roux-en-Y group, and the incidence of duodenal stump leakage was lower than that of the Billroth II group. The reason for this may be that the Braun anastomosis effectively relieves the pressure of the afferent loop[<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], but more cases should be included to confirm this difference.</p><p>For biliary reflux, during the postoperative period, all group U pH values were lower than 7.00, thus representing an acidic stomach environment. In group B patients, all pH values were higher than 7.00, representing an alkaline stomach environment with alkaline reflux, which can be considered an important risk factor for gastric stump cancer[<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). In addition, according to patient outcomes at the 1-year follow-up, the bile reflux incidence in group B patients was significantly higher than that in group U (<italic>P</italic> = 0.000). However, the incidence of bile reflux in group U patients was 60.9%, which is higher than the equivalent statistic in Park and Kim&#x02019;s report (less than 30%)[<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. There are two main reasons that can explain these data. On one hand, the incidence of partial recanalization reached 13.0%. In this study, for partial recanalization, all those cases were first observed by endoscopy, and the result would be confirmed by esophagogastroduodenal series if there was doubt. Recanalization eventually allowed bile access to the gastric remnant. On the other hand, for some other cases, the bile reflux happened through the efferent loop, and a small amount of bile was usually found in the bottom of residual stomach with no overflow (grade 1).</p><p>Regarding gastritis, the incidence in group B patients (72.2%) was significantly higher than that in group U patients (55.1%), with a higher incidence of heartburn in group B patients as well (23.6%). These results allow us to conclude that uncut Roux-en-Y can reduce the occurrence of residual gastritis and heartburn proportion in Billroth II reconstruction. However, the biopsy results showed no significant difference between the two groups (<italic>P</italic> = 0.278).</p><p>We draw two conclusions from these results. First, the pattern of bile reflux is different. The majority of group U patients were classified into grade 1 (49.3%), characterized by a small bile amount usually located in the bottom of the stomach as gastric residue, whereas most group B patients belonged to grade 2 (58.3%), characterized by considerable tidal rhythm. Hence, the stomach bile was fresh and temporary, which may be less corrosive to the gastric mucous membranes. Park showed a correlation between bile reflux and the degree of gastritis[<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], but perhaps it depends not only on the amount but also on the pattern of biliary reflux. Second, the follow-up time was too short to show differences in the percentage of residual gastritis on biopsy, so the linear-by-linear association <italic>P</italic> value was also calculated. The result showed a significant difference (<italic>P</italic><sub>trend</sub> = 0.015), meaning that the severity of residual gastritis for group B was worse than that for group U on biopsy.</p><p>For residual food, there was no significant difference between the two groups (11.6% <italic>vs</italic> 4.2%, <italic>P &#x0003e;</italic> 0.05). For gastrointestinal anastomosis of both procedures, the stoma was extensive along the greater curvature. No gastroparesis syndrome was found during follow-up, which is perhaps related to myoneural continuity. At 3-mo follow-up, the incidence of full emptying at 30 min reached 76.6% and 88.2% in group U and B patients, respectively (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>). As a result, no retention of afferent loop stump was found during the follow-up, and the incidence of residual food was lower than that in other studies[<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>This study adopted body weight change to evaluate postoperative nutritional status of patients, and 1 year later, the weight change values of group U and group B patients were -0.04 &#x000b1; 3.6 kg and -0.18 &#x000b1; 3.8 kg, respectively, with no significant difference. Moreover, there was no significant difference in survival rates of group U and group B patients after 1 year (90.79% <italic>vs</italic> 92.31%, respectively; <italic>P &#x0003e;</italic> 0.05).</p><p>In conclusion, the uncut Roux-en-Y digestive reconstruction procedure is secure and feasible. Moreover, it can effectively reduce the incidence of alkaline reflux, residual gastritis, and heartburn seen in classical Billroth II procedure. Besides, the uncut technique still needs improvement so that the risk of staple line dehiscence is minimized, with a longer follow-up period to reevaluate the exact risk. Despite the incidence of recanalization[<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>-<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], uncut Roux-en-Y should be widely applied.</p></sec><sec><title>COMMENTS</title><sec><title>Background</title><p>In 1988, uncut Roux-en-Y reconstruction was first reported by Stiegman and Goff. Some studies over the years have confirmed that this reconstruction can preserve myoneural continuity to eliminate Roux stasis syndrome. However, because of the challenge of recanalization, the uncut Roux-en-Y is still controversial and really needs further study.

It is inappropriate for surgeons to perform Billroth I anastomosis after subtotal gastrectomy. In 2005, Uyama first combined LADG with uncut Roux-en-Y reconstruction, and since then it has been the hotspot for many years. However, its use remains controversial. Some surgeons believe that it is better than Billroth II and Roux-en-Y reconstructions, while others do not.</p></sec><sec><title>Innovations and breakthroughs</title><p>This study is the first randomized controlled trial concentrating on uncut Roux-en-Y <italic>vs</italic> Billroth II reconstruction after distal gastrectomy for gastric cancer. It aimed to compare uncut Roux-en-Y and Billroth II reconstruction in terms of postoperative complications, including biliary reflux and gastritis. Despite the incidence of recanalization, uncut Roux-en-Y reconstruction is secure and feasible, and can effectively reduce the incidence of alkaline reflux, residual gastritis, and heartburn.</p></sec><sec><title>Applications</title><p>There remains no clear consensus regarding the preferred reconstructive surgical procedure after LADG for gastric cancer.
