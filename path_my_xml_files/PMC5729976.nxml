Despite this, it goes undiagnosed and untreated in many women attending antenatal care. Smartphones could help support the prompt identification of antenatal depression in this setting. In addition, these devices enable the implementation of ecological momentary assessment techniques, which could be used to assess how mood is experienced during pregnancy. With this study, we will assess the feasibility of using a bespoke mobile application (app) running on participants&#x02019; own handsets for the longitudinal (6 months) monitoring of antenatal mood and screening of depression.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>We will use a randomised controlled study design to compare two types of assessment strategies: retrospective + momentary (consisting of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale plus five momentary and two contextual questions), and retrospective (consisting of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale only). We will assess the impact that these strategies have on participant adherence to a prespecified sampling protocol, dropout rates and timeliness of data completion. We will evaluate differences in acceptance of the technology through a short quantitative survey and open-ended questions. We will also assess the potential effect that momentary assessments could have on retrospective data. We will attempt to identify any patterns in app usage through the analysis of log data.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>This study has been reviewed and approved by the National Research Ethics Service Committee South East Coast&#x02014;Surrey on 15 April 2016 as a notice of substantial amendment to the original submission (9 July 2015) under the Research Ethics Committee (REC) reference 15/LO/0977.

Pregnant women suffering from depression are more likely to engage in unhealthy practices (including poor diet, substance abuse and failure to enrol in prenatal care), and are at increased risk of self-harm (or suicide) and postpartum depression.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 6</xref> Antenatal depression can also affect fetal development, and has been identified as an independent risk factor for a child&#x02019;s behavioural, cognitive and emotional development (including through adolescence).<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 7&#x02013;9</xref>
</p><p>Research indicates that there is no difference in the prevalence or incidence of depression between pregnant and non-pregnant women.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> However, the rate of diagnosis and treatment might be lower in pregnant women.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Approximately three-quarters of pregnant women meeting the&#x000a0;diagnostic criteria for depression (and anxiety) are not identified, and only 1 in 10 of those who require further treatment is able to access it.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Some of the barriers to the prompt diagnosis of this disorder include difficulties in differentiating depressive symptoms from the expected mood and somatic changes of pregnancy, stigma, lack of reassurance that mental healthcare is a normal part of antenatal care, characteristics of healthcare providers, configuration of health services, insufficient consultation time and the cost-effectiveness of screening practices.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10&#x02013;12</xref>
</p><p>As with other mental health conditions,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13&#x02013;16</xref> smartphones could help address some of the practical barriers and facilitate the screening and monitoring of depression throughout the antenatal period. The computational capabilities of these devices allow them to implement validated screening scales (usually retrospective self-reports) at any frequency and for any duration. Smartphones are also able to support the implementation of techniques for the collection of momentary, experiential and ecologically valid data. Being collected in real time, momentary data are less susceptible to many of the biases common to retrospective scales (eg, recall bias) and are more sensitive to fluctuations over time.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17&#x02013;19</xref> The networking capabilities and wide availability (approximately 71% of UK adults)<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20 21</xref> of smartphones, and the software development and distribution framework of mobile applications (apps), could help practitioners to circumvent some of the practical challenges associated with screening and clinical monitoring, and reduce the costs associated with data handling and management.</p><p>Altogether, these characteristics could contribute to making the screening and monitoring of antenatal depression more cost-effective: an initial resource-intensive app development phase would be followed by a relatively low-cost, large-scale distribution of the app onto patients who&#x000a0;own smartphones. Thereafter, regular depression assessments could take place remotely, at anytime and anywhere (further comprehensive clinical assessments and the provision of treatment being dependent on local referral and care pathways). Nonetheless, the feasibility of using smartphones for this purpose needs to be explored.</p><p>In this area of research, a key factor is the&#x000a0;patient&#x02019;s willingness to run screening or clinical monitoring apps on their personal handsets.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> This could influence patient compliance with clinician-led data gathering (sampling) protocols, and thus affect data completeness. The latter refers to the minimum amount of information required by clinicians to inform their decisions, and is an important data quality dimension in healthcare.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Data completeness is also susceptible to the burden that the intensity of sampling protocols (both in terms of frequency and duration) can place on patients, as well as on the value that patients might derive from the data collected. Moreover, the impact that adding momentary assessments can have on retrospective data also needs to be explored, as this could lead to more efficient diagnostic and therapeutic decisions.</p><p>This study is part of a project aimed at understanding the role of mobile technology for the screening and assessment of antenatal depression and psychological well-being in the context of antenatal care pathways in the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK. A previous feasibility study assessed the feasibility of using iPads in the waiting area of antenatal clinics for implementing the&#x000a0;National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommendations for the recognition of depression.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> The present study will explore the feasibility of using a bespoke app to support the longitudinal and remote assessment of mood and depression screening throughout the antenatal period. We will evaluate issues of patient acceptance (namely, adherence to sampling protocols and dropout rates) by comparing two 6-month sampling protocols requiring either (1) monthly retrospective <italic>and</italic> momentary assessments or (2) monthly retrospective assessments.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods and analysis</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design</title><p>We will assess the feasibility of using a bespoke mobile application, called BrightSelf, running on participants&#x02019; own smartphones to assess and monitor depression and mood during the antenatal period through a combination of retrospective assessments and ecological momentary assessments (EMA).</p><p>We will use a parallel, randomised controlled study design to assign our participants to one of two types of assessment strategies:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Retrospective plus momentary assessment: requiring the completion of (1) the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), (2) five&#x000a0;momentary questions (assessing a participant&#x02019;s mood, sleep, worry, enjoyment and energy levels), and (3) two contextual questions once a month for 6 months</p></list-item><list-item><p>Retrospective assessment: requiring the completion of the EPDS once a month for 6 months.</p></list-item></list>

The visual appearance of the notifications will depend on the operating system and on the model of the participant&#x02019;s handset. The text of the notifications, however, will remain constant across participants for each type of notification.</p><p>Participants will be able to respond (and thus complete the corresponding assessments) or to dismiss the notifications. In addition, participants will be able to leave notifications unanswered. If participants do not complete an assessment in response to a notification, they will not receive reminders or follow-up notifications. In these instances, the non-response will be recorded in our database and will be coded as such for the purposes of our data analysis.</p><p>Outside assessment periods, participants will be able to use BrightSelf in any way they find convenient and there will be no restrictions on the number of assessments they can complete on a single day. However, we will be able to distinguish between assessments completed in response to a notification and those completed spontaneously.&#x000a0;At baseline, participants will be randomly allocated to one of two types of assessment strategies:</p></sec><sec id="s2c1k"><title>Retrospective plus momentary assessments</title><p>In this experimental manipulation, participants will be asked to complete a combination of retrospective assessments and momentary assessments.

The 6-month participation period will be calculated from the day on which the app is activated (ie, when participants enter their activation code and activate their account), and it will be divided into six intervals. All participants will receive the first notification 2 days after activating BrightSelf (ie, first assessment), while the use of the app is fresh within their minds and to give an idea of what to expect during the study. Subsequent assessment periods will be a random selection of six consecutive days within the 21&#x02013;35 days following the end of the previous assessment period (in order to avoid 12 days of continuous assessments).</p><p>The assessment period will be structured as follows:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Day 1: one retrospective assessment at any random time between 17:00 and 21:00</p></list-item><list-item><p>Days 2&#x02013;5: three momentary assessments per day, displayed at random times within each of the following intervals: 09:00&#x02013;12:00, 13:00&#x02013;16:00 and 17:00&#x02013;20:00</p></list-item><list-item><p>Day 6: one retrospective assessment at any random time between 17:00 and 21:00.</p></list-item></list>

This study will contribute to the growing body of evidence concerning the role of mobile technologies for the support of mental health. Similarly, it will generate baseline information concerning the acceptability of an EMA sampling protocol (in term of its duration, frequency and intensity) to women attending antenatal care. This study will also evaluate participant engagement with the technology and their adherence to a prespecified sampling protocol, both of which influence the completeness of the data needed by clinicians to inform their decisions. In addition, this study will identify some of the implementation issues that might arise when we attempt to deploy mobile technologies in clinical settings, which could affect their successful adoption.</p><p>In this work, we have maintained a focus on antenatal depression. Mental health during pregnancy, however, is more complex. Disorders such as anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder are also among the most common disorders during this period. Moreover, pregnant women who are exposed to certain risk factors or triggers (eg, domestic violence, social isolation, minority groups and low&#x000a0;income) are at increased risk of suffering from any of these mental health problems. Although we have not been able to focus on all these issues, we believe that the findings from this feasibility study will produce important lessons that could enable us to design and develop similar technologies and appropriate strategies. We aim to recruit participants from diverse backgrounds, and across multiple settings and geographical areas within England, and to focus on how such technologies can be embedded within existing antenatal care pathways, in order to support the existing patient&#x02013;midwife relationship.</p><p>The findings from this and from a previous feasibility study<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> will inform a larger trial evaluating the integration of mobile technologies into routine antenatal pathways, and their potential impact on clinical outcomes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e236" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2016-014469.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e237" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2016-014469.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><p>We would like to thank Professors Susan Ayers and Alexandra Thornton of&#x000a0;City University London, Joanna Girling and Marie O&#x02019;Connell of&#x000a0;West Middlesex Hospital, Tara Pauley and Charlotte Clayton of&#x000a0;Hinchingbrooke Hospital, Antoinette McNulty and Gemma Loebenberg of&#x000a0;the Northwest London CRN, and Dr Fiona Blake for their feedback on early versions of BrightSelf and the study protocol, and for their help with our patient and public involvement initiatives.
