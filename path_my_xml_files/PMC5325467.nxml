The health effects include heart disease, stroke, lung cancer, asthma exacerbation, other respiratory diseases, and ear infection (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Even brief exposure poses a risk to nonsmokers&#x02019; health (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>).</p><p>Disparities in SHS exposure have been documented for Korean residents in the United States (Korean Americans) and stem from high levels of smoking among men, many of whom emigrated from South Korea when men&#x02019;s smoking was the norm; for example, in 1998 66% of South Korean men smoked, and in 2010 48% smoked (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). In California, a third of Korean American nonsmokers reported exposure to SHS on a typical day in 2001 and 2002 (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>); more than two-thirds of nonsmokers reported having family members who smoked, and even more had friends and associates who smoked. Results from focus groups of Korean Americans indicate that SHS exposure bothered nonsmokers physically and emotionally (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), but avoidance was hindered by cultural norms such as avoiding conflict and respect for elders and male authority.</p><p>This study pilot tested an intervention to address the need for culturally acceptable SHS interventions for Korean Americans. Reaching Korean Americans can be challenging because of their lack of access to mainstream health care and limited English proficiency; in 2011, 55% of Korean Americans who spoke Korean at home did not speak English very well (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p><p>Korean churches are potential forums for health promotion for Korean Americans. Most Korean Americans (70%) attend Korean church (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) and prefer church settings or social networks for receiving health information (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Among the few health intervention studies involving Korean churches, most engaged in community-based participatory research and tested multifaceted screening programs (eg, mammography screening plus education, colorectal cancer screening education plus navigation assistance) (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). We describe the development and pilot testing of a church-based intervention for SHS exposure among Korean Americans.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study design and recruitment</title><p>This pilot study assessed feasibility for a cluster randomized design. Churches were randomized to the intervention or control condition. Study participants formed a cluster within each church. The pilot was approved by the institutional review board at San Diego State University. The study was conducted in San Diego County from 2009 to 2012.</p><p>From mid-2009 to mid-2010, the study team met with leaders of the 11 largest Korean churches (40 to &#x02265;900 members; 7 Presbyterian, 2 Baptist, 1 Catholic, and 1 nondenominational) on several occasions to discuss collaboration. They all agreed to participate in the study. We combined the 2 smallest Presbyterian churches and matched them and the other 9 churches on denomination similarity before randomization to treatment group.</p><p>In late 2010, study staff offered a voluntary, 2-page screening questionnaire in English and Korean to adults after a church service and announcement by the pastor, study church coordinator, or church team. The questionnaire requested a respondent&#x02019;s contact information and signature permitting contact by the study. Of 1,093 screening respondents, 253 met the following inclusion criteria: aged 18 years or older, of Korean descent, current nonsmoker, and SHS exposure of at least 1 cigarette per week. An additional criterion of not planning to move from the county in the next 6 months, which was determined at a baseline telephone interview, was applied before enrollment into the study. Research staff attempted telephone contact of eligible respondents sequentially by screening identification number within each church until we met our goal of at least 3 participants per church cluster and 30 participants per treatment group after attrition. Of 79 eligible screening respondents invited to participate in the trial, 2 refused (1 per group), and 77 enrolled. After 1 dropout per group (due to hectic schedules), 75 participants (35 in the control group, 40 in the intervention group) completed the study. The number of enrolled participants per church cluster ranged from 4 to 11. Researchers obtained verbal informed consent before the baseline interview and mailed a copy of the consent form to participants.</p></sec><sec><title>Intervention</title><p>
<bold>Intervention development.</bold> We used a community-based participatory research approach (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). During 2010, study staff and church teams (composed of 2 to 3 well-known and respected members from each church) collaborated on the intervention development. The study and church teams met several times to discuss the content and delivery of the different components of the intervention. They discussed findings from our research with Korean Americans (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), such as the sources of SHS exposure (mostly male smokers), nonsmokers&#x02019; concealed dislike of SHS, and nonsmokers&#x02019; lack of skills to circumvent exposure under the constraints of cultural norms, such as avoiding conflict to maintain harmony and respecting male or elder authority in the family. Before recruitment of churches began, researchers completed 15 in-person key informant interviews with leaders from the Korean church, radio, business, student, and health communities. The informants highlighted smoking as a major issue for their community, smokers&#x02019; difficulty in quitting, lack of access to Western medicine, and Koreans&#x02019; tendency to seek help or advice from their church, family, or Korean friends. To increase salience and acceptability, the intervention was designed for compatibility with Korean norms (eg, elder respect, group-mindedness), informed by previous research findings and input by church teams. The multilevel intervention incorporated individual and sociocultural factors, as recommended by the Behavioral Ecological Model (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). The multicomponent intervention was also loosely modeled after African American church-based diet interventions (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) and consisted of coaching, materials, and church activities, in both English and Korean. The intervention components were designed to be complementary in tackling the different contingencies and social dynamics of SHS exposure.</p><p>
<bold>Coaching.</bold> A bilingual (English/Korean) staff conducted 5 (approximately weekly) motivational interviewing sessions with enrolled individual participants by telephone. Coaches were trained in motivational interviewing techniques (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) (eg, open-ended questions, affirmation, reflective listening) with specific examples on SHS. Sessions averaged approximately 20 minutes. The coach tailored the session to the participant&#x02019;s situation and readiness level to reduce SHS exposure. The coach-guided goal-setting and strategies (eg, avoidance, environmental cues [displaying no-smoking signs and removing ashtrays]), which were reviewed at subsequent sessions.</p><p>
<bold>Materials.</bold> Enrolled participants received a binder containing information about SHS constituents and health-related effects and exercises to identify and align their values with reducing SHS exposure. The binder incorporated biblical scriptures with health themes. The binder also described strategies to reduce SHS in specific locations, including how to create a smoke-free home; how to avoid exposure in cars, at school, at work, in public spaces, and in other social settings; and how to encourage and support any smokers in their networks to quit smoking.</p><p>Participants received weekly diary worksheets (to document goals, strategies, and progress), study logo items (refrigerator magnet, magnetized pen, and reusable grocery bag), and coasters and no-smoking signs to display in locations of SHS exposure.</p><p>
<bold>Church activities.</bold> Study participants were encouraged by their coaches to attend an SHS informational group presentation and discussion led by the study church coordinator and a church team leader at their church. Most of the activities occurred in late 2010 and early 2011, after church services or during small group meetings and were announced in the church bulletin or at the church service. Church activities were open to the entire congregation to promote community awareness and support and to alter the social norms regarding SHS. The study church coordinator and a church team member introduced the study and led a PowerPoint (Microsoft Corp) or handout presentation and discussion of the constituents and health effects of SHS, why Koreans experience higher SHS exposure than other groups, and how to avoid SHS exposure in their daily lives. Church activities lasted 1 to 1.5 hours. Attendees were offered SHS brochures, quit-smoking guides, SHS stickers, reusable grocery bags, and insulated lunch bags with the SHS study logo as a reminder to protect themselves and to promote the educational theme in public, particularly outside Korean markets and businesses where smoking occurred.</p></sec><sec><title>Control condition</title><p>To increase participation and comparability between treatment conditions, control group participants received a fruit and vegetable (F&#x00026;V) intervention with similar components: 5 motivational interviewing coaching sessions, materials (binder, diary worksheets, magnet, pen, and bag), and church activities. The development process and timeline for the F&#x00026;V intervention was the same as described for the SHS intervention, but the content and logo pertained only to increasing F&#x00026;V intake.</p></sec><sec><title>Interviews</title><p>Trained bilingual research staff (other than coaches) conducted baseline and follow-up (within a week after coaching ended) telephone interviews with enrolled participants, in English or Korean. Interviews averaged 45 minutes. Participants received $10 and $30 for baseline and follow-up interviews, respectively. Participants reported demographic and other characteristics (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Both interviews asked about SHS attitudes, knowledge, and exposure.</p><table-wrap id="T1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Participants&#x02019; Baseline Characteristics, by Treatment Group, Study on Exposure to Secondhand Smoke Among Korean Americans, San Diego County, United States, 2009&#x02013;2012</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><col width="203" span="1"/><col width="81" span="1"/><col width="101" span="1"/><col width="72" span="1"/><col width="48" span="1"/><thead><tr><th valign="bottom" align="left" scope="col" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Characteristic</th><th valign="bottom" align="center" scope="col" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control (n = 35)</th><th valign="bottom" align="center" scope="col" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Intervention (n = 40)</th><th valign="bottom" align="center" scope="col" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Total (N = 75)</th><th valign="bottom" align="center" scope="col" rowspan="1" colspan="1">

To assess knowledge, participants were asked, &#x0201c;How many substances does cigarette smoke contain: less than 100, 100&#x02013;1,000, more than 1,000, or don&#x02019;t know?&#x0201d; They were also asked whether SHS causes heart disease. Weekly SHS exposure was estimated from reported frequency of exposure in the past month (never, 1&#x02013;3 times in past month, 1 to 2 times/wk, 3 to 4 times/wk, 5 to 6 times/wk, or daily), and the usual number of cigarettes on days exposed. To assess network smoking, participants specified categories of their network (eg, friends, coworkers, family) seen at least monthly. To assess SHS avoidance, participants indicated their response (ignore, hint, ask smoker to stop, or move) to someone smoking nearby. Participants identified who in their network smoked and who smoked in their presence. </p><p>Participants&#x02019; feedback was obtained at the follow-up interview. Participants reported whether their pastor&#x02019;s sermons or congregation members discussed smoking or SHS, whether they attended church activities, and whether activities were helpful. Participants rated their coaching sessions according to how easy it was to make time for sessions, the number of sessions, session length, whether the coach listened, the helpfulness of goal-setting, and the amount they learned. With regard to educational materials, participants reported whether they read their binder and used their pen, magnet, stickers, coaster, signs, or bag. Regarding the perceived effectiveness of the program, participants noted results from participating, their level of confidence to maintain results (very, somewhat, not very), what affected their goals, whether they encouraged anyone to quit smoking, and whether a smoker in their network tried to quit.</p></sec><sec><title>Evaluation</title><p>Process data were collected during each stage of the study (eg, contacts with churches, intervention development, screening, participant recruitment and retention, interview completion, coaching calls, and church activities). Feasibility of urine collection was assessed in the last 4 control and 4 intervention enrolled participants for the 7 days preceding baseline and follow-up interviews. Participants received urine collection kits and verbal and written instructions to collect a first morning urine sample on a Saturday, Sunday, or Monday (representing weekend SHS exposure) and another sample from Tuesday through Friday (representing nonweekend exposure). This schedule considered the half-life of cotinine, a metabolite of nicotine and a biomarker of SHS exposure (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Eight participants were recruited to provide a urine sample, and samples were retrieved from participants during a home visit.</p><p>Descriptive statistics for attitudes, knowledge, and SHS-related behaviors were analyzed using SPSS (version 22, IBM Corp).

Nearly all (95%) participants attended church activities. All attendees rated the activities as helpful.</p><p>Most participants (75%) found it easy to make time for their coaching sessions. Most (90%) rated the number and length of sessions as &#x0201c;just right.&#x0201d; For most participants (62%), the amount learned was sufficient, but for the rest it was too much. Everyone reported that the coach listened, and 97% found goal setting helpful. All participants in the intervention group read at least some of the binder materials and used the pen. Nearly everyone used the stickers and magnet, 85% used the bag, 72% used coasters, and 62% used the signs.</p><p>Regarding the perceived effectiveness of the intervention, participants were &#x0201c;very&#x0201d; confident (95%) or &#x0201c;somewhat&#x0201d; confident (5%) about maintaining results. Most participants (95%) had encouraged someone to quit smoking, 75% said that someone with whom they spent time had attempted to quit, and 10% said that someone had quit. Regarding achieving their goals, three-fourths of participants indicated that coaching helped, 15% mentioned the binder, and others mentioned a spouse&#x02019;s support or avoidance behaviors such as spending less time with network smokers. Common challenges were talking to a smoker who was a male family member (husband, father), a friend, fellow church member, coworker, boss, or customer. Benefits included learning about SHS and related health risks, increasing awareness of SHS, and skills to encourage smoking cessation and protect themselves.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This pilot study demonstrated feasibility for a faith-based, multilevel intervention for preventing exposure to SHS among Korean Americans. Changes in knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors were in the predicted direction. This pilot reiterates the importance of budgeting time and a study church coordinator to develop, coordinate, and sustain partnerships with churches. One year was needed to recruit churches and form collaboration. Ongoing contacts helped to maintain collaboration despite church leadership turnover in a few churches.</p><p>Data collection and urine collection were feasible and culturally appropriate assessment tools for this population. Screening at church sites provided credibility for the study and were efficient channels for recruitment. Using study staff with backgrounds similar to those of participants and study materials in Korean and English addressed participants&#x02019; language needs.</p><p>SHS exposure is influenced by physiological, environmental, and cultural factors. Previous surveys of Korean Americans show that social reprimand discouraged smoking (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). In this study, the link between physical and spiritual health was embraced by the church leaders and congregants. Involving church peers was important. Church activities were well-attended by study participants and fellow churchgoers and stimulated discussions and social support for not smoking. In addition, most pastors mentioned SHS-related health messages in their sermons as part of their mission.</p><p>Intervention effect was achieved across multiple domains &#x02014; attitudes, knowledge, and exposure (improvement from 18% to 55% for attitudes and knowledge and an 8.5 cigarette/wk reduction in SHS exposure among intervention participants). For comparison, there are few, if any, other intervention research activities that have focused on reducing SHS exposure among adult nonsmokers; most of the previous SHS interventions have targeted children&#x02019;s exposure, pregnant women (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), adult smoking cessation, hospitalized patients, or household smoking bans.</p><p>Areas for refinement for this study include participants&#x02019; finding time for coaching, reducing the information content or making it more relatable, and increasing assertiveness skills, eg, adding role-playing with multiple strategies and sample &#x0201c;responses&#x0201d; for when a relative or friend smokes near them.</p><p>This study had limitations. This pilot study was not designed to test hypotheses for the outcomes measures; the estimates should be interpreted with caution as they may be unreliable or biased due to the small sample and self-reported data. Although adult-reported exposure is used commonly and has shown moderate reliability and validity (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>), corroboration with a biomarker such as urine cotinine is recommended for full trials. In this pilot, asking participants about each category of network smoking and smoking in the participant&#x02019;s presence was used as an aid in recalling the instances and amount of SHS exposure.</p><p>Overall, the study results are promising for reducing SHS exposure and warrant further research to test the efficacy of this culturally appropriate approach and intervention.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was supported by the Flight Attendant Medical Research Institute (FAMRI).
