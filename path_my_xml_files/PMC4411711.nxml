Thus, nutritional supplementation that supports the immune system could complement resistance exercise as an intervention for age-associated muscle loss. The current study will determine the relationship between immune function and exercise training outcomes for older adults who consume a nutritional supplement or placebo during resistance training and post-training follow-up. The supplement was chosen due to evidence suggesting its ingredients [arginine (Arg), glutamine (Gln), and &#x003b2;-hydroxy &#x003b2;-methylbutyrate (HMB)] can improve immune function, promote muscle growth, and counteract muscle loss.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>Veterans (age 60 to 80&#x000a0;yrs, N&#x02009;=&#x02009;50) of the United States military will participate in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial of consumption of a nutritional supplement or placebo during completion of three study objectives: 1) determine if 2&#x000a0;weeks of supplementation improve immune function measured as the response to vaccination and systemic and cellular responses to acute resistance exercise; 2) determine if supplementation during 36 sessions of resistance training boosts gains in muscle size, strength, and function; and 3) determine if continued supplementation for 26&#x000a0;weeks post-training promotes retention of training-induced gains in muscle size, strength, and function. Analyses of the results for these objectives will determine the relationship between immune function and the training outcomes. Participants will undergo nine blood draws and five muscle (vastus lateralis) biopsies so that the effects of the supplement on immune function and the systemic and cellular responses to exercise can be measured.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Exercise has known effects on immune function. However, the study will attempt to modulate immune function using a nutritional supplement and determine the effects on training outcomes. The study will also examine post-training benefit retention, an important issue for older adults, usually omitted from exercise studies.

Resistance exercise training can be an effective intervention for improving muscle mass, strength, and function in older adults, but the magnitude of benefit varies considerably among individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. This suggests that older adults with less adaptive potential will have greater muscle loss due to aging and that their rehabilitation will be less effective. Thus, a better understanding of the effects of aging on the cellular and biochemical mechanisms controlling muscle health may be needed to design interventions (for example, nutritional supplementation) that complement resistance training. Specifically, this protocol will determine whether immune function influences muscle adaptation to resistance exercise and whether the influence is affected by a nutritional supplement (Arg, Gln, and HMB), whose ingredients appear capable of improving immune function, promoting muscle growth, and counteracting muscle loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. A randomized controlled trial is being conducted in which older adults consume a nutritional supplement or placebo during a resistance training program and post-training period in order to determine if the supplement improves immune function, boosts muscle adaptation to training, and supports post-training retention of the exercise-derived benefits (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>

The study will investigate the effects of nutritional supplementation on variables for humoral, innate, and adaptive immune functions and determine their relationship to exercise training outcomes. With aging, the antibody response to vaccination is weaker and wanes sooner over time, meaning that older adults may not possess protective antibody titers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. T-cells and monocytes have a diminished ability to proliferate and CD4+ helper t-cells, the CD8+ suppressor t-cells, and other t-cell subsets become imbalanced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. These changes increase susceptibility to infectious disease but may also indicate that other systemic problems exist that may specifically affect muscle. Acute increases in plasma pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines after acute exercise are thought to initiate muscle repair of damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], and repetition of this immune response through training is thought to be involved in muscle adaptation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, with aging, acute responsiveness gives way to chronic inflammation that may be detrimental to muscle. In rats, cytokine infusion suppresses protein synthesis and induces muscle catabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In humans, elevated cytokines are associated with sarcopenia and functional decline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Thus, systemic differences in immune parameters (for example, response to vaccine, t-cell phenotype, or cytokine levels) between older adults may reflect the individual ability to maintain or improve muscle health despite aging.</p><p>Specific cells of the immune system, that is, macrophages, appear to play an important role in muscle hypertrophy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Macrophages are thought to transition between three functional phases in response to unaccustomed exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Phase 1 is an inflammatory response mediated by systemic and local cytokines, such as IL1&#x003b2; and TNF&#x003b1;, which initiate muscle repair. Macrophages, termed M1 macrophages, produce these pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines to recruit additional macrophages to remove cellular debris from damaged myofibers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. After this initial cleanup, M2 macrophages function in Phase 2, which includes the downregulation of inflammation by anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1RA and IL10, so that secondary damage does not occur. This allows muscle tissue to become conducive to growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In the regenerative Phase 3, macrophage arginine metabolism increases and its byproducts promote cell growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Growth factors such as IGF1 are produced to further stimulate myogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Satellite cells proliferate and fuse with existing fibers so that the added myonuclei can support an increase in fiber size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. However, muscle injury is not necessary for macrophage stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Thus, in the absence of damage, or as muscle adapts to training, macrophages may be predominantly dedicated to producing growth factors required for muscle maintenance or hypertrophy.</p><p>Evidence from animal and human studies suggests that the immune system and macrophages influence muscle mass and strength during health and aging. In animals, experimental reduction of muscle macrophage content decreases the ability of muscle to hypertrophy and recover from atrophy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The effects were related to decreased macrophage provision of the growth factor IGF1 and decreased satellite cell differentiation, myonuclear addition, and muscle fiber growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In humans, muscle mass and strength gain are also associated with increases in muscle satellite cells, fiber nuclei, and fiber size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]; and these adaptations to exercise are diminished in older adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Inflammation may have contributed to those findings. In a training study of older adults, individuals consuming anti-inflammatory drugs gained significantly more muscle mass and strength than those consuming placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Our studies also indicate that immune function influences the response to exercise. The muscle cross-sectional area and strength gained by older adults from resistance training showed a strong positive correlation with muscle expression of specific pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and growth factors including IGF1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Muscle macrophage content pre-training in those older adults was also strongly correlated with pretraining growth factor levels (R&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.96, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c;0.001) and post-training strength gain (R&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.99, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c;0.001) (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). These results suggest that macrophages may be regulated by cytokines during exercise and provide growth factors that promote the adaptation of muscle cells and fibers, which leads to mass and strength gains. Thus, consumption of a nutritional supplement that either dampens a negative or boosts a positive effect of inflammation and immune function could benefit older adults during exercise training.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>

M1 macrophages are regulated primarily by NFkB in response to systemic pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF&#x003b1; and IL1&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. M1 macrophages then may be responsible for production of cytokines, which block FOXO phosphorylation and lead to increased transcription of the ubiquitin ligases, MuRF and MAFbx, which control protein degradation and can lead to muscle atrophy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Macrophage conversion to M2 function is driven by and results in production of anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL10 and CCL18, through the activation of STAT3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. These macrophages strongly support tissue growth, as was originally characterized due to the poor prognosis associated with their presence in tumors. M2 macrophages may be a source of IGF1, which promotes muscle health by blocking the FOXO pathway and stimulating the PI3K and MAPK signaling cascades. Activation or blockage of factors within these pathways results in obvious effects on muscle. For example, constitutive AKT signaling results in muscle growth; whereas deletion of the S6K results in muscle atrophy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Examination of these pathways in human muscle is limited to date, and further investigation is warranted. A model for how these signaling pathways, macrophage function, and cytokines and growth factors hypothetically integrate to control muscle health (that is, adaptation and performance) in the context of aging, nutritional supplementation, and exercise is presented in Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>
<bold>Proposed model for how a nutritional supplement promotes a shift in immune system function in older adults from a pro-inflammatory state (both at rest and in response to a bout of exercise) towards a state in which inflammation is dampened so that muscle growth in response to exercise training is supported.</bold> The supplement is proposed to augment muscle adaptation and performance gains from resistance training by altering macrophage and muscle cell phenotype through specific cytokines, growth factors, and signaling pathways.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2015_631_Fig3_HTML" id="MO3"/></fig></p><p>A nutritional supplement that affects immune function may improve the ability for older adults to reap and retain the benefits of resistance training. The supplement ingredients (Arg, Gln, and HMB) are used for nutritional support during conditions associated with muscle wasting or requiring tissue regeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. These ingredients have shown success in slowing cachexia and increasing fat-free body mass in both cancer and AIDS patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The ingredients also increased fat-free mass, strength, and muscle function after 12&#x000a0;weeks of consumption by elderly women. They are also commonly used to increase muscle mass and strength in combination with resistance exercise for sports performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Despite this success, little is known about the mechanism of action. HMB may work by altering protein synthesis, but it also enhances humoral immune function at least in animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Glutamine and arginine are considered immuno-nutrients. They affect immune cells including lymphocytes, T-cells, and macrophages by altering cell phenotype, proliferation, and production of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Thus, the supplement or its ingredients are used to support muscle health in the extreme conditions of cachexia and sports performance, and numerous effects on immune function have been identified. For these reasons, conduct of a randomized controlled trial of this particular supplement offers an opportunity for a mechanistic investigation of the relationship between immune function and muscle adaptation to exercise in older adults.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Study objectives</title><p>The objectives of this trial are as follows:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Determine the effects of nutritional supplement consumption by older adults on the humoral response to vaccination and specific cellular immune responses to an acute resistance exercise stimulus.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Determine if nutritional supplement consumption affects the adaptive responses to resistance exercise training at the whole body or cellular level.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Determine if nutritional supplement consumption affects the retention of benefits of exercise during post-training follow-up.</p></list-item></list></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Human subject participation</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Trial summary</title><p>Subjects will participate in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial of a nutritional supplement (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).

Blood will be collected at baseline and 1 and 2-weeks post-immunization to determine the effects of the supplement on the humoral response. Two post-vaccination time-points were chosen in case the response is delayed in older adults relative to the response in younger adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. If needed to accommodate scheduling, the supplementation period may be extended and the two post-vaccination blood draws may be delayed by one day if necessary.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Resistance exercise</title><p>The study will use a resistance exercise routine that we have previously used to elicit cellular and molecular responses in muscle associated with immune function and to improve muscle mass and strength of the thigh for older adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. The resistance exercise program will use three exercises to strengthen the thigh muscles, including bilateral knee extension, knee curl, and leg press. Exercises will be completed on air-driven exercise equipment (Keiser, Fresno, CA) in a seated position and always supervised by a study team member. Strength testing will utilize the 1-repetition maximum (1RM) test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. A brief warm-up period will include 10&#x000a0;minutes of mild aerobic activity on a cycle ergometer. For each exercise, approximately six repetitions of lifting warm up will be completed at a &#x02018;somewhat heavy&#x02019; (that is, approximately 65% 1RM) load. The load will then be gradually (approximately 5 to 10%) increased such that the maximum capability for lifting is reached in approximately ten total repetitions. Subjects will rest 60&#x000a0;seconds between repetitions after the warm up. Subjects rest 5&#x000a0;minutes prior to the next test completed in the order of press, curl, and extension. Subjects will complete one introduction to the exercise session and undergo strength testing twice during the first 2&#x000a0;weeks of participation. Subjects will then have at least 2&#x000a0;weeks of rest prior to the unaccustomed exercise sessions. The purpose of this rest period is to mitigate any possible effects on the muscle tissue analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Unaccustomed exercise sessions</title><p>Prior to exercise training, the study will measure the response to single bouts of the training exercises before and after two weeks of nutritional supplementation (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). The unaccustomed exercise session will be the same as each session completed for exercise training as described below. The response to exercise will be measured using both muscle and blood. The pre-exercise biopsy time points will be prior to exercise, possibly the same day or a different day, based on scheduling and/or the judgment of the study physician. The post-exercise time points for collection are 72&#x000a0;hrs for muscle and 1&#x000a0;hr for blood. Our studies have previously shown that 72&#x000a0;hrs is better than 24&#x000a0;hours for measuring the immune variables of interest in muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The 1&#x000a0;hr time point for blood collection is based on other studies that have determined the effects of exercise on systemic measures of immune function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Exercise training sessions</title><p>The training program will have subjects perform supervised exercise for approximately an hour three times per week on nonconsecutive days. The program consists of 36 exercise sessions that will optimally take 12&#x000a0;weeks though the total time will likely be longer due to scheduling based on the needs of the subject or the study team. The exercise load will be based on the subject 1RM. After a light cycling warm up, subjects will perform four sets of each exercise at loads of 60, 70, 75, and 80% of their measured capability. Strength is retested at every sixth session to account for strength gain in maintaining the work load. On days of testing, the strength test replaces the first of the four exercise sets. Strength is also tested twice prior to training, at the final training bout, and twice during the post-training follow-up period. Training sessions consist of three sets of ten repetitions for each exercise and a fourth set completed at voluntary failure to complete a repetition. Subjects will rest approximately 2&#x000a0;minutes between each set and approximately 5&#x000a0;minutes between exercises. Exceptions to the plan for each subject to complete 36 exercise training sessions may be necessary on a case-by-case basis in order to ensure that the final muscle biopsy of the protocol, needed for assessment of muscle adaptation, occurs 72&#x000a0;hours (3&#x000a0;days) after the final exercise training session. After each exercise session or as needed during exercise, subjects will be guided through stretching of the quadriceps, hamstrings, and other affected muscles.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Post-training follow-up</title><p>The subjects will remain in the study after completion of the training program for 26 additional weeks. The retention of muscle mass, strength, and function will be examined relative to continued daily consumption of supplement or placebo (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Subjects will be required to refrain from strength training of the thighs (that is, weight lifting, body weight exercise, and elastic bands) during this period. It is acceptable for subjects to participate in other forms of exercise such as walking. Compliance with these and study dietary requirements will be monitored by subject query at monthly visits during the follow-up period. These visits are also required for dispensing of product from the pharmacy and monitoring of consumption compliance.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Functional assessments</title><p>Functional assessment data will be collected at four times during the protocol: pre-training, post-training, during post-training follow-up, and at end of the post-training follow-up (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Four assessments of muscle function will be performed. The Berg Balance Scale will be used to detect balance impairments in older adults while the individual is static or performing various movements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. The Six Minute Walk Test will be used to measure mobility performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. The subjects will perform a supervised timed walk on a 200-foot track at a pace without encouragement and that allows speech without shortness of breath. The Gait Speed will be measured as habitual walking speed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. The subjects will walk at their normal preferred pace for 14 meters though only the middle 10 meters are timed. The result is an average of three replicates. Subjects will also complete the Timed Up and Go test. The test is indicative of balance and mobility by a measuring the time required for the subject to rise from a chair, walk 3 meters, turn around, walk back to the chair, and sit down [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Muscle cross-sectional area</title><p>Muscle size will be determined by the hospital imaging service using a CT scan of the mid-thigh of the dominant leg at three time points during the protocol: pre-training, post-training, and at end of the post-training follow-up (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Subjects will rest in a supine position for 30&#x000a0;minutes prior being precisely positioned in the scanner. The CT image will then be taken at the midpoint between the inguinal fold and proximal pole of the patella, along the femur. A blinded analysis of the scans will be completed using Slice-O-Matic software (Montreal, Canada) to discern between Hounsfield units for bone (+1000), fat (-190 to -30), and normal (40 to 100) and low (0 to 30) density muscle.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Muscle biopsy and blood draws</title><p>Subjects will undergo five muscle biopsies and nine blood draws in order to assess the effects of nutritional supplementation on immune function and cellular measures of muscle adaptation (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), though blood will also be used to assess subject eligibility and safety. Muscle tissue will be obtained from each subject by needle biopsy of the vastus lateralis (outer thigh) by a study physician. The procedure is performed after local anesthetic (bicarbonate buffered lidocaine) is used to numb the site. A small incision will be made in the skin and a Bergstrom needle will be inserted briefly into the muscle so that suction and closing of the needle can be used to obtain 100 to 200&#x000a0;mg of muscle. Direct pressure will be applied to stop the bleeding and the wound will be closed and covered with a pressure bandage. Pre-exercise biopsies will be taken from the dominant leg while post-exercise biopsies will be taken from the nondominant leg. Blood draws will be performed by a study phlebotomist or unit nurse. The blood will most likely be drawn from the antecubital vein (&#x02264;60&#x000a0;ml or 2&#x000a0;oz).

The study has eligibility criteria that have been precisely defined to ensure enrollment of subjects who possess an appropriate risk/benefit ratio (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Safety monitoring will be performed from enrollment until at least 30&#x000a0;days postparticipation for each subject. Monitoring occurs by query of the patient medical record and subject self-report or exam at each research visit, as well as during telephone contacts. Expected adverse events are listed in the informed consent document and will be monitored for, as will serious adverse events and unexpected adverse events possibly related to participation. Appropriate action relative to the severity of the event will be taken by the study team immediately when an event is identified. This may range from documentation by the coordinator (for example, mild muscle soreness) to safety examination by the study physician (for example, elevated blood pressure after exercise). The study procedures (for example, exercise or supplementation) will be halted at any time a safety concern is identified. Halted procedures will not resume until the concern has been alleviated. If concerns cannot be alleviated, then the study physicians may rule to withdraw the subject, modify the protocol, suspend enrollment, or halt the study. This is a relatively small single-site study, which allows decisions to be made in real-time as problems occur, rather than after aggregate data collection and interim analysis. Adverse events will be reported in compliance with IRB policy.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Research laboratory analyses</title><sec id="Sec19"><title>Blood measures</title><p>Plasma and monocytes derived from blood draws at the time points listed in the Statistical Plan section will be used to measure four types of variables related to immune function (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>):<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>The responses to vaccination against tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis will be assessed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays to measure antibody titers to the vaccine antigens (IBL International, Toronto, Ontario).</p></list-item><list-item><p>The study will determine if 2&#x000a0;weeks of supplementation increases the ratio of na&#x000ef;ve helper (CD4+) to cytotoxic (CD8+) T-cells at rest or in response to acute exercise.

With that approach, the 29% increase corresponds to an effect size of 0.8 SD units (mean/SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.128/0.159). Similar results were found using data suggesting that CRP levels decreases in older adults after supplementation. The effect size for change in CRP is 0.85 SD units (mean/SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.665/0.780 for log-transformed data). Having 20 subjects per group will provide 80% power to detect a mean shift of 0.8 to 0.85 SD units at a significance level of 5% for the following Objective 1 hypotheses:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>The response to vaccination will be greater in the supplement than the placebo group.

The representative response measure for this objective is post-training percent increase in muscle strength. In a similar study, Trappe <italic>et al</italic>. sought to improve strength gain by resistance training plus drug treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The drug treatment group gained significantly more strength by 25.1% than the group receiving placebo (26.4% versus 21.1%, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c;0.05). Our previous findings indicate that older subjects completing a 12-week training program but not taking supplements will experience an average strength gain of 25&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;8% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. If treatment with the proposed supplement improves strength similarly to the Trappe drug treatment, subjects in the supplement group will improve strength by an average of 31% (that is, 25.1% greater than those of the placebo group). This translates to an approximate effect size of 0.8 SD units (0.25*0.251/0.08) if variances are pooled for the groups compared. With 20 subjects per group, there will be 80% power to detect a mean shift of 0.8 SD units using a significance level of 5% for the Objective 2 hypotheses:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>The amount of strength gained from resistance training will be greater in the supplement than the placebo group.

The representative response measure for this objective is the strength gain retained during long-term follow-up after exercise training is completed. Lemmer <italic>et al</italic>. observed an average gain in muscle strength of 27% (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c;0.01) in older men after strength training, which is similar to the 25% gain in our study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. However, at 31&#x000a0;weeks of post-training follow-up, strength had decreased to be about 9% above the pretraining levels. Assuming the same level of variation among our subjects in retention of strength gain as the observed 8% SD for our study, then a 0.8 SD effect size would be about 6.4% (0.8*0.08), translating to our supplement group retaining strength of 12.4% above pretraining levels. With 20 subjects per group, there will be 80% power to detect a mean shift of 0.8 SD units using a significance level of 5%. If the SD for retention of strength is smaller than 8%, then the study will have higher power to detect the same difference or equal power to detect smaller differences for the following Objective 3 hypotheses:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>The change in strength during the detraining period will be smaller in the supplement than the placebo group.

The study is unique in that while exercise is known to have clear effects on immune function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>], little is known about the effects of immune function on individual ability to benefit from exercise. This is because few studies have altered immune function and determined the effects on training outcomes. The proposed study will attempt to do this using a nutritional supplement known to support muscle health. The supplement&#x02019;s mechanism of action is unknown, but the ingredients alter measures of immune function that will be measured by the study. The study will also examine detraining, an important issue for older adults that is often omitted from training studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. The study will evaluate a nutritional intervention as a complement to exercise for improving muscle health during aging, but the results may only be immediately applicable to relatively healthy older white males due to the stringency of the exclusion criteria and the racial and gender makeup for 60 to 80&#x000a0;year old U.S. veterans. Thus, follow-up studies in other populations, particularly those in need of muscle rehabilitation, may be warranted and necessary. The study also has the potential to advance our understanding of the mechanisms of muscle gain and loss in older adults. Granted, the proposed model (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) is an ambitious investigation and an oversimplification of the cellular and molecular determinants of muscle phenotype. To overcome this limitation, the study has been approved to allow flexibility in the specific methods and measures of immune function in muscle or blood for practical or scientific reasons and not be considered a protocol deviation so long as the measure 1) addresses a molecular or cellular trait potentially impacted by aging and muscle health or the improvements of muscle health by supplementation or exercise; 2) is not genetic testing; and 3) the results will not be communicated back to the subjects or used to influence their medical care in any way.</p><p>In conclusion, a randomized controlled trial of nutritional supplement use by older adults during resistance exercise training and post-training follow-up will be conducted. The individual benefits and potential scientific advancement far outweigh the risks of participation. High intensity training can be safely performed with benefit by older adults including nursing home residents over 90&#x000a0;years of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. However, the magnitude of the response to training varies significantly even between young and healthy individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Considering this interindividual variation, complementary interventions such as nutritional supplementation and a better understanding of the role of immune function in muscle adaptation to training and detraining may be valuable in optimizing preventative and rehabilitative exercise programs for older adults.</p><p>Thus, the importance of the scientific knowledge to be gained is also high. The risks of exercise, the supplement ingredients, and percutaneous muscle biopsy are relatively low compared to the possibility that targeting the immune system may be the advantage needed for certain older adults to successfully maintain or restore the mass, strength, and function that is necessary for personal independence, health, and quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Trial status</title><p>The study has been active and open for recruitment since 5 August 2014.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ARG</term><def><p>arginine</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GLN</term><def><p>glutamine</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HMB</term><def><p>&#x003b2;-Hydroxy-&#x003b2;-methylbutyrate</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RM</term><def><p>repetition maximum</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TDAP</term><def><p>tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VA</term><def><p>Veterans Affairs</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.
