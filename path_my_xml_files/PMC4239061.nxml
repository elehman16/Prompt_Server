A distinctive characteristic of impaired walking performance among older adults is a 15&#x02013;20% greater metabolic cost for walking (worse economy) compared to young adults <xref rid="pone.0113471-Martin1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0113471-Ortega1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Several factors are known to determine the metabolic cost of walking in humans across all ages. These major biomechanical factors include the costs associated with: supporting body weight, performing mechanical work, leg swing and balance <xref rid="pone.0113471-Ortega1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0113471-Gottschall1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Studies investigating age-related biomechanical determinants of walking cost have found that older adults have a similar cost of balance and perform a similar amount, or even less, external mechanical work during walking as young adults <xref rid="pone.0113471-Ortega1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113471-Franz1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113471-Mian1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Despite these similarities, other studies suggest that a decrease in muscular efficiency and an increase in antagonist leg muscle co-activation, contribute to the greater cost of walking in both healthy sedentary and active older adults <xref rid="pone.0113471-Martin1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113471-Ortega1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113471-Ortega3" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113471-Mian1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113471-Malatesta1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Yet, no study has found a sole mechanical determinant that accounts for the 15&#x02013;20% greater metabolic cost of walking in older adults. Therefore, interventions for improving walking economy in older age have been elusive.</p><p>Recent studies by Thomas et al. <xref rid="pone.0113471-Thomas1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> and Malatesta et al. <xref rid="pone.0113471-Malatesta2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> show that vigorous walking interval training effectively reduces the metabolic cost of walking in older adults by as much as 20%. Yet, the mechanisms for the decreases were not elucidated. Conversely, a generalized year-long training program that included resistance, aerobic and balance exercises had no effect on post-training walking economy in older adults <xref rid="pone.0113471-Mian2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. The different effects of these exercise interventions, high intensity aerobic versus generalized exercise with only a moderate aerobic component, suggest higher intensity aerobic activities may mitigate the typical age-related decrease in walking economy, and consequently, preserve mobility into older age.</p><p>In contrast, running economy does not exhibit the same age-related trend as walking economy. Two studies have reported that adults (45&#x02013;61 years) who consistently participated in running exercise retain a similar metabolic economy of running as young runners (23&#x02013;27 years) <xref rid="pone.0113471-Quinn1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113471-Trappe1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Although these results seem to support the hypothesis that vigorous aerobic exercise mitigates the decline in locomotion economy, i.e. metabolic cost of running and walking, it is also possible that a decline in running economy does not occur until late into the 6<sup>th</sup> decade of life, as observed with walking economy <xref rid="pone.0113471-Prince1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Perhaps the subjects in these studies <xref rid="pone.0113471-Quinn1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113471-Trappe1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> were not &#x0201c;old&#x0201d; enough to exhibit declines in locomotion economy. Another possible explanation is that running economy, unlike walking economy, is simply not affected by age. However, since these running studies did not measure walking economy, it remains unclear if regular participation in running exercise mitigates the typical age-related deterioration of walking economy.</p><p>Our purpose was to determine if and how regular participation in walking or running exercise affects the metabolic cost and biomechanics of walking in older adults. We hypothesized that older runners would consume less metabolic energy for walking than older walkers. Further, we also investigated whether the two groups demonstrate different walking biomechanics. We measured metabolic rates, ground reaction forces and spatio-temporal stride variables of two groups, older walkers and older runners, while they walked on a dual-belt, force-sensing treadmill at three speeds.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Subjects</title><p>Thirty healthy older adults (15 males and 15 female) who either walk (4 Male, 11 Female) or run (10 Male, 5 Female) regularly for exercise volunteered. <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0113471-t001">Table 1</xref> summarizes the anthropometric characteristics of the subjects.

In the second session, at least five days following the first session, we measured standing metabolic rate and familiarized the subjects to treadmill walking. For the treadmill familiarization, subjects walked on a dual-belt, force-instrumented treadmill (FIT, Bertec Corporation, Columbus, OH, USA) at three speeds (0.75, 1.25 and 1.75 m/s) for at least 7 minutes at each speed. These speeds correspond to 1.67, 2.80, 3.91 MPH. Thus, subjects completed a minimum of 21 minutes total of walking familiarization.

To determine if difference in metabolic cost and GRF was related to sex differences in our runner and walker groups, we examined differences in metabolic cost, ground reaction forces and spatio-temporal stride variables due to sex among each group and analyzed difference in metabolic cost, GRFs and spatio-temproal stride variables using sex as a covariate. We found no effect of sex on any dependent variable and differences between runners and walkers were not affected by sex. We performed all statistical analyses using SPSS 21.0 (SPSS, Inc.) software. In addition to our comparison between older walkers and runners, we used a mixed-model repeated-measures ANOVA (p&#x0003c;.05) to make further post-hoc comparisons of gross metabolic cost in walkers and runners collected in the present study to data for young and older sedentary adults previously collected in our lab at similar speeds <xref rid="pone.0113471-Ortega1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.

In support of our hypothesis, older runners consumed less metabolic energy for walking than older walkers. Although the older runners consumed less metabolic energy for walking than the older walkers, the two groups had almost identical walking biomechanics.</p><p>Given that there were virtually no differences in walking biomechanics between the older walkers and runners, other factors must underlie the lower cost of walking observed for the older runners. One factor may be muscle co-activation. Older adults, both sedentary and active walkers, use 30&#x02013;50% greater co-activation of antagonist leg muscles compared to young adults <xref rid="pone.0113471-Ortega2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113471-Mian1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113471-Franz2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. It has been suggested that older adults may use greater co-activation to increase joint stiffness and the stabilization of the body, thus reducing the risk of walking related falls <xref rid="pone.0113471-Finley1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Yet, increased co-activation has been associated with increased metabolic cost of walking in older adults <xref rid="pone.0113471-Ortega2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113471-Mian1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. It is possible that older runners are able to maintain a lower metabolic cost of walking compared to older walkers because they use less antagonist leg muscle activation. Some research shows that older adults who participated in a lower limb strength training program reduce leg muscle co-activation by 5&#x02013;10% <xref rid="pone.0113471-Hakkinen1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Perhaps, by regularly running three or more times per week for 30 minutes per bout, older runners are able to maintain or even increase leg muscle strength and reduce co-activation. However, a decrease in co-activation associated with running that is similar in magnitude to the decrease observed after strength training is likely not sufficient to explain the 7&#x02013;10% difference in metabolic cost of walking. It is also possible that other neuromuscular factors such as widening of EMG/motoneuronal bursts <xref rid="pone.0113471-Monaco1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> may also help to explain the difference in metabolic cost between older runners and walkers.</p><p>Better muscular efficiency may also help explain why older runners have a lower metabolic cost of walking than older walkers. Aging has been associated with reduced muscular efficiency <xref rid="pone.0113471-Mian1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113471-Amara1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. More specifically, mitochondrial dysfunction associated with the uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation (reduced ATP synthesis per O<sub>2</sub> uptake) effectively reduces muscular efficiency and increased the metabolic cost of muscle activation <xref rid="pone.0113471-Amara1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Interestingly, recent evidence suggests that aerobic exercise training may ameliorate mitochondrial uncoupling and improve muscular efficiency in older adults <xref rid="pone.0113471-Conley1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>.</p><p>Perhaps studies of cycling efficiency in older adults can provide insight. In contrast to the effects of running we have observed, the muscular efficiency of cycling declines with age despite regular cycling exercise <xref rid="pone.0113471-Sacchetti1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. More recently, Brisswalter et al. <xref rid="pone.0113471-Brisswalter1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> measured the cycling efficiency of active triathletes (who regularly swim, bike, and run for exercise) across age-groups and found a decline in cycling efficiency past the 5<sup>th</sup> decade. These data suggest that older cyclist and triathletes are unable to maintain muscular efficiency with age. However, Peiffer et al. <xref rid="pone.0113471-Peiffer1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> found no difference in cycling efficiency between their youngest age group (39&#x000b1;3 years) and their oldest (65&#x000b1;4 years). Intriguingly, their oldest training group cycled 58 km more per week (359 km per week) than the youngest group. Possibly the greater quantity of aerobic cycling exercise mitigated the decrease in muscular efficiency with age.</p><p>Alternatively, the intensity of exercise may hold the key to maintaining or improving muscular efficiency. Two prior studies have found that 6&#x02013;7 weeks of vigorous aerobic exercise (fast walking) that elicits a heart rate close to the ventilatory threshold can improve walking economy by 8&#x02013;20% <xref rid="pone.0113471-Thomas1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113471-Malatesta2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. More vigorous aerobic exercise such as walking uphill, fast walking or running may be required to elicit improvement in walking economy. Clinicians and others who work with older adults to improve their fitness may need to prescribe more vigorous, more prolonged and/or more frequent aerobic exercise to prevent the decline in walking performance. To test this hypothesis and help guide clinicians, a future study should investigate the effects of different intensity aerobic exercises on muscular efficiency and more specifically, the economy of walking.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Limitations</title><p>One limitation of the current study is the cross-sectional design. It is possible that older runners may not be economical walkers because of the effect of running exercise but rather they run because they are more economical in their locomotion. To better address this issue, a future study might quantify the longitudinal effects of a running training program. One such study conducted by Trappe et al. <xref rid="pone.0113471-Trappe1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> on the longitudinal effect of running exercise on running economy spanned 22 years. In that study, Trappe et al. <xref rid="pone.0113471-Trappe1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> showed that running economy did not decline in older adults who maintained their health and fitness over the 22 year period, whereas runners who became unfit had worse running economy. Although these results suggest that running may help to prevent a decline in running economy, Trappe et al. <xref rid="pone.0113471-Trappe1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> did not measure walking economy.</p><p>Another potential limitation of the current study is the different numbers of male and female participants in each group. Although the sex difference may have influenced the difference in anthropometrics between runners and walker, our results showed no main effect of sex on walking economy (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.211) and no sex difference in walking economy among older runners (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.131) or older walkers (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.331). Based on post-hoc power analysis, it is clear that we did not have sufficient statistical power to detect sex differences that might exist but that would require &#x0223c;300 subjects. However, when treated as covariates, sex and anthropometrics did not statistically account for the difference in walking economy between runners and walkers. Thus, while it would have been preferable to have a larger sample size with more similar sex and anthropometric matched cohorts, it would not have changed our overall conclusion.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Future Studies</title><p>Based on the results of this study and others, future studies of the effect of age and exercise on walking economy are warranted. Although the average age of our runners and walkers was 69 years, a future study might look to see if running exercise continues to prevent or slow the decline in walking economy in even older runners (over the age of 80 years). It seems plausible that at some age that exercise may not be able to sufficiently offset the normal decline in muscular efficiency and walking economy associated with aging. It is also not known whether there is an intensity threshold of aerobic exercise that is needed to prevent the decline in walking economy. Thus, it would be beneficial for future studies to investigate the relative effect of exercises with different levels of aerobic intensity on walking economy.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, older runners mitigate the age-related deterioration of walking economy. However, older walkers are unable to forestall the decline of walking economy as they require the same metabolic consumption as sedentary older adults. The difference in walking economy between older runners and older walkers remains unexplained due to no substantial differences found in either the kinetic or spatio-temporal data between the groups. Other factors such as decreased muscle co-activation and/or increased muscular efficiency may contribute to the superior walking economy exhibited by the older runners.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0113471-Himann1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
