		<p>The most appropiate management for bronchial asthma is the control
of airway inflammation. Corticosteroids are the most effective
anti-inflammatory drugs available, but they have a number of side
effects; most of these are dose-dependent. In children, asthma
control should be accomplished with low steroid doses possibly given
by inhalation. In a double-bind placebo-controlled crossover study a
group of children with mild to moderate asthma received NED 16
mg/day or BDP 400 &#x003bc;g/day. Values for FEV<sub>1</sub>, PEF, symptoms use
ofbronchodilators overlapped, whereas bronchial hyper-responsiveness
assessed by histamine bronchoprovocation challenge was better with
BDP than NED. In another case, one boy with high bronchial
hyper-reactivity assessed by provocation test with hypertonic
solution, experienced a significant improvement only after 2 weeks
of therapy with Deflazacort (2 mg/Kg/day) followed by 4 months on
combined treatment with NED (16 mg/day) and BDP (300 &#x003bc;/day). Authors
conclude that NED could have a steroidsparing effect over long-term use.</p>
