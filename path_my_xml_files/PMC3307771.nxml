Healthy undergraduates were randomized to groups in which they were scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) as they either actively played <italic>Re-Mission</italic> or as they passively observed a gameplay audio-visual stream generated by a yoked active group subject. Onset of interactive game play robustly activated mesolimbic projection regions including the caudate nucleus and nucleus accumbens, as well as a subregion of the parahippocampal gyrus. During interactive gameplay, subjects showed extended activation of the thalamus, anterior insula, putamen, and motor-related regions, accompanied by decreased activation in parietal and medial prefrontal cortex. Offset of interactive gameplay activated the anterior insula and anterior cingulate. Between-group comparisons of within-subject contrasts confirmed that mesolimbic activation was significantly more pronounced in the active playgroup than in the passive exposure control group. Individual difference analyses also found the magnitude of parahippocampal activation following gameplay onset to correlate with positive attitudes toward chemotherapy assessed both at the end of the scanning session and at an unannounced one-month follow-up. These findings suggest that IDG-induced activation of reward-related mesolimbic neural circuits stems primarily from participatory engagement in gameplay (interactivity), rather than from the effects of vivid and dynamic sensory stimulation.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Play represents a distinctive behavioral repertoire that is both highly rewarding and evolutionarily conserved <xref rid="pone.0033909-Panksepp1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. &#x0201c;Serious games&#x0201d; seek to promote positive changes in attitudes and behavior by leveraging fundamental neural processes engaged by play <xref rid="pone.0033909-Abt1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0033909-McGonigal1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.

Several studies have documented activation of mesolimbic circuits associated with reward anticipation and incentive motivation as people play &#x0201c;non-serious&#x0201d; entertainment-oriented interactive digital games (IDGs; colloquially known as &#x0201c;videogames&#x0201d;) <xref rid="pone.0033909-Koepp1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0033909-Mathiak1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Activation of brain motivational systems has been hypothesized to mediate the positive behavioral impact of serious IDGs (i.e., those explicitly designed to alter real-world attitudes and behavior) <xref rid="pone.0033909-Prensky1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0033909-McGonigal1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0033909-Vorderer1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, but it is not clear which specific aspects of the IDG play experience engage those motivational processes. Identification of the key motivation-engaging features of IDGs would significantly enhance our ability to rationally engineer play experiences that maximally influence attitudes and behavior.</p><p>One theoretical perspective suggests that the distinctive motivational impact of IDG play is a consequence of processing the complex, dynamic, and multi-modal sensory stream of events generated by interactive games <xref rid="pone.0033909-Prensky1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0033909-Vorderer1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0033909-Mayer1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. This account likens the IDG experience to other vivid, dynamic, emotionally engaging, multi-modal perceptual stimuli (e.g., audio-visual entertainment, stories, etc.) that have been found to enhance motivation, learning, and memory <xref rid="pone.0033909-Mayer1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. An alternative perspective suggests that the distinctive neural responses to IDG play stem not from the mere observation of a dynamic event stream, but rather rom the player's personal participation in shaping that dynamic event stream <xref rid="pone.0033909-Prensky1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0033909-Vorderer1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Under this hypothesis, the neural responses to IDG play differ qualitatively from those evoked by other highly vivid, dynamic, and emotionally engaging stimuli that do not involve the behavioral participation of the observer (e.g., non-interactive audio-visual entertainment).</p><p>In the present study, we sought to evaluate these alternative hypotheses in the context of a serious IDG that is already known to significantly impact behavior. The <italic>Re-Mission</italic> videogame was developed as a rationally targeted IDG behavioral intervention to improve health outcomes in adolescents and young adults currently undergoing treatment for cancer <xref rid="pone.0033909-Beale1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0033909-Kato1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0033909-Tate1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. A randomized controlled trial of <italic>Re-Mission</italic> in 374 adolescent and young adult cancer patients showed that the game significantly enhanced several targeted psychological and behavioral outcomes, including knowledge about cancer, self-efficacy to overcome the disease, and adherence to self-administered oral chemotherapy regimens <xref rid="pone.0033909-Kato1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. The current study seeks to understand <italic>Re-Mission</italic>'s general effects on the activation of reward-related neural circuits previously hypothesized to contribute to IDG-induced behavior change. After verifying that, (1) playing <italic>Re-Mission</italic> activates the same mesolimbic incentive motivation circuits previously found to be engaged by entertainment-targeted (i.e., non-serious) IDGs (e.g., the nucleus accumbens and broader mesolimbic dopamine projection areas) <xref rid="pone.0033909-Koepp1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0033909-Mathiak1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, this study tested the primary hypothesis that (2) activation of mesolimbic circuits is driven primarily by the interactive or participatory nature of gameplay, as opposed to the vivid, dynamic sensory stream it generates (i.e., different neural responses are generated by exposure to an identical non-interactive audio-visual information stream in a yoked passive control condition). Additional exploratory analyses also assessed the possibility that (3) the magnitude of gameplay-induced neural activation is associated with post-play differences in attitudes toward cancer chemotherapy &#x02013; a key psychological target of <italic>Re-Mission</italic> as a serious IDG <xref rid="pone.0033909-Beale1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0033909-Kato1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>Fifty-seven healthy undergraduates were each randomized to one of two experimental groups and scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) as they either actively played the cancer-related <italic>Re-Mission</italic> videogame for seven bouts of 60 sec separated by six rest pauses of variable 10&#x02013;30 sec duration (&#x0201c;active play&#x0201d; group; Supporting Information Video 1) or passively observed a gameplay audio-visual stream generated by a yoked active group player (&#x0201c;passive exposure&#x0201d; group).

These data also identify the participatory nature of interactive gameplay as a key driver of those neural responses. Temporal analyses of transition between pause conditions and active gameplay confirmed that ventral striatal activation was not driven solely by state transition-induced arousal (as might be hypothesized under theories interpreting mesolimbic dopamine activity in terms of novelty <xref rid="pone.0033909-Lisman1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>). Subjects in a passive exposure group experienced the same novel, vivid, dynamic, and emotionally involving stimulus streams as did those actively playing <italic>Re-Mission</italic>, but showed markedly less recruitment of mesolimbic structures implicated in reward processing.

While the highly vivid and dynamic event streams generated during IDG play do activate sensory neural structures, player involvement in shaping the event stream (i.e., interactivity) was required to substantially engage motivation-related brain circuits in response to <italic>Re-Mission</italic> gameplay. Although the present study focused on the impact of interactivity in the context of a serious game, interactivity likely contributes to reward-related neural activation during non-serious entertainment-oriented IDGs as well <xref rid="pone.0033909-Koepp1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0033909-Mathiak1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. What this study reveals about serious IDGs is that participatory interaction plays a key role in engaging reward-related neural processes previously hypothesized to mediate serious games' distinctive impact on &#x0201c;out-of-game&#x0201d; attitudes and behaviors (i.e., their potentially distinctive active ingredient relative to other attitude/behavior-change interventions) <xref rid="pone.0033909-Prensky1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0033909-McGonigal1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0033909-Vorderer1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.</p><p>In addition to activating the reward-related ventral striatum, the onset of interactive gameplay also increased activation in several other relevant regions. Of particular interest were subregions of the parahippocampal cortex falling at the interface between CA1 and the subiculum, which showed increased activation in response to the onset of interactive gameplay. In active play subjects, the quantitative magnitude of game onset-induced activation in regions of the left parahippocampal cortex positively correlated with the intensity of positive attitudes toward cancer chemotherapy assessed immediately following gameplay, as well as chemotherapy-related attitudes assessed one month later in an unannounced follow-up. In the passive exposure group, however, the quantitative magnitude of parahippocampal activation showed no significant correlation with post-play chemotherapy-related attitudes. We did not assess baseline chemotherapy-related attitudes prior to gameplay (by design, in order to avoid report-induced attitude anchoring), so it is not clear whether gameplay-induced neural responses in the left parahippocampal cortex are associated with gameplay-induced attitude change, or whether they might instead relate to pre-existing individual differences in attitude. <italic>Re-Mission</italic> has been shown to alter patients' cancer-related attitudes and behavior in previous studies <xref rid="pone.0033909-Beale1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0033909-Kato1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, but future analyses assessing pre-play attitudes will be required to more clearly define the role of play-induced parahippocampal activation on attitude change. Given the key role of the hippocampus in learning and memory, it is conceivable that IDG-induced activation in this region might potentially play a role in translating short-term play experiences into long-term effects on attitudes or behavior. However, direct measures of learning, memory, and motivation not available in this study will be required to test that hypothesis. Ultimately, studies will need to simultaneously contrast the effects of serious and non-serious IDGs on neural system engagement &#x0201c;in-game,&#x0201d; direct measures of play-induced learning and motivation, and &#x0201c;out-of-game&#x0201d; changes in attitude and behavior, in order to fully define the neural mechanisms by which serious IDGs exert their distinctive effects on behavior. The present results suggest that reward-related mesolimbic regions and the left parahippocampal cortex might serve as &#x0201c;candidate regions of interest&#x0201d; for such future studies.</p><p>Another unexpected finding was that extended periods of active IDG play were associated with reduced activity in some regions, including the medial prefrontal cortex, striatum, and medial temporal lobe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033909-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Future studies will be required to replicate these findings and determine their psychological basis, but such dynamics would be consistent with the hypothesis that playing IDGs alters the cognitive pathways through which information is processed <xref rid="pone.0033909-Prensky1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0033909-McGonigal1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0033909-Vorderer1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0033909-Tate1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.

Interestingly, gameplay onset was transiently associated with increased activity in sub-regions of the medial pre-frontal cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033909-g003">Figure 3</xref>) &#x02013; a pattern opposite to the deactivation observed over the broader medial prefrontal region during extended periods of interactive gameplay (i.e., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033909-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Future studies will be required to determine the replicability of these biphasic responses in the prefrontal cortex and determine their functional significance in the context of IDG play.</p><p>This study also has a number of other limitations that will need to be resolved by future research. One limitation involves the use of an asymmetric 3&#x02236;1 randomization strategy, which creates an unbalanced sampling design. We employed asymmetric randomization to enhance the size of the active play group and thereby increase statistical power to resolve relationships between gameplay-induced neural responses and attitude-related outcomes within that group. Statistical analyses were appropriately adjusted for asymmetric sample sizes in between-group comparisons, and extensive Monte Carlo analyses have confirmed that the <italic>t</italic> statistics utilized here remain valid in the context of 3&#x02236;1 sample size asymmetries <xref rid="pone.0033909-Hsu1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0033909-Zimmerman1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. However, future research should utilize larger total sample sizes in order to provide sufficient statistical power for well-powered within-group analyses while permitting balanced group sizes. Another limitation involved the nature of study participants. This study examined neural responses to <italic>Re-Mission</italic> gameplay in healthy undergraduates in order to define the basic effects of IDG play on activity of brain regions implicated in general reward-related processes. However, <italic>Re-Mission</italic> was specifically developed as an intervention for adolescents and young adults with cancer, and future studies will be required to determine what additional neural circuits might be engaged in players with a more deeply personal relationship to cancer. Future studies comparing gameplay responses in healthy individuals and cancer patients will also be required to determine whether <italic>Re-Mission's</italic> effects on out-of-game behavior stem primarily from the types of general responses observed here (e.g., coupling of cancer-related symbolic content with IDG-related activation of reward circuitry) or from cancer patient-specific responses (or perhaps from a mix of both). However, the observed association between parahippocampal response to gameplay onset and subsequently measured chemotherapy-related attitudes suggests that this game's general coupling of interactivity-induced activation of reward-related motivational circuits with cancer-related symbolic content might potentially contribute to at least some cancer-related outcomes (i.e., some effects occur among those with no direct personal experience of cancer). Nevertheless, future studies will need to analyze these attitude-related neural dynamics in cancer patients to more directly define the mechanisms by which the <italic>Re-Mission</italic> IDG influences cancer-related behaviors such as treatment adherence.</p><p>Given that the present data indicate a key role for interactivity in driving IDG activation of mesolimbic projection areas, it is worth considering which specific aspect of interactive play is responsible for such engagement. We hypothesize that the distinctive activation of anticipatory reward-related brain structures during IDG play is driven primarily by the players' recognition that their personal evaluative outcomes in the game (e.g., performance, self-view) depend on their instrumental actions. In other words, mesolimbic projection areas can modulate perception, learning, memory, and other cognitive functions that are engaged as part of the players' goal-directed efforts to succeed in game performance. Other psychological processes that are mobilized as a consequence of self-engagement may also contribute to the profile of neural recruitment observed during interactive gameplay. For example, the observed activations in the supplementary motor area and precuneus are consistent with previous studies implicating those structures in self-related processes <xref rid="pone.0033909-Vanhaudenhuyse1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0033909-Chua1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> and behavior change <xref rid="pone.0033909-Falk1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0033909-Falk2" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>.

However, other psychological dynamics that are correlated with the activation of reward- and self-related neural structures in this study (e.g., sensory effects on experiences of flow or virtual presence <xref rid="pone.0033909-Klasen1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0033909-Baumgartner1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0033909-Jancke1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, motoric output involved in gameplay) might contribute as well. Future studies that dissociate the instrumental or mechanical components of participatory control (e.g., sensory, planning, and motoric) from its affective and motivational components (e.g., self-view, goal achievement) could deepen our understanding of the neurobiological basis for play's distinctive power in driving the development of skills, knowledge, and complex behavior <xref rid="pone.0033909-Panksepp1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0033909-Prensky1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0033909-McGonigal1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Subjects</title><p>Data were collected from 65 young adults who were recruited through posted advertisements in the Stanford University environment and screened for typical FMRI exclusions (e.g., metal in the body, psychiatric and/or cardiac drugs).

VOI significance values were estimated over 4 averaged volumes specified as 6 mm diameter spheres centered bilaterally on ventral striatal regions implicated in reward anticipation (i.e., nucleus accumbens (Right/Anterior/Superior RAS&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;&#x000b1;11,11,&#x02212;2) and putamen (&#x000b1;17,12,0)) in previous research <xref rid="pone.0033909-Knutson2" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Overall statistical significance of primary hypothesis tests was based on Bonferroni-corrected significance threshold of p&#x0003c;.025 for each of the two primary bilateral tests (total family-wise p&#x0003c;.05). Secondary analyses of each of the 4 individual foci tested were conducted at Bonferroni-corrected significance threshold of .0125 (family-wise p&#x0003c;.05).</p><p>Because reward anticipation activates mesolimbic projection regions <xref rid="pone.0033909-Knutson1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0033909-Breiter1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, we predicted that the active play group would show increases in: (1) activation of sensorimotor circuits (i.e., primary sensory and motor cortices), perceptual circuits (i.e., visual cortex) and arousal-related structures (i.e., thalamus) for gameplay versus rest (nonplay); (2) activation of reward-related circuits (i.e., mesolimbic projection regions including the caudate, putamen, and nucleus accumbens) in response to the onset of game play; and (3) activation of circuits associated with interruption and aversion (i.e., anterior cingulate, anterior insula) in response to the offset of game play. Based on the hypothesis that interactive engagement in play engages motivation-related brain circuits, we additionally predicted that sensorimotor-, arousal-, reward-, memory-, and interruption/aversion-related activation dynamics would be significantly more pronounced for subjects in the active play group than in the passive exposure group.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Attitude measurement and analysis</title><p>To identify potential &#x0201c;in-game&#x0201d; neural response correlates of post-play attitudes toward chemotherapy, regression-based exploratory analyses assessed the relationship between individual differences in chemotherapy-related attitudes and individual differences in peak impulse responses following the initiation/resumption of gameplay. Both immediately after the gameplay session and one month later at an unannounced follow-up, subjects were asked to evaluate on a 7-point scale, &#x0201c;How important is chemotherapy in the treatment of cancer?&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;How vital is chemotherapy in the treatment of cancer?&#x0201d; Responses were averaged at each assessment point to provide a composite measure of chemotherapy-related attitude (Cronbach's alpha&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.91). Initial whole-brain analyses examined empirical correlates of chemotherapy-related attitudes in neural responses to gameplay onset. Because these were exploratory analyses targeting small subcortical regions, we utilized the same omnibus stringency threshold (p&#x0003c;.001) but a smaller cluster threshold (k&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;3) to identify potential activation foci. To plot the association between individual differences in peak neural response to gameplay onset and attitudes, a VOI-based analysis extracted individual average values of peak phasic response to gameplay onset/resumption (empirically determined to occur 6 sec after play onset) with a 6 mm diameter focus centered over the region of parahippocampal cortex found to show strongest association with post-play attitudes in initial whole-brain analyses. The magnitude of linear association was summarized by both Pearson correlation and outlier-robust Spearman correlation.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0033909.s001"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>
