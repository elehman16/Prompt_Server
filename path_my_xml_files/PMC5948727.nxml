Mindfulness may also be relevant in tackling obesity and eating disorders by decreasing binge eating episodes&#x02014;partly responsible for weight regain for a large number of people&#x02014;and increasing awareness of emotional and other triggers for overeating. The aim of the present study protocol is to evaluate and compare the feasibility and efficacy of two mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) addressing overweight and obesity in primary care patients: a general programme called Mindfulness-Based Health Promotion and a targeted mindful eating protocol called Mindfulness-Based Eating Awareness Training.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p id="Par2">A randomised controlled trial will be conducted to compare treatment as usual separately in primary care with both programmes (health promotion and mindful eating) added to treatment as usual. Two hundred forty adult women with overweight and obesity will be enrolled. The primary outcome will be an assessment of improvement in eating behaviour. Secondary outcomes will be (1) biochemical control; (2) anthropometric parameters, body composition, dietary intake and basal metabolism; and (3) levels of mindfulness, stress, depression, self-compassion and anxiety. At the end of each intervention, a focus group will be held to assess the programme&#x02019;s impact on the participants&#x02019; lives, diet and health. A feasibility study on access to benefits from and importance of MBIs at primary care facilities will be conducted among primary care health care professionals and participants. Monthly maintenance sessions lasting at least 1 hour will be offered, according to each protocol, during the 3-month follow-up periods.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">This clinical trial will result in more effective mindfulness-based interventions as a complementary treatment in primary care for people with overweight and obesity. If the findings of this study confirm the effectiveness of mindfulness programmes in this population, it will be possible to improve quality of life and health while optimising public resources and reaching a greater number of people. In addition, on the basis of the evaluation of the feasibility of implementing this intervention in primary care facilities, we expect to be able to suggest the intervention for incorporation into public policy.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par4">ClinicalTrials.gov, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://register.clinicaltrials.gov">NCT02893150</ext-link>.

Brazil has been undergoing a rapid demographic, nutritional and epidemiological transition accompanied by an increase in obesity in different population groups. In the current epidemiological setting, which has seen a decline in rates of infectious diseases, there has been a noteworthy rise in noncommunicable chronic diseases (NCDs), including obesity. With this has come increased caloric intake associated with adipose tissue gain and concomitantly a risk factor for other NCDs, such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cancer. This is a critical public health problem, particularly in Brazil, where 72% of deaths are related to such diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. More than half of the Brazilian population is overweight, and obesity currently affects 20% of adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. A study of food consumption between 1970 and 2009 showed a trend of increasing consumption of ultra-processed foods (baked goods, sausages, soft drinks, ready meals), and the researchers in that study also noted a reduction in the consumption of basic foods such as eggs, animal fats, fish, roots, tubers and rice, aside from the consumption of fruits and vegetables, which remained stable, albeit representing less than half of the recommended daily intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par34">Primary health care (PHC) is fundamental for promoting, protecting and maintaining health; supporting epidemiological surveillance; and contributing to health education actions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. According to the World Health Organisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], a fundamental goal is the ability to receive and treat overweight individuals and the ability to direct care to other health units and staff in order to ensure total care of the individual with highly relevant diseases with multifactorial aetiology.</p><p id="Par35">The prevention and treatment of overweight (body mass index [BMI] &#x02265;&#x02009;25&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> and&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;30&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and obesity (BMI &#x02265;&#x02009;30&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>) is facilitated by an interdisciplinary approach in order to enhance the effectiveness of primary care (PC) teams. This is consistent with an increasing expansion of knowledge about the complexity of these diseases and allows for better provision of care.</p><p id="Par36">A range of theoretical psychobiological approaches have addressed the underlying causes of excess food intake, which result in overweight and obesity. For example, from a psychoanalytical viewpoint, there is a linkage between a person&#x02019;s needs and body limitations and the desire to obtain pleasure and avoid displeasure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. From a cognitive behavioural perspective, both behavioural and cognitive habits in relation to food intake develop over many years, leading to habits and food choices that become increasingly automatic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In relation to the dysfunctional thoughts commonly present in overweight and obese individuals, mindfulness also has been an important tool for achieving more functional thoughts and providing better psychological health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. When one accepts certain natural conditions of life (openness, curiosity, gentleness and non-judgement, as experienced in the mindfulness approach), it becomes easier to respond to such conditions in a more creative and functional way [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Moreover, people with higher levels of trait mindfulness appear to have more appropriate nutritional states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Mindfulness practice may also decrease inflammatory response; therefore, given that obesity is also considered an inflammatory disease, further investigation of these effects may support the value of mindfulness-based programmes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par37">Mindfulness may also have a particular relevance in obesity and eating disorders by reducing the episodes of binge eating, partly responsible for weight regain in a large number of people, and improving eating behaviour, as demonstrated in the Mindfulness-Based Eating Awareness Training (MB-EAT) programme by promoting awareness of unbalanced emotional states and physiological indicators generated by the process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Results of the meta-analyses of random effects demonstrate the medium- and long-term effects of these interventions on binge eating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Multiple studies support the value of mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) targeted at eating behaviours. They have also been adapted for use on a broader range of overweight and obese individuals with no binge eating disorders and have been shown to lead to improvement in eating behaviour and weight loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Aims</title><p id="Par38">The aim of the present study is to evaluate the feasibility and relative efficacy of two MBIs by enrolling overweight and obese PC patients: the Mindfulness-Based Health Promotion (MBHP) programme and MB-EAT.

The steps of this study will be based on the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] guidelines for reporting randomised controlled trials in a clear, transparent and comprehensive manner. These guidelines are currently endorsed by 585 international journals and more than 50% of medical journals indexed in PubMed (CONSORT).

Power analysis was calculated a priori using G*Power 3.1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] for repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). The results indicated that a sample size of 240 (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;80 per group) is needed, with a significance level of 5% and a power of 80% to detect significant main effects of group and time, with a small to moderate effect size (Cohen&#x02019;s <italic>f</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.25), and allowing for a dropout rate of about 20%.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Recruitment</title><p id="Par49">Brazil&#x02019;s publicly funded health system Sistema &#x000da;nico de Sa&#x000fa;de (SUS), was created in 1988 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The expansion and qualification of PHC is seen as a fundamental policy in structuring and strengthening the SUS and has been supported by the country&#x02019;s Ministry of Health over the last 20&#x000a0;years. Several financial and organisational strategies have been used to address this challenge, notably the Family Health Strategy (FHS). The FHS consolidates a model of community-oriented PC facilities, known as basic health Units (BHUs), run by a team of nurses, general practitioners and community health workers. It includes comprehensive care, working with cultural competence and social accountability, and focuses on local families and community-based health care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The FHS prioritises coverage of vulnerable low-income populations and now covers about 65% of Brazilian citizens (more than 125 million people in August 2014) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p id="Par50">The city of S&#x000e3;o Paulo, where this study will be conducted, is responsible for coordinating health care provision within its area, which is divided into six regions: Central, Western, Eastern, Northern, South-eastern, and Southern. The Southern region, in which this work will be concentrated, comprises the administrative divisions&#x02014;or <italic>subprefectures</italic>&#x02014;of Campo Limpo, Capela do Socorro, Cidade Ademar, M&#x02019;Boi Mirim, Parelheiros and Santo Amaro. The Southern region, with 2.7 million inhabitants, is the most populated region in the city. One of the inclusion criteria will comprise residence in one of the following subprefectures: Campo Limpo (26 BHUs), Cidade Ademar (26 BHUs), M&#x02019;Boi Mirim (31 BHUs) and Santo Amaro (5 BHUs).</p><p id="Par51">An introductory lecture will be scheduled for anyone interested in participating in the research in order to point out its aims and the procedures involved. Anyone who agrees to participate in it will be required to sign an informed consent form. After the introductory lecture, evaluation tools featuring the participants&#x02019; baseline (T0) data will be applied to those who give their informed consent. The volunteers will then be randomised into one of three groups (G1, G2 or G3) and will be invited to participate in one of two programmes based on mindfulness for quality of life, lasting 10&#x000a0;weeks and 8 weeks (until randomisation), respectively. This is a single-blind study. The person responsible for performing the data analysis will be blind to the type of intervention. Both interventions (MBHP and MB-EAT) will be conducted by the lead researcher of this study in order to prevent inter-facilitator variability. After participants have given informed consent, they will be assessed on the basis of the inclusion and exclusion criteria. After the clarification of research procedures with the volunteers, they will then be included in a preliminary list and assigned a numeric code, which will subsequently be sent for randomisation. The participants will be randomly assigned to one of the three conditions. Randomisation will be performed by a statistician who is a member of the research team, by means of Sealed Envelope Ltd. 2017 statistics software (Sealed Envelope Ltd., London, UK) (seed 257983895669536) to allocate 15 participants to each group. The staff at the corresponding BHU will refer the participants to the research team and will also inform them of the day and time when the group sessions will be held. Allocation of participants to the groups will be performed using the restricted method to ensure balanced group sizes. The permuted block randomisation method is to be used with a 1:1:1 allocation ratio.</p><p id="Par52">Participants will remain blinded to their group allocation until the first meeting. The lead researcher will be responsible for delivering both protocols and will therefore be an unblinded study member and will not be involved in the outcome analysis or data analysis (<italic>see</italic> Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).</p><p id="Par53">As an attempt to improve adherence to the programme, all groups will receive an invitation to a monthly maintenance session (according to each protocol after the end of the programme, at 8 or 10&#x000a0;weeks) in addition to weekly emails with suggestions regarding formal and informal practices.

Self-report instruments to be used to track eating behaviour are the DEBQ and the BES, collected from T0 to T2.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Secondary outcome measures</title><p id="Par109">Secondary outcome measures include greater self-knowledge, the perception of emotional triggers for overeating, increase in self-compassion resulting in higher self-care and better adherence to treatment, improvement of nutritional status (reduction of body weight by &#x02265;&#x02009;5%) and biochemical examinations throughout the intervention, as well as maintenance of this status (without weight regain) during a 3-month follow-up period. This maintenance could lead to the prevention of multiple morbidities related to excess body weight. Levels of mindfulness, stress, anxiety (psychometric scale and serum cortisol) and self-compassion will be assessed. Body composition, basal metabolism and food intake, as well as maintenance of practices and the feasibility of the programme, will be also evaluated. Changes in lifestyles and eating patterns of participants in each group will be evaluated at the end of the programme and 3&#x000a0;months after the intervention.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Data handling</title><p id="Par110">All study-related information will be stored in secure folders with limited access. Paper-based data collection forms will contain only participant numbers to maintain confidentiality and will be stored in a locked cabinet in an area with limited access. Electronic data files will be password-protected (RedCap). The list linking participant numbers and personal information will be stored in a separate password-protected file. Paper-based data entry will be double-checked. Data will be stored for 5&#x000a0;years after the end of inclusion. The study has low negligibility risks; therefore, no data monitoring committee will be assigned. Only the first author and lead researchers, or persons assigned by them, will have access to the final dataset. Authors of the final trial report will make substantial contributions to the design, conduct, interpretation and reporting of the trial. Study results will be presented via publications and presentations; study participants, funders and involved clinicians will receive a summary of the study results.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Data analysis</title><p id="Par111">The qualitative variables will be described as numbers and percentages, and quantitative data will be summarised as mean values with SD if the assumption of normality of data has been satisfied; otherwise, the median and 25% and 75% percentiles will be used. The three conditions for the treatment will be compared with baseline measures to evaluate the success of randomisation. In this case, the chi-square test or Fisher&#x02019;s exact test for qualitative variables will be used, and one-way ANOVA or the Kruskal-Wallis test will be applied for quantitative variables.</p><p id="Par112">Longitudinal data (T0, T1 and T2) will be collected for each group, which means that they will not be independent; therefore, repeated-measures ANOVA will be used. When assessing the effectiveness of the TAU programme, repeated-measures ANOVA will be used to assess the main effects of time and treatment, and the interaction between them. The analysis will be performed with the complete sample, and we plan to perform analyses in subgroups stratified by BMI. The models will be adjusted for possible confounding variables, such as age, BMI and other relevant covariates. Differences will be identified by using test linear hypotheses after ANOVA, and multiple testing will be adjusted by the Bonferroni correction.</p><p id="Par113">The data will be evaluated for the intention-to-treat analysis; that is, the analysis will include all participants after randomisation. For the per-protocol analysis, women in the intervention groups who do not participate in at least four sessions will be excluded. For the attrition analysis, we will compare women who complete the protocol with women who answered only the baseline questionnaire.</p><p id="Par114">All data analysis will be performed with STATA version 14.2 software (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. <italic>p</italic> Values &#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05 will be considered statistically significant. No datasets were generated or analysed during the present study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Qualitative assessment</title><p id="Par115">At the end of each protocol/intervention, focus groups consisting of a minimum of 4 and a maximum of 15 volunteer participants will be conducted and incorporated into the programmed sessions (G2 and G3). The focus groups will be fully recorded in digital audio, with participant observation of a team member. The focus group will be held through structured interviews to investigate whether the programme made a difference in the participants&#x02019; health and nutritional status. Qualitative data will be analysed on the basis of focus group. Verbatim reporting will identify emerging themes from the qualitative content analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. We expect this analysis to identify the reasons for adherence/non-adherence to the mindfulness and TAU programmes and the health effects of the programmes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par116">Most people do not want to go on a diet, because they usually have an emotional relationship with food. This gives mindful eating an advantage because it is a non-diet approach, which is less unnerving for patients, and more realistic, doable and durable by enhancing self-acceptance and acceptance of the body, without an attachment to the number of calories in each food. Several studies and meta-analysis reviews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>] indicate that mindful eating can be an important tool in weight loss and maintenance, without the need to count calories, which is usually recommended by the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.</p><p id="Par117">MB-EAT was adapted from MBSR and specifically developed for compulsive eating disorders and related problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. The main objective of the MB-EAT is to control the balance between physiological and non-nutritional factors that influence eating behaviour, helping individuals to cultivate a greater awareness of hunger and satiety as well as awareness of arising emotional states and external triggers (<italic>see</italic> Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).</p><p id="Par118">The programme emphasises the pleasure and affection related to food while encouraging healthy standards when choosing food, in relation to both the quantity and the quality of food ingested. MB-EAT is an effective way to internalise and maintain behaviour changes. This programme emphasises the importance of mindfulness meditation in cultivating the ability to focus one&#x02019;s attention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>].</p><p id="Par119">People are more convinced by the information they discover on their own than by what is brought to them by others; it is already known that manipulating the cognitive field alone is not enough to change eating behaviours or habits. More serious than the maintenance of obesity is the &#x0201c;yo-yo pattern&#x0201d; promoted by a low adherence to dietary treatments, resulting in constant weight regain, which aggravates metabolic problems and poses a great challenge to health professionals. This therefore requires new intervention strategies and research.</p><p id="Par120">Weight maintenance is also associated with factors such as the manifestation of intrinsic motivation, such as greater self-confidence regarding weight loss, better strategies of reaction and the ability to cope with stress (decentring, metacognition), feelings of self-efficacy, autonomy, healthy narcissism and greater stability and psychological strength [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. Mindfulness is able to act positively in this direction, and both the MBIs, which present reduction in weight gain, hunger and emotional eating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>], as well as MB-EAT, which seems to be effective in the United States and Europe for stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>], anxiety reduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>] and body weight issues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>], must have their findings replicated.</p><p id="Par121">Research into mindful eating is more recent than research into the mindfulness stress reduction programmes. There is a very limited number of clinical trials, which are predominantly based on psychometric scales, often with few samples. Reviews concerning mindful eating have used different protocols, with a waiting list as a control, and an active control used only a few times. Follow-up is even rarer, and in most cases it does not reach 6&#x000a0;months.</p><p id="Par122">Few studies have provided significant data on at-home mindfulness practice (quantity and quality) in MBIs, particularly in mindful eating programmes. Studies of this nature are generally scarce, and they are non-existent in Brazil. Further research with more objective measures, aside from the psychometric scales, should be carried out to clarify the mechanisms involved in these benefits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>] and to identify the most effective protocol for this population.</p><p id="Par123">The present study, which uses psychometric, anthropometric and biochemical parameters, as well as dietary intake, will not be limited to a quantitative approach and could address the gaps left by psychometric scales. This information is as yet unpublished in Brazil and, as far as we know, is not published in any international literature either. This mixed-methods (quantitative and qualitative) study could point to more objective forms of effective intervention, contributing to cost reduction and therefore to more sustainable weight loss, with less weight regain, and consequently to a reduction in excess weight-related co-morbidities that burden the health care system.</p><p id="Par124">The feasibility assessment for the implementation of the mindfulness programme provided for in this study is one of the steps for the medium- and long-term implementation of this intervention in PC. PC is the main gateway for patients in a health system, and with the inclusion of meditation in the national policy of integral and complementary practices in 2017 by the Brazilian Ministry of Health, it is believed that more resources will be dedicated to the sector, thus allowing professionals to qualify as teachers. In addition, different types of professional training have been offered for a period of 2 years in the most varied protocols, which would allow the inclusion of more people interested in working with mindfulness. The adherence of the participants to the programme, the acceptance of the professionals and cost-effectiveness measures are future steps that should be contemplated for implementation to become reality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par125">This study presents certain limitations, which are as follows. S&#x000e3;o Paulo is a large metropolis, with an extensive surface area. Covering one BHU per week, even restricted to the Southern region, will require a great deal of travel mileage. Added to this will be the characteristic transit problems inherent in a large city, which requires 1.5&#x02013;2&#x000a0;hours to arrive at each BHU. Further studies should be carried out covering BHUs in other regions, with both sexes and including the elderly population, in order to ensure greater representativeness and generalisability. This is a very deprived population living in peripheral areas with scarce financial resources and low schooling, which adds more difficulty to the understanding and completion of questionnaires, possibly leading to errors. Although in this study we will evaluate the same health region, with the same guidelines applied, there is heterogeneity of treatment between BHUs.</p><sec id="Sec24"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par126">At the time of initial manuscript submission, recruitment was already in progress (starting March 2018) but was not yet complete (prospectively expecting completion in May 2019).
