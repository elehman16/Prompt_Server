The underlying mechanism has been suggested to involve a decrease in protein synthesis in order to conserve O<sub>2</sub>. With the aim to challenge this hypothesis, we applied a primed, constant infusion of 1-<sup>13</sup>C-leucine in nine healthy male subjects at sea level and subsequently at high-altitude (4559 m) after 7&#x02013;9 days of acclimatization. Physical activity levels and food and energy intake were controlled prior to the two experimental conditions with the aim to standardize these confounding factors. Blood samples and expired breath samples were collected hourly during the 4 hour trial and vastus lateralis muscle biopsies obtained at 1 and 4 hours after tracer priming in the overnight fasted state. Myofibrillar protein synthesis rate was doubled; 0.041&#x000b1;0.018 at sea-level to 0.080&#x000b1;0.018&#x00025;&#x022c5;hr<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (p&#x0003c;0.05) when acclimatized to high altitude. The sarcoplasmic protein synthesis rate was in contrast unaffected by altitude exposure; 0.052&#x000b1;0.019 at sea-level to 0.059&#x000b1;0.010&#x00025;&#x022c5;hr<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (p&#x0003e;0.05). Trends to increments in whole body protein kinetics were seen: Degradation rate elevated from 2.51&#x000b1;0.21 at sea level to 2.73&#x000b1;0.13 &#x000b5;mol&#x022c5;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x022c5;min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.05) at high altitude and synthesis rate similar; 2.24&#x000b1;0.20 at sea level and 2.43&#x000b1;0.13 &#x000b5;mol&#x022c5;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x022c5;min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (p&#x0003e;0.05) at altitude. We conclude that whole body amino acid flux is increased due to an elevated protein turnover rate. Resting skeletal muscle myocontractile protein synthesis rate was concomitantly elevated by high-altitude induced hypoxia, whereas the sarcoplasmic protein synthesis rate was unaffected by hypoxia. These changed responses may lead to divergent adaptation over the course of prolonged exposure.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="7"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Long-term (75 days) exposure of healthy lowlanders to high-altitude (5250 m at Mount Everest base camp) induces loss of skeletal muscle mass and single fiber atrophy in m. vastus lateralis and m. biceps brachii <xref rid="pone.0015606-Mizuno1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Similar results have been obtained in subjects residing for 40 days in a hypobaric chamber <xref rid="pone.0015606-MacDougall1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. In mountaineers climbing in the Himalayas severe loss &#x0003e;20&#x00025; of single fiber area has been reported in biopsies obtained upon return to sea level <xref rid="pone.0015606-Hoppeler1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0015606-Hoppeler2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Thus, hypoxic exposure has in several studies been shown to be detrimental for skeletal muscle mass. However, contrasting results have also been reported. For example, following 56 days at 4100 m altitude no significant changes in single fiber cross sectional area was observed <xref rid="pone.0015606-Lundby1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Besides the lower residing altitude in this study, subjects had free access to physical activities such as soccer, hiking, and jogging, which may have counteracted the severity of muscle loss and thus its detection. Following a 21-day expedition culminating with the assent to 6194 m, six mountaineers experienced no significant muscle loss <xref rid="pone.0015606-Green1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Thus, total time of exposure, the degree of hypoxia, physical activity levels, and food intake are all factors, which may markedly influence the adaptation of skeletal muscle to hypoxia.</p><p>In studies, applying indirect measures of protein turnover, <italic>in vitro</italic> models provide results that suggests that attenuated energy turnover and loss of muscle mass may be developed at hypoxia exposure due to a decrease in overall protein turnover rate <xref rid="pone.0015606-Heerlein1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0015606-Kraggerud1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Surprisingly, Vigano and co-workers observed no marked changes in translation regulating following 7&#x02013;9 days of stay at 4559 m altitude <xref rid="pone.0015606-Vigano1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Exemplified by the total mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a master regulator of protein synthesis, they found a slight decrease in its protein content, unfortunately with no measures of its phosphorylation status or activity <xref rid="pone.0015606-Vigano1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. The protein expression and phosphorylation state of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2&#x003b1;) was unchanged <xref rid="pone.0015606-Vigano1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, which was also the case for the protein concentration of the hypoxia inducible factor (HIF). In a previous publication however, the HIF gene was shown to be markedly increased at the transcriptional level <xref rid="pone.0015606-Robach1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.</p><p>A direct measurement of the protein kinetics processes is though more valid to decide whether altitude affects protein turnover. Using the stable isotope methodology, Imoberdorf and co-workers assessed muscle protein synthesis rate after exposure to high altitude <xref rid="pone.0015606-Imoberdorf1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. They showed that in a group of subjects, investigated acutely after active ascent to high-altitude, mixed muscle protein synthesis rate was higher compared to in a group that was flown to the altitude and compared to the rate at sea level <xref rid="pone.0015606-Imoberdorf1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. In this study the measurements may have been affected by the differences in ascent modality and the short acclimatization time allowed at altitude prior to measurements. Hence, from cell culture experiments it is known that some metabolic changes to hypoxic exposure takes place in a time-dependent manner; such as decrease in cellular ATP concentration and a decrease in oxygen consumption to protein synthetic processes <xref rid="pone.0015606-Heerlein1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, which means that some exposure time may be needed to allow the adaptation to occur.</p><p>We therefore hypothesized that skeletal muscle protein synthesis could be affected by high-altitude induced hypoxia if longer exposure time would have been allowed. Therefore, to study whole body and skeletal muscle protein kinetics, we completed trials with stable isotopically-labeled amino acid infusions at sea level and 7&#x02013;9 days after ascent to high altitude (4559 m).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Subjects</title><p>Nine healthy, physically active male subjects participated in the study. They ranged in age from 24 to 30 years, had an average height of 180&#x000b1;1 cm (mean &#x000b1; SEM), and a mean weight of 78&#x000b1;2 kg. Not all data points were obtained in all subjects during the altitude trials, and the exact n is given in tables/figures where needed.

Most of the time was passed watching TV, studying, working on computers, or conversation. During their indoor confinement the subjects had access to a broad variety of food and the subjects choose themselves what to eat at all times. All food intakes were registered. The day before the experiment no caffeine containing substances was allowed from 6 pm, and the subjects fasted from 8 pm until after completion of the experiments the following day. The next morning at 8 am the experiments were initiated and the protocol is described in the paragraph <italic>Experimental protocol</italic>.</p><p>In late August all subjects were flown to Italy and brought to 3200 m altitude by bus and lift. After 2&#x02013;3 hours of mountain walking all subjects arrived at the Gnifetti hut at 3647 m and spend two nights in order to minimize the risk of acute mountain sickness (assessed by Lake Louise scores). The experimental facilities of the Margeritha hut (4559 m altitude) were reached after 5&#x02013;7 hours of mountain/glacier walking on day 3 and subjects resided here until the experiments were started 7&#x02013;9 days after arrival to this altitude. The Margeritha hut is a modern building where parts of the second floor are allocated specifically for scientific projects. The building is well insulated, has electricity, and comfortable living and kitchen facilities, and the experimental settings cannot be compared to the previous studies conducted in for example the base camp of Mount Everest where low temperatures etc may influence the results.</p><p>As at sea level, all subjects were confined to indoor activities three days prior to the experiments and were not allowed outside in an attempt to standardize energy expenditure. We had brought an exactly matched amount of food as the subjects ate during the sea level experiments and the subjects consumed a similar diet as they did at sea level during this period. The restrictions to food prior to the experiments were the same as they were initiated at sea level.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Arterial blood sample</title><p>Approximately 10 days after the completion of the experiments at sea level an arterial blood sample was taken for other purposes <xref rid="pone.0015606-Lundby2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.

Although the atrophic phenomenon at altitude has been described for decades, the underlying peripheral protein kinetics and mechanisms remain unresolved and only few human data on protein turnover in response to hypoxia exist. The main finding in the present study was that resting, fasting skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic protein synthesis rate is unchanged after 7&#x02013;9 days acclimatization to altitude whereas the contractile protein synthesis rate is markedly elevated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0015606-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>The synthesis rate of human skeletal muscle protein has only sparsely been assessed during hypoxic conditions and data are somehow contrasting. Imoberdorf and co-workers assessed the fractional synthesis rate of mixed skeletal muscle protein at sea-level and divided the subjects into two groups subsequently; one group that was flown to high altitude and another that walked from 3220 m up to 3611 m (1.5 hr) on one day and then to 4559 m (4&#x02013;5 hrs) the next day <xref rid="pone.0015606-Imoberdorf1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Acutely (19&#x02013;24 hrs) after arrival at the high altitude destination the trials were conducted, which revealed an unchanged resting synthesis rate of the mixed muscle proteins in the passively ascended group and an elevated synthesis rate in the walking group <xref rid="pone.0015606-Imoberdorf1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Although well-conducted, the study has two critique points in terms of evaluating how hypoxia affects skeletal muscle protein synthesis rate. First, performing the trials shortly after arrival presumably does not allow sufficient time for relevant hypoxic responses to occur and thus does not determine whether chronic hypoxia affects protein synthesis rate. In this regard, rodent studies reveal that the adaptive response in muscle protein turnover to hypoxic conditions is affected by time <xref rid="pone.0015606-Preedy1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0015606-Preedy2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Secondly, the elevated muscle synthesis rate in the active group may simply be caused by the physical activity (active ascent) <xref rid="pone.0015606-Miller1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0015606-Phillips1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> conducted one and two days prior the experimental trial <xref rid="pone.0015606-Imoberdorf1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, which is a bias with regards to the hypoxic exposure intervention. In the other human study examining the response of hypoxia on protein metabolism, the forearm muscle compartment was shown to slower its protein synthesis (estimated by leucine uptake) with acute exposure to hypobaric hypoxia <xref rid="pone.0015606-Rennie1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. These divergent results also signify the importance of evaluating protein kinetics at more protein specific level, since different protein fractions may diverge in responsiveness. Therefore, not necessarily in contrast to previous results <xref rid="pone.0015606-Imoberdorf1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0015606-Rennie1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, the myocontractile protein synthesis rate was elevated after &#x0223c;1 week of acclimatization to high altitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0015606-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). As the problem during hypoxic exposures generally is loss of skeletal muscle mass, the enhanced synthesis rate of the contractile proteins must be accompanied by an even higher increase in the protein breakdown rate. That a similar stimulus may have been applied to the present subjects is implied by the trend toward an increase in the whole body protein degradation rate (Ra, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0015606-t001">Table 1</xref>). In the same subjects however, Vigano et al. reported that the concentration of the muscle myofibrillar protein actin was unchanged with altitude exposure <xref rid="pone.0015606-Vigano1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Therefore, the measured overall elevation in protein turnover with hypoxia exposure, which also is likely to have been the case for the myofibrillar protein breakdown rate, may have been counterbalanced by a concomitant increase in the myofibrillar protein synthesis rate. Thereby, resulting in a steady actin protein concentration and an undetectable change in muscle mass <xref rid="pone.0015606-Vigano1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.</p><p>In contrast, we found an unaffected synthesis rate of the sarcoplasmic proteins in skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0015606-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Using a similar muscle protein separation protocol, it has been verified that the sarcoplasmic protein fraction contains water soluble proteins present intracellularly as well as subsarcolemmal mitochondrial proteins <xref rid="pone.0015606-Bohe1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0015606-Guillet1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Assuming that the overall protein turnover rate is enhanced, an absence of enhanced protein synthesis rate will result in net protein breakdown leading to net protein loss. For the sarcoplasmic proteins this may be the situation and this is in agreement with the finding from the same muscle specimens showing a decreased concentration of various metabolic enzymes and stress responsive proteins <xref rid="pone.0015606-Vigano1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> as well as several proteins involved in the oxygen transport <xref rid="pone.0015606-Robach1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, of which most presumably will be present in the sarcoplasmic protein fraction. Although, the decrements in protein concentrations in these studies were unexpected for the authors at that time, because most of the mRNAs coding for those proteins were more concentrated at altitude <xref rid="pone.0015606-Robach1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, the findings are in agreements with decreased mitochondrial density and content of metabolic enzymes after prolonged exposure to hypoxia shown in other studies <xref rid="pone.0015606-Hoppeler2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0015606-Hoppeler3" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0015606-Howald1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Relating to these long-term adaptations, it can therefore be suggested that the breakdown rate of the proteins in the sarcoplasmic protein fraction as well as for other proteins in the body is enhanced, which thereby in the absence of elevated synthesis rate results in a negative net sarcoplasmic protein balance, leading to protein loss. We did not observe any indications of altered oxidative capacity with hypoxic exposure in the present study (similar submax and max VO<sub>2</sub> at sea level and with acute normoxia at altitude). Whether, the turnover rates of the specific proteins leading to the metabolic changes and decreased oxidative capacity were affected by hypoxia or not or the changes yet were unable to exert functional changes are unknown. As tempted to outline, several adaptations have to take place along the path from changes in gene and protein expression till detectable physiological manifestations.</p><p>Venous plasma KIC is not solely originating from skeletal muscle, but is released from all cells making the venous plasma KIC a weighted mean of whole body intracellular leucine enrichments. It is generally agreed that since skeletal muscle make up such an abundant tissue, the venous plasma KIC enrichments is highly reflective of the status in the myocytes <xref rid="pone.0015606-Toffolo1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0015606-Ljungqvist1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Interestingly, we observed a 13&#x00025; lower enrichment in the KIC at altitude compared to at sea level (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0015606-t002">Table 2</xref>). Since the enrichment at steady state is defined as the tracer infusion rate divided by the rate of appearance of the tracee, the lower enrichment at altitude is presumably due to a higher rate of appearance and thus flux of free leucine at altitude. This observation thus coincides with the trend toward increased whole body leucine flux and significant increase in leucine rate of appearance (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0015606-t001">Table 1</xref>), which is a measure of protein degradation. Unfortunately, we do not have any tissue or protein specific data for degradation, which would have gained valuable information in combination with the synthesis results. However, protein specific methods to assess the protein breakdown rate comparable to the fractional synthesis rate approach await yet to be developed.</p><p>It is not believed that the observed protein turnover is driven by changes in systemic hormones as we (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0015606-t002">Table 2</xref>) and others <xref rid="pone.0015606-Imoberdorf1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0015606-Larsen1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> have not been able to show changes in a range of potent hormones except from insulin, which previously has been found to be increased after hypoxic exposure <xref rid="pone.0015606-Larsen1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>.

It is unlikely that this relatively small increase in insulin should be responsible for the observed changes in skeletal muscle protein turnover <xref rid="pone.0015606-Greenhaff1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>.</p><p>It has previously been demonstrated that the hypoxic response may not be as detrimental for the cell <xref rid="pone.0015606-Lundby1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> as the <italic>in vitro</italic> conditions, which lead to the formulation of the &#x0201c;Hypoxia Defence Strategies&#x0201d; by Hochachka and co-workers <xref rid="pone.0015606-Hochachka1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Thus, a less severe response than the initiation of the two-phase <italic>Defence and Rescue</italic> strategy may be expected. During an exposure to a mild hypoxic milieu as in the present setting, we propose a remodeling adaptive response in the skeletal muscle, which initiates an increase in protein degradation. Subsequently, it is left to the synthetic processes to reorganize and rebuild the tissue. Whether the net outcome over time then ends up with a steady or slightly decreased protein mass is depended on how well the protein synthetic processes are maintained. The stimulation of protein synthesis may primarily be through external factors, which at altitude may be compromised by decreasing food intake, decrease in physical activity level <xref rid="pone.0015606-Lundby3" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, gastric disorder, minor inflammatory states <xref rid="pone.0015606-Klausen1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0015606-Hartmann1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, and various other high-altitude related inconveniences <xref rid="pone.0015606-Kayser1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. The net muscle protein balance may thereby be susceptible to become negative leading to a net loss of muscle mass as it is observed in most but not all high-altitude studies. Further, when the protein turnover rate is high, the protein mass is more vulnerable to change when small imbalances in net balance appear. It is known though, that skeletal muscles maintain their capacity to adapt to endurance training at altitude <xref rid="pone.0015606-Desplanches1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Therefore, if the compromising factors for the stimulation of protein synthetic processes are not sought treated and counteracted at high altitude a negative net protein balance seem unavoidable. In the present study, we sought to match energy expenditure at altitude with those at sea level and provided the subjects with excess food, which in our setting may have maintained the myofibrillar protein synthesis high. Assuming an overall increased release of amino acids after several days of high altitude acclimatization, the lack of elevated synthesis rate of the sarcoplasmic and mitochondrial proteins therefore coincides with the ubiquitously observed decrease in oxidative capacity following exposure to high altitude.</p><p>The applied tracer approach validly reveals that the adaptation of synthesis rates of various skeletal muscle protein fractions is different and future hypoxia-research should focus on describing the molecular signaling responsible for these divergent adaptations. With regard to the measurement of protein breakdown rate, no similar protein specific approach exists. However, the whole body amino acid flux rates assessed here indicate an elevation at altitude when compared to sea level but these results are underpowered and not protein specific. Therefore, the adaptation and regulation of the protein breakdown after acclimatization to high altitude demands thorough research and improvements in methodology.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Competing Interests: </bold>The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding: </bold>This study was financially supported by the Novo Nordisk Fonden (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.novonordiskfonden.dk">www.novonordiskfonden.dk</ext-link>) to CL while working at the Copenhagen Muscle Research Center, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.
