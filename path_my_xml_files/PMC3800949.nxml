The hectic life and tremendous stress in today's world has made the conception &#x00026; continuation of pregnancy to term very difficult. Anaemia is one of the common disease conditions which affect a pregnant woman. In Ayurvedic classics anaemia in pregnancy is taken under the Rasa Pradoshaja Vikara. It is also a Santharpanotha Vikara.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Method:</title><p>Total 26 patients were registered from O.P.D. And I.P.D. of the department of Streeroga &#x00026; Prasootitantra, out of them 4 patients were discontinued. They were randomly divided in to two groups; Group A (n 12) Pandughni Vati 2 tablets of 250mg tds and Group B (n 10) Dhatri Lauha Vati 1 tablet of 250mg tds. Dhatri Lauha Vati was selected for the present study due to its Pandughna, Prinana, Raktaprasadana properties. AYUSH department has developed a compound formulation Pandughni Vati. As a part of its clinical trials the same drug was selected for present study.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Result:</title><p>Group A The result observed in Shwasa (dyspnoea) (60%) and Hridrava (palpitation) (53.33%) were highly significant statistically (&#x0003c;0.001). Daurbalya (33.33%), Shrama (fatigue) (40%), Aruchi (anorexia) (28.57%) and Pindikodvestana (55.55%) were decreased significant statistically (&#x0003c;0.05) whereas in Panduta (pallor) (24%) it was not significant. In Group B, results observed were highly significant statistically (&#x0003c;0.001) in Panduta (pallor) (50%) and Shwasa (dyspnoea) (56.25%). The results in Shrama (fatigue) (61.54%), Hridrava (palpitation) (55.55%), Aruchi (anorexia) (42.85%), Pindikodvestan, (49.49%) were significant</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusion:</title><p>On comparing the effect of therapy study was finding better percentage improvement in-group B consistently in most of subjective and objective parameters. So it can be said that Dhatri Lauha Vati has somewhatbetter results, proving it better to Pandughni Vati.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
