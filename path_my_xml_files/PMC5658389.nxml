Caffeine has the ability to release catecholamines, but its effects after exercises is little explored. The present study aims to evaluate the acute effects of caffeine on the autonomic control and cardiorespiratory parameters after moderate intensity aerobic exercise. 32 young males (23,59&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;3,45 years) were submitted to two protocols: Placebo and Caffeine, consisting of 15&#x02009;minutes of rest, 30&#x02009;minutes of exercise on a treadmill to 60% on VO2peak, followed by 60&#x02009;minutes of recovery. Heart rate variability indices and cardiorespiratory parameters were determined at different times during the protocols. The RMSSD and SD1 indices recovered faster in placebo (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05). The systolic blood pressure differences were found from the 1st to the 5th minute of recovery with the caffeine protocol and from the 1st and 3rd minute with the placebo, whereas, for diastolic blood pressure, significant differences (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001) were observed only for the caffeine protocol at the 1st and 3rd minutes of recovery. Caffeine was shown to be capable of delaying parasympathetic recovery but did not influence the behavior of the respiratory rate, oxygen saturation or frequency-domain HRV indices.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Caffeine is one of the most consumed substances in the world. It is present in various foods, such as coffee, teas, energy drinks, supplements and medicines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> and is known for its psychoactive and ergogenic capacity in long-term exercise<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. The physiological effects of caffeine have been widely studied<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> and can be attributed to its ability to stimulate the nervous system. Due to its structural similarity, caffeine can lead to the blockading of adenosine receptors (A1 and A2)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> and increase autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity through the release of plasma catecholamines, inducing tachycardia and increased blood pressure (BP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">The effects of caffeine during physical exercise have been explored<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> because of its stimulatory action, with fatigue stalling and improved performance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. However, few studies have evaluated its effects during post-exercise recovery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, which is a critical period in which several modifications occur, among them changes in autonomic modulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, which may promote an environment conducive to the development of rhythm disturbances, abnormal responses of heart rate (HR) and BP in predisposed individuals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Nevertheless, most of the studies that have evaluated the effects of caffeine supplementation on post-exercise recovery were performed with protocols of progressive and exhaustive exercises<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, studying changes in physiological variables such as HR, BP, oxygen consumption and autonomic modulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">However, results are still inconclusive.

Prior to the experimental procedure, all volunteers were advised to abstained from caffeinated and alcoholic beverages, food, and strenuous exercise for at least 24&#x02009;hours before each testing session and consume a light meal two hours before the experiment.</p><p id="Par10">The experimental procedure was divided into three stages with a minimum interval of 48&#x02009;hours between them, in order to allow adequate recovery time for the participants. Before the beginning of the first stage, body weight measurements on a digital scale (Welmy W 200/5, Brazil) and height in stadiometer (ES 2020 - Sanny, Brazil) were recorded.</p><p id="Par11">The first stage of the experimental procedure consisted of the maximum effort test. This was performed first as it was used to determine the exercise intensity in subsequent stages. The other steps were called the placebo protocol and caffeine protocol, whose order of execution was established through a randomization process using a coin.

After ingesting the capsules, volunteers performed an initial supine rest for 15&#x02009;minutes, HR values, systolic blood pressure (SBP) diastolic blood pressure (DBP), respiratory rate (RR) and pulse oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) being registered in the 15<sup>th</sup> minute.</p><p id="Par14">After these measurements, the volunteers exercised on the treadmill at a speed of 5&#x02009;km/h and slope of 1% in the first 5&#x02009;minutes for warm up, followed by 25&#x02009;minutes with work load equivalent to 60% of the VO<sub>2</sub>peak HR, with the same inclination. At the end of the activity, the volunteers were again placed in the supine position and were monitored over 60&#x02009;minutes, their HR, SBP, DBP, RR and SpO<sub>2</sub> being logged in the 1<sup>st</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup>, 5<sup>th</sup>, 7<sup>th</sup>, 10<sup>th</sup> and from then every 10<sup>th</sup> minute until the end of the recovery period.

The main findings showed that caffeine: (a) was able to delay the recovery of parasympathetic heart rate control, evaluated by RMSSD and SD1 indices, (b) also promoted a later return of SBP and DBP at baseline conditions. However, caffeine did not influence HR, RR and SpO<sub>2</sub>.</p><p id="Par31">The literature indicates that caffeine consumption increases resting values in relation to BP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. In this context, one of the mechanisms related to vasodilation in the peripheral musculature during physical exercise, resulting in post-exercise hypotension, is the release of adenosine by the active tissues. Some researchers have reported that this effect can be attenuated with caffeine use by the blockade of the receptors of adenosine A2, thus minimizing the post-exercise hypotensive effect<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par32">In our study, with the placebo protocol, SBP recovery was observed 5&#x02009;minutes after exercise. No significant differences were found for DBP between rest and recovery. However, with the caffeine protocol, SBP and DBP showed a later recovery, only after the 7<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> minute, respectively. Results similar to ours for DBP can be found in the study by Bunsawat <italic>et al</italic>., who observed that DBP values remained high for the entire 30&#x02009;minutes of the recovery period after maximal exercise, which was attributed to sympathetic nerve stimulation potentiated by caffeine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. It is worth emphasizing that the greater the intensity of exercise, the greater the stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system to meet the demands imposed by physical stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par33">An <italic>et al</italic>. found no difference in BP values during recovery after maximal exercise after the volunteers consumed a caffeine-containing energy drink at a concentration of 1.25&#x02013;2.5&#x02009;mg/kg<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. It seems that the increase in BP response in exercise caused by caffeine may be related to the dose<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, as reported by the authors, and that these alterations can also be mediated by exercise intensity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par34">During exercise recovery HR decreases in a mono-exponential way<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, and this behavior is related to the reactivation of parasympathetic activity, the level of physical condition and exercise intensity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, its recovery in the 1st minute after exercise being regarded as an important predictor of mortality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. HR recovery was observed in both protocols from the 7th minute of recovery.</p><p id="Par35">Similar responses were observed by An <italic>et al</italic>. The authors found no effect among the protocols (control protocol vs. caffeine protocols - concentrations of 1.25 and 2.5&#x02009;mg/kg)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. In the study by Bunsawat <italic>et al</italic>. there were similar HR reductions in the 1<sup>st</sup> minute of recovery in both placebo and caffeine protocols, however, from the 2<sup>nd</sup> minute of recovery the values were higher in the caffeine protocol, which was attributed to a greater sympathetic nervous stimulus and a greater performance in the stress test attributed to the consumption of caffeine (400&#x02009;mg in capsules)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par36">Regarding SpO<sub>2</sub> and RR, no significant difference was found. All volunteers presented adequate SpO<sub>2</sub> values and the physiological behavior of RR during the protocols which would be expected in healthy individuals with no related cardiopulmonary disease.</p><p id="Par37">Findings in relation to autonomic heart rate control show that, although no significant difference in baseline values was found between the protocols, the use of caffeine led to a later recovery of the RMSSD and SD1 indices, occurring in Rec2 (5<sup>th</sup> to 10<sup>th</sup> minutes of recovery) for the placebo protocol and in Rec3 (15<sup>th</sup> to 20<sup>th</sup> minutes of recovery) for the caffeine protocol. Considering that these indexes predominantly reflect the parasympathetic component of heart rate regulation, these results suggest that caffeine delays the recovery of vagal heart rate control after exercise.</p><p id="Par38">During physical exercise, HR and BP control are modified; the baroreflex is attenuated at the brainstem level due to the metaborreflex activation. Metabolic accumulation, as a result of elevated cellular metabolism, promotes the activation of the metaboreceptors. As a consequence, the stimulation of the non-myelinated afferent fibers leads to sympathetic activity, resulting in an increase in HR, cardiac output, BP and vasoconstriction in non-active muscles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par39">Previous studies show that caffeine has the effect of promoting sympathetic stimulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, which also occurs during physical exercise<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, where a higher BP and HR response are observed when compared to the control group<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. The delayed recovery of parasympathetic heart rate control shortly after exercise, as seen by the responses of the RMSSD and SD1 indices, can be attributed to a sympathetic-vagal imbalance where the increase of sympathetic stimulation as a physiological response to physical exercise was potentiated by caffeine, as suggested by Yeragani <italic>et al</italic>. which attributes the highest values of LF power, during exhaustive exercise on a cycloergometer after caffeine consumption, to increase the responsiveness of sympathetic tone to heart rate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. No significant differences were found in the frequency domain indices when the values of the recovery moments with the resting value were compared, suggesting that these indices are not sensitive to identifying the changes observed using HRV indexes in the time domain.</p><p id="Par40">Regarding global HRV, caffeine seems to have an influence, since the SDNN and SD2 indices had a time effect. The SDNN index presented higher values in the placebo protocol, reaching higher values during rest, mainly in the last moments (Rec4 to Rec6), which can be attributed to greater relaxation in the volunteers, who were in the supine position. This alteration was absent in the caffeine protocol, which may be related to caffeine&#x02019;s stimulating capacity as mentioned above.</p><p id="Par41">In our study, the SD2 index in the caffeine protocol presented the effect of time in relation to its basal value in Rec1. We attributed this to a possible increase in the responsiveness of the sympathetic component over the heart rate, as well as the delay of vagal re-entry after exercise, resulting in a higher sympathetic modulation and lower parasympathetic modulation, although such an effect was not observed in SDNN. This influence of caffeine on the response of the parasympathetic component of heart rate was studied by Jammes <italic>et al</italic>., who investigated HR responses after caffeine injection and found that caffeine was able to suppress the bradycardia induced by direct vagal stimulation in rats<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. This would be attributed to the action of caffeine as an adenosine receptor blocker.</p><p id="Par42">Because caffeine is a substance consumed to such a great extent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, there is a need for more studies to be carried out to identify its influences in different populations, establishing its benefits as well as the risks attributed to its use. Our study raises some important methodological points. Investigation sample was composed of healthy young men in order to avoid the influence of sexual hormones. For this reason, our results cannot be applied to female groups because of changes in caffeine metabolism during the menstrual cycle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> or to individuals with cardiac diseases who use drugs that affect the ANS. However, the selection of the sample, which was performed using rigorous exclusion criteria, strengthens our findings.</p><p id="Par43">The results obtained can be used as a basis for future research about the impact of caffeine on post-exercise recovery in different populations, since it exposes influences in healthy young men during recovery following moderate aerobic exercise. We did not evaluate plasma catecholamine concentrations or the sympathetic nerve activity; however, we used HRV, a simple non-invasive method and one of the most promising quantitative markers of autonomic heart rate balance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. No respiratory control was carried out during the experiments, however, volunteers were instructed to breathe normally and remain awake during rest.</p><p id="Par44">Regarding the dose of caffeine, although we did not take into consideration the volunteers&#x02019; body weight and habitual consumption of caffeine, the dose used was equal to the average amount consumed and within the recommended daily consumption. Further, they were instructed not to eat caffeine-containing foods for 24&#x02009;hours before the protocols were performed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Additionally, Corti <italic>et al</italic>. showed that acute responses are independent of habitual caffeine consumption, which could minimize this limitation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par45">In conclusion, based on our findings, caffeine ingestion prior to moderate aerobic exercise delays recovery of the parasympathetic component of autonomic heart rate control, as well as the recovery of BP at baseline levels in young male participants.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>Luiz Carlos Marques Vanderlei, Rayana Loch Gomes and Vitor Engr&#x000e1;cia Valenti contributed equally to this work.</p></fn><fn><p>
