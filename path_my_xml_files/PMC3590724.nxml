Chlorhexidine has shown distinct advantage and efficacy, but side effects such as staining of the teeth and the tongue, altered taste sensation, and increased calculus formation often deters its use for long periods.</p><p>Hence, there is a need to develop a naturally occurring, indigenous and cost-effective oral hygiene aid. One such aid could be in the form of Aloe vera extract. Aloe vera is a cactus-like plant, which is a member of the <italic>Lilaceae</italic> family. Aloe vera has anti-inflammatory properties,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] antiulcer activity,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] astringent effect, and possibility of reducing scars and enhancing wound healing.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] The above properties along with the ease of availability, with no known adverse effects and cost-effectiveness, make Aloe vera an ideal candidate for plaque control and thereby reduce gingivitis and probably later periodontitis.</p><p>Studies evaluating the effectiveness of Aloe vera incorporated in a dentifrice or as a locally applied gel showed a significant reduction of gingivitis and plaque accumulation after the use of this natural product.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>]</p><p>The purpose of this study was to assess the antiplaque and antigingivitis effect of Aloe vera in an &#x0201c;experimental gingivitis&#x0201d; model.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>A total of 148 healthy subjects (68 males and 80 females), aged 18-25 years, were selected from the student volunteers of Sri Sai College of Dental Surgery, Vikarabad, Andhra Pradesh, India [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Experimental design</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JISP-16-543-g001"/></fig><p>Permission was obtained from the Institutional Ethics Committee of the college, and informed written consent was obtained from the volunteers after explaining the methodology of the clinical trial.</p><p>Inclusion criteria involved at least one maxillary quadrant having both premolars and molars, free from restorations on palatal, buccal, and proximal surfaces and subjects with good oral hygiene.</p><p>Exclusion criteria involved probing depths greater than 3 mm, teeth with gross carious lesions, subjects undergoing orthodontic treatment, those with removable and fixed prosthesis, teeth involved by severe fluorosis, and those who received any topical or systemic antibiotic treatment during the past 3 months prior to the study.

All the three groups when using a plaque guard and at the end of its use continued to accumulate plaque and this was statistically significant. Plaque accumulation in experimental subjects with cessation of oral hygiene (tooth brushing) is an established method in gingivitis and oral hygiene product evaluation.</p><p>This study was intended not only to study plaque accumulation but also its effect in eliciting gingival tissue response. Hence, a total period of 14 days of oral hygiene cessation was permitted before the soft tissue status could be recorded. This was in accordance with the studies by Lorenz <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] on chlorhexidine and Ramberg <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] on triclosan. All these studies emulate the classic and pioneering work of Loe and Schiot.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>]</p><p>This study, however, differed from the above studies in that the subjects instead of total abstinence from oral hygiene only abstained from brushing in few selected teeth area. To abstain from total oral hygiene from 14 days is inconvenient. To overcome such limitations, Rosen <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] introduced an ingenious method in the form of a plaque guard. This study has drawn inspiration from Rosen's study and most of the subjects did not complain either about abstinence from oral hygiene or any discomfort from wearing the appliance.</p><p>Aloe vera possesses various beneficial properties such as anti-inflammatory[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] (due to the presence of sterols and anthraquinones), antiseptic activity[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] (due to the presence of lupeol, salicylic acid, phenols, sulphur), and also has the capability to enhance wound healing.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] Aloe vera inhibits the cyclooxygenase pathway and reduces prostaglandin synthesis form arachidonic acid, thus reducing inflammation. Hence, the reduction in gingival index scores can be attributed to components of Aloe vera which have anti-inflammatory properties.</p><p>The antimicrobial effect of Aloe vera has been demonstrated in an <italic>in vitro</italic> study by Lee <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] wherein it was reported to inhibit the growth of diverse oral microorganisms such as Streptococcus <italic>mutans</italic>, <italic>Streptococcus sanguis, Actinomyces viscosus</italic>, and <italic>Candida albicans</italic>. The low plaque scores at the conclusion of the study could be attributed to the antibacterial properties of Aloe vera.</p><p>Both test and positive control groups showed reduction in plaque scores significantly, whereas placebo did not show any reduction; in fact plaque scores were increased. It indicates the ability of Aloe vera and chlorhexidine in plaque reduction as significant, but the level of significance is more with chlorhexidine usage. It nonetheless indicates that Aloe vera can also effectively reduce experimentally induced plaque accumulation.</p><p>Comparing the three groups in their ability to reduce gingival scores, it is observed that Aloe vera reduced gingival score, placebo also reduced gingival score, but the difference in mean reduction was more with the use of Aloe vera than placebo. The reduction of gingival score by Aloe vera and chlorhexidine is comparable and not significant. The use of chlorhexidine and placebo did reduce gingival scores and this reduction was not appreciable or significant in favor of chlorhexidine.</p><p>All the three groups showed reduced gingival scores irrespective of whether they are on Aloe vera, chlorhexidine, or placebo, but there are levels of difference which are difficult to interpret and probably needs a finer calibration. Aloe vera group showed statistically significant difference in gingival bleeding scores compared with placebo groups. Chlorhexidine use reduced gingival bleeding scores but such reductions in bleeding scores when compared with Aloe vera are not significant.</p><p>A recapitulation of the effect of three interventions indicates that Aloe vera and chlorhexidine had a definitive impact on plaque reduction but showed unpredictable and variable effect on gingivitis and gingival bleeding, with even patients on placebo showing marginal improvement instead of deterioration. This once again stresses the view point that plaque control is essentially a mechanical oriented (tooth brushing) method and use of mouth wash, however, effective, is only an adjunct in oral hygiene regimen.</p><sec id="sec2-7"><title>Highlights and limitations of the study</title><p>The cessation from regular oral hygiene is an inconvenient and embarrassing prerequisite in any mouthrinse study. This has been offset by the use of a plaque guard. The idea of using a plaque guard as introduced by Rosen <italic>et al</italic>. and implemented in this study could be a useful tool in future mouthrinse trials.</p><p>This study was conducted on student volunteers who are cohesive, well educated, and sensitized subjects to oral hygiene. The compliance and adherence to treatment protocols are thoroughly understood by them and such follow-up cannot be translated to patients belonging to common strata of society.</p><p>The substantivity of Aloe vera mouthrinse is to be established by in vitro microbiological tests before it's frequency of use can be established.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Aloe vera when used at full strength reduced accumulated plaque significantly. Within the limits of the clinical study, it may be concluded that the mouth wash containing Aloe vera showed significant reduction of plaque and gingivitis, but when compared with chlorhexidine, this was less significant.</p><p>Researchers are becoming interested in alternative therapies of plaque control using natural products as opposed to synthetic agents. Within the limitations of this study, Aloe vera did have an antiplaque and antigingivitis effect. If the potential benefit is confirmed through long-term studies, Aloe vera could be an alternative to chlorhexidine from its <italic>numero Uno</italic> position and could be valuable in patients who are seeking a chemical-free, indigenous, and patient-friendly oral hygiene aid.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn
