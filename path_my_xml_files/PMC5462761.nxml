In the present study we aimed to elucidate whether tDCS could affect temperature and pain perceptions in healthy subjects testing different stimulation parameters. A total of 20 healthy subjects were studied by means of quantitative sensory testing. Two different experiments were performed. First, we studied the effects of 15&#x02009;minutes 2&#x02009;mA anodal transcranial direct current stimulation applied over left M1 and parietal cortex in two separated sessions. Then, we tested the effects of 5&#x02009;minutes tDCS over M1 by means of a sham controlled design to optimize the possibility to study minimal effects of tDCS using different polarities (cathodal and anodal) and intensities (1 and 2&#x02009;mA). 2&#x02009;mA anodal tDCS, when applied for both 15 and 5&#x02009;minutes over the motor cortex, increased cold perception threshold. Conversely, motor cortex cathodal tDCS modulated cold perception threshold only when 1&#x02009;mA intensity was used. M1-tDCS can modify the temperature perception; these effects are polarity and intensity dependent. As stimulation intensity seems critical to determine the effects, we suggest that for clinical application strong anodal tDCS (&#x0003e;1&#x02009;mA) or weak cathodal tDCS (&#x0003c;2&#x02009;mA) should be used for pain control.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Treatment of chronic pain (CP) is often difficult and satisfactory pain control is not always achieved. However, invasive motor cortex stimulation (MCS) and non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques have emerged as a potential therapy and have been reported to be highly successful in a proportion of treated patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. However, although MCS is generally effective in pain relief, a conspicuous number of patients are not-responders. A high number of not-responders is unwanted and favours the expansion of the less expensive NIBS techniques over the neurosurgical techniques.</p><p>Non-invasive methods of brain stimulation, including repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) are able to induce long lasting effects within the human motor cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> and have been used to treat pain. Anodal tDCS over primary motor cortex (M1) promotes an increase in cortical excitability, while cathodal tDCS induces a reduction of cortical excitability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, furthermore it was shown that the longer the duration of tDCS, the longer the induced after-effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. As far as it concerns cathodal tDCS, increasing intensity from 1&#x02009;mA to 2&#x02009;mA can switch motor cortex excitability inhibition into excitation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Also, as intensity increases, the induced electric field goes deeper into the brain so that it is conceivable that the orientation and distance of the axonal or dendritic-somatic axis with respect to the electrical field could affect the resulting biological and clinical effects unexpectedly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Finally, it is important to consider that little variations of electrode size area, shape, or placement (montage) can strongly influence the &#x0201c;diffusion&#x0201d; of the current and the geometry of the induced DC fields into the brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.</p><p>Many prior studies have evaluated the effects of tDCS on different temperature and pain perception in healthy volunteers.

</p><p>Quantitative sensory testing (QST) is a standardized method that allows the evaluation of temperature and pain perceptions by means of different kinds of thermal stimuli (warm, hot inducing pain, cold and cold inducing pain) thus providing information about each of the physiological pathways involved<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. More in detail, QST provides the opportunity for assessment for A&#x003b4;-fibres and C-fibres that are involved respectively in temperature cold and warm perception and nociception (cold pain and hot pain)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>.</p><p>To elucidate whether tDCS could affect temperature and pain perceptions in healthy subjects, we performed a double-blind study in which we evaluated the effects of 15&#x02009;min 2 mA-tDCS on temperature and pain perception as measured by QST: we chose this tDCS protocol since it is commonly used to obtain pain relief in clinical applications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. In order to disclose a possible site-specificity of tDCS effects we applied the neuromodulatory protocol over M1 and parietal cortex (Pcor). Moreover, in a separate experimental session, we tested the effects of a very short tDCS protocol (5&#x02009;min, cathodal and anodal, M1) by using a placebo-controlled double blind study to disclose the polarity and intensity dependency of the effects of tDCS on thermal and pain perceptions. Contemporary, by means of these experiments, we aimed to test which QST parameters can be used as a biomarker of the effects of tDCS, possibly to be used in future study about its application in pain treatment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Subjects</title><p>Ten healthy volunteers (7 women, 3 men, mean age 31.9&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;4.9 (SD) years, range 27&#x02013;41 years) were studied by applying anodal tDCS 2&#x02009;mA for 15&#x02009;minutes over two different cerebral targets, M1 and Pcor.

The magnetic stimulus had a biphasic waveform with a pulse width of about 300 &#x003bc;s. During the first phase of the stimulus, the current in the center of the coil flowed towards the handle.

When main effects or interactions were found, Tukey&#x02019;s honest significant difference test was used for post-hoc comparisons.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>As previously reported by other authors using QST<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> baseline cold threshold was lower than warm threshold (0.68&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.35&#x02009;&#x000b0;C vs 0.92&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.49&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.008 unpaired <italic>t</italic> test) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec16" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The present study shows that motor cortex 2 mA-anodal tDCS, applied for both 5&#x02009;min and 15&#x02009;min, increased cold perception thresholds. Moreover the absence of effects when stimulating a non-motor cortex such as Pcor were demonstrated by applying 2 mA-anodal tDCS for 15&#x02009;min. Hitherto, a single session of 15&#x02009;min of anodal tDCS at 2&#x02009;mA delivered over the motor or parietal cortex was unable to modulate pain perceptions. Moreover, when anodal tDCS was delivered with a smaller intensity (1&#x02009;mA) and for 5&#x02009;minutes, no effects on temperature and pain perceptions were found.</p><p>As far cold perception concerns, our findings are in line with previous studies. Indeed, Borckardt and co-workers, using a high definition tDCS montage, found that 20&#x02009;min tDCS delivered at an intensity of 2&#x02009;mA modified heat and cold sensory perception when anodal stimulation was used while no effects were found in heat pain threshold and just a small effect on cold pain threshold<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. More in details, they reported that after stimulation lower temperatures were required to detect a change induced by cold stimuli. Furthermore, higher temperatures were required to detect a change induced by warm stimuli. On the other hand, we did not find any effects on the warm perception and cold and hot pain perception.</p><p>Moreover another study described that 2&#x02009;mA anodal stimulation of the primary motor area can be utilized to alleviate cold pain perception<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. However it should be considered that these groups found some effects on pain and this discrepancy respect our data could be due to the use of HD-tDCS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> that is characterized by a different spatial profile of induced brain current flow. On the other hand, Zandieh <italic>et al</italic>. (2012) evaluated the effects of 2&#x02009;mA tDCS over cold pain threshold by using cold pressor test, so that the different evaluation methodology could have accounted for the slight different results<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. In addition, it should be considered that the effects induced by tDCS are considerably affected by the presence of a large inter-subject variability as it was shown by similar studies using other forms of non-invasive brain stimulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. In this light, the differences between our results and those from other groups could be also influenced by this large intersubjects variability and by the relatively little size of the studied cohorts.</p><p>Our data also suggest that anodal tDCS increases cold perception threshold by a dose-dependent mechanism in which intensity bigger than 1&#x02009;mA is required. Furthermore we also observed that 5&#x02009;minutes 1mA-cathodal tDCS applied over M1 significantly increased cold perception threshold, while no effects were found when using sham stimulation. This result was similar to the effects of 2mA-anodal tDCS. It should be noted that we found positive results only when tDCS was applied over M1 and not over Pcor. Since our main results consist in the modulation of not painful perception (i.e. cold perception), it could be expected that Pcor location was the most effective site of application. However Craig <italic>et al</italic>. found that the application of innocuous cold stimuli activates insula and not primary somatosensory cortex. Nevertheless, painful heat and cold stimuli activated the contralateral anterior cingulate cortex, contralateral primary motor, primary sensory cortex (S1), bilateral secondary sensory cortex, midinsular cortex, thalamus, and cerebellum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Furthermore, functional neuroimaging also disclosed remote and widespread effects of tDCS and rTMS when focally applied to the primary motor or premotor cortex through fibres that project to remote cortical or subcortical structures involved in cognitive-emotional or discriminative aspects of sensorial experience and pain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>: thus it is not surprising that the stimulation of M1 is crucial in the modulation of thermal perception thresholds.</p><p>It is important to keep in mind that the tDCS we used cannot be considered &#x0201c;strictly&#x0201d; focal. Indeed, due to the large size of the tDCS electrodes (35&#x02009;cm<sup>2</sup>) and the montage we used, it cannot be ruled out that when tDCS electrodes are placed over M1, the tDCS stimulation can affect also the parietal cortex (and vice versa). Indeed, a non focal effect of tDCS over M1 may spread to Pcor. This seems not to be the case, at least using the polarity (anodal) and the parameters we used here, as tDCS delivered over Pcor is less effective in modulating temperature sensory perception than M1 stimulation. Hitherto, we found a tendency to increase in the cold perception threshold after 2&#x02009;mA anodal tDCS over Pcor (similar to the effects of M1 stimulation) that can be explained (may be not exclusively) by a spreading of the currents towards the M1.</p><p>Another interesting point from our results is that also 5&#x02009;min cathodal stimulation induced an increase in cold perception threshold. Other groups found similar results, for example Bachmann <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> reported that cathodal stimulation of the primary motor area reduced sensitivity of A-fibers to somatosensory input (cold detection thresholds)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Also, effects of the stimulation of the left S1 on thermal perception were found, with cathodal tDCS increasing cold detection thresholds in both hands and warm detection thresholds only in the contralateral hand<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. In both cases tDCS was delivered at 1&#x02009;mA intensity and cathodal stimulation was the most efficient when compared with anodal or sham stimulation.</p><p>Furthermore it should be considered that the net effect of motor cortex stimulation may be a mixed effect, as cathodal tDCS may also exert a &#x0201c;facilitatory effect&#x0201d; by deactivating inhibitory interneurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup> thus, hypothetically explaining the similar effects induced by cathodal and anodal tDCS in the present study.</p><p>We found no effect over pain thresholds. Ihle <italic>et al</italic>.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>, developed a study using functional imaging to explore the underpinnings of the previously suggested antinociceptive effects of tDCS over the motor cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. They found that neither cathodal nor anodal tDCS over the left M1 (1&#x02009;mA, 15&#x02009;minutes) significantly changed cortical nociceptive processing as a response to a heat pain paradigm when compared with sham stimulation. Only contrasting the interaction between responses to anodal and cathodal stimulation, It was found a substantial polarity-specific differences of regional brain activation after painful stimulation: anodal stimulation induced a decrease of regional Cerebral Blood Flow (rCBF), whereas cathodal stimulation resulted in an increase of rCBF in the hypothalamus, inferior parietal cortex, inferior parietal lobule, anterior insula, and precentral gyrus contralateral to the stimulation site<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>.</p><p>In sum, here we suggest the importance of evaluating the most efficient combination of intensity/polarity and site of stimulation for better results, since at the best of our knowledge this is the only work evaluating different intensities, polarities and cortical targets in the same study. As far as the parietal cortex stimulation, we found only mild effects. We cannot exclude that longer stimulation sessions or repeated sessions may have an effects on temperature perception. More studies would be done to better clarify these considerations.</p><p>We are aware that the findings obtained from healthy subjects have to be cautiously transferred to the patients. On the other hand, the effects of neuromodulation techniques in physiological conditions need to be understood before to think the multiple mechanisms that can condition the clinical response of the patients suffering for pain and sensory disturbances.</p><p>We can conclude that tDCS delivered over the motor cortex can modify the temperature perception and that these effects are polarity and intensity dependent. As stimulation intensity seems critical to determine the effects, we suggest that for clinical application strong anodal tDCS (&#x0003e;1&#x02009;mA) or weak cathodal tDCS (&#x0003c;2&#x02009;mA) should be used for pain control (in the attempt of reducing inconsistencies).</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>
