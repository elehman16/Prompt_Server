Decreased availability of brain 5-HT is thought to be associated with a number of psychiatric conditions and pathological behaviors, such as depressive disorders, impulsivity and risk-taking behavior, alcohol abuse, anxiety disorders, other difficulties in emotional and regulatory functioning (<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>), eating disorders (<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>), and attention disorders (<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Specifically, 5-HT is involved in controlling motor output and behavioral inhibition (<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) and the processing of aversive outcomes (<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).</p><p>To study the effects of central nervous system 5-HT function, several methods, such as assessments of the 5-HT metabolite 5-Hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) in cerebral spinal fluids, the prolactin fenfluramine challenge test (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), and dietary approaches such as acute tryptophan depletion (ATD) (<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) have been used. Briefly, the underlying principles of the dietary ATD procedure involve the oral administration of an amino acid (AA) beverage that lacks the essential amino acid tryptophan (TRP), the physiological precursor of 5-HT, which leads to a diminished rate of synthesis of 5-HT in the central nervous system due to decreased substrate availability (<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). A newly developed body weight&#x02013;adapted ATD challenge procedure termed Moja-De (<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) has shown to be an effective and safe dietary method to transiently reduce central nervous system 5-HT synthesis to investigate the effects of lowered central nervous 5-HT availability on different aspects of human behavior (<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) including cognitive (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) and affective (<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) processes in healthy adults (<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) and patient populations (<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>).</p><p>Studies investigating the effects of dietary ATD administration on cognition and behavior have produced diverse and mixed results (<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Brain 5-HT availability as altered by dietary ATD protocols has been linked to inhibitory and aversive functioning (<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). The joint presence and interplay of inhibitory demands and error-related punishment in common behavioral inhibition tasks impedes the disclosure of the specific role of brain 5-HT in aversive processing. The question remains unanswered, whether 5-HT modulates motor responses, sensitivities toward the prospects of punishment, or behavioral adjustments following aversive outcomes. Recently, a novel task designed to selectively assess the effects of ATD on inhibition and aversive responding was implemented in healthy adult subjects (<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), and the results suggested that dietary ATD administration and decreased brain 5-HT synthesis lead to significant reductions in punishment-induced inhibition, while leaving general motor inhibition and global sensitivity to aversive outcomes unaffected. The authors of this study concluded that 5-HT might be critical for neither punishment processing nor behavioral inhibition but might be specifically critical for the inhibition that is induced by the prospect of aversive consequences (<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). In light of these findings, we sought to apply a more refined dietary ATD procedure to this novel behavioral inhibition task.</p><p>The body weight&#x02013;adapted Moja-De ATD protocol has shown to have significantly fewer side effects (nausea, headaches, etc.), which allow its use in children and adolescents (<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Moreover, this particular dietary ATD protocol was recently validated in an animal model and shown to specifically reduce brain 5-HT synthesis in two strains of mice (<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p><p>Here, we conducted a reinforced categorization task originally introduced by Crockett et al. (<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) using a further developed, body weight&#x02013;adapted dietary ATD protocol. Moja-De ATD has proven to be a highly effective method to temporarily lower serum and cortical TRP availability in rodents (<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) and humans (<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) and resulted in fewer aversive side effects allowing its use in children and adolescents (<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Moreover, regarding the punishment-related processing of information, we modified the task conditions with respect to the performance consequences. The present study examined the effects of dietary ATD Moja-De administration on behavioral inhibition with an established task (<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) that emphasizes intrinsic motivation without providing immediate and explicit performance-based monetary rewards. Moreover, gender confounds in ATD-related research have been reported (<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), and gender-dependent differences in brain 5-HT synthesis have also been published (<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Therefore, we opted to balance gender in the present sample. As a result of our modifications to the protocol, we expected a lower rate of unintended aversive side effects associated with an optimized ATD-related dosing scheme and a higher global task adherence due to higher intrinsic motivation. Hence, we hypothesized a less pronounced detrimental effect of dietary ATD administration on response accuracy and response times (RTs) in the reinforced categorization task compared with previous findings.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="S0002"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S0002-S20001"><title>Subjects</title><p>Twenty-four healthy adult volunteers (12 females/12 males; mean age=25.4 years) attended two test sessions on two different study days (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T0001">Table 1</xref> provides the characteristics of the analyzed study sample).

Participants&#x02019; morning arrivals at the study site were preceded by a 12-h overnight protein fast, and a standardized breakfast that was low in TRP. A part of the sample received ATD on day 1, followed by administration of a balanced control mixture containing TRP (BAL) on their second day of testing. The remaining subjects received the same challenge procedures in the reverse order. Testing days were spaced at least 7 days apart. Prior to the intake of the AA mixtures in an aqueous suspension, urine drug screenings, pregnancy tests for the female participants, and the collection of baseline blood samples (T0) were performed. In addition, three blood samples were taken 90 min (T1), 180 min (T2), and 270 min (T3) after AA challenge intake (ATD/BAL). Plasma levels of total TRP, free TRP, and the ratio of free TRP to other large neutral amino acids (LNAA) were assessed at all four time points.

The BAL mixture contained the same quantities with an additional 0.7 g of TRP per 10 kg body weight.

A detailed description of the task has been published by Crockett et al. (<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Briefly, the stimulus material consisted of bicolor checkerboards with a total of 25 rectangles. Depending on the task, these checkerboards contained either a greater or fewer number of the target color squares. Target to non-target square ratios were 16 to 9 or 9 to 16 for easy problems, and 13 to 12 or 12 to 13 for difficult problems. If the target squares were in the majority, a button press (&#x02018;go&#x02019;) was demanded, and if the target squares were in the minority, withholding of the motor response (&#x02018;no-go&#x02019;) was required. Easy and difficult trials were equally and pseudorandomly distributed in all blocks. Response outcomes were presented immediately after each trial and depended on response accuracies and the specific response bias condition. To investigate subjects&#x02019; responses to rewards and punishments, four distinct response&#x02013;feedback conditions were applied (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Fig. 1</xref>). In order to selectively bias subjects' responding, correct motor responses were specifically reinforced by greater gains (Reward go and Reward no-go) or incorrect motor responses were punished by greater deductions (Punish go and Punish no-go). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref> depicts all four response-outcome contingencies and the magnitude of gains and deductions for all possible task&#x02013;response combinations. To prevent carryover effects from previous response bias conditions, blocks of neutral non-reinforced trials were interposed between the reinforcement blocks. The stimulus presentation durations were set individually based on the individual performance during a practice round prior to the actual measurement. Commission error rate (CE) and RTs of correct responses were assessed as outcome measures. For detailed description of the task see Crockett et al. (<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Our experimental settings were designed to allow for a replication of the original study with the two differences discussed above; that is, the specific ATD procedure and the parameters of the performance-based rewards.</p><fig id="F0001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>The Response-outcome contingency conditions consisted of four blocks of trials, each of which selectively rewarded correct responses or punished incorrect responses. Reward conditions emphasized correct go responses (reward go &#x02013; RG) or correct response inhibition (reward no-go &#x02013; RN). Punishment conditions emphasized consequences of incorrect go responses (punish go &#x02013; PG) or incorrect response inhibitions (punish no-go &#x02013; PN). Each block was associated with specific gains or deductions for correct or incorrect responding. For trials of the stimulus&#x02013;response condition RG, correct Go responses (Hit) were associated with high gains (+10 points) and correct inhibitions (CI) were rewarded with moderate gains (+1 point), whereas all incorrect responding, that is, commission errors (i.e. pressing the button when not required, CE) and omission errors (i.e. not pressing the button when required, OE) had no consequences (&#x000b1;0). The same was true for the RN condition, except that the magnitude of gains for Hit and CI were swapped. During trials of the punishment conditions (PG and PN), incorrect responses (i.e. CE and OE) were accordingly associated with high (&#x02212;10 points) and moderate (&#x02212;1 point) deductions. Correct responses had no consequences (&#x000b1;0). Neutral blocks without gains or deductions were presented before and between the four reinforcement blocks. Subjects received feedback about their response outcomes immediately after each trial.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="FNR-59-28443-g001"/></fig></sec><sec id="S0002-S20005"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Serotonin manipulation was evaluated by analyses of the blood samples that were taken at four time points (before intake, and 90, 180, and 270 min after intake). Laboratory assessments included the levels of total plasma tryptophan, free tryptophan, and the ratio of free tryptophan to other large amino acids (fTRP/&#x003a3;LNAA). Analyses of the behavioral data were conducted following the procedures of Crockett et al. (<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) with some minor differences. Our general behavioral analysis included preprocessed data regarding CE rates, response biases, and normalized RTs from all four experimental reinforcement conditions. Repeated-measures ANOVAs (SPSS 19) including gender as a covariate and treatment and feedback type and response bias (Go/No-go) as within-subject factors were conducted. Individually adjusted z-scores (normalized against matched non-reinforced trials) for RTs were processed and included in all computations. Motor response inhibition was assessed by examining the CE rates (i.e. incorrect no-go responses) and RTs of correct go responses. Reward and punishment signaling was assessed by measuring response adjustments based on response-outcome contingencies. The influence of ATD on discrimination of the prospects of small and large gains and losses was tested. The tendency to favor more beneficial responses in accordance with the outcome bias was assessed with the natural log of &#x003b2; (or ln(&#x003b2;)) from signal detection theory (<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>).</p><p>Punishment-induced inhibition was assessed by comparing the RTs of correct go responses in the punishment conditions to those of the reward and neutral conditions.

Our study detected marked reductions in absolute and relative plasma TRP levels after ATD administration. There is converging evidence that ATD Moja-De decreases brain 5-HT synthesis in rodents (<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) and humans (<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Moreover, ATD-Moja-De was used in combination with neuroimaging techniques (<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), which is of particular importance when it comes to studying the impact of AD related precursor availability and its impact on brain function (<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). However, the concept of dietary ATD administration has recently been questioned with respect to the specificity of its effects on central nervous system 5-HT (<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>), but there is clear and convincing evidence that ATD diminishes central nervous 5-HT synthesis (<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>).</p><p>Regarding behavioral performance after AA intake, the previously reported ATD-related reductions in response accuracy did not replicate in this study. Our data support previous findings that ATD does not influence executive function performance per se (<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). The observed performance improvements after ATD administration, particularly faster responding, have previously been reported for memory tasks (<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>), executive functions (<xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>), and emotion recognition tasks (<xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). This raises the question of whether the previously reported performance alterations were due to reduced central nervous 5-HT synthesis itself or due to nonspecific accompanying effects. Presumably reduced side effects by the body weight&#x02013;adapted ATD protocol could account for a reduction of biasing of behavioral performance. Thus, the minimization of aversive effects may have contributed to the minimization of detrimental effects on performance that have previously been observed after ATD. It has been suggested that ATD might affect the cognitive and executive performance of specific populations; that is, populations with schizophrenia (<xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>), Parkinson's disease (<xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>), remitted depressed patients (<xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>), subjects with family histories of alcoholism (<xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>), and menopausal women (<xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>).</p><p>It has been argued that processing of reward and punishment accesses separate motivational systems and is also mediated by distinct underlying neural substrates. On the one hand, reward processes are thought to be associated with dopaminergic neurons in the dorsal and ventral striatum (<xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). On the other hand, punishment-related processes have been linked to activation predominantly in the inferior frontal gyrus and, specifically, in the insular cortex. From a neurochemical viewpoint, punishment is believed to be linked to the serotonergic system that originates in the median raphe nucleus (<xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>).</p><p>Some methodological issues of the present findings also deserve consideration. Participation in the present study was monetarily compensated at the end of each session. However, in contrast to the original study design, task performance was not immediately reinforced by monetary rewards. Moreover, the better accuracy and speed performances of our sample compared with the sample of Crockett et al. (<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) suggest that motivation was generally higher, more persistent, and that the experimental compliance was better in this study. Moreover, the sample of the original study displayed high CE rates, partially around chance level (<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). This might indicate an excessive tradeoff toward (global) reward optimization at the expense of the compliance with the task instructions, triggered by the prospect of immediate monetary gains.</p><p>In contrast, social acceptance has been shown to serve as a strong reinforcer (<xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). It has been reported that social gratification processes rely on neural pathways that are comparable to those of monetary reward (<xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). In addition, negative social reinforcements can be applied and can actually be perceived as punishments in experimental settings. In this context, aversive conditioning (loss/punishment) with primary (sounds/odors) (<xref rid="CIT0051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>) and secondary reinforcers (<xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>) modulate perception and influence discriminatory sensitivity for loss-related stimuli. Consequently, altered perceptual thresholds and generalization effects have been observed (<xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). Because reward and motivational mechanisms occur at the perceptual level, task-related top&#x02013;down processes may be compromised and thus result in inferior task performance despite elevated motivational levels. Loss of discriminatory sensitivity as a result of punishment conditioning could lead to reduced discriminatory accuracy (i.e. the commission of more punishable errors or decisions) and result in even more aversive outcomes. In other words, the consequences of erroneous decisions could directly lead to elevated rates of erroneous decisions in a discrimination task. Finally, the question of whether gains and losses differently impact the mechanisms relevant to perceptual decision-making has been raised, particularly with respect to the recent evidence of the distinct processing of loss and gain prospects in the brain (<xref rid="CIT0053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>).</p><p>Notably, the characteristics of the samples varied between the two studies. Whereas the original study (<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) included nearly twice as many female as male subjects, our aim was to ensure an equal gender distribution in the present study. Brain 5-HT synthesis rates have been found to be significantly lower in female subjects than in with males (<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). A large meta-analysis reported that females are more vulnerable to the effects of dietary ATD administration in terms of cognitive processing (<xref rid="CIT0055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). There is also evidence that gonadal steroids have regulatory influences on the reward system in female rats (<xref rid="CIT0056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). While some studies have exclusively included male (<xref rid="CIT0053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>) or female subjects (<xref rid="CIT0057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>), we decided to include an equal number of both and include gender as a covariate in our statistical analysis. Several behavioral studies have shown that females exhibit greater memory impairments after ATD (<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) than males. Administration of ATD has been shown impair declarative memory to a greater extent in females (<xref rid="CIT0055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). In addition, the negative mood-inducing effects of dietary ATD have been reported to be greater in women than in men (<xref rid="CIT0058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>). Imaging studies suggest marked gender differences in social and monetary reward paradigms in terms of task performance on the behavioral and the neural levels. For example, male subjects are behaviorally more sensitive to increasing levels of monetary reward compared with social reward. In addition, males exhibit a more widespread pattern of brain activation in response to anticipated monetary (but not social) rewards than female subjects. In contrast, women exhibit a balanced pattern of cortical activation pattern in response to increasing levels of social and monetary rewards (<xref rid="CIT0061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>). Given these sex-related differences, future studies should carefully control for gonadal steroid levels (menstrual cycle), and imaging studies should incorporate designs that factorize sex hormone levels and activations of the neural substrates of the reward and punishment systems related to behavioral performance. However, our body weight&#x02013;adapted dietary depletion protocol was not affected by gender confounds in this sample. Apart from the overall slower behavioral responding of females, no task or task-by-treatment interaction effects were observed.</p><p>Besides the above-mentioned advantages of the ATD Moja-De protocol, this study has some limitations. While the present study was carefully balanced in terms of gender and homogenous in terms of demographic parameters, the sample size of the present study was rather small but comparable with other previous experimental dietary challenge studies using ATD. However, there was no significant interaction between treatment, treatment order and gender. Also, it should be noted that menstrual cycle and hormone status of the female participants were not controlled for in this particular study as it was done in a subsequent study (<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). However, although this is common practice in most ATD-related mixed gender studies, a possible modulatory effect of the order of challenge administration and hormone status on our female sample cannot be ruled out, and should be addressed in future studies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="S0005"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, the present study indicates that the body weight&#x02013;adapted dietary Moja-De ATD procedure is a useful physiological method for effectively reducing central nervous 5-HT synthesis in healthy adult volunteers. This method produced marked effects on behavioral performance in an elaborate selective inhibition response task. Reduced central nervous system 5-HT levels correlated with faster responding and enhanced overall performance accuracy (i.e. reduced error rates). In the light of the discrepancies between the present findings and previous findings, further explorations of the specific role of 5-HT in aversive prediction and the relation of 5-HT to the reward system should be conducted.</p></sec></body><back><sec id="S0006"><title>Conflict of interest and funding</title><p>FDZ was the recipient of an unrestricted award donated by the American Psychiatric Association (APA), the American Psychiatric Institute for Research and Education (APIRE), and AstraZeneca (Young Minds in Psychiatry Award).
