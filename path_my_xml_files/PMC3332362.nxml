Although exercise stress is the preferred modality, many patients are unable to exercise sufficiently because of age and physical limitations. Pharmacologic stress agents, such as adenosine and dipyridamole, are commonly used as effective substitutes for exercise stress in the diagnosis and prognosis of CAD in these individuals. Adenosine and dipyridamole are non-selective adenosine agonist stress agents which induce coronary hyperemia directly or indirectly via adenosine 2A (A<sub>2A</sub>) cell membrane G-protein-coupled receptors found in abundance on arteriolar smooth muscle cells. However, they also act on other adenosine receptor subtypes, such as A<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>2B</sub>, and A<sub>3</sub> adenosine receptors, causing frequent clinically important side effects (e.g., atrioventricular block, peripheral vasodilation, and bronchoconstriction) as well as other less serious side effects.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref> Logically, one may assume that a pharmacologic stress agent that selectively targets the A<sub>2A</sub> receptor would provide adequate coronary vasodilatation for SPECT and lessen or avoid other undesirable side effects.</p><p>Regadenoson is a selective A<sub>2A</sub> receptor agonist that was approved for use as a pharmacologic stressor for SPECT by the US Food and Drug Administration in April 2008.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref> The affinity of regadenoson for adenosine A<sub>2A</sub> receptors is 9-fold greater than for adenosine A<sub>1</sub> receptors, and it has a very low affinity for A<sub>2B</sub> and A<sub>3</sub> receptors.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref> Regadenoson has a triphasic half-life. The half-life of the initial phase is 2-4&#x000a0;minutes and coincides with the period of maximal coronary hyperemia; the second phase is 15-30&#x000a0;minutes and is not associated with a pharmacodynamic effect, as evidenced by resolution of side effects; and the terminal half-life is approximately 2&#x000a0;h. The extended terminal half-life is not considered clinically significant, as accumulation is not a risk following administration of a single intravenous (IV) bolus dose.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></p><p>A significant proportion of patients referred for pharmacologic stress SPECT are elderly.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref> Many of these individuals are likely to have chronic kidney disease (CKD). This results from the gradual decline in GFR with age of approximately 0.4&#x000a0;mL/minute/year and the prevalence of comorbidities, such as diabetes and hypertension, that are associated with the development of CKD.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref> Thus, it is important to assess the safety and tolerability of regadenoson in this population.

Subjects also had diagnosed CAD or &#x02265;2 of the following CAD risk factors: type 2 diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, current or history of cigarette smoking (minimum 10 pack-years exposure), or obesity (body mass index &#x0003e;30&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>). Subjects had no specific indication for cardiac imaging.</p><p>Subjects were excluded if they had other clinically significant illnesses (e.g., neurologic, gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic, cardiovascular, metabolic, endocrine, hematologic, or psychiatric disorders), medical conditions, or laboratory abnormalities within 2&#x000a0;weeks prior to screening that, in the investigator&#x02019;s judgment, might interfere with study assessments; second- or third-degree heart block or sinus node dysfunction in the absence of a functioning pacemaker; symptomatic hypotension; allergy or intolerance to aminophylline or regadenoson and its excipients; or a hemoglobin level &#x02264;9&#x000a0;g/dL. Also excluded were women who were pregnant, lactating, or of childbearing potential and not using contraception, subjects who were participating in another clinical trial or had received an investigational drug in the 30&#x000a0;days prior to screening, and those who had undergone surgery in the previous 3&#x000a0;months. Subjects with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were not excluded from the trial. However, no formal criteria were included in the protocol to specifically capture whether subjects had these coexisting conditions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study Design and Treatments</title><p>This Phase 4, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical trial was conducted at 32 sites in the United States (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00863707). The first participant was enrolled in April 2009 and the study was completed (last subject last visit) in December 2009. The study was conducted in compliance with the principles of the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use and Good Clinical Practice. The protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee of each study center. Each participant signed a written informed consent form prior to any study-related procedures.</p><p>Following a screening visit, eligible subjects returned to the clinic within 3&#x000a0;weeks and were randomized to double-blind treatment with either regadenoson 0.4&#x000a0;mg/5&#x000a0;mL or matching placebo using a 2:1 (regadenoson:placebo) computer-generated randomization schedule prepared by the sponsor prior to study initiation. The study drug was administered as a single IV bolus injection over 10&#x000a0;seconds, followed immediately by a 5&#x000a0;mL 0.9% sodium chloride USP (saline) flush. If necessary, aminophylline was given in doses ranging from 50 to 250&#x000a0;mg by slow IV injection (50-100&#x000a0;mg over 30-60&#x000a0;seconds) to attenuate severe and/or persistent adverse reactions. Subjects were monitored in the clinic for 8-h post-dose; clinically stable subjects were then discharged. The follow-up visit was conducted 24&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;4&#x000a0;h after study drug administration.</p><p>Subjects were required to abstain from eating and drinking for 30&#x000a0;minutes before and after dosing, and from smoking for 3&#x000a0;h before to 8&#x000a0;h after dosing. Foods and beverages containing methylxanthines (i.e., caffeine, theobromine, or theophylline) and medications containing theophylline were prohibited from 12&#x000a0;h before study drug administration to the follow-up visit. Dipyridamole was withheld for at least 2&#x000a0;days prior to dosing.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Safety Assessments</title><p>Adverse events (coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities [MedDRA] version 11.1 terms) were collected from the time of study drug administration to the follow-up visit and were assessed by the investigator for severity and causal relationship to the study drug. An adverse event was defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of a study drug, whether or not it was related to the study drug. All adverse events occurring during the study were followed up until resolved or judged to be no longer clinically significant, or until they became chronic to the extent that they could be fully characterized. The primary outcome measure was the frequency of serious adverse events. In accordance with the ICH of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use and Good Clinical Practice, serious adverse events were defined as any adverse event that (i) results in death, persistent, or significant disability or incapacity; (ii) consists of a congenital anomaly or birth defect; (iii) requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization; (iv) is life-threatening; or (v) is considered medically important.</p><p>Vital signs [systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), heart rate (HR), and respiratory rate] and 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) were assessed at screening, at baseline (prior to study drug administration), at 5, 15, and 30&#x000a0;minutes and 1, 2, 3-7, and 8&#x000a0;h after regadenoson or placebo administration and at the follow-up visit, 24&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;4&#x000a0;h later.

However, 7 severe adverse events (i.e., resulted in an inability to perform daily activities) were reported in 5 (1.5%) regadenoson subjects (headache, n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;2; dyspnea, n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;2; nausea, n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1; sensation of heaviness, n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1; neck pain, n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1). None of the placebo subjects experienced severe adverse events. The majority of adverse events occurred within 2&#x000a0;h of study drug administration: 204/334 (61.1%) subjects receiving regadenoson and 25/170 (14.7%) receiving placebo had adverse events during this period.</p><p>The stage of CKD did not affect adverse event rates for either study drug. Adverse events occurred in 182/287 (63.4%) of regadenoson-treated subjects with stage 3 and 27/47 (57.4%) with stage 4 CKD, and in 30/145 (20.7%) of placebo-treated subjects with stage 3 and 6/25 (24.0%) with stage 4 CKD. These rates were similar to the overall incidence for each treatment group.</p><p>Five adverse events were considered clinically important. Hemiparesis occurred in a 67-year-old white male with a history of CKD, prior myocardial infarction with stent placement, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, hypothyroidism, right facial numbness, and sleep apnea. His concomitant medications included aspirin, levothyroxine, atorvastatin, lisinopril, omega-3 fatty acids, fenofibric acid, and ezetimibe. The subject experienced transient left-sided weakness starting 2&#x000a0;minutes after the administration of regadenoson and lasting for 28&#x000a0;minutes. Blood pressure was 92/58&#x000a0;mm&#x000a0;Hg at baseline (prior to regadenoson administration), 100/58&#x000a0;mm&#x000a0;Hg at 5 minutes post-dose, and 98/70&#x000a0;mm&#x000a0;Hg at 30 minutes post-dose, when the hemiparesis resolved. Pulse oximetry showed that his oxygen saturation, which was 97% at 1 minute pre-dose, decreased to 86% at 5 minutes post-dose, but recovered to 94% at 10 minutes post-dose. The subject recovered fully, required no treatment, and had no sequelae. The event was deemed possibly related to the study drug by the investigator.</p><p>Another subject (a 73-year-old white male with a history of CKD, cigarette smoking, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, obesity, and CAD) experienced non-sustained ventricular tachycardia 2&#x000a0;h after regadenoson administration. This asymptomatic event was reported as part of the continuous Holter monitor data and was recorded as an adverse event of &#x0003c;1&#x000a0;minute in duration. Concomitant medications included desloratadine, metoprolol, rabeprazole, atorvastatin, doxazosin, potassium, furosemide, warfarin, fenofibrate, and levothyroxine. His blood pressure remained stable throughout the procedure, being 128/70&#x000a0;mm&#x000a0;Hg at baseline and 122/80&#x000a0;mm&#x000a0;Hg 2&#x000a0;h after regadenoson administration, when the episode of ventricular tachycardia occurred. This event was considered to be mild in severity, not related to study drug, and required no treatment.</p><p>Non-sustained ventricular tachycardia also was reported in a placebo subject after discharge (22-h post-dose). This was a single episode, which was considered mild and possibly related to study drug (placebo). No adverse events were reported in this subject following documentation of the arrhythmia. Second-degree atrioventricular node block occurred in a placebo subject 60 minutes post-dose, and sinus arrest of approximately 4&#x000a0;seconds occurred in a placebo subject 13 minutes post-dose.</p><p>One subject in the regadenoson group received 25&#x000a0;mg of aminophylline orally to attenuate dyspnea. None of the placebo-treated subjects experienced any adverse reactions that were sufficiently severe and/or persistent to require either IV or oral aminophylline.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Serum Chemistry</title><p>Mean changes from baseline were numerically small and similar with regadenoson and placebo for all serum chemistry parameters, including serum creatinine, and for hemoglobin.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate</title><p>Mean eGFR at baseline was similar in the regadenoson and placebo groups for all subjects and for those with either stage of CKD (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>).

Physical examination findings were unremarkable.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec16" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>A previous Phase 1 study in healthy male volunteers showed that renal excretion was a major elimination pathway for regadenoson, with an average of 57% (range 19%-77%) of a given IV dose being excreted unchanged in the urine.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref> It was also shown that the average plasma renal clearance of regadenoson (approximately 450&#x000a0;mL/minute) exceeded the normal GFR, indicating that active renal tubular secretion plays a role in the elimination of the drug.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref> A subsequent Phase 1 study investigated the pharmacokinetics and tolerability of regadenoson (single IV 0.4&#x000a0;mg bolus) in subjects (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;24) with varying degrees of kidney function (creatinine clearance &#x0003c;30&#x000a0;mL/minute, n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;5; 30-49&#x000a0;mL/minute, n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;6; 50-79&#x000a0;mL/minute, n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;7; 80-140&#x000a0;mL/minute, n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;6).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref> An inverse correlation was observed between the severity of CKD and regadenoson urinary clearance, total clearance, and terminal elimination half-life. However, plasma concentration-time curves directly post-dose (when the pharmacodynamic effect is most important for radiotracer uptake) were unaffected by creatinine clearance, as evidenced by similar maximum plasma concentrations and similar volumes of distribution estimates across the categories. The number and severity of adverse events were also comparable among this small sample of subjects. This study was conducted to further explore the safety and tolerability of regadenoson among individuals with decreased renal function.</p><p>This randomized controlled trial of regadenoson versus placebo demonstrated that the safety profile of regadenoson in individuals with stage 3 or 4 CKD was similar to the safety profile observed in patients participating in previous Phase 3 clinical trials with the drug.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref> For example, a total of 80% of those who received regadenoson in the pivotal, Phase 3 clinical trials reported an adverse event<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref> compared with 62.6% in this study. No serious adverse events were reported from the time of administration of a single IV 0.4&#x000a0;mg dose of regadenoson or placebo to the follow-up visit, 24-h post-dose. Of the 2 adverse events of clinical importance that occurred in the regadenoson group, only 1 was considered possibly related to study drug. This was a 28-minute episode of left hemiparesis beginning 2&#x000a0;minutes after the administration of regadenoson, which coincided with a period of low oxygen saturation (documented as 86% at 5 minutes post-dose, the first time it was measured after dosing). This individual had had sleep apnea and right facial numbness since 2009, but he was not receiving treatment for either condition at the time of the study. People with sleep apnea, especially those not on continuous positive airway pressure therapy, are susceptible to strokes and transient ischemic attacks.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref> The adverse event profile of regadenoson in subjects with stage 3 or 4 CKD was consistent with previous trials with the drug,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref> with no unexpected adverse events being reported. Headache, dyspnea, chest discomfort, nausea, flushing, and dizziness were among the notable side effects that were significantly more common with regadenoson than placebo, as expected. The frequency of these side effects was comparable to previously published data from pivotal regadenoson Phase 3 trials.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref> Adverse event profiles were also similar between subjects with stage 3 and 4 CKD for regadenoson and for placebo (i.e., the types and frequencies of adverse events with regadenoson [or placebo] were similar regardless of CKD stage). Although a slightly higher proportion of subjects with stage 3 than stage 4 CKD experienced an adverse event, this difference likely reflects the small number of subjects with stage 4 CKD. With greater numbers of subjects with stage 4 CKD, the differences would most likely be less. Using the overall adverse event rates, comparing the number of subjects in the stage 3 versus the stage 4 CKD group with adverse events and the number of subjects without adverse events, the results are not statistically significant (Fisher&#x02019;s exact test). It is also not statistically significant for placebo-treated subjects in the stage 3 versus stage 4 CKD groups. There is also no difference in the safety profile from a clinically meaningful standpoint. Most adverse events occurred in the 2&#x000a0;h following regadenoson administration, consistent with the pharmacodynamic effect and terminal half-life of the drug.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></p><p>The proportion of subjects whose HR exceeded 100&#x000a0;bpm was greater with regadenoson than placebo; all other vital sign criteria were comparable between the 2 treatment groups. The tachycardic effect was noted despite 55.1% of regadenoson subjects being on beta-blockers at the time of the study. Two mechanisms appear to account for the tachycardia induced by regadenoson. First, peripheral vasodilation following drug administration leads to a fall in blood pressure, triggering a baroreflex-mediated activation of the sympathetic nervous system and a subsequent increase in HR.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref> Second, evidence from animal models suggests that regadenoson also causes direct sympathoexcitation through stimulation of arterial chemoreceptors via A<sub>2A</sub> receptors, such that the regadenoson-induced tachycardia is dissociated from the decrease in mean arterial pressure.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></p><p>No clinically important differences were apparent between the regadenoson and the placebo groups with regard to changes from baseline in clinical laboratory findings or ECG abnormalities following drug administration. The changes in these parameters, when observed, were not clinically meaningful and none required intervention. One subject experienced left hemiparesis, which was considered possibly related to regadenoson administration, concurrently with a decrease in oxygen saturation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Limitations</title><p>Several limitations should be considered when evaluating the results of this study. First, of the 504 subjects that were randomized, only 72 (14%) had stage 4 CKD. Thus, the results of this study in this subgroup of subjects should be interpreted with caution. Second, the trial did not include subjects with stage 5 CKD (on dialysis). Third, no pharmacokinetic data were collected to support the previously published findings of Gordi et al,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref> which included only a small number of patients with impaired renal function. For drugs that are eliminated by the kidney (i.e., &#x02265;30% of the administered dose eliminated unchanged in the urine), renal impairment often results in a significant increase in drug exposure, manifested as an increase in the area under the concentration-time curve.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref> In some cases, this necessitates a recommendation for dose adjustment according to the degree of renal dysfunction.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref> Regadenoson plasma concentrations display a tri-exponential decline after administration of an IV bolus dose, with rapid distribution phases followed by a relatively longer elimination phase.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref> Any increase in exposure to regadenoson in patients with renal impairment would be expected to occur during the final phase of clearance. However, most adverse events observed with regadenoson occur shortly after dosing and resolve within approximately 15&#x000a0;minutes (except for headache, which may last for 30&#x000a0;minutes), reflecting the timing of the drug&#x02019;s pharmacodynamic effect.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref> Thus, it is unlikely that an increase in regadenoson exposure among patients with renal impairment would affect the adverse event profile, a speculation supported by the results of this study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study demonstrated that regadenoson, an A<sub>2A</sub> receptor agonist, has a safety profile in individuals with stage 3 or 4 CKD that is comparable to the safety profile in the general patient population, although it should be noted that only 14% of subjects included had stage 4 CKD. These results indicate that regadenoson is suitable for use as a coronary vasodilator for pharmacologic stress MPI in patients with stage 3 or 4 CKD.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The study and publication process was sponsored by Astellas Pharma Global Development, Inc.
