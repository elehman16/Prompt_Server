Based on this information, we conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, proof-of-concept trial to assess the efficacy of simvastatin in smoking cessation. After informed consent, 118 participants received behavioral cessation support and were randomly assigned to a 3-month treatment with simvastatin or placebo. The primary outcome was biochemically verified abstinence or smoking reduction at 3-month post-target quit date (TQD). Secondary outcomes were abstinence during weeks 9&#x02013;12 post-TQD, prolonged abstinence or reduction at months 6 and 12 post-TQD, safety and craving assessed at each visit during the 3-month period of treatment. Simvastatin treatment was not associated with higher 3-month abstinence or smoking reduction compared to placebo. There was no significant difference in any of the secondary outcomes. Simvastatin was well tolerated. Over 3 and 9 months follow-up period, 78% simvastatin and 69% placebo participants were retained in the study. At 6 and 12 months, smoking remained significantly reduced from baseline in both groups. Our results demonstrate that a 3-month simvastatin treatment (40&#x02009;mg/day), added to individual behavioral cessation support, does not improve significantly smoking cessation compared to placebo in humans.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">According to the World Health Organization, smoking is the largest preventable cause of disease and death in the world<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Although the prevalence of every-day tobacco use has dropped in most nations since 1990, the total number of smokers has increased<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. In 2015, 6.4 million deaths worldwide were attributable to smoking, representing a 4.7% increase in smoking-attributable deaths since 2005. This number is likely to reach 8 to 10 millions a year by 2030<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. The benefits of smoking cessation have been clearly proven in terms of morbidity and mortality for different diseases related to tobacco, especially for lung cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Although over 70% of smokers want to quit, less than 5% of quit attempts are successful annually<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Currently, there are only 3 first-line approved medications in the USA and Europe for smoking-cessation: nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), sustained release bupropion, and varenicline, which are widely recommended in many national guidelines. Nevertheless, the therapeutic effectiveness of NRT is relatively modest, bupropion is not widely used because of its safety profile and varenicline&#x02019;s use is limited because of fear of potential cardiovascular or neuropsychiatric adverse effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Therefore, the discovery of new medications that could facilitate abstinence and reduce relapse to cigarette use represents a pressing necessity to reduce risks associated with tobacco smoking.</p><p id="Par4">We recently reported in rats that brain-penetrating statins - simvastatin and atorvastatin - can reduce risks of relapse to addiction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. In fact, chronic treatment with low doses of statins daily during a 21-day period of abstinence, significantly reduced cocaine or nicotine seeking compared with placebo without altering seeking for food. Based on this information, we hypothesized that simvastatin could have beneficial effects on smoking cessation in humans. Therefore, we conducted a randomized, prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, proof-of-concept trial of the efficacy of simvastatin (with behavioural counseling) for smoking cessation. The primary objective of the study was to determine whether simvastatin would increase abstinence or reduce tobacco smoking at the end of 3-month medication treatment compared to placebo. Secondary objectives included evaluation of the continuous abstinence rate for weeks 9&#x02013;12 post-target quit date (post-TQD), nicotine withdrawal symptoms during medication treatment and prolonged abstinence or reduction at months 6 and 12 post-TQD.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="Par5">Study procedures are presented in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and flowchart of participants through the trial in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>.

Total abstinence at 6 months was maintained at 18.6% rate (simvastatin 14%, placebo 23%, Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) then decreased moderately but not significantly in both groups at 12 months (simvastatin 14%, placebo 15%, Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Smoking increased similarly in both groups at 6 months and moreover at 12 months, but the reduction remained significant from baseline (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001 for both treatments, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par12">The main finding of this study is that a 3-month treatment with simvastatin does not improve self-reported abstinence, the number of cigarettes smoked, continuous abstinence and reduction in craving compared to placebo. Therefore, despite the promising pre-clinical background supporting the effectiveness of using brain-penetrating statins in management of smoking cessation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, we failed to show a benefit of simvastatin compared to placebo. Whereas these results may be seen as somewhat disappointing, it should be noticed that, unfortunately, it is not uncommon that results obtained in animal models of psychiatric disorders are not replicated in humans. For example, fenofibrate, another approved lipid-lowering drug, was found to be effective in reducing nicotine addiction-related effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> but it failed to decrease smoking in dependent smokers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. In the same line, notwithstanding a large amount of data in rodents supporting its role in addiction and relapse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, recent studies in humans have failed to demonstrate anti-craving effects of corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) compounds in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Notwithstanding these failures, it is important to keep comparing animal and human findings and to publish even negative results. This may (1) lead to a better awareness of the limitations, at least in term of predictive validity, of the current animal models, (2) shed lights into differences between humans and rodents that can explain different effects; and finally (3) improve and refine current animal models.</p><p id="Par13">Reasons for the lack of simvastatin efficacy for smoking cessation can be multifaceted. First, it is possible that the brain penetration of simvastatin in human patients was poor and insufficient. In our preclinical experiments, reduction in drug seeking was observed with administration of brain-penetrating statins, simvastatin and atorvastatin whereas administration of pravastatin, a statin with low brain penetrability, did not<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Whereas simvastatin appears to have good brain penetrability in rats<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, species-specific physiological differences may exist between rodents and humans that can influence the efficacy of the drug. As a matter of fact, it has been shown that whereas simvastatin has positive effects in rodent and monkey models of Parkinson&#x02019;s disease, these effects do not appear to translate to humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. The 40&#x02009;mg/day dose used in Tison&#x02019;s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> study as in ours is the most widely used dose for lipid control. Whereas it is possible that higher doses and other regimens of administration may be effective for smoking cessation, it should be noticed that the risk of adverse effects of statins increases with increasing doses and such treatments could be difficult to implement in the general population. Secondly, it is possible that the behavioral support provided in this study produces significant effects that may have masked the effects of statins. In fact, in our study, intervention combined pharmacotherapy and individual behavioral counseling. Research nurses, trained by smoking cessation medical experts and applied this counseling in accordance to a standardized operational procedure, were in charge of providing the individual and personalized help and support to enrolled patients. This intensity of the behavioral support was substantially greater than what is typically provided, with repeated sessions every two weeks, which might create a stronger placebo response. There is high-quality evidence that individually-delivered smoking cessation counseling can assist smokers to quit<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> and that counseling associated with medication can more than double the success rate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. In our study, the abstinence rate after three months of treatment was 18% that is in accordance with the literature. Success rates of smoking cessation treatments (5-months-after-treatment) range between 8.5% (minimal or no counseling or self-help) and 27.6% (intense counseling and medication), depending on contact time and intensity, number and length of sessions, number and type of clinicians involved and number and type of counseling formats and interventions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. This kind of medical management may also explain the results of this trial suggesting a seemingly higher quit rate compared to some of the other studies in the literature. The drop-out rate at 23% and 31% at 6 and 12 months follow-up is lower in comparison to the 6-month 60&#x02013;70% reported in the literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Moreover, at 6- and 12-month follow-up, abstinence or smoking reduction were maintained for almost of participants. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis reported that average abstinence rates (6 months or more) were 17%, 19%, 27% and 31% for NRT, bupropion, varenicline and combination NRT, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. These results show that face-to-face treatment may result in higher commitment of the patients and suggest that more efforts should be made into implementing this kind of treatment as a first choice in the management of tobacco addiction.</p><p id="Par14">An interesting aspect of this study is that, in our population, statins did not produce more adverse effects than placebo. It has been claimed that statin therapy increases the rates of many types of adverse event, including muscle pain or weakness and liver disease. The idea that so-called &#x0201c;statin intolerance&#x0201d; is a common problem has been widely publicized not just in the medical literature but also in the media, which can lead to under-use of statins among individuals at increased risk of cardiovascular events<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Our current study found absolutely no differences in simvastatin vs placebo on safety what is in accordance with large-scale evidence from randomized controlled trials showing that almost all of the symptomatic adverse events that are attributed to statin therapy in routine practice are not actually caused by it<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par15">In conclusion, our findings do not support beneficial effects of simvastatin (40&#x02009;mg/day) for smoking cessation. On the other hand, the high rates of smoking reduction obtained in both groups in this study highlight the benefit of frequent behavioral counseling in obtaining drastic and long lasting reductions in smoking. Given the high health costs associated with tobacco smoking, these results suggest that more efforts should be made to implement these safe and relatively inexpensive behavioral approaches in the general population.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par16">A randomized, parallel-group, double blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted at the Clinical Investigation Center of the University Hospital of Poitiers (France) between April 2015 and November 2016 (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02399709, registered on March 26, 2015, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02399709">https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02399709</ext-link>).
