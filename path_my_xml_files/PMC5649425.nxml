The mechanism of action for synthetic antifibrinolytics is competitive blockade of the lysine-binding sites of plasminogen, plasmin, and tissue plasminogen activator. The reversible blockade impedes fibrinolysis and blood clot degradation. Plasmin inhibition by tranexamic acid may also help prevent platelet degradation.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] The half-life of tranexamic acid is approximately 80 min, provided there is normal renal function.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Intravenous administration of tranexamic acid has been routinely used for many years to reduce hemorrhage during and after surgical procedures such as coronary artery bypass and scoliosis surgery. Tranexamic acid has been found to be very useful in reducing blood loss and the incidence of blood transfusion in these surgeries.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] This study was conducted to assess the role of tranexamic acid in the prevention of excessive bleeding in laparoscopic cholecystectomy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>S<sc>UBJECTS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>This was a prospective study.

The principle is to minimize the trauma of access without compromising the exposure of the surgical field. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is now considered as the &#x0201c;gold standard&#x0201d; treatment for symptomatic gallstone disease.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Tranexamic acid exerts its antifibrinolytic effect by blocking lysine-binding locus of plasminogen and plasmin molecules, thereby preventing the binding of plasminogen and plasmin to the fibrin substrate. Tranexamic acid also inhibits conversion of plasminogen to plasmin by plasminogen activators. It has been used in the treatment of bleeding for many years.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>Hence, our experience regarding the role of tranexamic acid in preventing blood loss in laparoscopic cholecystectomy has been discussed, taking into account the various parameters.</p><p>In this study, the mean age of the patients was 44.36 years, which is comparable to the studies by Gordon <italic>et al</italic>. in 1976[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and Danlel <italic>et al</italic>. in 1982[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], in which the mean age of the patients undergoing cholecystectomy was 47 and 45 years, respectively.</p><p>The majority of the patients were females in both the groups, i.e., 73.33% in Group A and 66.66% in Group B. The percentage of females in our study (70%) is consistent with the study conducted by Kambouris <italic>et al</italic>. on cholecystectomy in 1973,[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] in which the percentage of female patients was 72.6%.</p><p>Five patients (8.33%) were diabetic, five patients (8.33%) were hypertensive, three patients (5%) were drug addicts, and nine patients (15%) were alcoholics. Our findings are comparable to the findings obtained by Koc <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] who found out that 12 out of 92 patients (13.3%) in their prospective double-blinded randomized study on laparoscopic cholecystectomy were diabetic. Diabetes mellitus increases the incidence of infection, and one of our patients had this complication.</p><p>The mean hematocrit of the drain fluid for Group A was 0.2434% and for Group B was 0.2627%. Hematocrit of drain fluid was less in the study group showing that blood loss was less in the study group as compared to the control group.</p><p>The mean hemoglobin in the drain fluid of the patients of the study group was 0.83 g%, which was less than the control group with mean value of 0.9 g%. Hence, blood loss was less in study group as compared to the control group, but the result was not statistically significant. Gohel <italic>et al</italic>. in 2007[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] concluded that tranexamic acid is effective in decreasing blood loss during and after cesarean section.</p><p>There was less blood loss in the study group who received tranexamic acid as a bolus dose as compared to the control group who did not receive tranexamic acid as a bolus dose in laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Tranexamic acid showed decrease in blood loss in the study group, but it was statistically insignificant.</p><p>The mean days of hospitalization in our study Group A were 2.4 days, which was less as compared to mean days of hospitalization in Group B, i.e., 2.63 days. However, the result was statistically insignificant. These results were similar to the study by Choi <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] on the effect of tranexamic acid on blood loss during orthognathic surgery (bimaxillary osteotomy), in which there was no significant difference in the length of hospital stay between the two groups.</p><p>There was no significant alteration in mean pulse of the patients in the study group following administration of tranexamic acid 24 h after surgery, signifying minimal blood loss, intra- and postoperatively. Similarly, there were no significant alterations in the vital signs of the patients of the control group 24 h after surgery.</p><p>In our study, the mean change in hemoglobin in the study group was 0.373, which was less than that of the control group, i.e., 0.471. Similar findings were seen by Gohel <italic>et al</italic>. in 2007[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] showing no significant difference in the preoperative and postoperative mean hemoglobin of the two groups in their study on the efficacy of tranexamic acid in decreasing blood loss in cesarean section. Hence, in our study, tranexamic acid did reduce blood loss, but it was statistically insignificant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>The use of tranexamic acid decreased the intraoperative and postoperative bleeding in laparoscopic cholecystectomy, but it was not statistically significant. This may be due to minimal blood loss in the laparoscopic procedures. There is no active role of tranexamic acid in limiting blood loss in elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy.</p><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec
