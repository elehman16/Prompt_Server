It produces difficulties in access to care, poor technical quality, discontinuity of care and inefficiency.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> These weaknesses are most evident in the care of patients with chronic conditions that require the coordination of multiple health professionals and care settings.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Owing to the demographic and epidemiological changes seen in Latin America in recent years,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> the care of patients with chronic conditions is becoming an increasingly relevant challenge to address.</p><p>In this context of care fragmentation, the policy challenge is to improve care integration.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Many countries have promoted the development of integrated healthcare networks (IHN), defined as a network of organisations that provides or arranges to provide a coordinated continuum of services to a defined population and is willing to be held clinically and fiscally accountable for the health status and outcomes of this population.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> These countries include, among others, Colombia,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Brazil,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Chile,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Mexico,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Uruguay<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> and Argentina.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p><p>IHN initiatives have received strong support from international organisations,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12&#x02013;14</xref> despite the scarce evidence of their impact. Results from a previous study on IHNs in Colombia and Brazil (Equity-LA) reveal poor perceived coordination across care levels, limited implementation of care coordination mechanisms and significant hindrances to care coordination, related both to the health system model and the organisation of the healthcare network (I Vargas, AS Mogoll&#x000f3;n-P&#x000e9;rez, P De Paepe, <italic>et al</italic>. Barriers to care coordination in market-based and decentralized public health systems: a qualitative study in healthcare networks of Colombia and Brazil. <italic>Health Policy Plan</italic> 2014; [submitted]). However, similar evidence from other Latin American health systems is scarce,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15&#x02013;17</xref> and questions concerning best practices in care integration for the Latin American context, and the structural and organisational reforms required to improve IHN performance, remain unexplored.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></p><p>The expected results of this research project&#x02014;Equity-LA II, which builds on those of Equity-LA, will support national and international decision-makers by providing evidence of best practices in care integration in different health systems in Latin America, with particular reference to two chronic diseases (diabetes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It will also contribute to advancing the state of the art by generating new knowledge on the impact of IHN reforms on coordination across care levels and, ultimately, quality of care. The project will achieve this by expanding the scope of the research in Colombia and Brazil and incorporating other Latin American (LA) countries&#x02014;Chile, Mexico, Argentina and Uruguay&#x02014;thus representing a large array of health systems and IHNs.</p><sec id="s1a"><title>Care coordination and quality as outcomes of IHN performance</title><p>In theory, the integration of healthcare delivery should contribute to more efficient, more equitable and higher quality health services<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> through improvements in care coordination, continuity and access.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Consequently, IHN performance analysis should take into account both final outcomes (efficiency, equity and quality of care) and intermediate outcomes (care coordination, continuity of care and access to healthcare), as is proposed in the Equity-LA conceptual framework.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> This aims to analyse IHN performance taking the following factors into account: the internal processes developed by IHNs to achieve their objectives; the macro-level and micro-level contexts in which IHNs perform (including the type of health system and its objectives regarding equity of access, efficiency and quality of care, and care coordination), and the social actors involved in the care coordination process, that is, healthcare professionals, managers and users (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2014007037F1">figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="BMJOPEN2014007037F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Framework for the analysis of Integrated Health Care Networks (IHN) and its impact.

However, the empirical evidence indicates that a lack of coordination across care levels is one of the most frequent causes of poor quality&#x02014;duplication of diagnostic testing, perilous polypharmacy, inappropriate referrals, and confusion about conflicting care plans,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>
<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> suggesting that an appropriate and necessary way to address quality improvement is to advance in care coordination. To contribute to progress beyond the state of the art, Equity-LA II will develop and apply research tools, building on and further developing the Equity-LA conceptual framework.</p></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>Interventions to improve the performance of IHNs</title><p>The evidence is conclusive on the organisational elements that are critical for IHN performance.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> These elements, which are included in the Equity-LA conceptual framework (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2014007037F1">figure 1</xref>), are as follows: (A) a shared vision of the system's goals and strategies across the network; (B) methods for resource allocation that align health services incentives with the global objectives of the network; (C) an organic structure with mechanisms that enhance communication between health professionals involved in the care process; (D) a common culture and leadership with values oriented at teamwork, collaboration and best performance; and (E) a healthcare model based on primary healthcare.</p><p>To address these critical elements, an array of interventions at different levels can be considered<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>: (1) macro-level: policies and regulatory mechanisms to develop IHN; (2) meso-level: IHNs&#x02019; strategic plans and coordination mechanisms for managerial functions (eg, integrated management strategies, shared management committee); (3) micro-level: the introduction of a single care coordination mechanism or a combination of mechanisms in a comprehensive programme (eg, shared care strategy, disease and case management programmes).</p><p>The literature recommends the implementation of integration strategies at the micro-level led by healthcare professionals from the beginning of the IHN configuration process<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26&#x02013;29</xref> This argument is based on one of the main weaknesses detected in the development of such initiatives: the tendency of IHN managers to prioritise strategic discourses and organisational changes and to ignore actions aimed at improving clinical management.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Although macro-level and meso-level strategies facilitate clinical integration,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> mechanisms for care coordination seem to be more effective in enhancing collaboration between professionals of different care levels by creating spaces for communication and mutual understanding, such as multidisciplinary healthcare teams across levels or shared clinical sessions.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Micro-level coordination strategies will be the focus of Equity-LA II.</p></sec><sec id="s1c"><title>Evidence on effective interventions to improve integration of care in Latin America and other contexts</title><p>Evaluations of interventions to improve coordination across care levels have mainly been carried out in the USA and Europe. These show, first, that interventions involving multiple strategies are more successful than those which employ a single strategy<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>
<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> and, second, that despite the methodological weaknesses associated with the studies conducted, there is a certain amount of evidence to suggest a connection between specific strategies and improved care outcomes, appropriate health services utilisation and technical efficiency.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>
<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>
<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> Shared care strategies that encompass multidisciplinary groups for care coordination, disease management programmes and case management<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> have been shown to improve care outcomes in specific population groups, such as patients with psychiatric illnesses, stroke victims and patients with diabetes, with improvements being noted in mortality rates and hospital readmissions, among other outcomes.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> However, the effects of these interventions on other groups of patients are unknown, as are the effects of other interventions proposed for improving care coordination. It also remains to be seen whether the results obtained for evaluations in the North American and European contexts are applicable to other contexts such as Latin America.</p><p>There have been few evaluations to date of best practices in care integration in the Latin American context. Existing studies have so far been conducted at the national level and have focused on specific populations&#x02014;mainly mother and child health.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>
<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> Moreover, most studies have concentrated on the evaluation of a single mechanism, addressing only one dimension of care coordination, such as the implementation of information technology in healthcare settings<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>
<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> or the expert system (case reviews, clinical sessions, etc) in mental healthcare.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>
<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> Evidence is also scarce with regard to the factors and actors that influence the effectiveness of the introduction of these micro-level interventions in different health systems and settings in middle-income countries.</p></sec><sec id="s1d"><title>Need for adequate research design and approaches in testing care integration interventions</title><p>The fact that the existing evidence is scarce on the effectiveness of organisations&#x02019; strategies for improving coordination, and even scarcer with regard to improvements in the final outcomes of efficient use of resources and quality of care, is mainly due to underdeveloped theories and research designs, over-reliance on experimental designs and the lack of independent evaluations.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> To address this gap, the need to develop more quasi-experimental research has been pointed out.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>
<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>
<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> With the type of design, observed differences in performance are assumed to be due to the intervention, since controlled before and after studies protect against secular trends and sudden changes.<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>
<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> Furthermore, quasi-experimental studies allow us to consider participants&#x02019; preferences, which may be important in influencing their motivation and attitudes.<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> These aspects may be enhanced by adopting a participatory action research (PAR) approach<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> that focuses on learning, success and action, as this is a collaborative approach that builds on the strengths, values and contributions of all the actors concerned.<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>
<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> Thus, its strength lies in generating solutions to practical problems&#x02014;in this research, strategies to address problems of care coordination across care levels&#x02014;as well as in implementing those solutions. Furthermore, by systematically monitoring and reflecting on the process and outcomes of change,<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> it helps to bridge the gap between theory and practice in both directions: knowledge for practice and practice for knowledge.<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></p></sec><sec id="s1e"><title>Aims of the equity-LA II project</title><p>The ultimate goal is to improve the effectiveness, efficiency and equity of healthcare systems, particularly in Latin America, by providing evidence on best practices in care integration, which will be translated into effective policies for varying social, political and economic contexts.

Criterion sampling<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref> was used to select informants, applying the following inclusion criteria: (1) healthcare professionals of different care levels (primary, secondary/tertiary care) providing care for patients from the study areas, with at least 6&#x02005;months&#x02019; experience. To provide a variation in discourse, the following criteria were taken into account: age, sex, care level, type of work contract and specialty; (2) users (and their caregivers) with chronic conditions (including diabetes and COPD) who had used the first care level and used or tried to use the secondary care level in the past 6&#x02005;months. The following maximum variation criteria were applied: age (over 18) and severity of illness. The final sample size was reached by saturation of information. Topic guides were developed with one common and one specific section for each informant group. Participants were identified through healthcare provider records. Approval was sought for their participation in focus groups and individual interviews both by telephone and home visits. All focus groups and individual interviews were recorded and transcribed. The qualitative data analysis is still underway. Transcriptions are being analysed using text-coding software. A thematic content analysis<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref> is being conducted. Data have been segmented by network, informant group and themes. The categories used have been generated from a mix of the topic guide and those emerging from the data. The analysis takes the gender perspective into account. Themes are being identified, coded, recoded and classified, identifying common patterns by looking at regularities, and convergences and divergences in the data, through a process of constant comparison, going back and forth between the data. To ensure data quality, results are being triangulated using different research methods and relying on different informant groups and multiple analysts with different backgrounds and an in-depth knowledge of qualitative methods, the research topic and its context.<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref> The members of the local steering committee are also participating in the data analysis. In the different analytical stages, preliminary results are presented to the members of the steering committee during meetings conducted for this purpose and their feedback is then taken into account for further analysis. They are involved as part of the participatory process, so that they are given the chance to not only familiarise themselves with the data but also to influence the analytical process. Moreover, the results of the baseline study should serve to guide the selection of the most appropriate intervention in each context.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Quantitative studies. Two questionnaire surveys are being conducted: (1) primary and secondary/tertiary doctors will be surveyed to determine their perceptions of the degree of coordination across levels of care, as well as their knowledge and use of existing care coordination mechanisms and influencing factors; and (2) users of 18&#x02005;years of age or over with chronic conditions (including type 2 diabetes and COPD), who were attended to in primary care and secondary care for the same condition in the 3&#x02005;months prior to the survey, will be surveyed to determine their perceptions and experiences of continuity of care and factors that influence on them. A sample of doctors and users will be selected in both networks under investigation in the baseline and evaluation phases. A list of doctors will be drawn up based on the information provided by the centres. Since the number of doctors in most networks is relatively small, all primary and secondary care physicians are being invited and encouraged by the research team to participate in the survey. Patients fulfilling the criteria are being selected in the waiting room of the primary care health facilities. Since the flow of patients in primary care centres is relatively low, all the users in the waiting room of each primary care centre in the network will be approached. The surveys have started between May or June, depending on the country, and are expected to past from 6&#x02005;weeks to 2&#x02005;months each, depending on the response of doctors and the flow of patients. The sample size has been calculated taking into account the controlled before and after design of the study. With respect to health professionals, a sample size of 174 for each network (and phase) was estimated in order to ensure the detection of a 15% variation in professionals&#x02019; perception of coordination of care, both between phases and between networks. For the users&#x02019; survey, a sample size of 388 patients per network (and phase) was estimated in order to ensure the detection of a 10% variation in patients&#x02019; perception of continuity of care, both between phases and between networks. In both cases, sample size is calculated on the basis of 80% power and a confidence level of 95%. Descriptive analyses will be carried out, and t tests and &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> tests will be used to compare differences in outcomes between intervention and control networks. In addition, a multivariable analysis will be conducted using statistical software in order to explore the effects of potential explanatory variables on the outcome. The analysis of the baseline study on network performance with respect to coordination across levels of care and continuity of care, and related quality of care will be completed by combining the preliminary results of the qualitative study with those of the quantitative study.</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Phase 2: Participatory design and implementation of interventions</title><p>In all the study countries, the preliminary results of the qualitative baseline study reveal limited coordination between the primary and secondary care levels. This is reflected in reports of poor clinical information transfer, inappropriate referrals of patients to secondary care and the follow-up of patients in secondary care rather than in primary care when appropriate. The local steering committee of each country will be in charge of selecting, designing and implementing the interventions aimed at addressing the problems identified in the baseline study. They will also be responsible for recruiting and training participants in their countries throughout the process. The members will undergo a process of learning by doing and will be coached by the researchers in putting these activities into practice in their network. Additional data to those obtained in the baseline study may be collected (through interviews with key informants, review of records, etc) in order to hone the design of the interventions and monitor the process of implementation.</p><sec id="s2e1"><title>Design of interventions</title><p>A shared care strategy will be developed in each country through a participatory process led by the local steering committee. The strategy will be designed to address the main difficulties of the referral system, especially to improve the adequacy of the referral and counter-referral of patients and the transfer of clinical information between primary and secondary care services. The shared care strategy involves the joint participation of primary and secondary care physicians and will combine a series of care coordination mechanisms. The selected strategies will be conceived to motivate health professionals to participate on a voluntary basis. Any activity taken on should be incorporated into their regular duties, so the proposed interventions should be affordable for local authorities. The following list of potential mechanisms is not prescriptive since the final selection of interventions will depend on the results of the baseline study and the decision made by each local steering committee.
<list list-type="alpha-upper"><list-item><p>Programming strategies: the development of an expert system (continuous medical training, alternatives to traditional consultations such as case reviews, shared clinical sessions, and other training mechanisms such as hospital rotation for primary care doctors), rationalisation tools for clinical decision-making in handling COPD and diabetes (clinical guidelines, design of care maps or clinical pathways).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Feedback strategies: placement of care managers and liaison professionals, the implementation of in-service supervision and individual coaching, the development of multidisciplinary working groups to enhance communication between health professionals, the fostering of informal channels of communication, and an adequate use of clinical information systems.</p></list-item></list></p><p>Since one of the factors that influence the use of care coordination mechanisms by professionals is their degree of involvement in the selection, design, implementation and evaluation processes, the interventions will: (A) be bottom up, meaning that health professionals in the network will play a central role in introducing the changes<xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>
<xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>; (B) be based on staff training through techniques such as in-service demonstrations, case reviews and audit-oriented observations<xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>; and (C) ensure a balance between the rationalisation of clinical decision-making and the individual health professional's therapeutic autonomy.<xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref></p></sec><sec id="s2e2"><title>Implementation of interventions</title><p>The shared care strategy will be implemented in the intervention network in each country and, if proven effective, introduced in the control network (comparative arm) at the end of the country study, in order to prevent changes occurring too early and thereby hindering the detection of differences. The previously trained local steering committee will be in charge of monitoring the intervention process in each country. On introducing the selected intervention, particular attention will be paid to its rate of uptake and stability. Their constant monitoring will facilitate the adaptation of the intervention to achieve optimal effectiveness if, for example, the proposed intensity or duration of the intervention is found to be unacceptable to participants. This cyclical process represents the classical spiral of PAR.<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref> The process will be based on learning by doing, which will provide sustainability after the end of the project.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Phase 3: evaluation of interventions</title><p>In this phase, the effectiveness of the shared care strategy implemented will be evaluated, recognising its limitations and identifying factors that determine its applicability in different contexts. As well as measuring the impact of the interventions, factors that may hinder or enable their implementation will be identified for each setting. This evaluation, which also combines qualitative and quantitative methods, will follow the same design as the one used in the baseline study. The main analysis dimensions of coordination, continuity and related quality of care are those used in the baseline study.</p><p>Two intracountry comparisons will be made: (1) before and after in each health services network, to compare performance in both the intervention and control networks before and after the intervention period; (2) intervention-control comparison, to measure differences in performance between the intervention and control networks. Evaluations will analyse improvements in coordination across levels of care and related quality of care, as well as contextual factors influencing the strategies and their results. To compare differences in outcomes (the levels of coordination and continuity of care) between the baseline and the evaluation phases, and within and between networks, the following analyses of survey data will be performed: (A) a bivariate analysis using the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test and (B) multivariate analyses, adjusted by explanatory variables using logistic or linear regression models, according to the dependent variable analysed.</p><p>The analysis of network performance with respect to coordination across levels of care and continuity of care will be completed by combining the preliminary results of the qualitative study with those of the quantitative study. It will also include feedback for professionals in order to improve their clinical practice skills and use of care coordination mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Phase 4: Cross-country comparative analysis and generation of recommendations and tools for translating research into policy</title><p>Comparisons will be made at two levels: (1) with the other Latin American countries analysed; and (2) with international studies in which networks have been evaluated, such as those from Catalonia (Spain).<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> The comparative analysis will result in a better understanding of the link between different interventions and their outcomes, and the associated factors in each health system and healthcare setting.
