While treatment with inhaled bronchodilators and steroids may partially relieve symptoms and oxygen therapy may prolong life, for many patients the course of the disease is one of inexorable decline. Very few palliative care intervention studies are available for this population. This trial seeks to determine the effectiveness of the introduction of specialized palliative care on hospital, intensive care unit and emergency admissions of patients with severe and very severe COPD.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>The study is a three year single centre, randomized controlled trial using a 2 arms parallel groups design conducted in a tertiary center (University Hospitals; Geneva). For the intervention group, an early palliative care consultation is added to standard care; the control group benefits from standard care only. Patients with COPD defined according to GOLD criteria with a stage III or IV disease and/or long term treatment with domiciliary oxygen and/or home mechanical ventilation and/or one or more hospital admissions in the previous year for an acute exacerbation are eligible to participate. Allocation concealment is achieved using randomisation by sealed envelopes. Our sample size of 90 patients/group gives the study a 80% power to detect a 20% decrease in intensive care unit and emergency admissions &#x02013; the primary endpoint. All data regarding participants will be analysed by a researcher blinded to treatment allocation, according to the "Intention to treat" principle.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Given the trends toward aggressive and costly care near end-of-life among patients with COPD, a timely introduction of palliative care may limit unnecessary and burdensome personal and societal costs, and invasive approaches.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. It is a progressive lung disorder with mortality rates between 36&#x02013;50%, within 2&#x000a0;years after admission for an acute exacerbation
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. One out of eight (130,000) hospital admissions per year in the UK are related to COPD with approximately 30% of patients admitted with COPD for the first time being re-admitted within 3&#x000a0;months
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>While treatment with inhaled bronchodilators and steroids may partially relieve symptoms and Noninvasive Positive Pressure Ventilation (NIV) and long term oxygen therapy (LTOT) may prolong life, for many patients the course of the disease is one of inexorable decline with a prolonged period of disabling dyspnea and increasingly frequent hospital admissions reflecting deteriorating lung function and usually presaging a premature death
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. It has long been recognized that, in this group of patients, both quality of life and survival are poor. For instance, in the Nocturnal Oxygen Therapy trial of LTOT, disturbances in emotional and social functioning were common and there was a marked impairment in activities of daily living
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Despite these issues, the needs of these patients are typically poorly addressed, and many patients have limited access to specialists in palliative care services
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Furthermore many of these patients are housebound and they and their caregivers have poor access to health services. No randomised early palliative care intervention studies are available for this particular population, although it has been shown that it is feasible to provide palliative care interventions in this population
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] A study conducted in the UK found that patients with COPD are much less likely to die at home and to receive palliative care services than patients with lung cancer
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Additional studies have also documented the poor quality of palliative care and significant burden of symptoms among patients with COPD
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In a retrospective cohort study conducted in Canada, of 1098 patients who died in 2004, very few patients who died with COPD used the palliative care services that were available in acute care hospitals (5.1%) or home care settings (2.8%) compared to those with lung cancer (acute care 47.6%; home care 37.4%)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>Although anxiety and depression are common in COPD, they are not well recognized or treated
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In a recent study, only a third of patients with COPD and clinically significant depression or anxiety were being treated and only half of those with severe depression or anxiety were being treated
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Antidepressants can significantly improve mood among patients with COPD and depression
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>One reason these patients may receive poor-quality palliative care is that patient&#x02013;physician communication about end-of-life care often occurs late in the illness
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Healthcare for these patients is often initiated in response to acute exacerbations rather than being initiated proactively based on a previously developed plan for managing their disease
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>Studies have shown that only a minority of patients with moderate-to-severe COPD has discussed treatment preferences and end-of-life care issues with their physicians and most believe that their physicians do not know their preferences for end-of-life care
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. A survey of 214 general practitioners in the UK found that, although 82% felt that general practitioners should discuss prognosis with COPD patients, only 41% reported "often" or "always" discussing prognosis with these patients
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Furthermore, two thirds of the physicians who reported infrequently discussing end-of-life care reported feeling inadequately prepared to have such discussions.</p><p>The "SUPPORT" study (study to understand prognosis and preferences for outcomes and treatment) that/which enrolled seriously ill hospitalized patients, including COPD, demonstrated that COPD compared to patients with lung cancer, were much more likely to die in the intensive care unit, on mechanical ventilation and with dyspnea
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. These differences occurred despite most patients with COPD preferred treatment focused on comfort rather than on prolonging life. In fact, SUPPORT found that patients with lung cancer and patients with COPD were equally likely to prefer not to be intubated and not to receive cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), yet patients with COPD were much more likely to receive these therapies
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. A study of patients with COPD or lung cancer in the US Veterans Affairs Health System also found that patients with COPD were much more likely to be admitted to an ICU, and have greater lengths of stay in the ICU during their terminal hospitalization, than patients with lung cancer
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><p>Most patients with a life-limiting illness prefer to discuss their preferences for end-of-life care relatively early in the course of their illness, as these discussions are less stressful when the patient is feeling relatively well
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. One qualitative study compared patients with severe COPD to patients with metastatic cancer or advanced AIDS, showed that patients with COPD were more likely to express concern about the lack of information that they received about their disease. They wanted more information in the following five specific areas: diagnosis and disease process, treatment, prognosis, what dying might be like, and advance care planning
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><p>A recent randomized study conducted in the United States in an outpatient clinic demonstrated that an intervention using patient specific feedback about preferences for discussing end-of-life care improved the occurrence and the quality of communication between 376 patients with COPD and their clinicians. Patients in the intervention group reported nearly a threefold higher rate of end-of-life discussions about end-of-life care (30% vs. 11%; P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>Advance directives may be especially useful among patients with COPD because of their likely trajectory of illness, with unpredictable exacerbations that may render patients suddenly critically ill. Some patients with COPD have strong feelings about the situations in which they would want to forego CPR or, particularly relevant for COPD, mechanical ventilation for acute respiratory failure. Patients&#x02019; prior experiences with life support, or with relatives or friends who have required life support, can be important facilitators for patient&#x02013;physician communication about treatment preferences and end-of-life care
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. The period of hospitalization may not be an appropriate time to initiate advance directives, but the opportunity should be taken after discharge from hospital
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p><p>Because of the paucity of palliative care intervention studies available for this particular population, we designed a study to evaluate the effect of introducing palliative care for patients with severe and very severe COPD.</p><p>Our hypothesis is that the early introduction of specialized palliative care could decrease the length and number of admissions to intensive care units as well as hospital and emergency admissions of patients with severe and very severe COPD.</p><p>The primary objective of the study is to assess the effectiveness of the introduction of early specialized palliative care on hospital, intensive care unit and emergency admissions of patients with severe and very severe COPD.</p><p>The secondary objectives are to assess impact of early palliative care on:</p><p>1. mood and anxiety of patients with severe and very severe COPD</p><p>2. health-related quality of life of patients with severe and very severe COPD.</p><p>3. pattern of antibiotics used during the last month of life</p><p>4. advance care planning and end-of-life decision-making</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Design of the study</title><p>This randomised controlled trial will used 2 arms parallel groups design.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. Information gathered in this phase has been used to develop the optimal intervention by a multidisciplinary group and a study design adapted to our regional health system. Researchers involved in the recruitment of the patients are blinded to the details of the intervention. Our team also established contacts with experts who had already developed specialized palliative care interventions in this type of population.</p><p>Patients assigned to the early palliative care group will meet a nurse attached to the community ambulatory palliative care unit of the HUG (USPC) within three weeks of inclusion and at least monthly thereafter during one year after inclusion. This nurse has a long experience in palliative care. The first consultation will take place at the patient&#x02019;s home, unless the patient prefers to have the consultation at the pulmonary division. It will take approximately 1 h &#x000bd; to assess and discuss the different items. The subsequent monthly consultations will last approximately 30 minutes according to the needs of the patients. A consultation with a specialized palliative care physician or another specialist (psychiatrist, pulmonologist&#x02026;.) will be organized if intensity of pain, dyspnea, mood, anxiety and appetite disturbances are &#x0003e;4/10 on visual analogic scales (VAS) and both the patient and his/her physician agree. The individualised palliative care assessment and treatment plan will be forwarded in writing to the physician in charge of the patient within 24 hours of the consultation. These consultations will be at charge of the insurance of the patient. Details of the palliative consultation are described in Table&#x000a0;
<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. We decided to establish a set of core interventions, but not to schedule these different items to respect the rhythm and needs of the patients. At the end of each consultation, the items discussed during the consultations will be collected. Participants who refuse to attend one or more palliative care interventions will be contacted by phone by the palliative care nurse to understand their reasons. If the patient, agrees a new appointment will be fixed.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Description of the palliative care intervention</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" border="1"><colgroup><col align="left"/><col align="left"/></colgroup><tbody valign="top"><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">1.</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><bold>Symptom management</bold></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">- Assessment of symptoms with the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">- If intensity of pain, dyspnea, mood, anxiety and appetite &#x0003e;4 and patient agrees: patients will be referred to home based specialist palliative care team or another specialist (dieticians, pulmonologist, psychiatrist&#x02026;)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">- Symptom management will follow the palliative care guidelines of the University Hospital of Geneva.</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">- Non pharmacological interventions such as relaxation will be promoted according to Booth

Only the principle investigator will have the key to the correspondence between patient reference number and identity. The CRF (case report form) will be collected using SecuTrial software with the support of the Clinical Research Center, Geneva University Hospitals (Prof. Jules Desmeules).

We know that between one third and one half of these patients are hospitalized at least once during the year. Furthermore approximately 200 COPD patients per year are admitted to the Emergency Division of our hospital. Even if only a third of these patients are included in the study, this would give us sufficient statistical power to validly analyze our primary outcomes. Regarding the primary outcome, we calculated that a sample size of 80 patients per group would be adequate with an 80% power to detect a difference in hospital admissions of 20% between both groups at an &#x003b1; significance level (2-sided test) of 0.05.</p><p>With regard to missing data, we will use the conservative approach of carrying the last observation forward for all missing data in the intention-to-treat analyses. Poisson or binomial negative regression models will be used to compare count data between the groups while adjusting for potential confounder. The trend in the evolution of the different scores will be assessed using mixed linear regression models.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Given the trends toward aggressive and costly care near the end-of-life among patients with COPD, timely introduction of palliative care may decrease unnecessary and burdensome personal and societal costs. The results of this study may provide some directions for future palliative care interventions in this particular population. These interventions may also provide a basis for training physicians and health professionals to improve patient&#x02013;clinician communication about end-of-life care for patients with COPD, and stimulate the development of a specialized palliative care consultation for this population.</p><p>This is one of the first randomized trials to measure the effectiveness of early palliative intervention on hospital, intensive care unit and emergency admissions of patients.</p><p>One limit of the study is that the nature of the intervention makes it difficult to double-blind comparisons between both groups. However every attempt will be made to ensure that the researchers that include and follow the patients are blinded to the palliative care intervention.</p><p>The study is supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation grant # 406740_145086/1(
