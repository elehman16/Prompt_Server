Levobupivacaine, the S(-)-enantiomer of bupivacaine, recently introduced for obstetric spinal and epidural anesthesia[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] has been shown to provide a more selective neuraxial blockade than racemic bupivacaine.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Often, intrathecal opioids, such as fentanyl or sufentanil, are combined with local anesthetics, thereby markedly enhancing the quality and duration of postoperative analgesia after cesarean delivery as well as providing better parturient comfort without affecting neonatal outcome significantly.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>In the postoperative period, prolonging the analgesia is the best way to encourage for early ambulation of patients, but associated prolonged motor blockade caused by neuraxial blockade with long-acting local anesthetic discourages the patients from early ambulation in spite of having adequate analgesia. Hence, many additives such as fentanyl, sufentanil have been administered along with local anesthetic to prolong the sensory blockade without intensifying motor block.</p><p>Hence, the above study has been formulated to assess and compare sensory and motor characteristic following spinal anesthesia with a combination of reduced of levobupivacaine (7.5 mg) and fentanyl (12.5 &#x003bc;g) and standard dose of levobupivacaine (10 mg) alone. Thus, to assess the ability of low-dose combination of levobupivacaine and fentanyl to provide prolonged sensory blockade and with a decreased duration of the motor blockade which may help in early ambulation of patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>After the Institutional Review Board approval and written informed consent, sixty parturients fitting the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Physical Status I and II presenting for elective and emergency cesarean delivery were included in this prospective, randomized, double-blinded study between age group 19 and 40 years, gestational age 37&#x02013;40 weeks, and height 150&#x02013;170 cm. Exclusion criteria were as follows: known allergy to local anesthetics or opioids, contraindications to spinal anesthesia, and fetal indications for cesarean delivery and multiple gestations.</p><p>To facilitate blinding, the study solutions were prepared by a pharmacist who was not otherwise involved in the study. The preservative-free study drug was diluted to a total volume of 2 ml, containing either 10 mg of levobupivacaine or levobupivacaine 7.5 mg plus fentanyl 12.5 &#x003bc;g. The dose of local anesthetics administered (10 mg) was chosen in accordance with a recent dose-finding study.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Neither the anesthesiologist nor the parturient herself was aware of the drugs or dose administered. Randomization of the parturients was performed with sealed envelope technique, in which each treatment allocation was sealed in an individual envelope, and all sixty envelopes were shuffled.</p><p>Preloading was done with Ringer's lactate at a rate of 10 ml/kg. In left lateral position using 25-gauge Quincke needle at the L2&#x02013;L3 or L3&#x02013;L4 interspace, spinal anesthesia was administered. Heart rate, noninvasive blood pressure, SpO<sub>2</sub>, and respiratory rate were monitored. Bradycardia and hypotension were treated when heart rate &#x0003c;60 beats/min and mean arterial pressure (MAP) &#x0003c;60 mmHg and treated with intravenous (IV) boluses atropine 0.6 mg and ephedrine 6 mg, respectively. Nausea and vomiting if any treated with injection ondansetron 4 mg IV. Intraoperatively, parameters assessed are time taken for maximal cephalad spread, maximum cephalad level of sensory block, two segment regression time to T10, time to motor block Bromage 1, duration of the motor block, time for rescue analgesia, and Apgar score at 5 min. Postoperative heart rate, noninvasive blood pressure, SpO<sub>2</sub>, respiratory rate, and side effects (nausea, vomiting, hypotension, and bradycardia) were observed and recorded for every 30 min till 3 h, hourly till 12 h, and then every 4<sup>th</sup> hourly till 24 h. Data are presented as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation, median and range or number of parturients where appropriate. Calculation and data analyses were performed using SPSS version 20 (IBM Corp, Armonak, NY, USA). Chi-square test was used to compare nominal categorical data between study groups.

Pharmacological profile of levobupivacaine reveals no fetal toxicity. For subarachnoid block, small quantities of levobupivacaine were used and the rate of drug absorption from the subarachnoid space is low, thereby reducing the potential fetal drug load to about 1/10 of that given epidurally. In the present study, neonatal Apgar scores (neonatal outcome) showed no evidence of neonatal depression and limitation of our study being cord blood arterial blood gas was not analyzed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>Both regimes are effective. Fentanyl added to levobupivacaine during subarachnoid block offers faster onset of sensory block, prolonged duration of sensory block, and shorter duration of motor blockade; this might help early
