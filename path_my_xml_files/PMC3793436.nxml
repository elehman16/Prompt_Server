Pregnant women at risk want to be treated as normal and help her get through pregnancy and birth with as little sickness and complication as possible[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] Improvements in technology have increased the chances of survival for the micro-premature infant and the very low birth-weight infant but have significantly increased the financial burden of health care organizations. This economic burden has a significant impact on third-party payers and on society in general. Of the annual U.S. 10.2 billion dollars spent on newborn care alone, 57% is disproportionately consumed by the 10% of infants who are born preterm.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] Therefore, it is important to take into consideration the economical and social dimension of woman when directing treatment during pregnancy.</p><p>Studies have shown that fetuses of exercising women may tolerate labor better than those of nonexercisers.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] It has been suggested that regular physical activities may protect against preeclampsia by intervening at three key stages in the disease process: (1) enhanced placental growth and vascularity (protection against abnormal placental development), (2) reduction of oxidative stress, and (3) reversal of endothelial dysfunction.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] Yoga, an ancient science of holistic living has been used for centuries in stress reduction and health promotion[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] and its positive effects have been demonstrated even in women with HRP complications.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] An integrated approach to yoga during pregnancy improved birth weight, decreases preterm labor, and decreases intra uterine growth retardation (IUGR) either in isolation or associated with pregnancy-induced hypertension, with no increased complications.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>]</p><p>With these promising benefits of yoga, we could hypothesize that yoga therapy (YT) module may play a vital role in prevention of HRP. But, there was insufficient evidence for the role of the YT module in a randomized control trial for prevention of HRP. Hence, the present study was designed to assess the efficacy of the YT module in reduction of maternal stress in HRP, with the hypothesis that it is possible to select safe stress reducing practices.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Subjects and Methods</title><p>Patients with a diagnosis of HRP, who were on regular follow-up and willing to give consent for the study, were recruited from the outpatient services of the Medical College and Hospital in Bangalore, South India. A total of 68 patients were included in the study with their age ranging from 19 to 31 [mean (SD), 27.4 (5.1)] years. The reasons for exclusion of 42 women from the study were as follows: moved away (<italic>n</italic> = 20), drop out (<italic>n</italic> = 5) and irregular attendance (<italic>n</italic> = 17). There were 18 (8 yoga, 10 control) women with bad obstetric history, 14 (6 yoga, 8 control) with age factor, 14 (6 yoga, 8 control) with genetics, 13 (6 yoga, 7 control) with obesity, 8 (4 yoga, 4 control) with multiple pregnancy, and 1 (control) with diabetes. Signed informed consent was obtained from all subjects before randomization and the project had received clearance from the ethical committee of University in Bangalore, South India prior to recruitment of the subjects. Furthermore, the project was approved by the Institutional Ethical Review Board and the registration number was IERB/1/861/08. The project was also registered with Clinical Trial Registration of India (CTRI) with registration number as CTRI/2011/10/002096. Patients with a diagnosis of HRP were selected using following criteria:</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>Pregnant women with (1) hypertension at the time of recruitment/prior to this pregnancy, (2) diabetes at the time of recruitment/prior to this pregnancy, (3) past history of pregnancy complications such as pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH), gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), pre-eclampsia (PE) or eclampsia (E), intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), placental abruption (PA), and fetal death (FD), (4) multiple pregnancies, (5) extremes of age, i.e., &#x0003c;20 or &#x0003e; 35 years, (6) BMI &#x0003e; 30, (7) family history (sister, mother, and/or grandmother) of pregnancy complications (PIH, GDM, PE or E, IUGR, PA, FD).</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Exclusion criteria</title><p>Pregnant women with (1) major medical (cardiac, renal or neurological diseases) or mental illnesses (psychosis, neurosis, addictions, etc.) or with any structural abnormality of reproductive system and (2) normal pregnancy.</p><p>The present study was a single-blind randomized controlled clinical trial. Using computer-generated random numbers, 68 patients were allocated to two treatment groups: Yoga (<italic>n</italic> = 30), control (<italic>n</italic> = 38) at their 12<sup>th</sup> week of pregnancy (end of the first trimester). The power analysis (alpha = 0.01, power = 0.8, effect size = 0.81) had yielded 27 subjects per group.</p><p>The YT module used in this study was selected carefully by the investigators based on previous studies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] This module was a holistic approach to well-being at physical, mental, emotional, intellectual, and spiritual levels and was designed to reduce chronic psychological stress experienced during HRP. The practices for the control group involved standard simple prenatal stretching exercises approved by the Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists of Canada (SOGC) Clinical Practice Obstetrics Committee, the Executive and Council of SOGC, and the Board of Directors of the Canadian Society for Exercise Physiology.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>]</p><p>The outcome measure was the perceived stress scale (PSS) scores. The PSS is a widely used valid psychological instrument for measuring perception of stress in the Indian population with a Cronbach's &#x003b1; for reliability of 0.84.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] This questionnaire consists of 10 questions about experiencing stress during the previous month and coping with the stress, and has a 5-point scoring system from 0 to 4 with reverse scoring for 4 positive items (the 4<sup>th</sup>, 5<sup>th</sup>, 7<sup>th</sup>, and 8<sup>th</sup> questions).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] The final score is a sum of the scores for all 10 items. The PSS questionnaire was administered at the baseline, i.e., 12<sup>th</sup> week of pregnancy, 20<sup>th</sup> week of pregnancy (1<sup>st</sup> follow-up), and 28<sup>th</sup> week of pregnancy (2<sup>nd</sup> follow-up).</p><p>Randomization was carried out using a computer-generated random number table and all baseline data were collected prior to the starting of prenatal treatment (YT module). The fact that there was no baseline differences in the yoga and control groups helped to compare the data at follow-up without adjusting for the means at baseline. This study was a single-blind, randomized controlled clinical trial where only the patients, the medical staff, and the yoga instructor knew the treatment group. The people involved in the assessments were blind to the group treatment status.</p><p>Statistical software SPSS version 16.0 (Chicago IL.USA) was used for all data analysis. When the data were found to be normally distributed by a Kolmogorov&#x02013;Smirnov test (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05), the RMANOVA were used to assess the PSS scores between the yoga and control groups.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>Results</title><p>The trial profile shows the selections process of the subjects for the study [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. The socio-demographic data showed that there was no significant difference in any of the demographic or clinical variables in both the yoga and control groups [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>]. The independent sample <italic>t</italic>-test showed that there was no significant difference in the PSS scores between the yoga and control groups at baseline. This showed that the sample in both the groups were comparable at the same PSS score level at the start of the study. There was also no significant difference in the PSS scores between the groups at the first follow-up (20<sup>th</sup> week of pregnancy). However, a significant difference in the PSS scores (<italic>P</italic> = 0.02) of the yoga group with reduced scores at the second follow-up (28<sup>th</sup> week of pregnancy) compared to the control group was observed [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>]. Since PSS scores were collected at three time periods, i.e., baseline (12<sup>th</sup> week of pregnancy), first follow-up (20<sup>th</sup> week of pregnancy), and second follow-up (28<sup>th</sup> week of pregnancy) across two groups (yoga and control), the RMANOVA was conducted to assess PSS scores across the groups over the period of time. The results of the RMANOVA showed that there was a significant decrease (<italic>P</italic> = 0.02) in the PSS scores of the yoga group compared to the control group [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Trial profile</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AMHSR-3-341-g001"/></fig><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Demographic dat</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AMHSR-3-341-g002"/></table-wrap><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Perceived stress scale scores at baseline, first and second follow-up</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AMHSR-3-341-g003"/></table-wrap><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>RMANOVA graph depicting effect of yoga between groups across the period of 4 months</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AMHSR-3-341-g004"/></fig></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec1-4"><title>Discussion</title><p>Many women would like to avoid pharmacological or invasive methods of pain management in labor and this may contribute toward the popularity of complementary methods of pain management. In this connection, it has been reported that relaxation and yoga may have a role with reducing pain, increasing satisfaction with pain relief, and reducing the rate of assisted vaginal delivery.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] Previous study on yoga showed that yoga is a noninvasive, economical, and easy-to-learn solution to improve the quality of life of pregnant women, improve their abilities to perform their social roles, and potentially prevent adverse obstetrics outcomes. Pregnancy is a very special time in women's life and yoga can give her the opportunity and tools to enjoy this miraculous period to the fullest.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] It was demonstrated that meditation, breathing, and relaxation techniques which are the essential components of yoga have a direct and positive impact on the activities of the autonomic nervous system in a pregnant women.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] The present study is consistent with these findings, indicating that systematic and safe adoption of the YT module can be effective in reducing the stress levels in HRP. Although, the present study was mainly focused on the prevention of HRP complications (we were forced to recruit very limited number of subjects in each high-risk category), it would be interesting and extremely useful to find out what would be the long-term benefits of the YT module on the mother and the child in pregnancies at high risk. The enhanced oxygenation in maternal blood, better circulation to and from placenta, and reduced maternal stress are certain to have long-term positive impacts on the health of the mother and the child.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The present study suggests that the YT module can decrease the stress level during HRP complications. Thus, practicing the YT module during HRP complications is not just a noninvasive and economical option but also a feasible and safe option.
