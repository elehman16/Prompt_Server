Medical students learning Community Medicine as a subject are expected to be competent in critical thinking and generic skills so as to analyze community health problems better. However, current teaching by didactic lectures fails to develop these essential skills. Problem-based learning (PBL) could be an effective strategy in this respect. This study was hence done to compare the academic performance of students who were taught Community Medicine by the PBL method with that of students taught by traditional methods, to assess the generic skills of students taught in a PBL environment and to assess the perception of students toward PBL methodology.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>This study was conducted among seventh-semester final-year medical students between June and November 2014. PBL was introduced to a randomly chosen group of students, and their performance in an assessment exam at the end of postings was compared with that of the remaining students. Generic skills and perception toward PBL were also assessed using standardized questionnaires.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 77 students took part in the brainstorming session of PBL. The correlation between self-assigned scores of the participants and those assigned by the tutor in the brainstorming session of PBL was significant (<italic>r</italic> = 0.266, <italic>P</italic> = 0.05). Out of 54 students who took part in the presentation session, almost all 53 (98.1%) had good perception toward PBL. Demotivational scores were found to be significantly higher among males (<italic>P</italic> = 0.024). The academic performance of students (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) and success rates (<italic>P</italic> = 0.05) in the examination were higher among students who took part in PBL compared to controls.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusion:</title><p>PBL helped improve knowledge of students in comparison to those exposed only to didactic lectures. As PBL enabled students to identify the gaps in their knowledge and enhanced their group functioning and generic skills, we recommend PBL sessions: They would help optimize the training in Community Medicine at medical schools. Good correlation of tutor and self-assessment scores of participants in the brainstorming session suggests that the role of tutors could be restricted to assessment in presentation sessions alone. Demotivation, which hinders group performance in PBL, needs to be corrected by counselling and timely feedback by the tutors.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Community medicine</kwd><kwd>generic skills</kwd><kwd>medical students</kwd><kwd>perception</kwd><kwd>performance</kwd><kwd>problem-based learning (PBL)</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Community medicine plays a pivotal role in the delivery of health care. For efficiency in health care delivery, community health care professionals need to be successful primary health care physicians. This involves meticulous identification of common health problems in the community and the creation of effective interventional strategies to address these issues. Medical graduates today have to be critical thinkers and self-directed learners. They should have generic skills such as being able to effectively communicate and work in groups, in addition to problem-solving, while working in the community in activities including community diagnosis and investigation of epidemics. However, training for the same is lacking. Teaching is limited essentially to didactic lectures where students fail to develop these essential generic skills.(<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>)</p><p>World Health Organization (WHO) consultations on public heath teaching and training recommend utilization of 40% time for skill-building in all public health courses by innovative learning methods. These methods should make training student-centered, inquiry-driven, problem-oriented, and evidence-based, with the role of the teacher as a facilitator to help students to acquire these competencies.(<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) The Medical Council of India also recommends the teaching of concepts in Community Medicine in a small group, teaching by student-centric and problem-based approaches.(<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) The medical schools must therefore identify and define the curriculum models and instructional methods accordingly to meet these requirements among students.(<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>)</p><p>Problem-based learning (PBL) is a student-centered pedagogy in which students themselves determine what and how they learn.(<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) PBL also encourages critical thinking skills, independent responsibility for learning, knowledge acquisition, sharing information, time management skills, better retention of information, and problem-solving abilities. It thus stimulates higher-order learning in students, leading to the achievement of high professional competency.(<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) In the process, the student is inculcated with capabilities such as the ability to work productively as a team member, to master his/her communication skills, to develop better clinical reasoning skills and presentation skills, the ability to make decisions in unfamiliar situations, and respect for others, which are all key areas of a student's education in community medicine.(<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) Studies have found that students in PBL classes have higher attendance and academic performance than students who have had experienced a mostly lectured-based curriculum.(<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>)</p><p>This was the first time that the Department of Community Medicine, Kasturba Medical College, Mangalore, Karnataka introduced PBL in their teaching curriculum. As PBL is not a common learning methodology in this setting, it was necessary to prove its effectiveness over the traditional teacher-led method of education.</p><p>This study was hence done to compare the academic performance of students who were taught by PBL methodology with that of students taught by traditional methods, to assess the generic skills of students taught in a PBL environment, and to assess the perception of students toward PBL.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This experimental study was done among seventh-semester final-year MBBS students of Kasturba Medical College, Mangalore. Ethical approval for conducting this study was obtained from the institutional Ethics Committee. The tutor underwent training in PBL facilitation skills through workshops conducted by experts in the Medical Education Unit of this institution and at Melaka-Manipal Medical College, Manipal Campus, India. Content validation of the study tools was done by experts in Internal Medicine and from Medical Education Unit of this institution. The study was then conducted between June and November 2014. It is during this period that students in their seventh semester have clinical postings in Community Medicine, in batches of 50 students every month. Each batch is further divided into five subgroups of 10 students each. Each subgroup has to present a medicosocial/bedside case in communicable disease, noncommunicable disease, pediatrics, antenatal care, or postnatal care every day, followed by lectures by the tutors in the hospital wards. A subgroup of students chosen by simple random method formed the study group in PBL intervention and were given an exercise on malaria. Similarly, another subgroup was chosen to participate in a PBL exercise on tuberculosis. The remaining 40 students in each round of PBL sessions constituted the control groups. The study groups were briefed about the objective of the study, and written informed consent was taken individually for their participation. These students were given 30 minutes orientation on PBL methodology using PowerPoint slides self-prepared by the tutor based on PBL literature available online. This was followed by 10 minutes question/answer session and discussion in rounds among participants on PBL methodology using validated multiple-choice questions (MCQs) shown on PowerPoint slides. The entire PBL session was modelled on the Maastricht &#x0201c;seven jump&#x0201d; process using validated PBL exercises.(<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>)</p><p>The generic skills of the students during the brainstorming and presentation sessions were assessed by the tutor using a separate, validated, modified version of standard checklists developed by Elizondo-Montemayor.(<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) The students also self-assessed their performance using the same checklist at the end of each session. Each parameter in the checklist was scored between 1 and 10 points. Various parameters in the checklists of the brainstorming and presentation sessions were categorized into those to assess knowledge-building and inquiry skills, group skills, problem-solving skills, and attitude during discussion and professionalism. The cumulative score for each category was further classified as poor, average, or good performance. Individual feedback on their performance was given to all participants by the tutor at the end of each session. After the presentation session, students were given a validated, modified version of the standardized feedback form(<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) to enable them to share their PBL tutorial experience. It contained 49 statements to assess perception under areas such as application of knowledge base, clinical reasoning and decision-making, self-directed learning, and collaborative work in PBL sessions. It also included statements on perceptions toward peer performance (inclusive of a question on perception towards self-contribution in PBL sessions) and tutor's performance, and on PBL exercise given in the sessions. This form was designed as a five-point Likert scale. Five points were assigned to &#x0201c;strongly agree&#x0201d; responses and one point was assigned to &#x0201c;strongly disagree&#x0201d; responses. Reverse scoring was done for negative statements. Cumulative scores ranging 53-115 were considered as poor, 116-178 as average, and 179-241 as good perception toward PBL. The statements in this perception assessment form were also categorized as those related to cognition, motivation, and demotivation. The motivation domain dealt with the extent to which students express concern, motivate, and help each other learn.(<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) The cognition domain dealt with the extent of learning and understanding the topic, and the demotivation domain dealt with adverse influence on learning due to the extent of nonparticipation among a few students.(<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>)</p><p>Demographic information on the age, gender and nationality of the participants and their previous experience in case-based learning (CBL) or PBL was also collected in this form. On the final day of the 1-month postings, students of both the study and the control group took part in two written examinations, one on malaria and the other on tuberculosis, each of 30 minutes duration. Each paper contained 10 MCQs to assess content knowledge, 4 clinical reasoning MCQs to assess problem-solving and critical-thinking skills, and 1 short-answer question to assess the understanding of basic concepts and in-depth knowledge about the related disease. Out of the 10 direct MCQs, the first 5 were based on Bloom's taxonomy levels 1 and 2 (knowledge and comprehension) and the second 5 were based on levels 3-6 (application, analysis, synthesis, and evaluation).(<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) The clinical reasoning MCQs were long case vignettes consisting of patient history, physical findings, and laboratory data; students would be required to study them and synthesize important findings to reach an accurate conclusion.</p><p>One mark was awarded for a correct answer to each MCQ, and a maximum of 6 marks were awarded for the short-answer question. Participants obtaining 50% marks in the examination were considered successful.</p><p>A total of three sets of question papers were used on rotation every month throughout the study.</p><p>The Cronbach's alpha values of internal consistency for the assessment questionnaire, namely, Set 1, 2, and 3 on tuberculosis were 0.723, 0.711, and 0.891, respectively. Similarly, the values for Set 1, 2, and 3 for the assessment questionnaire on malaria were 0.848, 0.794, and 0.799, respectively, indicating good reliability.</p><p>Data entry and analysis were done using the software package Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) version 16.

This would result in better appreciation of the social and emotional aspects of health care among students.(<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) From the above observations and from our study findings, it is clear that PBL can be used to learn topics in Community Medicine more effectively than through conventional teaching methodologies.</p><p>A UK based study observed that medical students in PBL group performed significantly better in MCQ scores when compared with others in the subject of Psychiatry.(<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>) In a study done in Saudi Arabia, students in a medical college belonging to the PBL curriculum obtained a higher score in the MCQ examination and objective structured practical examination in Respiratory Physiology, compared with students taught by didactic methods.(<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) Burford <italic>et al</italic>. directed a randomized multicenter study in Pharmacology using PBL and traditional curricula, and demonstrated higher scores on knowledge testing from the PBL approach.(<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>)</p><p>However, in another study done among medical students in Lahore, Pakistan for the subjects of Obstetrics and Gynecology (OBG) and Surgery, content knowledge was significantly more among students taught through traditional teaching, involving bedside teaching and lectures in wards, which was different from our observations. But the significant difference in clinical reasoning and problem-solving skills in the PBL intervention group observed in the above mentioned study was similar to our findings.(<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>)</p><p>In this study, the pass percentage in the study group was significantly higher than controls. In other studies done in Canada(<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>) and United Kingdom,(<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>) students on a PBL curriculum reported fewer failures, but these observations were not significant.</p><p>In the UK based study, female medical students who were assigned the PBL curriculum were significantly more successful in the examinations and clinical viva than their male counterparts.(<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>) In our study, the only difference between the genders was seen in the performance of short-answer questions, but the overall performance did not differ significantly.</p><p>Considering the several benefits of PBL as observed in this study, it is not surprising that several medical schools worldwide are changing their curricula by adopting PBL programs.(<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>)</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results of the present study show that medical students who participated in a PBL curriculum obtained significantly higher knowledge, better clinical reasoning skills, and deeper understanding of the concepts of Community Medicine when compared with others taught by conventional methods. As PBL enabled students to identify the gaps in their knowledge and enhanced their group functioning and generic skills, we recommend PBL sessions: They would help optimize training in community medicine at medical schools.</p><p>The correlation between the tutor-allotted scores and the self-assigned scores of participants about their own performance was significant in the brainstorming session of PBL. Therefore, students&#x02019; self-assigned marks can be considered for brainstorming session, while tutors could focus on the assessment of presentation sessions alone. Counselling and timely feedback by tutors are also needed to minimize demotivation of participants, particularly males, during PBL sessions.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Limitations</title><p>The students in the control group did not benefit from PBL tutorials. Crossing over would have been ideal to solve this problem, which could not be done due to time restrictions. To explore the issue further, more multicenter studies are required on varied topics in Community Medicine. This will yield more evidence in support of improvement in students&#x02019; academic performance in this subject before suggestions can be made to introduce PBL and thus bring about curriculum changes.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We authors thank the MBBS students and faculty members of the Department of Community Medicine, Kasturba Medical College, Mangalore, India for their support and cooperation throughout this research.</p><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></ack><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Khoshnevisasl</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Sadeghzadeh</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Mazloomzadeh</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Hashemi Feshareki</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Ahmadiafshar</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Comparison of problem-based learning with lecture-based learning</article-title><source>Iran Red Crescent Med J</source><year>2014</year><volume>16</volume><fpage>e5186</fpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">25031862</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><article-title>World Health Organization.
