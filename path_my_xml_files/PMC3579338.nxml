Interaction between genetic and environmental factors, including diet, has an important role in development of this disease. Accumulating evidence indicates that insufficient concentrations of circulating 25(OH)D are associated with glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, and increased risk for diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Despite some evidence of ameliorated glycemic control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>) and inflammatory biomarkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>) after improvement in vitamin D status, vitamin D supplementations have not resulted in improvement of glycemic or metabolic status in some populations, and interindividual variations in response to vitamin D intake are generally considerable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). This heterogeneity in diabetic host responses to vitamin D may partly be explained by variations in the genes affecting the individual response to vitamin D intake. One of the candidate genes for controlling responses to vitamin D is vitamin D receptor (<italic>VDR</italic>), a member of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily that modulates the transcription of target genes and mediates vitamin D genomic actions. <italic>VDR</italic> is expressed in a vast array of tissues, including those involved in the regulation of glucose metabolism, such as pancreatic &#x003b2;-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Several polymorphisms of the <italic>VDR</italic> gene have been identified, and their possible significance in diabetes has been inconclusively assessed in epidemiological investigations across multiethnic groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). One of such polymorphisms is <italic>Fok-I</italic> variants, whose restriction site is located on exon 2 in the 5&#x02032;-coding region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). This polymorphism results in different translation initiation sites on <italic>VDR</italic>. A thymine to cytosine conversion in the first translation initiation codon adenine thymine guanine (ATG) (methionine) generates long and short variants of <italic>VDR</italic>. The alleles were defined as &#x02018;&#x02018;F&#x02019;&#x02019; or &#x02018;&#x02018;f&#x02019;&#x02019; depending on the absence or presence of the restriction site, respectively. In the ff variant, initiation of translation occurs at the first ATG site, giving a long version of VDR protein comprised 427 amino acids. Conversely, in the FF variant, translation begins at the second ATG site instead of the first, resulting in a protein shortened by three amino acids. This is the only known <italic>VDR</italic> polymorphism, in contrast to other variants, that is translated in two different VDR protein products. Moreover, it is the only polymorphism that is not linked to any of the other <italic>VDR</italic> variants, thus giving it a unique role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>Fok-I</italic> polymorphism, either singly or in combination with other <italic>VDR</italic> polymorphisms, has been investigated in a few studies on diabetes risk assessment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Some studies reported the association between FF genotype (either alone or together with other VDR polymorphisms) and diabetes risk in Indian population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>) and Caucasians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>), whereas one study found the subjects with ff genotype, compared with FF subjects, more susceptible to insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Another study did not find any association between <italic>Fok-I</italic> polymorphism and increased risk for type 2 diabetes and its complications in a Polish population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). These data have mostly been derived from descriptive studies, and there has not been a report of a clinical trial on the nutrigenetic association of <italic>VDR</italic>
<italic>Fok-I</italic> variants with response to vitamin D intake in diabetes to date. This study aimed to compare the effect of vitamin D intake on glycemic, lipidemic, and inflammatory responses among <italic>Fok-I</italic>
<italic>VDR</italic> variants of diabetic hosts.</p><sec id="s1"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><p>One hundred and forty type 2 diabetic patients aged 29&#x02013;67 years recruited from the Iranian Diabetes Society and Gabric Diabetes Education Association, both located in Tehran, participated in the study.

Briefly, after a 2-week run-in period, all subjects were instructed to consume a 250-mL bottle of vitamin D&#x02013;fortified Persian yogurt drink (<italic>doogh</italic>), containing 170 mg calcium and 500 IU vitamin D/250 mL per bottle, twice a day with their meals (i.e., lunch and dinner). Two bottles of <italic>doogh</italic> were replaced for one exchange of dairy product (one glass of milk or yogurt) in the participants' diets so that the total energy intake was not affected by the intervention. The subjects were asked to keep their physical activity unchanged during the intervention. Fortified <italic>dooghs</italic> were given to the participants in 15-bottle packages. Every two weeks, all subjects were visited for assessment of their compliance and provision to them of a new package. Blood pressure measurements as well as anthropometric, dietary, physical activity, and biochemical evaluations were performed for all of the subjects before and after the intervention. Finally, all participants were divided in three groups according to <italic>VDR</italic>
<italic>Fok-I</italic> variants, i.e., FF, Ff, and ff. Responses to the intervention were compared among the <italic>Fok-I</italic> genotypic groups. To ascribe changes of the variables to vitamin D intake, the intervention was performed during fall and winter, when dermal vitamin D synthesis was negligible. Moreover, a control group (<italic>n</italic> = 50) receiving equal amount of plain <italic>doogh</italic> was also included in the main study.

Some fortification experiences failed to protect the desirable proportion of the study population from vitamin D deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>), which might be, at least partly, due to the genetic variations.</p><p>The influence of <italic>VDR</italic> genotypes on absorption of both calcium and vitamin D has already been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). In a pilot study on the efficacy of vitamin D plus calcium supplementation in 92 U.S. adult subjects, after 6 months&#x02019; supplementation with 800 IU vitamin D and 2,000 mg calcium, 25(OH)D reached the desirable levels in only half of the subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Similarly, supplementation with 800 IU/day vitamin D during the winter resulted in normalization of circulating 25(OH)D in 80% of the postmenopausal women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Although no genetic analyses were performed in these studies, genetic variations of <italic>VDR</italic> among the study populations could be one explanation. In support of this notion, in subjects with low bone density who are heterozygous for allele f, compared with ff homozygotes, an increased tendency for being responsive to supplementation has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). The inverse association between <italic>VDR</italic>
<italic>Fok-I</italic> ff genotype and lower vitamin D status has also been observed among the subjects with multiple sclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>) and &#x003b2;-thalassemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>).</p><p>It is noteworthy that despite different 25(OH)D responses, changes of iPTH did not differ significantly among the groups. Contrary to our finding, in an observational study on 95 postmenopausal women, <italic>Fok-I</italic> variants were related to both secretion and degradation of parathyroid hormone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). Notwithstanding, our data showed that a parathyroid hormone&#x02013;suppressing effect of intake of 1,000 IU/day vitamin D could be similar among <italic>Fok-I</italic>
<italic>VDR</italic> genotypic groups.</p><p>The ameliorating effect of vitamin D intake on glycemic status of diabetic subjects was observed in our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). In the current study, lower 25(OH)D response to vitamin D intake in the ff group had no remarkable effect on either FSG or QUICKI. This might be due to the compensatory increased formation of the active vitamin D metabolite, 1,25(OH)D2 from 25(OH)D by 1-&#x003b1;-hydroxylase, which is also expressed in pancreatic &#x003b2;-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). Although VDR <italic>Fok-I</italic> polymorphism has been shown to explain some 29% of the variability in insulin sensitivity, it has no influence on &#x003b2;-cell function in healthy Caucasians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). The association of <italic>VDR</italic> genotypes with glycemic status has been the focus of several studies. Polymorphisms of <italic>VDR</italic>
<italic>Bsm-I</italic> have been linked to development of both diabetes and coronary artery disease (CAD) in 293 subjects at high risk of CAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). In another study, while the distribution of <italic>Apa-I</italic>, <italic>Bsm-I</italic>, and <italic>Taq-I</italic> variants did not differ between diabetic and nondiabetic subjects, <italic>Bsm-I</italic> polymorphism was associated with insulin resistance only in nondiabetic Caucasians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). High prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and its inverse association with <italic>Apa-I</italic> aa genotype and <italic>Fok-I</italic> f allele in Caribbean subjects with type 2 diabetes has been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>).</p><p>As previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>), daily consumption of vitamin D&#x02013;fortified <italic>doogh</italic> resulted in a small but significant increase in serum HDL. However, only in homozygotic subgroups (i.e., FF and ff) were the changes of HDL concentrations statistically significant. Contrary to our findings of increased serum HDL in VDR <italic>Fok-I</italic> homozygotic groups FF and ff, in a study on 276 nondiabetic overweight men (BMI 28.06 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) aged 25&#x02013;65 years, subjects with FF and Ff genotypes, compared with the ff variant, had lower HDL concentrations and higher fasting serum insulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). One of the reasons for this inconsistency in observations could be the interactive effects of other genes with VDR, including HLA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>).</p><p>Cardiovascular disease (CVD), including CAD, stroke, and peripheral vascular disease, is well-known as the major cause of morbidity and mortality in diabetic subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). However, some studies have shown that intensive treatment of hyperglycemia would lead to only 16 and 25% risk reduction of myocardial infarction and microvascular disease, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). Therefore, normalization of other risk factors, including inflammatory status, has been proposed to prevent CVD in diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). The association of inflammation with diabetes and its long-term complications has previously been documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). In the current study, although hsCRP decreased in all groups, it did so more in FF than in Ff and ff. Similarly, the decrease of cellular IL-6 in FF was in order of magnitude compared with Ff and ff, which was accompanied by a significant increase in IL-4. These changes suggest the vitamin D&#x02013;induced immune deviance toward T-helper 2, which was more prominent in FF than in Ff or ff. Considering the predisposing effect of inflammation in long-term diabetes morbidities, notably CVD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>), our findings may indicate different protective effects of vitamin D intake among diabetic subjects carrying various <italic>VDR</italic>
<italic>Fok-I</italic> genotypes.</p><p>Improvement of endothelial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>) as well as systemic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>) inflammatory biomarkers after vitamin D intake in the subjects with type 2 diabetes has already been reported. The subsided inflammatory response, however, was not accompanied by a significant change in urinary albumin excretion in either <italic>Fok-I</italic> genotypic group. The possible synergistic protective effect of both suppressed systemic/endothelial inflammation and raised serum HDL after improvement of vitamin D status in diabetic subjects and their interaction with VDR <italic>Fok-I</italic> variants could be the focus of further studies.</p><p>As vitamin D deficiency adversely affects both glycemic and inflammatory status, it can intuitively be regarded as a predisposing factor for long-term diabetes complications, including atherosclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). In the current study, 74% of the subjects initially had vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency, similar to 73% occurrence of hypovitaminosis D observed in another study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). However, not all VDR genotypic groups responded similarly to increased vitamin D intake. Actually, the ff variant showed the lowest response in terms of increments of 25(OH)D and certain inflammatory biomarkers. <italic>VDR</italic> ff genotype has also been proposed as a contributing factor in aggressive breast cancer, which is less responsive to vitamin D therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). The possible role of <italic>VDR</italic> variants in diabetes still remains to be clarified by further studies. Notwithstanding, some genotypic groups, notably <italic>VDR</italic> ff, may be considered &#x0201c;low responders&#x0201d; who may have an increased need for vitamin D. A nutrigenetic approach may, therefore, be needed to protect diabetic subjects from vitamin D deficiency. This possibility warrants further studies with larger sample sizes.</p><p>However, some limitations of the current study should be acknowledged. Polymorphisms of other <italic>VDR</italic> genotypes, i.e., <italic>Taq-I, Apa-I, Bsm-I</italic>, and <italic>Cdx-2</italic>, and their possible interactions with <italic>Fok-I</italic> variants were not evaluated. Measurement of MMP-9 should preferably have been done in plasma instead of serum. Extension of the changes observed after 12 weeks&#x02019; intervention to longer periods of time and, above all, their possible protective effect against long-term diabetes complications require well-designed longitudinal controlled studies. Regarding the small amount of 25(OH)D variation explained by genetic determinants, a Mendelian randomization approach could be beneficial to reveal a causal relationship in a large population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>).</p><p>As hypovitaminosis D may negatively affect glycemic status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>), and probably the related consequences, the very high prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency/deficiency among the participants of the current study is likely to have a major impact on the results. Also, evaluation of a vast array of variables further allowed us to detect the positive effects of vitamin D supplementation.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the interactive effects of <italic>VDR</italic>
<italic>Fok-I</italic> polymorphisms and vitamin D intake on diverse aspects of diabetes host response, including glycemic, lipidemic, and inflammatory as well as immune responses. Our findings indicated that those with <italic>VDR</italic>
<italic>Fok-I</italic> ff genotype may be regarded as low responders to vitamin D intake in terms of circulating 25(OH)D and certain inflammatory biomarkers. The prevalence of different VDR <italic>Fok-I</italic> variants among diabetic subjects could explain, at least in part, some discrepancies observed in the effect of vitamin D on various aspects of diabetes host response.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><p>Clinical trial reg. no.
