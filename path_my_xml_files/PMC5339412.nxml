Cognitive symptoms are among the most frequently endorsed symptoms, and nearly half of the patients continue to report residual cognitive symptoms between episodes (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Cognitive dysfunction has been shown to be associated with poorer functional outcomes (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) and higher rates of relapse (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) in patients with depression. However, there are major challenges to addressing the impact of cognitive problems in depression. First, clinical practitioners tend to inquire about and treat the mood symptoms and frequently do not ask patients about cognitive problems (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Second, when measured, the effects on cognition of most currently available treatments for depression are relatively small (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Recently, cognitive dysfunction has been increasingly recognized as a novel target for treatment in depression (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Alternative therapeutic interventions are needed to tackle cognitive problems in depression. In this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study, we investigated the effects of single-dose modafinil on cognitive domains in patients with remitted depression.</p><p>Modafinil is a wake-promoting agent currently licensed for narcolepsy and shift work sleep disorder (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Its beneficial effects on sleep problems, fatigue, and motivation have led to its use to alleviate symptoms in patients with depression. A meta-analysis of randomized placebo-controlled trials revealed that modafinil augmentation was associated with greater reduction in symptom severity in depression (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Notably, modafinil&#x02019;s effectiveness was evident in the first week, suggesting possible acute or subchronic effects. However, there was not a single cognitive outcome in the previously published controlled studies. To date, only one open-label study has measured cognitive performance and demonstrated improvement with modafinil augmentation in an executive function task (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Over the past 2 decades, the cognition-enhancing potential of modafinil has been shown for various domains of cognitive performance in healthy volunteers (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Modafinil also improved cognitive dysfunction in other psychiatric conditions, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) and schizophrenia (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Procognitive effects of modafinil on working memory were associated with its effects on noradrenaline and dopamine in the prefrontal cortex. It was suggested that modafinil&#x02019;s action on glutamatergic pathways may be linked with positive effects on encoding (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p><p>A growing body of evidence indicates that cognitive deficits in depression are seen even after mood symptoms recover (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). A recent meta-analysis of depression studies examining a broad range of cognitive domains showed that the magnitude of cognitive deficits in remitted depression were in some domains comparable to deficits during episodes (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Patients with remitted depression showed cognitive deficits in the domains of executive function, memory, and attention. Given these previously published findings, we specifically aimed to recruit patients with remitted depression to test the efficacy of modafinil on cognition. Using patients in remission minimizes the confounding effects of depressed mood on cognition. Neuropsychological performance in depression is highly heterogeneous (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>); therefore, differences between patients in cognitive deficits should be taken into consideration. In this study, we used a baseline cognitive testing session to assess possible performance differences within the sample. The rationale for test selection was based on those tests shown to be most affected in the recent meta-analysis (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Measures from this session were used to inform analyses at the intervention session.</p><p>The main aim of this study was to investigate whether a single dose of modafinil (200 mg) could improve performance on cognitive tests in patients with remitted depression. The possible mediating role of clinical variables on cognition was assessed, including fatigue symptoms, psychosocial functioning, and work functioning.</p><sec id="s0005"><title>Methods and Materials</title><sec id="s0010"><title>Research Governance</title><p>The study was jointly sponsored by the University of Cambridge and Cambridgeshire and Peterborough National Health Service (NHS) Foundation Trust. The protocol was submitted to Medicines and Health Products Regulatory Agency, and the study was classified as not a clinical trial of an investigational medicinal product. Study funding was from a core award to the Behavioural and Clinical Neuroscience Institute from the Medical Research Council and the Wellcome Trust. The Ethics application was approved on June 25, 2014, by the NHS National Research Ethics Service&#x02013;Cambridge East Research Ethics Committee (Ethics Reference No. 14/EE/0178). The study was adopted by National Institute of Health Research Clinical Research Network&#x02013;Mental Health and registered into a public database (UK CRN ID: 17355) that was accessible online. The consent procedure was in line with NHS National Research Ethics Service ethical standards and was compliant with the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consents were obtained at the baseline session.</p></sec><sec id="s0015"><title>Participants</title><p>In total, 60 patients with remitted depression aged between 18 and 65 years were recruited from a range of mental health trusts, from general practitioner surgeries, and through online and local advertisements. Inclusion criteria were 1) confirmed diagnosis of a previous unipolar depressive episode (during the last 3 years) according to ICD-10 diagnostic criteria, 2) currently in remission from depression (score of less than 12 on the Montgomery&#x02013;&#x000c5;sberg Depression Rating Scale [MADRS]) for at least 2 months, and 3) fluency in English. Exclusion criteria were 1) history of head injury, 2) mental retardation, 3) any other psychiatric diagnosis (except comorbid anxiety), 4) active suicidal ideation, 5) cognitive disorder owing to a medical condition, 6) pregnancy and breastfeeding, 7) treatment-resistant hypertension or any known significant cardiovascular disease, 8) renal or liver disease/impairment, 9) taking hormonal contraceptives, anticonvulsants, or warfarin, 10) taking drugs that are metabolized through CYPC19 enzymes or drugs that are eliminated by gastrointestinal CYP3A enzymes, and 11) taking maximum dose of antidepressant medication that is metabolized through CYP2D6 enzymes owing to a possible interaction in people who have low metabolizer status (approximately 7% of the U.K. population).</p><p>The sample consisted of 37 female and 23 male patients. The mean age of participants was 45.03 &#x000b1; 10.82 years, the mean length of current remission was 8.21 &#x000b1; 7.49 months, and the mean number of previous depressive episodes was 3.18 &#x000b1; 1.52. Patients had some degree of residual depressive symptoms; the mean MADRS score at the baseline session was 5.33 &#x000b1; 3.25. The details of demographic and clinical features are presented in <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The groups were balanced in terms of age, gender, and education levels (<xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Of the sample, 48 patients were on antidepressant medication (citalopram = 15, venlafaxine = 11, sertraline = 6, fluoxetine = 5, duloxetine = 2, mirtazapine = 2, dosulepin = 2, doxapin = 1, bupropion = 1, nortryptiline, = 1, amitryptiline, = 1, trazodone = 1), whereas 12 patients were unmedicated. The study sessions were conducted between November 2014 and November 2015.</p></sec><sec id="s0020"><title>Study Sessions</title><sec id="s0025"><title>Baseline Session</title><p>Participants attended a baseline session at their local mental health trust. They were assessed at the same time interval (10 AM to 2 PM) in a quiet room, and they were advised not to take caffeinated drinks at least 2 hours before the session. Benzodiazepine use was not allowed prior to the session. The session involved detailed evaluation of clinical features, depression history, anxiety ratings (State and Trait Anxiety Inventory), depressive symptom severity rating with MADRS, premorbid IQ (National Adult Reading Test), psychosocial functioning (Global Assessment of Functioning), work functioning (Lam Employment Absence and Productivity Scale), and computerized cognitive testing. The following tests from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) were used: 1) Rapid Visual Information Processing (RVIP), 2) Stockings of Cambridge (SOC), 3) Spatial Working Memory (SWM), and 4) Paired Associates Learning (PAL). A summary of the tests, including descriptions, main outcome measures, and references, is presented in <xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Detailed descriptions can be found in the CANTABeclipse administration guide (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). In addition to providing baseline data, this session familiarized participants with the tests.</p></sec><sec id="s0030"><title>Intervention Session</title><p>Approximately 1 week after the baseline session, participants attended the intervention session at the National Institute of Health Research/Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Facility at Addenbrooke&#x02019;s Hospital. A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled parallel groups design was used. Study sessions were scheduled at the same time of the day (10 AM to 12 PM) to keep the testing time standard. Before dosing, participants had their current mental state assessed as well as a baseline blood pressure, electrocardiogram, urine drug screening, and assessment of breath alcohol concentration. The assessments included the Fatigue Severity Scale, visual analogue scales of feelings, anxiety ratings (State and Trait Anxiety Inventory), and depressive symptom ratings (MADRS). After the assessments, participants received modafinil (200 mg) or placebo. The modafinil dose was selected on the basis of previous experimental studies that reported procognitive effects (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Cognitive testing started 2 hours after dosing. Modafinil was shown to reach its peak level in 2 to 4 hours, so the interval allowed us to test the participants in a time window while modafinil had peak plasma levels. Blood pressure and heart rate were monitored every half hour after dosing. The participants spent 2 hours before the test administration in a quiet day room at the Clinical Research Facility. All neuropsychological tests were delivered by the first author, who is a trained psychiatrist. Light lunches and snacks were provided with the exception of caffeinated drinks.</p><p>At the intervention session, the CANTAB SWM task with high levels of difficulty (up to 12 boxes) and the PAL test with high levels of difficulty (up to 12 shapes) were administered. One Touch Stockings (OTS), a challenging planning task, was selected instead of the easier planning task, the SOC. Those versions of the tasks in previously published studies have been found to have greater sensitivity and to avoid ceiling effects. The version of CANTAB RVIP used was the same in both sessions. Primary and secondary cognitive measures are listed in <xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0035"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>The data were analyzed with version 21.0 of the SPSS statistical software package (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). Separate linear models were constructed for each neuropsychological outcome at the intervention session as dependent variables. The groups (modafinil and placebo) were fixed factors, and neuropsychological test scores at the baseline were used as covariates to account for within-group variance in preexisting cognitive performance. In the intervention session, test versions with higher difficulty levels were used to minimize learning effects. The statistical approach allowed us to account for the cognitive level at baseline on performance after the intervention without potential confounding effects related to differential task difficulty. Additional covariates (National Adult Reading Test, age, etc.) were selected if they accounted for a significant proportion of the variance in linear models. Sidak correction was applied for adjustment of multiple comparisons. All <italic>p</italic> values reported are corrected for multiple comparisons. Estimates of effect sizes are reported as partial eta squared (&#x003b7;<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup>) values.

The participants were asked at the end of the test session whether they thought they were on modafinil or placebo. In response, 40% of patients in the modafinil group were able to guess that they received modafinil, whereas 26.6% of patients in the placebo group correctly guessed that they received placebo. Comparison of the two groups showed no significant difference in the ability to correctly detect group membership (&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> = 1.200, <italic>p</italic> = .27 [two sided]).

However, there were no effects on attention and planning. It has been reported that modafinil can improve forms of cognition in both healthy volunteers and people with cognitive impairment owing to psychiatric conditions (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Findings from the current study indicate that modafinil can also improve domains of cognition in those with remitted depression. To our knowledge, this study is the first to investigate the effects of modafinil in remitted depression.</p><p>The effects of modafinil on episodic memory were found to be within the medium to large effect size range. In contrast, previous studies did not find an improvement in episodic memory with single-dose modafinil (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), although most of these studies used an easier version of the PAL test. The only study that used the new difficult version of the PAL test, which was up to the 12 shapes level (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), reported possible ceiling effects in their high-functioning healthy sample. An alternative explanation for the improvement by modafinil in episodic memory might be related to a possibly altered neural circuit in patients with remitted depression. One of the proposed neural mechanisms for cognitive dysfunction in depression is impaired hippocampal function. This was supported by consistent findings of reduced hippocampal volumes in people with a history of depression (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Patients with depression showed lower hippocampal activation in functional imaging during an associative learning task (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). The findings from the current study indicated that the effects of modafinil were related to improvements at the initial encoding stage rather than on the subsequent learning trials of the PAL task. In a previously published imaging study by our group, we demonstrated that the hippocampal formation was primarily recruited in the encoding stage of the PAL task, whereas parahippocampal structures were more activated in retrieval (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). The activation was also associated with increasing task difficulty. Episodic memory improvement observed in this study could be associated with neurochemical changes induced by modafinil in hippocampal areas, particularly via glutamatergic mechanisms. Experimental studies indicate that modafinil could induce glutamate release in the hippocampus (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Modafinil was shown to increase regional blood flow to the hippocampus in healthy volunteers (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>); therefore, this may be the underlying mechanism of improved performance in the PAL test.</p><p>The finding of working memory improvements at the highest level of difficulty was similar to that seen in a study of healthy volunteers that used the high-functioning version of the CANTAB (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Other studies using relatively easier versions of the CANTAB SWM task did not show significant effects of modafinil, again probably related to ceiling effects. The effects of modafinil were evident only in the 12 boxes stage of SWM in the current study. Previously, single-dose modafinil (200 mg) was shown to improve working memory and altered frontal activation in sleep-deprived healthy volunteers (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). In patients with schizophrenia, modafinil administration was associated with increased dorsolateral prefrontal activity (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). The actions of modafinil on norepinephrine and dopamine in dorsolateral prefrontal regions likely play a role in improved working memory performance (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). It should also be noted that working memory performance at baseline was associated with psychosocial functioning as measured by the Global Assessment of Functioning in our sample of remitted depressed patients. This finding suggested that working memory is a particularly critical domain for future studies as a potential target to improve daily functioning (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies consistently reported improvements in planning accuracy with single-dose modafinil in healthy volunteers (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). However, modafinil did not have a significant effect on planning accuracy or speed in the current study. The effects of modafinil on OTS latency varied across studies. Mean latency scores in the OTS in this study were noteworthy because both groups took markedly longer times to correction compared with those in previous studies (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). The lack of improvement in RVIP performance was in line with previous studies using single-dose modafinil (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). This study lends further support to the conclusion that modafinil does not exert its effects on domains of memory and executive function via enhancing attention.</p><p>There are several limitations to the current study. First, this study investigated the acute effects rather than long-term effects of modafinil. Second, the majority of participants were on regular antidepressant treatment. However, our study accurately reflects the clinical population. The unmedicated group and patients on specific types of antidepressants (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor) were not sufficiently large to run separate analyses. Third, there was not a measure for subjective cognitive complaints, although it appears that subjective measures are more closely related to the mood symptoms (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). The diagnoses were made on the basis of clinical evaluation and previous clinical records, but a structured interview (Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry) for ICD-10 diagnoses was not used. Last, this proof-of-concept study investigated the cognitive effects of modafinil on a number of domains, and the findings were preliminary for future research.</p><p>Despite the growing evidence that cognitive dysfunction in depression extends beyond the episodes, few studies have sought to examine potential therapeutic interventions to address those problems. Those including cognitive outcomes currently focused on treatment of acute episodes along with cognitive deficits (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Cognitive deficits in remitted depression have detrimental effects on life functioning and pose a risk for relapse. Recurrent depression has been reported to increase the risk for dementia (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Recently, achievement of &#x0201c;cognitive remission&#x0201d; has been proposed as a novel objective for treatment of depression (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). Modafinil has been used in various clinical populations, including depression. Augmentation with modafinil could be a safe and effective option for acute depressive episodes (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). This proof-of-concept study suggested that modafinil could improve episodic and working memory functions in remitted depressed patients. Further research into the use of modafinil over a longer time period, and in combination with psychological treatments on cognitive dysfunction in depression, is warranted.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="bibliog0005"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Conradi</surname><given-names>H.J.</given-names></name><name><surname>Ormel</surname><given-names>J.</given-names></name><name><surname>de Jonge</surname><given-names>P.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Presence of individual (residual) symptoms during depressive episodes and periods of remission: A 3-year prospective study</article-title><source>Psychol Med</source><volume>41</volume><year>2011</year><fpage>1165</fpage><lpage>1174</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">20932356</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref2"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Jaeger</surname><given-names>J.</given-names></name><name><surname>Berns</surname><given-names>S.</given-names></name><name><surname>Uzelac</surname><given-names>S.</given-names></name><name><surname>Davis-Conway</surname><given-names>S.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Neurocognitive deficits and disability in major depressive disorder</article-title><source>Psychiatry Res</source><volume>145</volume><year>2006</year><fpage>39</fpage><lpage>48</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">17045658</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref3"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Godard</surname><given-names>J.</given-names></name><name><surname>Baruch</surname><given-names>P.</given-names></name><name><surname>Grondin</surname><given-names>S.</given-names></name><name><surname>Lafleur</surname><given-names>M.F.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Psychosocial and neurocognitive functioning in unipolar and bipolar depression: A 12-month prospective study</article-title><source>Psychiatry Res</source><volume>196</volume><year>2012</year><fpage>145</fpage><lpage>153</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">22370154</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref4"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Majer</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Ising</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name><name><surname>K&#x000fc;nzel</surname><given-names>H.</given-names></name><name><surname>Binder</surname><given-names>E.B.</given-names></name><name><surname>Holsboer</surname><given-names>F.</given-names></name><name><surname>Modell</surname><given-names>S.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Impaired divided attention predicts delayed response and risk to relapse in subjects with depressive disorders</article-title><source>Psychol Med</source><volume>34</volume><year>2004</year><fpage>1453</fpage><lpage>1463</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15724876</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref5"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Demyttenaere</surname><given-names>K.</given-names></name><name><surname>Donneau</surname><given-names>A.F.</given-names></name><name><surname>Albert</surname><given-names>A.</given-names></name><name><surname>Ansseau</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Constant</surname><given-names>E.</given-names></name><name><surname>Van Heeringen</surname><given-names>K.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>What is important in being cured from depression?
