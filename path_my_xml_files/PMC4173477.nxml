Such accumulation may delay recovery from anesthesia. The impact of anesthetic stored in fat may be the result of a return of the anesthetic in blood perfusing the fat or of a transfer from fat to adjacent highly perfused tissues.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Obesity magnifies the importance of the fat&#x02013;blood solubility coefficient of the anesthetic in its relation to emergence and recovery.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Clinical studies involving electroencephalographic-based cerebral monitors have demonstrated titration of both intravenous[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and inhalational[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] anesthetics during general anesthesia. Titration of anesthetics using these monitors can facilitate an earlier emergence from general anesthesia. Bispectral index (BIS) monitoring has been proven to be effective in preventing awareness. Optimizing anesthesia level using BIS monitoring will probably help to shorten recovery time and reduce total anesthetic drug consumption.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Using BIS monitoring for the titration of the administration of inhaled anesthetics such as desflurane may permit a less consumption and more rapid recovery from desflurane anesthesia in morbidly obese patients. No studies have investigated the potential usefulness of BIS monitoring to guide the administration of desflurane in morbidly obese patients undergoing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. The aim of this randomized prospective controlled single-blinded study was to investigate the effect of BIS monitoring on extubation and recovery times, and intraoperative desflurane consumption in morbidly obese patients undergoing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy under general anesthesia using desflurane for maintenance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>PATIENTS AND METHODS</title><p>After local institutional review board approval was obtained and all patients gave informed written consent, 40 morbidly obese patients [body mass index (BMI) &#x0003e;35 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and ASA physical status II&#x02013;III] undergoing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy were included in the study. Exclusion criteria were memory impairment, psychosis, known or suspected electroencephalograph abnormality (e.g., epilepsy, previous brain operation), chronic use of psychoactive medication, and operation time exceeding 6 h. Patients were randomly allocated into two groups (20 patients each) as follows: Group 1 (non-BIS group): Desflurane was administered according to standard clinical practice (control group) and group 2 (BIS group): Desflurane was titrated to maintain a BIS value between 40 and 60 during surgery, and then to 60&#x02013;70 during 15 min before the end of surgery. All patients were pre-medicated by esomeprazole 40 mg orally at the night of surgery, and metechlopramide 10 mg and lorazepam 2 mg orally by sip of water 3 h before surgery. Anesthesia was induced with 1.5-2 mg/kg intravenous propofol and 2 &#x003bc;g/kg intravenous fentanyl injected over 15-30 s. Intravenous rocuronium, 0.9 mg/kg, was administered to facilitate tracheal intubation and neuromuscular blockade. All patients were mechanically ventilated on 40% oxygen mixed with air to maintain an end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2) concentration of 35-40 mmHg through Datex-Ohmeda S/5 anesthesia machine. Intravenous paracetamol 1 g was given to all patients of both groups over 15 min after induction of anesthesia and local infiltration with marcaine 0.25% was given by the surgeon before all skin incisions (five small incisions). BIS monitoring (BISA-2000 software 2.21, Aspect Medical Systems, Newton, MA, USA) was initiated at induction, and smoothing time was 30 s (only in BIS group). Standard monitoring [SpO<sub>2</sub>, electrocardiogram, ETCO2, indirect or direct blood pressure (BP), and esophageal temperature probe] was used in all patients. Desflurane 6% in 2 l/min fresh gas flow, mixed in air and oxygen, was administered to all patients after endotracheal intubation until skin incision; then the concentration was changed every 5 min as follows: Non-BIS group (control group), the anesthesiologist adjusted the desflurane concentration purely according to the clinical signs [heart rate (HR) and BP]. However, in BIS group, the anesthesiologist adjusted the concentration of desflurane to achieve a target BIS in the range 40-60. End-tidal concentration of desflurane was also regularly recorded (by Datex-Ohmeda S/5 monitor). During the operation, the patients in both groups were observed for signs of inadequate anesthesia (increased BP and HR 20% from baseline, lacrimation). Significant hypotension or bradycardia was defined as 20% reduction of the baseline figures. Any instances of inadequate anesthesia were managed by increasing the concentration of desflurane. Rocuronium neuromuscular blockade was maintained to a single twitch of the train of four. During the last 15 min of surgery, in the BIS group, the BIS value was gradually titrated to 60-70 by decreasing the inhaled anesthetic concentration. After skin closure and application of surgical dressing, neuromuscular blockade was reversed with neostigmine (0.07 mg/kg) and glycopyrrolate (0.015 mg/kg), desflurane was discontinued, and fresh gas flows were increased to 10 l/min. Mechanical ventilation (10 ml/kg ideal body weight) was continued until the first spontaneous respiration began, followed by assisted manual ventilation. A verbal command (open your eyes) was given every 1 min. After a train-of-four ratio higher than 0.9, a 5-s head lift was performed and patients were extubated. Times from discontinuation of the desflurane to eye opening and extubation were recorded. Recovery times (eye opening on verbal commands, and orientation to time, place, and person) were assessed at 1-min intervals. The time to extubation and also the time to achieve a modified Aldrete score (Appendix) of &#x02265; 9 were recorded. All recovery times, end-tidal desflurane concentration, and desflurane consumption per patient were recorded by blinded study anesthesia nurse. After extubation, patients were transferred fully awake on oxygen mask 4 l/min to the post-anesthetic care unit (PACU). All patients were observed in PACU for 3 h. Postoperative pain was evaluated at 5-min intervals using a 5-point verbal rating scale (0: No pain; 1: Light pain; 2: Moderate pain; 3: Intense pain; 4: Severe pain). Pain scores were treated with intravenous meperidine up to 1 mg/kg according to ideal body weight. All patients were discharged from the PACU after they fulfilled discharge criteria (stable hemodynamics, fully conscious, pain free with no nausea or emesis). At the time of discharge from the recovery room and 24 h after surgery, patients were asked whether they had bad dreams or recalled any intraoperative events. Desflurane consumption was calculated in milliliters through gas usage option of Datex-Ohmeda S/5 anesthesia machine.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Power analysis suggested that group sizes of 17 should be adequate to detect a significant difference (&#x0003e;25%) in the percentage of patients able to respond to initial command with &#x003b1; =0.05 and &#x003b2; =0.80.

Song and other authors[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] had concluded that BIS monitoring allows reduction in the total amount of intraoperative anesthetic consumption and appears to decrease emergency and recovery times.</p><p>There were significant differences in the times of eye opening to verbal commands, extubation time, and orientation to time, place, and person between BIS and non-BIS groups; however, there were no significant differences between the two groups in obtaining Aldrete score of &#x02265; 9.

Heavner <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] had demonstrated that use of BIS monitoring had improved recovery profiles in elderly patients anesthetized by desflurane and nitrous oxide. Other BIS-guided studies demonstrated that recovery time is reduced, compared with previous non&#x02013;BIS-guided studies where the desflurane or sevoflurane dosages were based on MAC and hemodynamic response, whether mixed with nitrous oxide[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] or not.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>Song <italic>et al</italic>. failed to detect differences in total recovery duration and the duration of stay in the recovery unit between BIS-monitored and control groups.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] In our study, patient stay in the PACU was determined by 3 h.</p><p>Significant reduction of the end-tidal desflurane concentration and desflurane consumption in the BIS group compared to the non-BIS group coincides with other studies[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] which reported that practitioners use lower concentrations of volatile anesthetics when they use information provided by cerebral monitors such as BIS and auditory evoked potential (AEP). Also, White <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] found that AEP and BIS monitoring can decrease the end-tidal desflurane concentration during anesthesia maintenance and can also decrease the discharge times after the end of anesthesia during laparoscopic ambulatory surgery.
