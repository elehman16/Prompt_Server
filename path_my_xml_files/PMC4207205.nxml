However, high insulin concentration lowers the hyperglycemic effect of glucagon, and small doses of glucagon in this setting are ineffective. There are no studies clearly defining the relationship between insulin levels, subcutaneous glucagon, and blood glucose.</p></sec><sec><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><p>Using a euglycemic clamp technique in 11 subjects with type 1 diabetes, we examined endogenous glucose production (EGP) of glucagon (25, 75, 125, and 175 &#x003bc;g) at three insulin infusion rates (0.016, 0.032, and 0.05 units/kg/h) in a randomized, crossover study. Infused 6,6-dideuterated glucose was measured every 10 min, and EGP was determined using a validated glucoregulatory model. Area under the curve (AUC) for glucose production was the primary outcome, estimated over 60 min.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><p>At low insulin levels, EGP rose proportionately with glucagon dose, from 5 &#x000b1; 68 to 112 &#x000b1; 152 mg/kg (<italic>P</italic> = 0.038 linear trend), whereas at high levels, there was no increase in glucose output (19 &#x000b1; 53 to 26 &#x000b1; 38 mg/kg, <italic>P</italic> = NS). Peak glucagon serum levels and AUC correlated well with dose (<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.63, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001), as did insulin levels with insulin infusion rates (<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.59, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>EGP increases steeply with glucagon doses between 25 and 175 &#x003bc;g at lower insulin infusion rates. However, high insulin infusion rates prevent these doses of glucagon from significantly increasing glucose output and may reduce glucagon effectiveness in preventing hypoglycemia when used in the artificial pancreas.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="7"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Dysfunctional Counter-regulation in Diabetes</title><p>Beginning soon after the discovery of insulin, the role of the counter-regulatory hormone glucagon has been studied in light of its impact on glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Although &#x003b2;-cell dysfunction is known to be the hallmark of type 1 and type 2 diabetes (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), &#x003b1;-cell dysfunction in both of these conditions may also contribute to the diabetic condition (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). The occurrence of &#x003b1;-cell dysfunction in diabetes is primarily due to loss of intrinsic &#x003b2;-cell control: insulin's signaling is believed to be necessary for appropriate and timely release of glucagon during hypoglycemia, as well as for appropriate suppression of glucagon release during hyperglycemia (for example, after meals) (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Conversely, isolated &#x003b1;-cell dysfunction has little effect on glucose regulation since normal &#x003b2;-cell function is sufficient to regulate glucose levels in the otherwise healthy individual (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). However, the administration of subcutaneous insulin, i.e., nonpulsatile, low portal-systemic ratio, does not sufficiently regulate glucagon release in people with diabetes (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Additionally, subcutaneously delivered insulin has slow absorption and clearance profiles, even for fast-acting analogs (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). In patients who use insulin, hypoglycemia is accompanied by high insulin concentration at the time of low blood glucose, a nonphysiologic situation and a further cause of reduced glucagon effectiveness (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). For these reasons, endogenous glucagon release by the pancreas in people with diabetes cannot be relied upon in cases of imminent hypoglycemia after subcutaneous injections of insulin. Indeed, Lorenzi et al. (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) demonstrated in the 1980s that the glucagon response to hypoglycemia in people with type 1 diabetes was markedly reduced, especially in those with long-standing diabetes.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Glucagon in the Artificial Endocrine Pancreas</title><p>With one early exception, most artificial pancreas systems over the last half century have been single hormone delivery with insulin for the control of type 1 diabetes (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). A number of control strategies have been used, along with the incorporation of glucoregulatory models (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), in the attempt to better match glycemic control and subcutaneous insulin delivery. However, despite the introduction of fast-acting insulin analogs, the delay in absorption and action of subcutaneous insulin remains one of the greatest hurdles to overcome in single-hormone closed-loop systems (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). The recently renewed inclusion of glucagon into artificial pancreas systems has led to a reduced risk of hypoglycemia during closed-loop control (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Small (microgram level) doses of glucagon have been shown by several research groups to minimize time spent in the hypoglycemic range (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Yet a percentage of glucagon doses delivered are unsuccessful in preventing hypoglycemia, despite accounting for insulin on board (IOB) (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Castle et al. (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) found that correcting glucagon dose based on IOB could account for &#x0223c;46% of failures within the hour after a glucagon dose is delivered (37% of failures without accounting for IOB vs. 20% of failures with IOB-adjusted dosing) (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Factors such as sensor inaccuracy, glucagon degradation, glycogen depletion, and varying pharmacokinetic profiles have been offered as additional explanations (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), but the scarcity of data evaluating microgram doses of glucagon normally used in the setting of bihormonal closed-loop control leaves more questions than provides answers.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Quantifying the Glucagon Response</title><p>The glycemic response to doses of intravenous glucagon has been studied extensively since its discovery, both as single dose injections or constant infusions (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Like insulin, subcutaneously delivered glucagon has a delayed onset of action compared with intravenous delivery. Unlike insulin, however, the physiological effect of subcutaneously delivered glucagon has received little attention until more recently, evident by the scarcity of integrated glucagon absorption and action models (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). As a result, this research study was designed with the intent to quantitatively analyze the glucose response to small doses of glucagon delivered subcutaneously at varying steady-state insulin levels. The primary goal was to elucidate the interaction between insulin and glucagon in order to model the response of endogenous glucose production (EGP) at doses used in the artificial pancreas system. A secondary goal was to determine if high levels of insulin indeed can be overcome by increasing the dose of glucagon.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Research Design and Methods</title><sec id="s6"><title>Subject Recruitment</title><p>Subjects were recruited from the Legacy Health Services outpatient clinics in Portland, OR, or from prior contact with our laboratory, between December 2011 and January 2013. Subjects were between 21 and 65 years of age with a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes for &#x0003e;12 months. Exclusionary conditions included pregnancy; ongoing cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, renal, or hepatic disease; any uncontrolled chronic medical condition; oral or parenteral corticosteroid use; immunosuppressant therapy; insulin or glucagon allergy; serum insulin antibody titer &#x0003e;100 &#x000b5;U/mL; or total insulin requirement &#x0003e;200 units/day. The research protocol was reviewed and approved by the Legacy Health Services institutional review board, and all subjects provided written informed consent. Sample size was chosen based on an estimated &#x003b1; error of 0.05, a power of 85%, to detect a 20% difference between groups, with an expected SD of 20% about the mean. Adverse events were monitored and reported by the principal investigator and coinvestigators.</p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Study Materials</title><p>Drugs included regular human insulin (Humulin R; Eli Lilly and Company) and octreotide (Sandostatin; Novartis) for intravenous infusion. Glucagon (GlucaGen) was provided by courtesy of Novo Nordisk. Di-deuterated glucose (6,6-<sup>2</sup>H<sub>2</sub>-glucose, 98 atom % D isotopic purity) was purchased through Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) for stable isotope infusion. Insulin was infused intravenously at a constant rate for the 10 h of each study day, although at a different rate on each day. Octreotide was prepared as 2 mg in 1,000 mL of 0.9% NaCl, supplemented with 1,330 mg of deuterated glucose and delivered at 0.45 mL/kg/h for the first nine studies. However, after the occurrence of gastrointestinal side effects (loose stools or nausea), the octreotide rate was subsequently lowered to 0.25 mL/kg/h with a resultant increase in the deuterated glucose supplementation to 2,337 mg per liter of fluid, in order to maintain the same infusion rate of deuterated glucose. All protocol changes were instituted after obtaining institutional review board approval. Additionally, each liter of 10% dextrose was supplemented with 800 mg of deuterated glucose (0.8% enrichment) in order to minimize dilution effects from infused glucose (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s8"><title>Study Procedures</title><p>Each subject underwent three studies on three separate days, each study lasting &#x0223c;10 h. Subjects arrived between 7:00 and 8:00 <sc>a.m.</sc> on each day and were admitted to the Legacy Good Samaritan Hospital after having had breakfast at least 2 h before admission and having turned off their insulin pumps after their breakfast bolus. Subjects were fasted throughout the entire study to remove confounding from meals. On one arm, a double stop-cock system was attached. Arterialization of blood flow was accomplished by application of a heating pad to increase blood flow and allow for blood sampling up to every 5 min. On the other arm, insulin, octreotide, and 10% dextrose were infused. Insulin infusion was constant on each day, at one of three randomly assigned rates: <italic>1</italic>) a minimum rate of either 0.01 units/kg/h or an average of the subject&#x02019;s daytime basal rate, whichever was higher (designated &#x0201c;low&#x0201d;); <italic>2</italic>) a rate of 0.05 units/kg/h (designated &#x0201c;high&#x0201d;); and <italic>3</italic>) midway between the minimum and maximum rates (designated &#x0201c;medium&#x0201d;). These rates were determined at the time of screening. The lowest rate of insulin infusion was not set (for example at 0.01 units/kg/h) but rather was tailored to the subject&#x02019;s usual basal infusion rate in order to achieve target glucose levels during the low insulin studies. An infusion rate less than their basal requirement would lead to prolonged hyperglycemia.</p><p>Insulin and octreotide infusions were begun once the infusion catheter was available in order to help achieve steady state quickly. Ten percent dextrose infusion was controlled by a proportional integral derivative algorithm design, based upon simulation analyses performed by Bequette (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>), using a target glucose level of 85 &#x000b1; 20 mg/dL. A 2-h run-in period was allowed for achievement of infusion steady states prior to the first dose of glucagon. Every 2 h after the run-in period, glucagon was delivered subcutaneously in a pseudo-random order based on blocks of four, in doses of 25, 75, 125, and 175 &#x003bc;g, varying the initial dose while keeping the same order. Each subject received the same glucagon dose order assigned during screening on each study day. Pseudo-randomization of glucagon doses resulted in the first dose as follows: 25 &#x003bc;g during eight studies, 75 &#x003bc;g during seven studies, 125 &#x003bc;g during nine studies, and 175 &#x003bc;g during five studies. Also, glucagon and insulin levels were drawn every 10 min during the first hour after each glucagon dose, and every 20 min during the second hour. From a total of 116 batches of glucagon samples (4 per study from 29 studies), contamination was noted in 17 batches, in which the glucagon levels exceeded the upper limit of the assay. The remaining 99 batches were used for this analysis, 24 after the 25- and 75-&#x003bc;g doses, 26 after the 125-&#x003bc;g dose, and 25 after the 175-&#x003bc;g dose. Glucose levels were checked every 10 min (every 5 min if the previous check was &#x0003c;60 mg/dL) for the duration of each study utilizing the HemoCue Hb 201 DM analyzer (Cypress, CA). Blood was drawn for measurement of di-deuterated glucose levels at the 0-min time point and every 10 min from the 60-min time point onwards.</p></sec><sec id="s9"><title>Laboratory Testing</title><p>For analysis by gas chromatography&#x02013;mass spectrometry, derivatization of glucose in blood samples was accomplished as follows (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>):</p><list list-type="order" id="L1"><list-item><p>A total of 20 &#x000b5;L of plasma was placed into a 13 &#x000d7; 100 mm disposable glass test tube, to which 50 &#x000b5;L of water and 0.5 mL of ice-cold ethanol were added.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The mixture was then vortex mixed before centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 10 min, with transfer of the supernatant, using gel-loading tips, to a 13 &#x000d7; 100 culture tube, and then allowing evaporation to dryness in a centrifugal evaporator (&#x0223c;1 h).</p></list-item><list-item><p>To the dry vial, 50 &#x000b5;L of MOX reagent (2% methoxyamine-HCl in pyridine; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Ashville, NC) was added, and the vial was capped with a teflon-lined screw cap and then heated for 2 h at 80&#x000b0;C in a dry block heater.</p></list-item><list-item><p>After cooling, 50 &#x000b5;L of bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA) plus 1% trimethylchlorosilane (TCS) (Regis Technologies, Inc., Morton Grove, IL) was added to the vial, which was left to stand overnight at room temperature.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Using a fume hood, excess solvent was allowed to evaporate using dry nitrogen (&#x0223c;30 min), and finally 100 &#x000b5;L of a 10% mixture of BSTFA + 1% TCS in dry n-decane was added to the vials.</p></list-item></list><p>Di-deuterated glucose ratios were determined at Oregon Health &#x00026; Science University (OHSU) using a Thermo Scientific DSQ II gas chromatography&#x02013;mass spectrometry system (Ashville, NC) with standards of 1, 2, and 4% di-deuterated glucose formulated for estimation of glucose concentrations.

EGP was baseline corrected for values at the time of glucagon dosing, and area under the curve (AUC) assessment was performed in Microsoft Excel 2010 (Redmond, WA) using the trapezoidal method. Statistical analysis was performed using Stata 12 (College Station, TX), with the sktest function being used to identify normal distributions. Nonnormally distributed and nonparametric data were presented as median with interquartile ranges (IQRs) where necessary.

In contrast, during the high insulin infusion rate study, EGP values remained relatively flat (a nonsignificant rise of 18 to 26 mg/mg as glucagon dose increased). This finding suggests that at insulin serum concentrations of &#x0003e;40 mU/L, glucagon doses of 175 &#x003bc;g or lower are largely ineffective at increasing blood glucose levels.</p><p>Subcutaneous glucagon has become a useful tool in the bihormonal artificial pancreas, but in some cases, subjects in such studies develop hypoglycemia despite the administration of glucagon. Most cases of hypoglycemia experienced during the management of type 1 diabetes result from a high insulin effect. In the closed-loop setting, administration of glucagon when insulin effect is high would require scaling the dose upwards to compensate for prevailing insulin activity. Most glucoregulatory models currently used can predict insulin serum levels with relative certainty, and this information can then be used to appropriately dose glucagon during online running of an artificial pancreas system. Fear of instability in glucose control, with oscillations in glucose levels between hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia due to competition between insulin and glucagon remains a concern within the artificial pancreas community, but more importantly, the inability to prevent hypoglycemia due to prevailing insulin effect if glucagon is underdosed sets an important precedent for quantifying this relationship.</p><p>Glucagon&#x02019;s primary action is upon increasing hepatic glucose output through glycogenolysis and, to a lesser extent, gluconeogenesis (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Therefore, the quantification of glucagon action depends upon estimating this effect in vivo. The determination of EGP by tracer methods has evolved over the half century since first introduced (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Although it remains difficult to accurately estimate EGP in non&#x02013;steady-state conditions (such as after a dose of glucagon), the use of mathematical models for this estimation has proved useful in elucidating the quantitative relationship between insulin, glucagon, and glucose. Cherrington and colleagues (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>) defined the action of intravenously delivered glucagon in the canine model, which is likely translatable to human physiology. Nonetheless, glucagon used in bihormonal systems is delivered via the subcutaneous route. Damiano and colleagues (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>), Haidar et al. (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>), and Castle et al. (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) have published data analyzing the glycemic response of subcutaneously delivered glucagon in bihormonal closed-loop systems, and Lv et al. (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>) from the University of Virginia published an identifiable subcutaneous glucagon absorption model, using data from bihormonal studies by Damiano and colleagues. However, after extensive literature searching, we found no studies in which the effect of subcutaneous glucagon in humans was stratified according to steady-state insulin levels. Therefore, we believe this study, with a stable tracer analysis of glucose output, provides a novel contribution to this field and will be helpful in the modeling of glucagon action in silico. With respect to open-loop therapy, the idea that high IOB can reduce the effect of glucagon on elevating blood glucose would, in theory, be critical in situations of minidosing of glucagon (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). We would expect that rescue glucagon therapy, with the approved dose of 1 mg given parenterally, would be less likely to fail even at high IOB, although such large doses were not given in the current study.</p><p>Limitations of this study include the following: <italic>1</italic>) excessive variability in the estimates of EGP by mathematical modeling of tracer data, likely due to combinations of measurement noise, smoothing effects from the software, and rapid glucose changes during glucagon administration; <italic>2</italic>) the study may therefore have been underpowered, based on the larger than expected SD in the EGP data; <italic>3</italic>) the use of multiple tracers may have advantages over the use of a single tracer, but a single tracer was chosen for simplicity; <italic>4</italic>) the method chosen for determining EGP AUC allowed for negative values and did not take into account a moving baseline prior to calculation, although this method was used in order to ensure standardized estimation across all doses; <italic>5</italic>) dosing subjects by microgram per kilogram of fat-free mass would have removed subject weight from the equation, although multivariate analysis did not identify weight as a significant variable at these doses; <italic>6</italic>) the continued rise in glucose infusion rates during the medium and high insulin infusion rate studies suggests that the first dose was delivered before steady-state insulin levels were achieved; and <italic>7</italic>) the coefficients for the dose-response curve calculated in MATLAB were found to have wide 95% CIs, reducing the strength of the association considerably.</p><p>The principal finding in this study was that moderate doses of subcutaneous glucagon were ineffective in stimulating EGP when insulin levels exceeded 40 mU/L. This finding suggests that when insulin levels are elevated, higher doses of glucagon will be required to prevent hypoglycemia, or alternatively, the use of carbohydrate rescue may be necessary. These results also underscore the importance of taking extra precaution to minimize insulin dosing during algorithm design. Although there are several subcutaneous insulin models in use today, the current study provides novel information on the subcutaneous glucagon effect on glucose dynamics during differing steady-state insulin effects. For this reason, these results may be helpful in developing a glucoregulatory model that includes action of both subcutaneously delivered insulin and glucagon.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Article Information</title><p><bold>Acknowledgments.</bold> The authors thank Dr. Andrea Mari (University of Padova, Padova, Italy) for introduction and guidance into tracer analysis techniques and for the gracious use of his MATLAB software, GLUTRAN.
