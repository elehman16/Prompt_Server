The present study was designed to investigate the effects of intraoperative dexmedetomidine on postoperative analgesia and recovery following abdominal hysterectomy surgeries. Sixty-four patients scheduled for abdominal hysterectomy under general anesthesia were divided into two groups that were maintained using propofol/remifentanil/dexmedetomidine (PRD) or propofol/remifentanil/saline (PRS). During surgery, patients in the PRD group had a lower bispectral index (BIS) value, which indicated a deeper anesthetic state, and a higher sedation score immediately after extubation than patients in the PRS group. During the first 24 hours post-surgery, PRD patients consumed less morphine with patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) and had lower scores on a visual analogue scale (VAS) than their controls from the PRS group. The global 40-item quality of recovery questionnaire and 9-question fatigue severity score both showed higher recovery scores from day 3 after surgery in the PRD group. with the data are considered together, intraoperative administration of dexmedetomidine appeared to promote the analgesic properties of morphine-based PCA and to expedite recovery following surgery in patients undergoing abdominal hysterectomy.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Postoperative pain and fatigue are two of the key causes of prolonged convalescence following abdominal surgery<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Opioid based PCA (patient-controlled analgesia) is well established and has been widely used for postoperative analgesia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Currently, the main challenge with PCA is to reduce opioid consumption and the related side effects such as nausea, vomiting, itching, etc. Because surgery-induced fatigue is less understood than post-surgical pain, more investigations are necessary to determine its underlying mechanisms to develop novel drugs or to find effective therapeutics using currently available drugs.</p><p>Anesthesia management may modulate surgery-induced pain, stress responses and fatigue<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Recent clinical studies have reported that the highly selective alpha-2 adrenergic receptor (&#x003b1;2-AR) agonist dexmedetomidine promoted an analgesic effect, and prolonged the analgesic time of local anesthetics for up to 24&#x02009;hours after dental and osteopathic surgeries<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Most of these studies investigated the synergic action of intraoperative dexmedetomidine with local anesthetics on surgery-induced acute pain during or following surgeries<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. However, more evidence is needed to support its potential analgesia-promoting effect in PCA following general-anesthetized surgeries. Few studies have indicated that DEX has an active influence on recovery<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>, even at a single dose<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. The evidence noted above suggested that patients with surgery-induced pain and fatigue might benefit from perioperative DEX administration. However, side effects including hypotension and bradycardia have limited its clinical application under conditions without professional monitorings. Therefore, in the present study, we hypothesized that intraoperative DEX would improve the analgesic effect of morphine-based PCA and would promote the recovery following surgery in patients undergoing abdominal hysterectomy.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Demographic data and surgery/anesthesia-related information</title><p>Patients from both groups had comparable demographic and surgery/anesthesia-related variables, including age, weight, BMI, ASA class, operation time, anesthesia time, and PACU stay time (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). The PRS and PRD patients received either propofol, remifentanil, saline or dexmedetomidine for general anesthesia maintenance and the same treatments for induction and PCA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>).</p><p>The two groups were also comparable with respect to their baseline mean blood pressure (MBP) and mean heart rate (HR) before surgery.

Moreover, 24&#x02009;hours after surgery MBP and HR returned to the baseline levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a,b</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Anesthesia depth evaluation</title><p>Anesthesia depth was monitored with BIS.

Patients from the PRS group also had a higher pump press number and more morphine consumption than the PRD group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3cd</xref>, *P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Postoperative recovery and fatigue evaluation</title><p>The global 40-item quality of recovery questionnaire scores showed lower values for the both groups on day 1 after surgery compared with the baseline.

The PRD patients trended towards suffering from less adverse effects, such as nausea, vomiting, than those in the PRS group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>In the present study, we found that intraoperative administration of dexmedetomidine promoted the analgesic property of morphine-based PCA and the speed of recovery following surgery of patients undergoing abdominal hysterectomy.</p><p>It is widely known that approximately 2&#x02013;10% of patients undergoing abdominal hysterectomy experience severe acute postoperative pain, which can lead to chronic pain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Opioids, especially morphine-based patient controlled analgesia are widely used for pain control following abdominal hysterectomy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. To combat the side effects, such as nausea, vomiting, itching, etc., there has been a pursuit for novel drugs or for more information regarding combining the currently-available drugs to reduce the morphine consumption. Alpha 2 receptor agonists, like clonidine (&#x003b1;2R:&#x003b1;1R ratio of 200:1), have been used as pain treatments for decades<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. A recent study reported that &#x003b1;1 receptor activation encountered &#x003b1;2R-related analgesia and suggested that an agonist with higher &#x003b1;2 R selectivity would show a more potent analgesic effect and would be more suitable for pain treatment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. DEX is a &#x003b1;2R agonist developed in the 1990s, and it was first used as a short-term sedative in the intensive care units<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Clinical studies have confirmed its potential as an adjuvant for pain treatment, mostly in acute perioperative settings. This use suggests that DEX might be a new drug for surgery-induced acute pain control<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. In the present study, we combined dexmedetomidine with propofol and remifentanil to maintain the general anaesthesia in patients undergoing abdominal hysterectomy surgery, and we found that intraoperative dexmedetomidine was helpful in relieving both resting and moving postoperative acute pain. Moreover, patients from the PRD group who received intraoperative dexmedetomidine had lower pump-press number, and consumed less morphine than those in the PRS group. The analgesic and opioid-sparing effects of dexmedetomidine have been well described in previous studies both in adults and children<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. Similar to the present data, these studies reported significantly lower VAS scores and morphine consumption and fewer morphine demands. Together with these findings, the present study indicated that intraoperative administration of dexmedetomidine is potentially be used to promote morphine-based PCA following abdominal surgery. Though remifentanil has been reported to induce hyperalgesia following general anesthesia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>, we did not see significant difference in consumption of remifentanil and propofol between the two groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">supplementary Figure 1</xref>). Thus, we believe that the analgesic effect predominantly came from dexmedetomidine, though not completely.</p><p>Dexmedetomidine induces hemodynamic changes, such as hypertension, hypotension, and bradycardia, especially after a loading dose. Thus, in the present study, we administered a continuous infusion without a loading dose. Using this continuous infusion, we did not see significant difference in HR or MBP between the groups. Interestingly, we observed significant lower BIS values in the PRD group during anaesthesia, and higher sedation scores immediately after extubation, which were consistent with previous reports and indicated that intraoperative dexmedetomidine provided more stable anesthesia without changing haemodynamic characteristics, and promoted quality of recovery from surgeries<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>.</p><p>So far, the mechanisms underlying the long-term analgesic effects of dexmedetomidine have remained unknown. Dexmedetomidine was first introduced into clinical use as a short-term sedative because it is a rapidly-metabolized chemical with a short plasmatic half-time of 2 ~2.5&#x02009;hours<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. There are several possible mechanisms underlying the long-term analgesic effect: unlike with the sedation effect, dexmedetomidine uses a different &#x003b1;2AR-dependent downstream mechanism to act as an analgesic. Another reason might be that dexmedetomidine prolongs the analgesic time and analgesic effect of other analgesics. Although an animal study reported that its analgesic properties could be neutralized by the &#x003b1;2AR antagonist<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>, we can&#x02019;t completely exclude the remote possibility that dexmedetomidine also uses &#x003b1;2AR-independent mechanisms to exert its analgesic effects.</p><p>Surgery-induced fatigue was another factor that prolonged convalescence after surgery<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. In the present study, all of the patients reported higher fatigue level after surgery, but on day 3 and day 7 after surgery, patients in the PRD group had significantly lower scores for fatigue than their controls, consistent with the findings of a recent study from New York University Medical Center<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Using a global 40-item questionnaire, the present study found that the Global QoR-40 score was significantly improved in the PRD group on day 3 after surgery. Few other studies have reported that intraoperative infusion of dexmedetomidine had active effects on recovery in patients following different surgeries<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, such as major spinal surgery and nasal surgery. Together with these previous reports, this study indicated that intraoperative dexmedetomidine was helpful in alleviating surgery-induced fatigue in the early postoperative period. Multiple factors are responsible for slow recovery from surgery, including pain, fatigue, and surgery-induced metabolic, endocrine, and immune changes known as &#x02018;stress responses&#x02019;. There is no existing evidence that shows the relationship among these factors. We believe that there is a vicious cycle among these three factors: acute postoperative pain will reduce movement motivation and keep the patient in a relatively &#x0201c;comfortable position&#x0201d; even for hours, which will cause fatigue to increase and impair the ability to respond to stress physically and mentally. Fatigue might be the result of a multi-system disorder induced by response stress, and it can possibly worsen response stress and acute pain after surgery. Further, at the molecular level, the stress response induces multi-system changes, including inflammatory factors, such as the interleukin cytokines<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>, which are widely accepted mediators of the pain process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>). More investigations must be undertaken to verify this hypothesis in the future.</p><p>We found that dexmedetomidine induced sedation and analgesia without increasing the risks of opioid-related side effects, such as respiratory depression, consistent with previous reports. We also observed decreasing trends in postoperative nausea and vomiting. Future large sample studies should be performed to verify the effects on morphine- and surgery-related side effects, such as nausea and vomiting.</p><p>There might be some limitations of this study: (1) There are four commonly used scales to evaluate sedation level: the Ramsay sedation scale (RSS), the Richmond Agitation Sedation scale (RASS), the Sedation Agitation Scale (SAS), and the Adaption to Intensive Care Environment Scale; they are sufficient for sedation evaluation. We used the RSS, a highly BIS-related scale, to test sedation after surgery in this study. Optimally, future studies should validate the findings of this study using one or more other scales, such as the RASS or SAS, the other two highly BIS-related scales<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. (2) We used a VAS for post-operative pain evaluation. The numerical rating scale (NRS) is another well-established and widely-used method for pain evaluation, and it was reported to be more reliable than the VAS in some cases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. Our hospital is located on the demarcation line between North China and South China, and we received patients from different provinces. The heavy accents with which some patients spoke might have been a limitation to the use of the NRS. For example, some patients from South China often pronounce the number &#x0201c;10&#x0201d; (&#x0201c;Shi&#x0201d; in Chinese mandarin) as &#x0201c;Si&#x0201d;(which is the pronunciation of the number &#x0201c;4&#x0201d;). Furthermore, the anaesthesiologists who performed this study also came from different provinces of the country. Thus, to avoid misunderstanding we used the VAS to evaluate post-operative pain. We nevertheless encourage the NRS to be used in future studies if the conditions are applicable, because it is easier to perform, saves more time and more reliable than the VAS.</p><p>Taken together, maintenance with dexmedetomidine (0.4&#x003bc;g/kg/h) provided more stable anesthesia without changing haemodynamic characteristics, and it was useful for promoting morphine-based PCA, alleviating fatigue, and promoting patient recovery following abdominal hysterectomy. The single sex of the patients might be another limitation of this study because the abdominal hysterectomy is a female-only surgery, thus rendering it more difficult to generalize current conclusion to the general population, or at least to male patients. This study indicated that intraoperative administration of dexmedetomidine benefited female patients, at least those experiencing abdominal surgeries.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Subjects</title><p>This study was approved by the Institutional Medical Ethics Committee of Nanjing Medical University, and was conducted in accordance with the approved guidelines.
