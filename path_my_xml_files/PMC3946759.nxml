The pulsed orocutaneous experience has been enhanced to incorporate the frequency-modulated characteristics of a neurotypical NNS burst.<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> This form of stimulation serves to entrain trigeminal mechanosensitive nerves in the lips, tongue, and jaw of the neonate which in turn influence the sCPG and oromotor activity. This approach is consistent with the role of sensory-driven neural activity in circuit formation and the notion that appropriate oral experiences may be critical in the final weeks of gestation in the formation of functional central neural circuits.<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> Use of an orocutaneous entrainment stimulus also has the distinct advantage of being safe and pleasurable for the neonate, and easily administered cribside by the care team in the NICU.</p><p id="P29">In general, somatosensory stimulation strategies have proven beneficial in developing oral feeding skills in premature infants.<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> In a recent study, relatively brief tactile-motion stimulation (15 minutes, twice/day) applied to the face-mouth and body before tube feedings among 75 clinically stable preterm infants beginning at 32.3 weeks of PMA (26&#x02013;32 weeks GA) resulted in the attainment of independent oral feeding approximately 9&#x02013;10 days earlier than those in the control group. <sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> This form of somatosensory stimulation also serves to improve the dynamics of swallow&#x02013;respiration coordination.<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup></p><p id="P30">Factors contributing to the development of CLD include immaturity of lung structure itself, prolonged oxygen and/or higher levels of respiratory support that cause free radicals exposure and damage to the developing lung, inflammatory cytokine cascades that may originate with maternal infection during pregnancy, and potentially genetic factors. As pulmonary function improves, these infants often manifest oromotor dyscoordination, absent or weak non-nutritive suck, poor airway protection, dysphagia, and poor state control.<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> The invasiveness of lengthy intubation and oxygen supplementation procedures associated with prematurity and lung disease cost the baby precious sensory and motor experiences during a critical period of brain development for oromotor pattern generation.<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> Even the presence of a nasogastric (NG) feeding tube has negative effects on sucking and breathing.<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> This translates to longer NICU stays until the infants achieve these life-essential skills. Therefore, it appears that preterm infants with significant lung disease may benefit from oral somatosensory therapy to improve their sucking and feeding skills. Preterm infants with significant lung disease have many reasons to explain their relative delays in sucking and feeding skills, and are therefore excellent candidates for oral somatosensory therapy to improve these skills.</p><p id="P31">The richness of the frequency-modulated orocutaneous experience offered by a PULSED entrainment pacifier nipple presents a new and exciting neurotherapeutic application to promote suck and feeding skills. Exposure to this orosensory experience over the course of 3 gavage feeds per day for up to 10 days in the NICU provides the preterm infant with a neural entrainment experience that facilitates the development and strengthening of central pathways which regulate suck. Recent evidence has shown the same PULSED orocutaneous stimulation, as used in the present study, is highly effective in modulating brain activity as reflected in amplitude-integrated EEG and range-EEG measurements sampled in preterm infants at 32 weeks PMA.<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> One unexpected finding in the present study was the increased LOS for RDS infants who received the PULSED orocutaneous treatment and manifest significant NNS performance increases. One likely reason is the relatively late introduction of the PULSED orosensory treatment (~ 34.5 weeks PMA). On average, RDS infants began extrauterine life a week earlier than their HI counterparts, and undoubtedly gained additional oromotor experience moving them ever closer to discharge from the NICU before our PULSED orocutaneous treatment was initiated. Future work with this population will introduce the PULSED orosensory treatment 10 to 14 days earlier which also is consistent with somatosensory stimulation strategies described in two recent papers.<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup></p><p id="P32">Another key question to be addressed in future studies concerns the dose of orocutaneous stimulation per gavage session and whether this should be adjusted in a progressive manner based on the infant&#x02019;s PMA and suck performance levels. For example, in our sicker preterm infants (i.e., CLD), the administration of the third 3-minute block of pulsed orocutaneous stimulation towards the end of a 20-minute gavage feed was sometimes judged by the study nurse/coordinator to exceed the energy capacity of the infant to support NNS activity. This is an important observation since overstimulation of trigeminal afferents may negatively reinforce ororhythmic pattern formation. Our previous experience with RDS and preterm infants <sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> utilized a single 3-minute orosensory period which was tolerated well by the majority of infants. Thus, it seems reasonable to consider a graduated oral somatosensory therapy schedule for preterm infants, based in part, on their medical diagnosis, motor capacity and experience. In the present study, CLD infants had an average GA<sub>birth</sub> of approximately 27<sup>0/7</sup> weeks, and began orosensory entrainment therapy at approximately 35<sup>5/7</sup> weeks PMA, whereas RDS infants were in the womb 3 weeks longer with an average GA<sub>birth</sub> of 30<sup>4/7</sup> weeks, and began their entrainment therapy a week earlier at approximately 34<sup>5/7</sup> weeks PMA. In a graduated schedule, one could initiate the CLD infant with a single 3-minute orosensory entrainment condition during 3 gavage sessions on days 1 and 2, and then increase to two 3-minute orosensory entrainment conditions on successive days (e.g., days 3&#x02013;10). Preterm infants with somewhat more mature gestational ages at birth (e.g., 30 wks compared with 27 wks) can be initiated at higher levels of orosensory entrainment therapy to promote NNS and ororythmic pattern stabilization.</p><p id="P33">The study results show a significant improvement in NNS in preterm infants with various degrees of illness through the use of the pulsed pacifier controlled by the NTrainer device. RDS and CLD babies increased several NNS performance measures as a result of the PULSED treatment condition. These findings may relate to the gestational age at birth, with the CLD babies being born at a younger average GA<sub>birth</sub>. This may also be a function of the very different NICU cares and therapies required in these babies. Brain development and responses to oral stimulation have different characteristics in these babies. Understanding these characteristics can lead to tailored clinical strategies, using the N Trainer device, according to the baby&#x02019;s clinical condition and history. Algorithms could be developed that could be specific for different disease states. The NTrainer device used in this study is easily used and is very portable. This study shows that the NTrainer device is promising as a potential therapeutic strategy for babies in NICU with various clinical disorders who need to develop oral feeding skills in order to be safely discharged home with adequate oral nutrition.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="S23"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>1</label><media xlink:href="NIHMS535661-supplement-1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d37e621" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>2</label><media xlink:href="NIHMS535661-supplement-2.emf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="emf" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d37e625" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S24"><p>This study was supported by grants NIH R01 DC003311 (SM Barlow), NIH P30 HD02528, and the Sutherland Foundation.
