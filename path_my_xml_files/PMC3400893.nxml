Relative to placebo, LX4211 enhanced urinary glucose excretion by inhibiting SGLT2-mediated renal glucose reabsorption; markedly and significantly improved multiple measures of glycemic control, including fasting plasma glucose, oral glucose tolerance, and HbA<sub>1c</sub>; and significantly lowered serum triglycerides. LX4211 also mediated trends for lower weight, lower blood pressure, and higher glucagon-like peptide-1 levels. In a follow-up single-dose study in 12 patients with T2DM, LX4211 (300 mg) significantly increased glucagon-like peptide-1 and peptide YY levels relative to pretreatment values, probably by delaying SGLT1-mediated intestinal glucose absorption. In both studies, LX4211 was well tolerated without evidence of increased gastrointestinal side effects. These data support further study of LX4211-mediated dual SGLT1/SGLT2 inhibition as a novel mechanism of action in the treatment of T2DM.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>An estimated 24 million people in the United States have diabetes, and the prevalence is projected to increase to 44 million by 2034.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref></sup> In patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), improved glycemic control lowers risk for microvascular complications of renal failure and retinopathy and may also lower risk for macrovascular complications of nonfatal myocardial infarction and coronary heart disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref></sup> Although metformin and other monotherapies improve glycemic control in patients with T2DM, hemoglobin A<sub>1c</sub> (HbA<sub>1c</sub>) levels tend to increase steadily, ultimately requiring additional therapy, which may include insulin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup> Aggressive glycemic control with combination therapy often leads to side effects, most notably weight gain and severe hypoglycemia, which may be associated with increased incidence of cardiovascular (CV) events.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref></sup> These concerns underscore the need to develop new agents that safely and effectively treat hyperglycemia without precipitating hypoglycemia in patients with diabetes.</p><p>It has been known for decades that inhibiting urinary glucose reabsorption improves glucose homeostasis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref></sup> Recently, highly selective inhibitors of sodium-glucose transporter-2 (SGLT2), the transporter primarily responsible for renal glucose reabsorption, have been shown to improve glycemic control in preclinical diabetes models and in patients with T2DM.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref></sup> Inhibiting SGLT2 in the kidney provides many advantages: (i) glucose is cleared from the circulation without the need for insulin, thereby lowering the demands on pancreatic &#x003b2;-cells; (ii) glucose excretion decreases as blood glucose levels decrease, thereby limiting the risk of severe hypoglycemia; (iii) urinary glucose excretion (UGE) may lower blood pressure; and (iv) UGE may lead to weight loss. All these advantages were observed in recent studies of SGLT2 inhibitors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref></sup> Also, the novel mechanism through which SGLT2 inhibitors lower blood glucose should make them compatible with other glucose-lowering therapies, including insulin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref></sup></p><p>SGLT1 is the major intestinal glucose transporter, contributing only 10% to renal glucose reabsorption.

Screening, dosing, and follow-up took place from September to December 2009. The study patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive 150 or 300 mg of LX4211, or placebo, orally as a liquid formulation, once daily for 28 days. The treatment groups appeared balanced in terms of baseline demographics and disease characteristics (<bold><xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></bold>). All patients completed the study in their originally assigned group, except one subject in the placebo group, who discontinued on day 23 because of a family emergency but returned for end-of-study assessments.</p><p>Improvements in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) were significant for each of the two treatment groups on days 7, 14, 21, and 28 as compared with the placebo group (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref></bold>; <bold>Supplementary Table S1</bold> online). The improvement was rapid, with day 7 FPG reduced from baseline value by 30 and 43 mg/dl in the 150- and 300-mg dose groups, respectively, as compared with a 9 mg/dl increase in the placebo group. By day 28, FPG was reduced from baseline by 52 and 68 mg/dl in the 150- and 300-mg dose groups, respectively, as compared with a 12 mg/dl decrease in the placebo group. Mean homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance values were also significantly lower on day 27 in both LX4211 groups as compared with placebo (<bold>Supplementary Table S2</bold> online).</p><p>By day 28, mean HbA<sub>1c</sub> was significantly reduced relative to placebo in each of the two treatment groups (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref></bold>; <bold>Supplementary Table S3</bold> online). The HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels were &#x02264;7.0% in 50% of the patients who received LX4211 but in only 18% of patients in the placebo group (<bold>Supplementary Table S4</bold> online). Fructosamine levels were significantly decreased relative to placebo after 14 days in the 300-mg dose group alone, and after 21 and 28 days in both the 150-mg and 300-mg dose groups (<bold>Supplementary Figure S1a</bold> and <bold>Supplementary Table S2</bold> online).</p><p>Glucose tolerance, as measured by area under the curve (AUC) for glucose concentration from hour 0 to hour 4 of a standard oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), was significantly improved relative to placebo in both LX4211 groups at all time points measured (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref></bold>; <bold>Supplementary Table S5</bold> online). AUC values were lower than those of placebo by 30% on day 2 in both dose groups and by 35 and 36% on day 13 in the 150-mg and 300-mg dose groups, respectively. By day 27, AUC values were 38 and 39% lower in the 150- and 300-mg dose groups, respectively, as compared with the placebo group. To determine whether the lower AUC values reflected decreased glucose excursions in addition to decreased FPG values, we corrected for differences in FPG at hour 0. We found that the glucose excursions above baseline FPG, which were not different between each of the LX4211 dose groups and the placebo group on day &#x02212;2 (pretreatment), were significantly improved in both the 150-mg and 300-mg dose groups relative to placebo values on study days 2, 13, and 27; on day 27, glucose excursions were 46% lower in both the 150-mg and 300-mg dose groups as compared to the placebo group (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref></bold>; <bold>Supplementary Table S6</bold> online). LX4211 treatment also significantly lowered 2-h postprandial glucose (PPG) levels in each treatment group as compared with placebo values on days 1, 7, 21, and 28 (<bold>Supplementary Figure S1b</bold> and <bold>Supplementary Table S2</bold> online).</p><p>The 24-h UGE value was significantly increased in both treatment groups as compared with the placebo group on days 1, 14, and 28, and there was a significant increase in 24-h UGE with increasing LX4211 dose on days 1 and 14 (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref></bold>; <bold>Supplementary Table S7</bold> online). The net UGE increases in the 150- and 300-mg dose groups relative to the placebo group were 44 and 65 g/day, respectively, on day 1, and trended down over the treatment period to 37 and 48 g/day, respectively, on day 28. In the LX4211-treated groups, the amount of glucose excreted in the first 8 h was comparable to the amount of glucose excreted in the period spanning 8&#x02013;24 h (<bold>Supplementary Table S8</bold> online).</p><p>Mean serum triglyceride (TG) levels in both LX4211-treated groups decreased throughout the study and fell to within the normal range (&#x0003c;151 mg/dl) by day 14. Both doses of LX4211 were associated with statistically significant TG reductions as compared with placebo (<bold>Supplementary Figure S2</bold> and <bold>Supplementary Table S9</bold> online). After 28 days of dosing, there were also trends toward greater reductions in weight and blood pressure in the LX4211-treated groups relative to the placebo group, but these did not attain statistical significance (<bold><xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref></bold>).</p><p>The frequency rates of treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) were similar among the three groups (<bold><xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref></bold>). There were no reports of treatment-emergent urinary tract infections, genital infections, episodes of hypoglycemia, or serious AEs, and no CV events or clinically significant electrocardiogram findings were observed.</p><p>On day 1, 24-h urine volume showed a slight but nonsignificant increase in the LX4211-treated groups relative to the placebo group. This was accompanied by modest increases in sodium and chloride excretion relative to placebo, which achieved statistical significance in the group receiving 300 mg (<bold>Supplementary Figure S3</bold> and <bold>Supplementary Table S10</bold> online). By days 14 and 28, all these parameter values in the LX4211 treatment groups were at or below baseline and placebo values. Notably, at no time during the study was urinary calcium excretion increased in the LX4211-treated groups (<bold>Supplementary Figure S3</bold> online). Other clinical laboratory values remained unchanged throughout the study, except blood urea nitrogen and magnesium, which showed slight but significant increases that were within the normal range and rapidly decreased toward placebo levels after treatment ended (<bold><xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref></bold>).</p><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters and mean plasma concentration&#x02013;time profiles are summarized in <bold><xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref></bold>. For each LX4211 dose, plasma concentrations were detected within 15 min, increased with increasing dose, and decreased in a biphasic pattern. The maximum plasma LX4211 concentration (<italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub>) appeared at 0.5&#x02013;2.0 h after dosing, and ranged from 82.5&#x02013;115 ng/ml and 230&#x02013;307 ng/ml in the 150-mg and 300-mg dose groups, respectively. The increases in <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> and AUC for plasma concentration over time curve were slightly more than dose-proportional. The median time to reach <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> (i.e., <italic>t</italic><sub>max</sub>) was similar on days 14 and 28 for the two dose groups (1.00&#x02013;1.50 h), with individual values ranging from 0.48 to 2.02 h. Mean plasma LX4211 concentrations at the end of the dosage interval (<italic>C</italic><sub>min</sub>) were similar on days 7, 14, 21, and 28, and all were higher than values on day 1, in both the 150- and 300-mg dose groups (<bold><xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref></bold>; <bold>Supplementary Table S11</bold> online). <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>0&#x02013;tau</sub> values, as determined on days 1, 14, and 28, were similar on days 14 and 28, and each was higher than values on day 1 in both dose groups. Collectively, these data support the view that steady state was reached by day 14, and possibly even by day 7, based on the <italic>C</italic><sub>min</sub> value. Apparent total clearance of LX4211 from plasma after oral administration (CL/F) and CL/F at steady state (CL/F<sub>ss</sub>) were similar across dose groups. After multiple doses, CL/F<sub>ss</sub> was lower on days 14 and 28 than the value observed after a single dose. CL/F on day 1 and CL/F<sub>ss</sub> on days 14 and 28 were higher than the sum of hepatic blood flow and renal blood flow, suggesting the possibility of unabsorbed LX4211 in the gastrointestinal tract. Mean &#x000b1; SD values for <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> (half-life) were 20.7 &#x000b1; 13.7 and 13.5 &#x000b1; 5.3 h in the 150-mg and 300-mg dose groups, respectively.</p><p>The dual inhibition of SGLT1 and SGLT2 by LX4211 <italic>in vitro</italic> suggested that LX4211 might work not only by increasing UGE but also by triggering intestinal release of GLP-1. We performed a <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis of GLP-1 levels in samples collected on days 1 and 28. On day 1, total GLP-1 levels showed a nonsignificant increase after meals in the LX4211-treated groups; similar results were noted on day 28 (<bold>Supplementary Figure S4</bold> and <bold>Supplementary Table S12</bold> online). This led us to carry out a prospective test to investigate whether LX4211 increased the levels of gastrointestinal peptides. This was performed as part of a single-dose study that compared the effects of liquid and solid oral formulations of LX4211.</p></sec><sec><title>Single-dose study assessing GLP-1 and PYY response to liquid and tablet oral formulations of LX4211</title><p>The study was conducted in 12 LX4211-naive inpatients with T2DM, 44&#x02013;65 years of age. Screening, dosing, and follow-up took place from 7 October 2010 through 31 October 2010. The study had a three-way crossover design (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref></bold>), with patients randomly assigned to one of three treatment-sequence groups; at different times, each patient received 300 mg LX4211 administered as a single dose of two 150-mg tablets, six 50-mg tablets, or a 300-mg liquid formulation (300 ml). The baseline demographics and disease characteristics of these patients are shown in <bold>Supplementary Table S13</bold> online.</p><p>As compared with pretreatment day (day &#x02212;1) values, a single 300-mg dose of any of the LX4211 formulations significantly increased UGE over the next 24 h (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref></bold>, <bold>Supplementary Table S14</bold> online), significantly increased total GLP-1 and total PYY between 0 and 13 h (which encompassed the three scheduled meals) (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c,e</xref></bold>, <bold>Supplementary Table S15</bold> online), and significantly decreased plasma glucose and insulin between 0 and 13 h (<bold>Supplementary Figure S5</bold> and <bold>Supplementary Table S15</bold> online). Both tablet formulations were also associated with an increase in active GLP-1 between 0 and 13 h, whereas glucagon values were not altered (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref></bold>, <bold>Supplementary Table S15 </bold> online). Because the no-treatment control was not concurrently implemented across treatment periods, we tested for evidence of a period effect to ensure that any inference based on comparisons with day &#x02212;1 values was valid. The levels of GLP-1, PYY, and insulin were not associated with a significant period effect, suggesting that results based on within-treatment comparisons with day &#x02212;1 values were informative and that LX4211 might have played a role in the changes. By contrast, a significant period effect was found for glucose (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05), suggesting that the changes relative to day &#x02212;1 may be only partially explained by LX4211 treatment, because they were confounded with time. No significant sequence effect was observed in the analysis for any of these parameters.</p><p>The occurrence of treatment-emergent AEs was reported at similar rates among the three groups (<bold>Supplementary Table S16</bold> online). There were no serious AEs, or withdrawals attributable to AEs during this study. Most of the AEs were mild in intensity. There were no episodes of hypoglycemia and no clinically significant changes in other laboratory values or vital signs.</p><p>The pharmacokinetic parameters derived for plasma LX4211 are summarized in <bold><xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref></bold>. The absorption rate for the LX4211 liquid formulation was approximately threefold faster than for the tablets, with the median <italic>T</italic><sub>max</sub> being 3.00 h for each tablet treatment group and 0.875 h for the liquid treatment group (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref></bold>). Also, the mean <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> was 2- to 2.5-fold lower for the tablet treatments than for the liquid formulation. Although the AUC values associated with each tablet treatment group were similar, both were lower than that of the liquid formulation; this finding suggests that the tablet formulation has lower bioavailability. The mean &#x000b1; SD values for <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> were 13.2 &#x000b1; 2.8, 19.8 &#x000b1; 8.8, and 17.9 &#x000b1; 9.0 h for the 2 &#x000d7; 150-mg tablets, 6 &#x000d7; 50-mg tablets, and liquid formulation, respectively, consistent with once-daily dosing of LX4211.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>LX4211 treatment rapidly improved multiple measures of glycemic control in patients with T2DM. After 28 days, the decreases in FPG from baseline were 39 and 55 mg/dl in the 150- and 300-mg LX4211 dose groups, respectively, after correcting for changes in placebo values. This magnitude of improvement in FPG, and the fact that it was largely achieved by day 7, is entirely consistent with decreases from baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub> values of 0.76 and 0.66 on day 28 in the 300- and 150-mg dose groups, respectively, after correcting for changes in placebo values.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref></sup> In addition, the improvement in glucose tolerance observed with LX4211 treatment suggests that LX4211 might lower HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels not only by decreasing FPG but also by decreasing PPG excursions. The LX4211-mediated decrease in HbA<sub>1c</sub> after 4 weeks in our inpatient study was comparable to decreases in HbA<sub>1c</sub> after 12 weeks of treatment with dapagliflozin, canagliflozin, or empagliflozin in an outpatient setting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>,</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref></sup> This degree of HbA<sub>1c</sub> reduction suggests that LX4211 merits further study in a 12-week outpatient trial.</p><p>LX4211 administered once daily resulted in an immediate, dose-dependent increase in UGE which was spread throughout the day. This increase in daily UGE became less pronounced by the end of the study, probably because of improved glycemic control in LX4211-treated patients. The loss of glucose calories in urine during LX4211 treatment contributed to the additional weight lost by these patients but cannot account for the entire placebo-corrected weight loss. LX4211 treatment was associated with (i) increases in the excretion of sodium and chloride in urine as well as increases in the volume of urine on day 1, returning to baseline levels by day 14, and (ii) a 1- to 2-mg/dl increase in serum blood urea nitrogen on day 28, which reversed after treatment ended. These findings are consistent with a glucose-mediated diuresis in LX4211-treated patients. This early diuretic effect could explain some of the weight loss and also some of the trend toward decreased blood pressure. Dapagliflozin treatment also lowers weight and blood pressure, in association with modest increases in urine volume and serum blood urea nitrogen,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref></sup> suggesting that the osmotic diuresis induced by SGLT2 inhibitors is an on-target mechanism that contributes to lowering of weight and blood pressure.</p><p>Partial inhibition of intestinal SGLT1 by LX4211 may contribute to the improvement in glycemic control. This is consistent with the following: (i) human SGLT1 is potently inhibited <italic>in vitro</italic> by LX4211 (IC<sub>50</sub> = 36 nmol/l); (ii) SGLT inhibitors covalently attached to nonabsorbable polymers remain in the rat gastrointestinal tract after oral delivery, where they inhibit intestinal SGLT1 and improve glycemic control by lowering glucose excursions during OGTTs; and (iii) our pharmacokinetic data that suggest limited absorption of LX4211 from the gastrointestinal tract.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref></sup> Partial inhibition of intestinal SGLT1 may improve glycemic control through a physiologic mechanism similar to the one thought to contribute to improved control after Roux-en-Y bariatric surgery or ingestion of dietary-resistant starch, namely, increased glucose delivery to the distal small intestine and colon. When Roux-en-Y surgery or ingestion of dietary-resistant starch increases glucose delivery to the distal gut, glucose tolerance improves in association with, and possibly mediated by, increased levels of GLP-1.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref></sup> PYY levels also rise, consistent with increased production of both PYY and GLP-1 by intestinal L cells in response to glucose and/or short-chain fatty acid metabolites of glucose.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>,</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref></sup> The release of GLP-1 and PYY from L cells, their normal site of release in the gastrointestinal tract, may enhance their beneficial effect as compared with systemic delivery through parenteral administration or systemic accumulation of GLP-1 induced by dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors. This suggestion is based on the expression of GLP-1 and PYY receptors on afferent vagal nerves that innervate the gastrointestinal tract, as well as on animal studies demonstrating that GLP-1- and PYY-mediated inhibition of food intake, GLP-1&#x02013;mediated increased glucose disposal, and GLP-1&#x02013;mediated delayed gastric emptying all require direct signaling to the brainstem via these vagal circuits for maximal effect.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref></sup> We therefore hypothesize that partial inhibition of intestinal SGLT1 by LX4211 results in delayed glucose uptake, which triggers the release of GLP-1 and PYY by L cells, and that the increased levels of active GLP-1 may contribute to the improved glycemic control noted in LX4211-treated patients.</p><p>Concerns regarding the tolerability of pharmacologic SGLT1 inhibition are based on historical observations of gastrointestinal side effects in individuals receiving oral doses of the nonselective SGLT inhibitor phlorizin and in patients with glucose/galactose malabsorption (OMIM &#x00023;606824) due to lack of functional SGLT1. Also, theoretical safety concerns have been based on SGLT1 expression in the heart.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref></sup> Phlorizin, the earliest SGLT inhibitor tested in humans, induces nausea when taken orally at high doses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref></sup> However, phlorizin is rapidly converted to phloretin in the small intestine.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref></sup> Phloretin inhibits multiple proteins, including the facilitative glucose transporters, and can uncouple mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. However, it does not inhibit SGLT1, suggesting that phlorizin-induced nausea may well result from inhibition of intestinal proteins other than SGLT1.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">51</xref></sup> Patients with glucose/galactose malabsorption cannot absorb glucose in the gastrointestinal tract, and as little as 6 g of glucose taken orally can trigger diarrhea and other gastrointestinal side effects. This inability to absorb glucose also results in flat blood glucose curves during OGTTs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref></sup> We did not observe an increase in the frequency of gastrointestinal side effects in patients treated with LX4211 relative to placebo even after they were challenged with 75 g of glucose during OGTTs. The absence of more frequent gastrointestinal side effects, the presence of decreased but not absent blood glucose excursions during OGTTs, and the elevated GLP-1 and PYY levels noted during LX4211 treatment are consistent with partial inhibition of SGLT1, sufficient to allow glucose to reach the distal small intestine and colon but insufficient to completely prevent glucose absorption. Finally, the risk of CV toxicity seems remote. Patients with glucose&#x02013;galactose malabsorption are not reported to be at increased risk for CV problems despite complete absence of functional SGLT1.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref></sup> Also, keeping in mind that LX4211 inhibits SGLT1 with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 36 nmol/l, systemic LX4211 levels achieved with the tablet forms do not appear high enough to significantly inhibit SGLT1 in the heart, kidney, or other organs.</p><p>LX4211 was safe and well tolerated at the doses and schedule employed. There were no treatment-emergent urinary tract infections, genital infections, CV events, or episodes of hypoglycemia, and laboratory data provided no evidence of renal toxicity. Importantly, gastrointestinal AEs were mild and equally divided among the LX4211 and placebo groups. Serum magnesium rose slightly with LX4211 treatment but remained within the normal range, as was observed with dapagliflozin,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref></sup> and urinary calcium excretion did not increase in LX4211-treated patients.</p><p>The significantly decreased TG levels observed in T2DM patients receiving LX4211 were not observed with dapagliflozin treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref></sup> but have been reported for treatment with GLP-1 analogs; in addition, sitagliptin may also lower TGs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">54</xref></sup> This suggests that TG lowering, if confirmed in future studies, may be related to LX4211-mediated increases in GLP-1. Because T2DM is associated with an increased risk for CV events, it is crucial that new compounds that improve glycemic control in patients with T2DM do not further increase CV risk.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">55</xref></sup> The possibility that LX4211 may lower body weight, blood pressure, and TGs, all of which are associated with decrease in CV risk,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">56</xref></sup> suggests that LX4211 is unlikely to increase, and may indeed decrease, CV risk in the T2DM population.</p><p>These studies demonstrate that a 28-day regimen of once-daily oral LX4211, a dual SGLT1/SGLT2 inhibitor, was safe and well tolerated in T2DM patients. LX4211 significantly improved several measures of glycemic control in these individuals, accompanied by increases in the circulating levels of GLP-1 and PYY, decreases in TG levels, and trends toward lower weight and blood pressure. The major limitations of these initial studies of LX4211 in patients with T2DM were the short study duration, the inpatient setting, and the small number of patients enrolled. Nevertheless, the results clearly indicate the need for further studies of LX4211 in a larger sample size of patients with diabetes so as to evaluate the effects of long-term dual SGLT1 and SGLT2 inhibition on safety, metabolic parameters, and glycemic control.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>These studies were conducted at a single center (ICON Development Solution Phase I Center, San Antonio, TX) and carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

Metformin was washed out before day 1, and LX4211 formulations administered on days 1 and 6 were washed out over the 5 days following each of the doses. The levels of UGE, GLP-1, PYY, and LX4211 measured on the day when the LX4211 formulation was administered to 12 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) were compared with those on day &#x02212;1 (baseline control levels) measured in the same 12 patients. (<bold>b</bold>) UGE. UGE was estimated by measuring the total amount of glucose present in 24-h urine samples collected at baseline (day &#x02212;1) and on the days when each LX4211 formulation was administered; the data shown represent mean changes from baseline values. (<bold>c</bold>&#x02013;<bold>e</bold>) Circulating GLP-1 and PYY. These were measured at the same time points on day &#x02212;1 and on the days when each LX4211 formulation was administered. In <bold>c</bold>&#x02013;<bold>e</bold>, arrows show the time points at which meals were provided, and <italic>P</italic> values are presented at the bottom of each of these panels. (<bold>c</bold>) Total GLP-1. (<bold>d</bold>) Active GLP-1. (<bold>e</bold>) Total PYY. (<bold>f</bold>) Time course of plasma LX4211 levels after oral administration of liquid or tablet LX4211 forms. The color key identifying each group in <bold>b</bold>&#x02013;<bold>f</bold> is at the bottom of the figure. Error bars in <bold>b</bold> represent 1 SD. All data are presented as arithmetic means. AUC, area under the curve; D/C, discontinue; GLP-1, glucagon-like peptide-1; PK, pharmacokinetic analysis; PYY, peptide YY; UGE, urinary glucose excretion.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="clpt201258f2"/></fig><table-wrap id="tbl1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Patient demographics and disease characteristics at baseline in the 28-day study</title></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="clpt201258t1"/></table-wrap><table-wrap id="tbl2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><title>Efficacy and safety parameters in the 28-day study</title></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="clpt201258t2"/></table-wrap><table-wrap id="tbl3"><label>Table 3</label><caption><title>Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) reported by &#x0003e;1 patient in the 28-day study</title></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="clpt201258t3"/></table-wrap><table-wrap id="tbl4"><label>Table 4</label><caption><title>Pharmacokinetic parameters after single and multiple doses of LX4211 in the 28-day study</title></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="clpt201258t4"/></table-wrap><table-wrap id="tbl5"><label>Table 5</label><caption><title>Pharmacokinetic parameters of LX4211 liquid and tablet forms, single-dose study</title></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="clpt201258t5"/></table-wrap></floats-group></article>
