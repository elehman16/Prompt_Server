abilities in stroke patients following overground gait training with or without rhythmic
auditory stimulation. [Subjects and Methods] Forty patients with hemiplegia resulting from
stroke were divided into a rhythmic auditory stimulation gait training group (n=20) and a
gait training group (n=20). The rhythmic auditory simulation gait group and gait training
group both performed gait training. Rhythmic auditory stimulation was added during gait
training in the rhythmic auditory stimulation gait training group. The gait training was
performed in 30 minute sessions, five times a week, for a total four weeks. [Results] Gate
ability significantly improved in both groups, and the rhythmic auditory stimulation gait
training group showed more significant increases in cadence, step length, and Dynamic Gait
Index. [Conclusion] The results of this study showed that gait training with rhythmic
auditory stimulation was more effective at improving gait ability.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Stroke</kwd><kwd>Gait</kwd><kwd>Rhythmic auditory stimulation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Patients with stroke experience a number of physical disorders, including movement,
cognitive, sensory, language, and visual disorders. Among them, movement disorders can limit
muscle control and motion functions or mobility, as well as degrade balance control
abilities. Hemiplegia is accompanied by an increase in postural instability, asymmetrical
weight bearing, impairment of body weight transfer capabilities, and a decrease in postural
stability<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, many patients
with stroke experience problems with daily activities requiring functional movements such as
balance, climbing stairs, gait, and walking<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>For this reason, one of the primary goals of rehabilitation for stroke patients is to
restore mobility through gait training<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Various therapeutic approaches have been suggested for the improvement of gait ability of
patients with stroke, such as neurodevelopmental treatment and sensory stimulation. Numerous
studies of training using rhythmic auditory stimulation (RAS) have been conducted since its
development in 1990 for gait training for patients with neurological damage<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. RAS is a training method that enhances
motor skills by providing rhythmic stimulation to the motor center of the brain. The stride,
gait speed, and symmetry of stroke patients trained with rhythmic auditory stimulation were
found to increase. The effect of gait training with rhythmic auditory stimulation was proved
through previous papers<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The purpose of this study was to compare the gait abilities and motor recovery abilities of
stroke patients following either overground gait training with or without rhythmic auditory
stimulation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects of this study were 40 adult stroke inpatients of J Hospital located in Daegu,

stroke; no cognitive impairment with MMSE scores of 24 or higher; those without visual,

to the purpose of the study. This study was approved by the university&#x02019;s Institutional
Review Board, and all of the subjects understood the purpose of the study and provided
written informed consent prior to their participation in the study, in accordance with the
ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki. The protocol for this study was approved
by the local ethics committee.</p><p>The 20 patients in both groups performed 30 minutes of neurodevelopmental therapy for 30
minutes, five times a week for four weeks. In additional, the RASG patients performed gait
training with a rhythmic auditory stimulation for 30 minutes, five times a week for four
weeks, and the GTG patients performed gait training with a supervisor for 30 minutes, five
times a week for four weeks.</p><p>For assessment of gait ability, a 10-meter walking test (10MWT) and a GAITRite analysis
system were used to determine cadence and step length. The Dynamic Gait Index (DGI) was used
to assess the participants&#x02019; functional gait ability<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. This index consist of eight items: level walking, walking at
different speeds, walking while turning the head horizontally, walking while turning the
head vertically, walking and performing a pivot turn, crossing obstacles, walking around
obstacles, and stair walking. Each item is assessed on a scale of 0 to 3 according to the
presence of assistance and performance level. Total scores closer to 24 points, a perfect
score, indicate higher levels of functional gait ability. The DGI has been shown to have
good inter-rater reliability (ICC=0.96) and validity (r=0.837).</p><p>The experimental results were statistically analyzed using SPSS 12.0 KO (SPSS Inc.,
Chicago, IL, USA). After the general characteristics of the subjects were determined, their
general characteristics were analyzed using descriptive statistics. A paired t-test was used
to assess differences before and after the intervention. An independent t-test was used to
assess differences between the two groups.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Both the RASG and GTG subjects exhibited significant improvements in gait ability after the

about limitations in muscle control and motion functions or mobility, as well as degradation
of balance control abilities. Hemiplegia is accompanied by increase in posture instability,

activities requiring functional movements such as balance, climbing stairs, gait, and

gait training and gait training on gait abilities in stroke patients. To determine gait
abilities, the 10-meter walking test, cadence, step length, and DGI were assessed, and the
test results showed that both the RASG and GTG had significant improvements in gait
abilities. The results also showed that the walking performance of the auditory stimulation
training group after training was significantly better than that of the gait training group,
indicating that the auditory stimulation training had a positive effect on the improvement
of gait performance.</p><p>Rhythmic auditory stimulation is known to stimulate motor neurons in the brainstem and at
the spinal level<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Auditory stimulation
in stroke rehabilitation is provided as a means of increasing the excitability of spinal
motor neurons via the reticulospinal pathway, thus decreasing the amount of time required
for muscular response to a given motor command<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Regarding walking performance, sensory stimulation may be an
effective means of strengthening functional movement when it is rhythmically performed in
coordination with the motor response with an appropriate time relationship<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. According to a study by Roerdink in
stroke patients, a treadmill training group that received rhythmic auditory cueing showed an
improvement in stride length, which is shorter in stroke patients than in individuals
without stroke<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Our results show that
cadence and stride length on the affected side were significantly improved in the RASG and
that there were significant improvements compared with the GTG. A metronome beat assists the
coordination of rhythmic or sequential movements. Regular application of auditory cueing
over a suitable time frame may reinforce the coordinated motor response during walking<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. During walking, sensory stimulation may be an effective means of
strengthening functional movement when it is rhythmically performed in coordination with the
motor response with an appropriate time relationship<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. A similar positive impact of auditory stimulation was documented
for the bilateral arm function of chronic stroke patients<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. The DGI is an index that classifies a subject&#x02019;s level of
functional gait ability. It requires them to perform gait tasks that demand a high level of
balance, including level walking, changing speeds during walking, and crossing obstacles;
scores closer to 24 points, a perfect score, indicate higher levels of gait ability<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this study, the RASG showed an increase
in DGI score of 8.41 points, a more significant increase than that of the GT group, whose
DGI score increased by 4.22 points. This result suggests that participants in the RASG
achieved greater improvement in functional gait ability compared with those in the GTG.</p><p>The results of this study showed that gait training with rhythmic auditory stimulation was
more effective at improving gait ability than overground gait training without rhythmic
auditory stimulation. Therefore, rhythmic auditory stimulation may be useful for
rehabilitation of patients with stroke.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Horstmann</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Koziol</surname><given-names>JA</given-names></name><name><surname>Martinez-Torres</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Sonographic monitoring of mass effect in stroke patients
