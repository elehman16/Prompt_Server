Medication overuse headache (MOH) is a common severe headache. The basis of treatment of MOH is discontinuation of the offending drugs. However, cessation of drug consumption could lead to severe disabling headache. Corticosteroids are the most popular drugs for bridge phase of treatment. However corticosteroids might cause different side effects. Celecoxib is a Cox 2 inhibitor drug with analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties, assumed to be a good alternative for steroids.</p></sec><sec><title>Aims</title><p>We conducted this study to compare celecoxib with prednisolone for bridge stage therapy in MOH.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>103 patients (18-65 years) with at least 15 days of headache per month were enrolled. They assigned into two groups: celecoxib (53 cases) and prednisolone (51 cases). Prednisone was administered as daily doses of 75, 50, 30, 25, and 10 mg in 3 days interval. Celecoxib was administered for 15 days according to the following schedule: 100 mg three times per day (5 days), twice a day (5 days) and once a day (5 days). The severity and duration of headache, as well as side effects were assessed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>No significant differences were observed in the decrement of the severity and duration (p=0.114 and 0.149 respectively) of headache between two groups. Side effects were reported in 42 % and 18.9% of prednisolone and celcoxibe groups respectively (Relative Risk=2.2, p=0.011).</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Celecoxib has similar efficacy and fewer side compared to prednisolone during withdrawal therapy.</p><p>No conflict of interest.</p></sec></body></article>
