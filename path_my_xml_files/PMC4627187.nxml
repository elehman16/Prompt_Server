Yet there are various definitions; some researchers focus on narrow issues such as absence of disease and health-related symptoms, whilst others consider quality of life as an overall assessment of one's whole experience of life. This may explain the controversial views regarding subjectivity or objectivity in the quality of life. Although the correlation of psychopathologic features of schizophrenia and quality of life has already been identified, the degree of functional impairment and defects of quality of life cannot be explained merely through the apparent psychopathologic symptoms.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Although the advent of newer antipsychotic agents held great promise in terms of better efficacy and tolerability, their benefit in improving the quality of life in schizophrenia still remains controversial.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>Although the pathophysiological process of schizophrenia is ambiguous, glutamatergic signaling through N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor has been proposed to play pivotal role in positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Experimental studies show that persistent blockade of NMDA receptor recreates the clinical pathological features of schizophrenia.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] On the other hand, NMDA-modulating agents, including D-serine, D-alanine, D-cycloserine and sarcosine, have been the focus of several trials for treatment of schizophrenia and other major psychiatric conditions.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Memantine, an uncompetitive NMDA blocking agent, has been presented to treat severe residual negative symptoms of schizophrenia in previous case studies.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Several reports suggest the neuroprotective role of memantine in schizophrenia. However, it is not known if this property results in improvement of function and quality of life.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>The aim of the present study is to evaluate the effect of memantine on global function and quality of life in patients with schizophrenia.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This was a randomized controlled trial on inpatient cases of schizophrenia in Noor Hospital, an Educational Hospital affiliated to Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, in downtown Isfahan. The diagnosis was based on clinical interview and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV-TR criteria. A number of 64 patients were selected through sequential sampling among hospitalized patients with schizophrenia [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. Inclusion criteria were age 18&#x02013;65 years, normal intellectual ability, not being pregnant, not breast feeding, not receiving electro convulsive therapy in the current 2 weeks, being diagnosed with schizophrenia for the past 2 years, being treated with atypical antipsychotic in the past 3 months, and initial Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale score &#x0003e;26. Exclusion criteria were sensitivity to memantine, drug or substance abuse and dependence, comorbidity of other psychiatric disorders or neurological conditions. Patients were assessed through the following scales:</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Flowchart of study steps</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ABR-4-211-g001"/></fig><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Global assessment of functioning</title><p>Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) is a global functioning assessment, widely used numeric scale, for evaluation of psychological, social and occupational functioning in psychiatric outpatients and inpatients. It evaluates three domains: Social function, psychological function and personal function. It is rated from 1 to 100, and the score is often presented as a range. The higher the score is, the better the individual functions. GAF has proven to be valid and reliable. It covers the range from mental health to deep psychopathology in generic global measures.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Quality of life scale</title><p>Quality of life scale (QLS) is a scale with 21 items in four categories, including interpersonal relation (8 items), instrumental role (4 items), intra-psychic foundation (7 items) and common objects and activities (2 items). The range of score in interpersonal relations is 0&#x02013;48, in instrumental role 0&#x02013;24, in intra-psychic foundation 0&#x02013;42, and in common objects and activities 0&#x02013;12. It is based on a semi-structured interview designed to assess quality of life in patients with schizophrenia. The score may vary from 0 to 126. Higher scores present better quality. Face and content validity is acceptable; reliability was measured through Cronbach's alpha (84&#x02013;97%).[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Before the onset of trial, families and guardians were informed about the study process, probable side effects, positive and negative aspects of participation; and their questions were answered by the clinicians who conducted the study. Written informed consents were then obtained from family or guardian. Patients were allocated in random blocks according to their sequence. Each block included two patients, one allocated to intervention group and the other allocated to the control. The intervention group was treated with memantine plus previously administered stabled-dose atypical antipsychotic, while the control group received placebo plus atypical antipsychotic. Memantine administration was initiated at 5 mg daily; the dosage was increased at weekly intervals by 5 mg and finally up-titrated to 20 mg daily within 4 weeks. The other group received add-on placebo. Both intervention and control groups were on a stable dosage of atypical antipsychotic regimen in the past 3 months and also during the trial. The previous routine treatment was continued during the study.</p><p>All patients were assessed by means of GAF and QLS initially and every 4 weeks to the end of the 12<sup>th</sup> week. Patients, families or guardians, and the clinicians who evaluated the patients were unaware of the group allocation. Memantine and placebo were packed identically and labeled alphabetically by the pharmaceutical laboratory to ensure double-blinding. Data were analyzed using repeated measure ANOVA in SPSS 17.0. (SPSS Statistics for Windows, Chicago: SPSS Inc). Age, duration of schizophrenia, and number of prior psychiatric admission were compared through <italic>t</italic>-tests, while the differences between other demographic features were measured by means of Chi-square; results were presented as mean (standard deviation).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>A total of 64 patients were included, however, four patients dropped out during the study [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>].

Ghaleiha <italic>et al</italic>. showed that memantine add-on significantly improved short-term outcomes in moderate to severe OCD.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] It has also been discussed that memantine might have antidepressant-like and mood-stabilizing effect. In a study by Lee <italic>et al</italic>. memantine has been effective in ameliorating metabolic profile of patients with bipolar II disorder; therefore, it is discussed that memantine can reduce binge eating episodes and weight.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] It is also studied in children with autism and proven to be effective in reducing irritability and stereotypic behaviour.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] It has also been studied in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), based on the concept of glutamate dysregulation in prefrontal cortex and striatum of untreated ADHD children.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</p><p>Administration of memantine in schizophrenia has also been studied in several trials. Krivoy <italic>et al</italic>. indicated that adjunctive memantine treatment, in schizophrenia can improve the clinical status, particularly negative symptoms, but not cognitive deficits.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Also, in another study by John <italic>et al</italic>., memantine has proven to be clinically effective in improving positive and negative psychopathology and cognitive domains.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] However, Lee <italic>et al</italic>. proposed that adjunctive memantine treatment did not either affect psychopathology or improve cognitive function in chronic schizophrenia;[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] although it was well tolerated and did not exacerbate positive symptoms.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Likewise, Fakhari <italic>et al</italic>. showed that add-on memantinetreatment of refractory schizophrenia was not associated with improvement in negative and positive symptoms in refractory schizophrenia.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Moreover, Lieberman <italic>et al</italic>. found that adjunctive memantine had no efficacy in treatment of schizophrenia with residual psychopathology and was even associated with a higher incidence of adverse effects.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</p><p>The present study showed add-on memantine was significantly effective in improving the global function of patients as well as their quality of life. This could be explained by the fact that negative and cognitive symptoms are the most influencing factors in the disability of patients with schizophrenia.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] If memantine ameliorates the cognitive or functional abilities in schizophrenia, it can subsequently improve patient function and quality of life.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] However,
