Advanced surgical operations are now being done laparoscopically, and more reconstructive procedures are being performed. The skill of laparoscopic suturing is very important for performance of these advanced laparoscopic procedures.</p><p>Laparoscopic suturing skills are probably the most difficult skills to master in the minimally invasive environment because of the limitations of laparoscopic surgery, such as altered depth perception, 2-diminsional vision, counterintuitive movements, dependence on visual-spatial skills, and small working field.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref></sup> Though difficult, laparoscopic suturing skills can be acquired with extensive training, and acquisition of laparoscopic suturing skills is based on the principle of modeling, repetitive practice, and formative feedback.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref></sup></p><p>There is an ongoing debate in the literature whether prior exposure to laparoscopic surgery helps trainees in acquiring laparoscopic suturing skills faster. It has been shown in a few studies that previous laparoscopic experience is not necessary for the acquisition of laparoscopic suturing skills.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref></sup> As a result, many residency programs have included this as an essential skill in their curriculum.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref></sup> Even the Society of American Gastrointestinal Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES) has introduced laparoscopic suturing in their Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS) program.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref></sup></p><p>There are no studies in the literature in which trainees have done a full anastomosis and the acquisition of laparoscopic skills assessed on the basis of the anastomosis. This prospective study was done to assess the acquisition of laparoscopic suturing skills in a short-term training program in performance of laparoscopic gastrojejunostomy on a porcine phantom model and to compare whether prior exposure to laparoscopic surgery helped the trainees in acquiring laparoscopic suturing skills faster in comparison to trainees who had no previous exposure to laparoscopic surgery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This prospective study was conducted as a part of a 3-d intensive training in laparoscopic suturing skills for general surgery residents. Institute Ethics Committee clearance was obtained prior to the start of the study. Forty general surgery residents participating voluntarily who gave informed written consent for participation in the study were divided into 2 groups. General surgery residents who had more than 2 y experience in laparoscopic surgery and who had performed a laparoscopic cholecystectomy (generally residents in their fourth or fifth year of residency) were included in group 1 as laparoscopy-exposed surgeons. General surgery residents who had little or no exposure to laparoscopic surgery were included in group 2 as laparoscopy-na&#x000ef;ve surgeons.</p><sec><title>The Course</title><p>The participants were given 3 d of intensive training in laparoscopic suturing on a Tuebingen Trainer with integrated porcine organs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref></sup> Each course consisted of 6 participants, and participants from both the groups were randomly allotted to a course. The course consisted of a video demonstration on principles of laparoscopic suturing that was followed by 2 h of practicing laparoscopic suturing on a cloth model with the help of instructors.</p><p>The trainees performed 5 laparoscopic gastrojejunostomies on a porcine phantom model in the Tuebingen Trainer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref></sup> The trainees in both the groups were given no verbal or physical help to complete the anastomosis. The performance in the first case was taken as the baseline performance, and performance in the fifth case was taken as the final score. The results of the first and fifth cases were compared.</p></sec><sec><title>Preparation of the Model</title><p>Porcine organs (stomach and 15 cm of jejunum) taken from the slaughter house were integrated into the Tuebingen trainer after being prepared (irrigated, washed, frozen, and thawed). A 2-cm longitudinal anterior gastrostomy and enterotomy were made extracorporeally, and the organ was fixed in the Tuebingen trainer in the anatomical position. The participants were then shown a video of a laparoscopic gastrojejunostomy on the porcine model, and each participant performed 5 laparoscopic gastrojejunostomies on this model. A 30&#x000b0; 10-mm telescope was mounted on a Martin's Arm, and the trainee could adjust the camera according to their requirements. The gastrojejunostomy was performed in a single layer of inverting continuous suture using 2-0 Vicryl on a 30-mm half circle, round body needle and a thread length of 15 cm. The posterior layer was sutured before the anterior layer, starting from the right corner. At the end, the anterior and posterior sutures were tied together at the left corner. The technique of anastomosis, suturing, and knot tying was similar for each candidate and for each case.</p></sec><sec><title>Assessment</title><p>The performance of the candidates was recorded for every case. The operation time for each procedure was noted. The evaluation of the anastomosis was done extracorporeally. The quality of anastomosis was evaluated by assessing anastomotic leak, size of the anastomosis, suture placement, and mucosal approximation. The anastomotic leak was assessed by occluding both limbs of the jejunum and 1 end of the stomach with clamps <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>a)</bold>. The stomach was then filled with water from the open end, and any leak was scored as explained in the <bold><xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref></bold>. The jejunum was split open along its mesenteric border to visualize the inside of the anastomosis for the evaluation of the size of the anastomosis, suture placement, and mucosal approximation, and these were assessed as shown in the <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>b). The score for anastomotic leak, size of the anastomosis, suture placement, and mucosal approximation were added to achieve the overall anastomotic score for each participant. The level of difficulty of the procedure was graded by each participant at the end of the procedure on a Likert scale from 1 to 4. The performance was assessed from case 1 to case 5, and the acquisition of laparoscopic suturing skills was compared between the 2 groups on various parameters as previously described.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>a.</bold> Extracorporeal assessment of anastomotic leak by filling the jejunum and stomach with water. <bold>b.</bold> Extracorporeal assessment of size of anastomosis, suture placement and mucosal approximation.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jls0041229360001"/></fig><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Assessment Criteria for Performance</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody valign="top"><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>1.

They vary from assessment of single intracorporeal knotting to 100 consecutive knots.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref></sup> No previous study has assessed the laparoscopic suturing skills of surgical trainees in the performance of bowel anastomosis on a porcine model in an almost real scenario. This is possibly the first study where laparoscopic suturing skills acquisition has been assessed by operation time, anastomotic leak, and size of the anastomosis, suture placement, mucosal approximation, and difficulty level.</p><p>Operation time is a significant parameter to assess the laparoscopic skills of a surgeon. It has been used as an objective measure of the acquisition of laparoscopic skills by many studies such as those done by Rosser et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref></sup> Vossen et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref></sup> Chung et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref></sup> Risucci et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref></sup> and Dubrowski et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref></sup> These studies reveal that as the surgeon becomes more skillful, operation time decreases and reaches a minimum level that is similar to that of the experts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref></sup> In the present study, training resulted in significant improvement in mean operation time for all the participants. It was the first and the most significant parameter to improve after training. The difference in the operation time between the laparoscopy-exposed and laparoscopy-na&#x000ef;ve surgeons also decreased significantly after the training course, signifying that training definitely shortens the learning curve for laparoscopic suturing skills for both the laparoscopy-exposed and laparoscopy-na&#x000ef;ve surgeons and that the laparoscopy-na&#x000ef;ve surgeons manage to catch up with the laparoscopy-exposed surgeons after training.</p><p>However, the trainees in our program could not reach the level of experts possibly because laparoscopic suturing is a very difficult task to master, and although they showed significant improvement in operative time, they still need more practice to reach the level of experts. The trainees showed a significant improvement in the overall anastomotic score from the baseline to the postcourse evaluation, which signifies that training helped them in acquiring the skills of laparoscopic suturing. The laparoscopy-na&#x000ef;ve surgeons also had a significant improvement in the anastomotic score.</p><p>Similar improvement in laparoscopic suturing skills with training was also observed by Kanumuri et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref></sup> who found that third-year medical students improved task completion rate and time with training. Botden et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref></sup> observed statistically significant improvement in 18 novice medical students from the second knot to the top of the performance. Vossen et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref></sup> observed 100 consecutive intracorporeal suturings after a training and found that the quality of the knots increased when the first 10 were compared to the last 10 knots.</p><p>Few studies have shown that experience in laparoscopic procedures is not a prerequisite for trainees to learn laparoscopic suturing techniques and that novice surgeons can acquire complex skills of laparoscopic suturing in a shorter and similar time as compared to the trained surgeons. Aggarwal et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref></sup> who compared the performance of 9 senior operative residents (PGY 4 and 5; course A) with 14 junior operative resident (PGY 2 and 3) at an identical 2-d laparoscopic suturing course, had similar observations. In a study done by Stefanidis et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref></sup> novices demonstrated a 22-fold increase in performance after uniformly achieving proficiency in a reasonable (5.6 h) amount of time. Risucci et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref></sup> found significant and similar improvement in both the resident and attending surgeons from suturing trials 1 to 3 and trials 8 to 15.</p><p>The observations in our study are similar to the above-mentioned studies. Laparoscopy-na&#x000ef;ve surgeons, despite the limitation of their minimal previous laparoscopic surgery experience and even exposure to open bowel anastomosis, were capable of learning basic laparoscopic skills as effectively and efficiently as the trained surgeons. It was seen that though the laparoscopy-exposed surgeons were faster than the laparoscopy-na&#x000ef;ve surgeons in the beginning of the study, this difference in mean operation time between the 2 groups decreased significantly after training.</p><p>Many studies have shown variable effect of age and experience on acquisition of laparoscopic suturing skills. Rissuci et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref></sup> and Kroeze et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref></sup> demonstrated a positive relationship between laparoscopic suturing skill and experience. Our study also suggests that as age increases mean operation time decreases and as experience increases the mean operation time decreases and the mucosal approximation improves. Thus, with age, experience increases and both lead to better acquisition of laparoscopic suturing skills. However, Vossen et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref></sup> and Aggarwal et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref></sup> had observed that performance was not related to experience or age, respectively. The application and transfer of these skills in the operating theater directly on patients has not been studied and the sustainability and transfer of the skills acquired was not assessed due to logistical problems of retesting the individuals.</p><p>Though the relation of experience to acquisition of laparoscopic suturing skills is controversial, there may be some benefit to having previous experience in laparoscopic or open surgical procedures. One explanation is that laparoscopy-na&#x000ef;ve surgeons had to first overcome the basic skills of laparoscopy, such as bimanual dexterity, depth perception, absence of haptic feedback, and other such things, accounting for their initially prolonged operative time. However, once they overcame this, they made significant improvement in the operative time and also the overall anastomotic score. Laparoscopy-exposed surgeons were able to achieve significant improvements in anastomotic leak rate and size of the anastomosis apart from the mean operation time. The overall anastomotic score was greater than that of the laparoscopy-na&#x000ef;ve surgeons; however, the difference was not statistically significant. Our observations suggest that this group of participants acquired knowledge of the methods for laparoscopic suturing and were able to apply this knowledge without difficulty. Further, their experience in performing a secure anastomosis in open surgical procedures may have benefitted them. On the other hand, laparoscopy-na&#x000ef;ve surgeons had to acquire knowledge of basic laparoscopic skills, laparoscopic suturing, bowel anastomosis, and dexterity during the 3-d course and hence could not achieve further improvement in mean operative time and other parameters. Since laparoscopic suturing is a complex skill involving several tasks, the mental workload threshold of participants, along with the short duration of training, probably prevented the laparoscopy-exposed surgeons from improving on their performance. Hence, it can be deduced from our study that training leads to improvement in skills in all the residents irrespective of their previous exposure to laparoscopic surgery. Laparoscopy-na&#x000ef;ve surgeons can acquire skills comparable to that of the trained surgeons.</p><p>The findings of this study need to be tested on a larger scale with a greater number of trainees, and if the findings are proven and the skills are identical between the 2 groups, then it can have important implications in the training requirements of laparoscopy-na&#x000ef;ve residents whereby it may become mandatory for laparoscopy-na&#x000ef;ve as well as practicing surgeons to undergo training before they are exposed to the operating theater environment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>It may be inferred from our study that training improves the laparoscopic suturing skills of laparoscopy-exposed as well as laparoscopy-na&#x000ef;ve surgeons and definitely helps in decreasing the learning curve. Prior experience in laparoscopic surgery does not seem to influence the acquisition of laparoscopic suturing skills, as laparoscopy-na&#x000ef;ve surgeons catch up with the skills of the laparoscopy-exposed surgeons.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The laparoscopic equipment in the Minimally Invasive Surgery Training Centre, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India was donated by Richard Wolf, Knittlingem, Germany as one time educational grant, and technical support for establishing this training centre was provided by Prof GF Buess and Mrs Lilo Mailander, Section for Minimally Invasive Surgery, Eberhard-Karls University Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Germany.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References:</title><ref id="B1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
