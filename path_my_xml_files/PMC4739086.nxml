Researchers have identified that preschoolers tend to be more active outdoors than indoors, with higher activity levels occurring during the first 10&#x000a0;minutes of outdoor playtime. Additionally, interventions incorporating either staff training or the inclusion of play equipment have been effective at increasing children&#x02019;s activity in this setting. As such, the overarching objective of the <italic>Supporting Physical Activity in the Childcare Environment</italic> (SPACE) intervention is to improve the physical activity levels of preschoolers during childcare hours, utilizing a combination of the above components<italic>.</italic> The purpose of this manuscript is to provide a detailed account of the protocol, innovative methods, and evaluation plans used in the implementation of the SPACE study; in an effort to support the development of further research in this field.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p id="Par2">The SPACE study, a cluster randomized controlled trial, involves 22 childcare centres randomly allocated to either the experimental (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;11) or the control (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;11) group. Childcare centres receiving the intervention will adopt an 8-week physical activity intervention with the following components: 1. shorter, more frequent bouts of outdoor playtime (4&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;30&#x000a0;min periods rather than 2&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;60&#x000a0;min periods); 2. new portable play equipment (e.g., obstacle course, balls); and, 3. staff training (1 &#x000d7; 4&#x000a0;hr workshop). Actical accelerometers will be used to assess total physical activity with measurements taken at baseline (i.e., week 0), immediately post-intervention (i.e., week 8), and at 6- and 12-month follow-up. As secondary objectives, we aim to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention on preschoolers&#x02019;: a) sedentary time; b) standardized body mass index scores (percentiles); c) health-related quality of life; and childcare providers&#x02019; physical activity-related knowledge and self-efficacy to implement physical activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">The SPACE study aims to increase the low levels of physical activity observed within childcare centres.

In a systematic review of the literature, Tucker found that only 54&#x000a0;% of preschoolers from 7 countries engaged in at least 60&#x000a0;minutes of daily activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Studies have also shown that physical activity levels tend to decrease with age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], with a 50&#x000a0;% reduction between the ages of 3 and 4&#x000a0;years, and statistically significantly lower again by age 5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. This is disconcerting as Canada&#x02019;s Physical Activity Guidelines for the Early Years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] recommend that preschoolers should engage in 180&#x000a0;minutes of daily activity (at any intensity). Thus, early intervention is crucial given that physical activity plays a pivotal role in children&#x02019;s overall health and is associated with many positive health outcomes, including improved weight status, cardiovascular health, psychosocial and cognitive development, and bone health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Sedentary behaviour, also noted to be prevalent among the preschool population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], has been identified as detrimental to preschoolers&#x02019; health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par15">A growing body of literature, both Canadian and international, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] has been undertaken exploring physical activity levels among preschoolers in childcare centres, and many researchers have reported that their activity levels are dismally low. Specific to this environment, Temple and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and Vanderloo et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] found that preschoolers were well below the guidelines averaging 148 and 133&#x000a0;minutes of physical activity, respectively. When exploring moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) specifically, researchers have provided evidence to suggest that preschoolers engaged in only 1.54 and 1.76&#x000a0;min/day while in care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In combination with these low levels of physical activity participation, preschoolers&#x02019; have been noted to partake in upwards of 42&#x000a0;min/hr of sedentary time within the childcare setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. These trends are alarming, particularly because while opportunity exists outside of childcare for kids to be active, parents have acknowledge they rely on childcare facilities to ensure their kids are moving [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par16">Over 80&#x000a0;% of Canadian preschoolers attend some form of childcare or early childhood education program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Given that children learn many lessons while in out-of-home care, including those related to nutrition, screen-viewing, and physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], researchers have purported that policies and programming in early learning environments may serve as ideal avenues for increasing physical activity and enhancing the overall health of this population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In fact, researchers have found that the childcare centre accounts for approximately 50 % of the variation in preschoolers&#x02019; physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Furthermore, a recent Canadian study found a positive correlation between the number of hours preschoolers spend in childcare and the prevalence of obesity, and that those enrolled in centre-based childcare had higher rates of obesity than those cared for by a parent or relative [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In light of these findings, combined with the disturbingly low rates of physical activity accumulated in Canadian childcare centres [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], evidence-based efforts to combat these trends are essential.</p><p id="Par17">Recently, a meta-analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and two systematic reviews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] were undertaken to explore characteristics and efficacy of interventions aimed at preschoolers. Gordon and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] explored the effectiveness of physical activity interventions (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;15) and found that programs offered in the childcare facility, led by teachers (rather than parents), and which incorporated unstructured playtime and offered outdoor activity, were most effective. These authors reported that physical activity interventions had a small-to-moderate effect on overall physical activity (Hedges <italic>g</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.44; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.05) and a moderate effect on MVPA (Hedges <italic>g</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.51; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.05). When examining interventions in the childcare setting only, Ward and colleagues (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;9) concluded that the majority of interventions were effective at increasing activity levels of participating preschoolers, and they identified organized physical activity sessions integrated into the curriculum, appropriate physical activity staff training, and portable equipment, as important characteristics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Finally, Hinkley et al. completed a review to explore the correlates of physical activity participation among preschoolers and reported that &#x0201c;boys were more active than girls&#x02026;and that children who spent more time outdoors were more active than children who spent less time outdoors&#x0201d; (p.435) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Based on this evidence, it is clear that providing portable play equipment (e.g., balls, tricycles, hula hoops), staff training, and access to outdoor playtime is important for facilitating physical activity participation among preschool-aged children. Based on these above studies, and other Canadian research efforts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], it is clear that outdoor playtime is instrumental for improving preschoolers&#x02019; physical activity in childcare. Previous work has reported that young children are most active during their first 10&#x000a0;minutes outdoors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]; consequently, it is possible that the more opportunities for outdoor play preschoolers are provided in childcare, the more minutes of physical activity they are likely to accumulate.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Study rationale</title><p id="Par18">A consolidated understanding of the effective characteristics of physical activity interventions targeting the preschool population is now available, and this information, combined with recent evidence which highlights the importance of outdoor playtime for preschoolers, serves as a call for effective action. While researchers are striving to improve the activity levels of preschoolers in childcare at an international level, we are only aware of one other childcare physical activity intervention undertaken in Canada [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], which adopted a staff training focus.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study objectives</title><p id="Par19">The primary objective of the SPACE study is to implement and evaluate the effectiveness of an evidence-based intervention at increasing total physical activity (TPA) among preschoolers enrolled in centre-based childcare. As secondary objectives, we aim to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention with regard to: a) decreasing sedentary time; b) decreasing preschoolers&#x02019; body mass index scores (percentiles); c) increasing preschoolers&#x02019; health-related quality of life; d) increasing childcare providers&#x02019; physical activity-related knowledge; e) increasing childcare providers&#x02019; self-efficacy to implement physical activity programming with the children in their care; and f) examining whether sex or child temperament influences preschoolers&#x02019; physical activity levels and sedentary time.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Hypotheses</title><p id="Par20">We hypothesize that preschoolers in the experimental group (i.e., receiving the intervention) would display increased rates of TPA (min/hr) from baseline to post-intervention, while no change would be observed for preschoolers in the control condition. While levels of TPA are expected to decrease at 6- and 12-month follow-up, we believe that activity levels at these time points will still be higher than those recorded at baseline for the experimental group. We also anticipate decreased sedentary time and improvements in health-related quality of life post-intervention among preschoolers in the intervention group compared with the control group. Given the natural growth that occurs among children within this age range, some change in BMI is expected among children in both groups, although we would not anticipate any change in standardized BMI scores (i.e., percentiles) for children in the control group. For childcare providers from the experimental group, we expect an increase in physical activity-related knowledge and self-efficacy for implementing physical activity programming with preschoolers in their care. Furthermore, we anticipate that male preschoolers will accrue higher levels of TPA (and lower sedentary time) in comparison to their female counterparts. Although minimal evidence on the impact of child temperament on physical activity levels exists, we expect that child temperament may be a contributing factor to preschoolers&#x02019; physical activity levels.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec6"><title>Trial design</title><p id="Par21">Following the PRECEDE-PROCEED model for health promotion program planning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], and in line with the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], a cluster randomized controlled trial, involving the implementation and evaluation (i.e., process, impact, and outcome evaluation) of the multi-faceted SPACE study will be undertaken. Due to the nature of the intervention, a double-blind study design is not possible, but to maintain the rigor of the study, a single-blinded design will be adopted (all assessments will be conducted by research staff who remain unaware of group assignment). This study received ethical approval&#x000a0;from the University of Western Ontario's Research Ethics Board (REB# 105779) and has been assigned an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN70604107).</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Sample size</title><p id="Par22">A recent meta-analysis exploring the effectiveness of 15 physical activity interventions targeting preschoolers by Gordon et al.

According to Cohen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], a two-group design would thus require 83 participants per group assuming a small-to-moderate effect, a power level of .80, and an alpha of .05.

First, <italic>environmental modifications</italic> will entail the addition of portable play equipment (for use indoors and outdoors) that has been shown to predict physical activity levels among preschoolers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. The package will include items such as: balls, hula hoop activity pack, obstacle course, stepping domes, ribbons, a hopscotch play mat, and hop-along bouncers. The equipment will be delivered directly to each centre at the start of the 8-week intervention period. Staff will be asked to rotate the equipment available (e.g., offering different pieces each day) and to ensure it is used for the duration of the intervention. Childcare centres will keep all physical activity equipment at the conclusion of the intervention period. Second, <italic>physical activity-related staff training</italic> will involve one 4-hour session with childcare providers and directors. The principal investigator, the project coordinator, and a consultant who is experienced in delivering physical activity education for childcare personnel will lead the staff training. In this session, childcare staff will be provided with information regarding: (a) the Canadian physical activity and sedentary behaviour guidelines for preschoolers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]; (b) the need for shorter, more frequent bouts of outdoor activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]; (c) how to incorporate physical activity into the childcare centres&#x02019; indoor curriculum; and, (d) overcoming physical activity barriers, like poor weather and limited resources<italic>.</italic> Third, <italic>curriculum modifications</italic> will target both indoor and outdoor play periods provided to participating preschoolers. Specifically, preschoolers in the experimental condition will receive four 30-minute outdoor play periods per day rather than two 60-minute outdoor play periods per day (which is the current practice in Ontario). This re-structured outdoor time is designed as free play, in which the preschoolers could interact with the new portable play equipment.

Among the preschool population in particular, these small motion sensor devices have been shown to provide reliable and valid estimates of physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]; they provide detailed and accurate information on the duration, frequency, intensity of activity (i.e., light, moderate, vigorous) as well as the dates/times at which these activities occur. Consistent with the preschool literature, and in an effort to ensure an accurate depiction of this group&#x02019;s activity behaviours, an epoch length of 15&#x000a0;seconds will be applied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Participating preschoolers will be asked to wear the accelerometers during childcare hours only for five consecutive days (i.e., Monday to Friday, or when in care) prior to the introduction of the intervention (i.e., baseline), for one week at the completion of the intervention period (i.e., week 8), and for one week at the 6- and 12-month follow-up periods. Accelerometers will be secured to the participants&#x02019; right hip (i.e., above the iliac crest) using an adjustable elastic belt and will be programmed to begin collecting activity data on the morning (i.e., 7&#x000a0;am) of the first day of data collection (i.e., Monday). At each of these data collection periods, childcare staff will be asked to keep a log of the times the devices are placed on the children and removed each day.

In the interest of creating an evidence-informed physical activity intervention, the SPACE study was developed following the PRECEDE-PROCEED model for health promotion program planning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Our research team undertook a needs assessment with childcare staff [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>] to understand the challenges of implementing physical activity in their facilities, followed by a meta-analysis to examine the literature and understand the characteristics of interventions that have been previously successful with this population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Based on these two sources of information, the SPACE intervention was developed with the primary aim of increasing physical activity among preschoolers enrolled in centre-based childcare. While other interventions have been implemented with this cohort elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], this is the first study, to our knowledge, to tackle shorter, more frequent bouts of <italic>outdoor</italic> playtime, combined with environmental modifications and staff training.

Given the young ages of preschoolers, as well as their dependence on the adults in their lives, childcare staff are in a key position to encourage physical activity among this group. Interventions such as these are important given that childcare staff [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>], as well as early childhood education students [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>], have acknowledged their desire for additional physical activity training. Modifying the frequency of outdoor playtime in childcare facilities represents a relatively easy, cost-effective, and therefore sustainable, change for childcare centres. Given the link between outdoor playtime and increased physical activity noted among the preschool population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], this approach was reasonable and evidence-informed. By establishing healthy active behaviours during the early years, preschoolers may be more likely to continue these behaviours long-term.</p><p id="Par48">Although we anticipate that the SPACE study will be effective at increasing TPA levels among preschoolers, it is also important that we gather information about the appropriateness of this intervention from front-line staff members.
