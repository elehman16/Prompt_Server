[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Nutritional therapy in critically ill-patients improves wound healing, reduces rates of certain complications and mortality seems to reduce. [<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Enteral nutrition is recommended as the first option for most patients in light of the evidence of significant benefits while parenteral nutrition does not seem to add benefit to most critically ill-patients. [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>However, gastric intolerance is common, associated with the opioid or vasopressor use and shock, it reduces the energy delivery and can increase the incidence of nosocomial pneumonia. [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] The slow gastric emptying may contribute to an increase in gastric residual volume predisposing to bacterial colonization and the occurrence of aspiration pneumonia in critically ill-patients. The nutrition by a postpyloric tube can overcome the difficulty of gastric emptying, and as the jejunum has a higher absorptive capacity and is less susceptible to decreased motility, it could be advantageous. [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>However, studies and meta-analyzes comparing nasojejunal and nasogastric nutrition show inconsistent results regarding the delivery of nutrition or of pneumonia even when patients at risk for reduced gastric motility are included. [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] A meta-analysis published in 2013 evaluated 15 randomized trials until 2011 and concluded that the incidence of pneumonia is increased. [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Davies <italic>et al</italic>., in the largest randomized trial comparing the use of nasogastric and nasojejunal tube, did not observe any significant differences in outcome. [<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Our hypothesis is that the use of a jejunal tube does not reduce the incidence of nosocomial pneumonia. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the incidence of pneumonia throughout the stay in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) comparing gastric with jejunal nutrition. Secondarily, we evaluated the mortality rate in the ICU until the 28<sup>th</sup> day and other complications potentially related to enteral feeding.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Methods</title><p>Our study was a pragmatic, open, randomized, controlled trial. All patients admitted to a University ICU for a period of 12 months were eligible for the study. Data collection was performed after approval by the Research Ethics Committee which waived the informed consent considering that there is no consensus on the use of jejunal or gastric tube and the choice is a personal preference of the attending physician.</p><p>The following variables were obtained at baseline: Age, sex, primary diagnosis, Glasgow coma scale and score Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II).

Additionally, patients who had difficulties during insertion of the tube and those admitted with enteral feeding (jejunal or gastric) that the attending physician contraindicated change of tube for the purposes of the study were excluded.</p><p>A third person not involved and blinded to the study conducted the patients&#x02019; randomization (with the aid of opaque envelopes) to gastric or jejunal tubes groups. The positioning of the tube was confirmed radiologically.</p><p>The complications related to the placement of the tubes were recorded by the researchers. Accidental removal was defined when the tube was partially or totally withdrawn by the patient or during routine care.</p><p>These patients were followed daily while in use of a feeding tube and up to the 28<sup>th</sup> day of admission or discharge from the ICU.</p><p>The individual energy needs and the formulation of enteral nutrition were determined by clinical staff (doctors and nutritionists). After patient's clinical stabilization, a 12 French tube was placed for nasogastric feeding and placement was confirmed by auscultating the stomach while insufflating air. Patients assigned to nasojejunal nutrition had a nasojejunal tube inserted and as soon as practicable, tube position was assessed using plain radiograph without contrast. If the tube was not positioned in the jejunum, time was allowed for further spontaneous passage using pro-kinetic drugs (in the discretion of a physician in charge), sometimes with tube repositioning prior to repeating radiograph. The diet was continuously administered by an infusion pump. The patients were maintained in a semi-recumbent position at (between 30&#x000b0; and 45&#x000b0;) unless contraindicated.</p><p>Study outcomes were described as follows: Primary (pneumonia rate) and secondary (mortality rate within 28 days of ICU admission, ICU stay duration, duration of mechanical ventilation (MV), diarrhea, vomiting and constipation). The clinical suspicion of pneumonia required the presence of a new or progressive infiltrate on chest X-ray (no other alternative explanation), and at least two of the following criteria: (a) Temperature &#x0003e;38&#x000b0;C or &#x0003c;36&#x000b0;C, (b) leukocytosis or leukopenia &#x02265;12.000 mm<sup>3</sup> &#x02264;4.000 mm<sup>3</sup>, (c) purulent secretion from the bronchial tree (tracheal aspirates specimens were considered positive in the presence of &#x0003e;10<sup>5</sup> CFU/ml) or a simplified Clinical Pulmonary Infectious Score &#x02265;6 points.

We found that early jejunal nutrition did not reduce the rate of pneumonia. Furthermore, there were no differences in rates of vomiting or GI complications; duration of MV or hospitalization; and mortality rate.</p><p>Our findings showed that jejunal nutrition did not reduce mortality, duration of MV or ICU stay. Our results are consistent with the results of previous studies and systematic reviews.

We evaluated the risk of pneumonia and did not confirm the beneficial effect of jejunal tube on this outcome.</p><p>Several previous studies found no differences in rates of pneumonia when compared jejunal to gastric [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] nutrition. Davies <italic>et al</italic>. studied 180 patients randomized to receive feeding via nasogastric or nasojejunal tube and found no difference in the risk of ventilator associated pneumonia. [<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Our study did not study only mechanically ventilated patients yet &#x0003e;80% of them underwent MV. Other studies suggest that the incidence of pneumonia can be reduced when nutrition is delivered via nasojejunal tube. [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] A recent meta-analysis concluded that the combined studies using postpyloric feeding as the preferred route shows a decrease in the incidence of pneumonia. [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] However, the results of the studies included in this meta-analysis do not make clear whether the rate of aspiration pneumonia, which would be more related to the place of delivery of nutrition, is actually increased and therefore there is no consensus that the postpyloric position is effective in reducing the incidence of pneumonia. In addition, there is a significant discrepancy in the selection of studies. Furthermore, this meta-analysis did not include the study of Davies <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] The differences may be explained in part by the different ventilator-associated pneumonia diagnosis criteria between studies and also by the insufficient number of patients to reach statistical significance.</p><p>Gastric intolerance manifested as an increased gastric residual and risk of vomiting would be the main explanation for an increased risk of aspiration and therefore pneumonia. The occurrence of vomiting was common in both groups, reflecting the decreased gastric motility, but the delivery of nutrition on jejunal position has not decreased vomiting or other GI complications. This result is in agreement with other studies and meta-analysis. [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] The volume of gastric residual in our study was not assessed, which can be considered an important limitation. However, as noted earlier, there was no difference for vomiting and macroaspiration was not observed for either group.</p><p>Some guidelines and researchers suggest that tube feeding in postpyloric position in critical patients would be helpful in specific situations, particularly in patients with pancreatitis and gastric stasis as these patients have higher gastric intolerance. [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Our study did not exclude patients who might develop gastric stasis and still we did not observe differences between the two groups regarding GI complications.</p><p>The subject follows controversial, and the studies conducted so far have not provided a more definitive answer. Perhaps, therefore, the guidelines of the American Society of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition, the Canadian Critical Care Clinical Practice Guidelines Committee suggest that there is no difference between the two types of tube positioning, but recommend the use of postpyloric tube position only in certain patients as in the case of occurrence of severe pancreatitis or elevated gastric residual volume. [<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] While the European Society of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition assumes no difference in the position of the tube. [<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] The routine use of jejunal tube results in higher cost and requires more experience and training for insertion and confirmation by radiological examination or endoscopic positioning.</p><p>The strength of our study lies in the number of patients, comparable to a few studies [<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and with similar results. However, our study has several limitations: Physicians were not blinded to assess the outcomes; nurses with different expertise performed the insertion of tubes. Some specific nutrition data were not collected, such as caloric balance administration or gastric residual volume. It was also not quantified the number of episodes of diarrhea and vomiting, the report was restricted or not to the occurrence of these outcomes. Furthermore, we did not evaluate the use of drugs that reduce or accelerate GI motility. We should be careful in extrapolating the study results to all our ICU patients as only 16% of patients were included during the study period, and more medical patients were studied.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We conclude that there is no difference in the rate of pneumonia when using the gastric or jejunal tube position.
