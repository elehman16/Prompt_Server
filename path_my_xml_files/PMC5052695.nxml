These studies involved intensive interventions organized and delivered by health service personnel, with high levels of engagement from residents. The results are difficult to extrapolate to a UK care home population, where 75% of residents are cognitively impaired<sup><xref rid="bibr7-0269215515604672" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> and National Health Service (NHS) input to care homes is variable in structure and function, and frequently minimal, ad hoc and reactive.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-0269215515604672" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup></p><p>The Guide to Action Care Home falls prevention intervention<sup><xref rid="bibr9-0269215515604672" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> is a multifactorial fall risk factor checklist, with suggested actions to reverse or modify fall risk factors. It was coproduced by care home staff, clinical staff and researchers. When the Guide to Action Care Home is put into practice, falls clinical specialists train small groups (four to eight) of care home staff to use the checklist in one-hour sessions. Once trained, care home staff assess each resident&#x02019;s falls risk, taking 15 to 20&#x02009;minutes to do so. The checklist then prompts specific actions to mitigate risk, the completion of which takes, on average, two hours. The implementation of the Guide to Action Care Home has not been subject to a large-scale robust evaluation to determine if it prevents falls, or is cost effective. To do so would require a cluster randomized controlled trial, because the intervention would need to be implemented at the whole home level to prevent cross contamination. To clarify the design parameters, estimated treatment effects and associated sample size calculations for a phase III definitive randomized controlled trial, a feasibility cluster randomized controlled trial entitled Falls In Care Homes (FICH) was conducted.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="section10-0269215515604672"><title>Methods</title><p>We conducted a two-centre, single-blind, feasibility, cluster randomized controlled trial with a concurrent process evaluation to explore intervention implementation and study design parameters. Ethical approval was provided by the National Research Ethics Service Committee West Midlands, Staffordshire (12/WM/0091).</p><p>As this was a feasibility study, no formal power calculation was performed. The aim was to recruit two centres and three homes in each centre. It was estimated that 60% of the population would meet eligibility criteria and provide consent. With an average of 19 residents per home, we expected a study sample of 68 resident-participants.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-0269215515604672" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> The feasibility of achieving this sample size was explored and sample size calculations for a phase III trial are presented in the discussion section.</p><p>Recruitment took place between September 2012 and February 2013.

Managers who did not respond to letter invitations were telephoned to determine their level of interest and preferred recruitment procedures. Care homes were purposively selected from those who replied expressing interest, to reflect a range of ownership, size and registration.</p><p>Once six care home managers and owners had provided informed consent to study enrolment, care home staff screened residents for eligibility to take part. Eligible high-risk<sup><xref rid="bibr12-0269215515604672" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> residents (aged over 50&#x02009;years, fallen at least once in the past year and not bed-bound, hoist-dependent or terminally ill) were approached by researchers and provided with a patient information leaflet and a consent form. After having adequate time to consider study information and the opportunity to discuss any concerns with a researcher, eligible residents who wished to take part in the study provided consent. Residents with mental capacity provided their own consent. Residents without mental capacity were recruited subject to family member or friend signing a consultee form indicating that the research was not contrary to their best interests.<sup><xref rid="bibr13-0269215515604672" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup></p><p>Care homes were randomized to either Guide to Action Care Home intervention group or control group (50:50 ratio) using a remote, secure, internet-based randomization system maintained and operated by the Nottingham Clinical Trials Unit.

It was delivered according to protocol (one hour) in two homes, but in the third home 17 members of staff attended for only ten&#x02009;minutes training. The care home that received non-protocol compliant training appeared dissatisfied and did not accept the offer of retraining. The acceptability of the training was greater in the two homes that received one hour training. Greater frequency of training and explanation of medical terms was requested to aid understanding by one staff member. Other staff suggested the training had a positive impact on staff and participants, helping them to feel more confident, more fall risk aware and more able to transfer knowledge to other contexts without causing distress.</p><p>

Documentation was however completed for two non-participants in one care home, after an appointment was arranged to qualitatively explore Guide to Action Care Home (GtACH) use. Care staff suggested leadership and senior involvement from managers would help increase compliance with documentation.</p><p>There was minor contamination of treatment in two homes. One had acquired a copy of the Guide to Action for Community Settings, which was designed for use in people&#x02019;s own homes, and one had a Guide to Action Care Home poster on the wall, which publicized the intervention. No control homes received training or the intervention manual.</p><p>The findings indicated that the usual falls prevention provision at the time of the study was a reactive fall assessment and treatment service provided by the NHS in hospital and community settings. However, there was no evidence in intervention or control homes that any participants were referred to these services over the study period. In addition, there was no evidence that care home staff received any falls prevention training in the period of the study. There was, however, evidence of fall risk assessment tools in five of the six homes. Three homes used an assessment designed by the home manager, one used STRATIFY,<sup><xref rid="bibr20-0269215515604672" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> developed for use in hospitals, and one had the Guide to Action Community,<sup><xref rid="bibr21-0269215515604672" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> initially developed for people living at home. Staff reported that they had not received training in these tools. Two of the managers, but none of the 11 staff interviewed, had heard of the Guide to Action Care Home prior to recruitment.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="section15-0269215515604672"><title>Discussion</title><p>The findings of this study provide recommendations for a definitive trial and suggest largely that it will be feasible to complete a definitive trial to evaluate the Guide to Action Care Home intervention. Care home staff can be trained to use the Guide to Action Care Home, and the protocol-compliant intervention was implementable and accepted by care homes, fall rates were reliably ascertained from care home records and care homes, and total recruitment and recruitment rates were proportionally high for the allocated recruitment time. This suggests recruitment targets will be met in a larger study providing similar conditions are in place. Notably, this study indicated that the intervention would need greater explanation of medical terms, more frequent training sessions and further adaptations for people living in learning disability care homes, as they frequently spend much of the day in another context, which was largely identified as external day centre attendance.</p><p>The main limitation was that the small number of homes recruited means that a number of institutional variables that might influence the success of a subsequent randomized controlled trial may have been missed. Care homes are recognized to be highly variable in terms of their organizational structure and this has been identified as a challenge to research.<sup><xref rid="bibr22-0269215515604672" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> However care homes were purposively selected to reflect diverse characteristics to account for any influence that differing care home characteristics may have on the study design and Guide to Action Care Home implementation. Statistical techniques for handling heterogeneity are also well established in the randomized control literature.<sup><xref rid="bibr23-0269215515604672" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="bibr24-0269215515604672" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Once recruited, homes stayed in the research process and, despite care home differences, the study design parameters and intervention were feasible. We recommend that, in a definitive trial, homes should be invited by post and by telephone. This is in line with recommended recruitment procedures<sup><xref rid="bibr25-0269215515604672" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> for recruiting to time and target, and to aid greater generalizability of findings. Care home characteristics, such as gender distribution, average age and average dependency were in line with national data, but staff turnover was low compared with average national Figures.<sup><xref rid="bibr26-0269215515604672" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> We would recommend that homes that appear to have unstable management should not be recruited into a definitive trial, and attentiveness to staff turnover as a possible confounding variable might be required as part of the analysis of data.</p><p>We recruited less than our expected resident participant sample size (76%), however the residents we did recruit had a higher falls rate than in a previous study.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-0269215515604672" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> We recruited residents who had fallen in the past year (as documented in the available care records) and there is evidence that people who fall once are at greater risk of falling again.<sup><xref rid="bibr27-0269215515604672" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> Discussions with care homes regarding data collection intervals revealed that care records were archived every three months and therefore data collection intervals should be tailored accordingly for ease of data collection. Although feasible, it was a more difficult and lengthy process for care homes to identify residents following the inclusion criteria &#x02018;fallen in the past year&#x02019;. Care home staff suggested that residents excluded on the basis of having not already fallen could benefit from the intervention. To overcome the screening problems and because the intervention aims to reduce the falls risk in potential fallers, we recommend that trained care home staff should provide the intervention to all residents and therefore a definitive trial should recruit all residents who are not terminally ill or receiving end-of-life care (death imminent within the next six months). By using these criteria, the fall rate will be lower and we propose that a conservative fall rate of 2.5 falls per person per year, suggested by Whitney,<sup><xref rid="bibr28-0269215515604672" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> be used in the control group of a definitive trial (as opposed to the 3.0 falls per year observed here). Assuming a fall rate of 2.5 falls per year, 80% power, two-sided significance level of 5%, 189 residents per group are required to detect a 33% reduction in falls rate over a three-month period of observation. After adjusting for the clustered design, and assuming an average cluster size of 20 residents, intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.1 and an 16% attrition rate, a sample size of 1308 care home residents (654 intervention group and 654 control group) is required. If, in contrast, we take the falls rate in the intervention group from the feasibility study to estimate a sample size for the comparison of two rates at the 5% significance level (two sided), 80% power, we need 157 participants in each group before clustering is taken into account and 456 participants per group after the adjustment for clustering.<sup><xref rid="bibr29-0269215515604672" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup></p><p>The strength of the recruitment and retention strategies employed in this study is evident in the attrition and missing data rates, which were lower than other published research performed in care home settings.<sup><xref rid="bibr30-0269215515604672" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> Falls were frequent and well recorded in routine care home service records. Coupled with the mandatory requirement from regulators of the UK health and care providers, this suggests care home records are an acceptable means of ascertaining fall events. However, we would recommend that only homes that can show evidence that they record falls in a systematic way before recruitment should be enrolled into a definitive trial. This method has also been used successfully in hospital settings.<sup><xref rid="bibr31-0269215515604672" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> Although it is possible that some falls may have gone unrecorded, it should be noted that the reliability of self-reported diaries (which are usually used in falls prevention studies) in care home residents with a high prevalence of cognitive impairment<sup><xref rid="bibr7-0269215515604672" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> is likely to be worse. It has been suggested that falls should be monitored using electronic devices, but using a subsample of participants from this study, we have previously found that accelerometers were not a feasible way to record falls or activity in this resident cohort.<sup><xref rid="bibr32-0269215515604672" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> There was a general trend towards fewer falls in both intervention and control homes postintervention; this is an expected trend seen in other falls trials. Increased falls vigilance in care staff in both arms of the study is a possible contributor.<sup><xref rid="bibr33-0269215515604672" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> Service use was lower than in a recent cohort care home study<sup><xref rid="bibr7-0269215515604672" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> and as self-completion questionnaires have revealed large quantities of missing data in other feasibility trials,<sup><xref rid="bibr34-0269215515604672" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> we advise that service use data should be collected from NHS data sets. The consequence of the high degree of variability in general practitioner (GP) is unclear. We anticipate that these differences in GP support would be more evenly distributed by randomization in the greater number of homes required for a definitive trial. Any confounding variables (such as GP visit distribution) can be considered in regression analyses and evaluated upon during a process evaluation in a definitive trial. Interestingly however, fewer GP visits were evident at the six-month end-point in intervention homes.</p><p>The Guide to Action Care Home training was not delivered as per protocol in one intervention home. To enhance protocol adherence in a definitive study, we suggest that care home managers are asked to agree at the outset when and to whom the training will be provided, that refresher sessions are scheduled in advance and that protocols for inclusion of Guide to Action Care Home in care home records are agreed. Training of more staff (50&#x02013;80%)<sup><xref rid="bibr35-0269215515604672" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> and increasing communication and coordination through additional refresher training may facilitate and strengthen staff-to-staff interactions to help overcome barriers associated with staff rotation and turnover.<sup><xref rid="bibr36-0269215515604672" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> Fidelity procedures to ensure strict protocol compliance should be applied, including provision of a &#x02018;train the trainer&#x02019; manual, regular supervision and checklist monitoring. This should be evaluated as part of the concurrent process evaluation in the definitive trial. Staff felt confident to use the Guide to Action Care Home; this is especially important in contexts such as care homes whereby staff may be transient and undertrained with high demands placed upon them.<sup><xref rid="bibr37-0269215515604672" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> Interestingly it has been suggested that training can aid staff coping responses.<sup><xref rid="bibr38-0269215515604672" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> The importance of engaging the support of care home managers in implementing the training is in keeping with previous studies considering educational interventions in this setting.<sup><xref rid="bibr39-0269215515604672" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup></p><p>Our findings regarding falls prevention usual care are in keeping with existing literature, which suggest this to be predominantly ad hoc and reactive.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-0269215515604672" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Some of the falls risk assessments in place in control homes had not been validated for the care home setting and did not elicit any actions.<sup><xref rid="bibr40-0269215515604672" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> Although heterogeneous, they were sufficiently different from the coordinated, evidence-based, expert-facilitated and supported intervention represented by Guide to Action Care Home to be a feasible control intervention.</p><p>Occasions of researcher unblinding were infrequent. A definitive randomized controlled trial should incorporate robust limits on contact between &#x02018;blinded&#x02019; and &#x02018;non-blinded&#x02019; participants, and researchers and follow guidelines for blinding.<sup><xref rid="bibr41-0269215515604672" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup></p><p>In conclusion, the Guide to Action Care Home is a feasible and implementable falls prevention intervention and presents a novel tailored approach for both care home staff and care home-dwelling older adults. This study has shown that this intervention can be studied in various care home settings and is ready to be taken forward into a phase III definitive trial.</p><boxed-text id="boxed-text1-0269215515604672" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Clinical messages</title></caption><list list-type="bullet" id="list2-0269215515604672"><list-item><p>Guide to Action Care Home programme can be implemented in old age care homes.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The integrity of protocol procedures and fidelity of controls required is supported.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Care home records are a reliable means of recording falls.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Preliminary signs of intervention impact have been demonstrated.</p></list-item></list></boxed-text></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank all residents and care home staff that were involved in the study.
