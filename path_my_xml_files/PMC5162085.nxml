The intervention group received peer support with weekly home-visits. Both groups received first-line ART regimens according to the National Treatment Guidelines. Viral load (VL) (ExaVir&#x02122; Load) and CD4 counts were analyzed every 6&#x000a0;months. The primary endpoint was virologic failure (VL &#x0003e;1000 copies/ml). Patients were followed up for 24&#x000a0;months. Intention-to-treat analysis was used. Cluster longitudinal and survival analyses were used to study time to virologic failure and CD4 trends.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Of 640 patients, 71% were males, mean age 32&#x000a0;years, 83% started with stavudine/lamivudine/nevirapine regimen. After a mean of 20.8&#x000a0;months, 78% completed the study, and the median CD4 increase was 286 cells/&#x003bc;l. Cumulative virologic failure risk was 7.2%. There was no significant difference between intervention and control groups in risk for and time to virologic failure and in CD4 trends. Risk factors for virologic failure were ART-non-na&#x000ef;ve status [aHR 6.9;(95% CI 3.2&#x02013;14.6); <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01]; baseline VL &#x02265;100,000 copies/ml [aHR 2.3;(95% CI 1.2&#x02013;4.3); <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05] and incomplete adherence (self-reported missing more than one dose during 24&#x000a0;months) [aHR 3.1;(95% CI 1.1&#x02013;8.9); <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05].

To ensure the sustainability of ART programs in resource-limited settings, it is essential to find effective ways to maintain patients on first-line regimens as long as possible as adherence to ART has a major influence on treatment failure and the development of HIV drug resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, the provision of ART in low-resource settings remains challenging due to the shortage of human resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the United States President&#x02019;s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) advocated a strategy to mobilize the involvement of people living with HIV (PLHIV) through task shifting among health workforce team [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. WHO/UNAIDS proposed the &#x0201c;Treatment 2.0&#x0201d; initiative that aimed to reach and sustain universal access to treatment and capitalize on the preventive benefit of ART through five high-priority goals: 1) optimize drug regimens; 2) provide point of care diagnosis; 3) reduce costs; 4) adapt delivery systems and 5) mobilize communities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>In sub-Saharan Africa, peer support and home-based care have become part of the HIV comprehensive care and treatment package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], in which the role of peer support is acknowledged as an essential activity for treatment success [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. A recent randomized controlled trial (RCT) in Uganda showed that community-based peer health worker intervention had an effect on reducing virologic failure risk after 96&#x000a0;weeks of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. A meta-analysis review indicates that peer education programs in developing countries are moderately effective at improving behavioral outcomes but show no significant impact on biological outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. On the other hand, in most Asian countries, where the HIV epidemic is in a concentrated stage targeting the high risk population such as injecting drug users (IDUs) and sex workers, the adherence support may pose different challenges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Hence the impact of peer support in Asian countries on virologic failure has not been proven.</p><p>In Vietnam, the ART programs have been rapidly scaling up with the support from PEPFAR and Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GFATM). By the end of 2010, more than 82,700 people had access to free ART (70% coverage) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. According to the revised National Guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], VL testing is indicated only for assessing patients suspected of failing the first-line treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. A qualitative study conducted among 48 PLHIV about adherence obstacles encountered during ART, methods that patients used to enhance adherence, treatment support structures, and attitudes toward home delivery of ART showed that stigma was identified as a strong barrier to ART adherence and that patients seeked more community-based support, preferably from PLHIV who had received sufficient training. Home delivery of ART medications was seen as undesirable by PLHIV, who feared that it might increase stigma and discrimination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. We have shown that the community-based peer support had an impact on reducing stigma and discrimination, increasing the access to counseling and testing, improving the quality of life, and enhancing adherence to ART among ART patients presenting at clinical stages 3 and 4 at baseline. However, communitybased peer support had no impact on quality of life among ART patients enrolled at clinical stages 1 and 2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. However, the impact of peer support on treatment outcomes, especially on virologic failure, has not yet been assessed.</p><p>We conducted this study with the aim of testing the hypothesis that peer support intervention has an impact on virologic and immunologic responses in HIV-infected patients initiated on first-line ART regimens in a rural resource-limited setting in Quang Ninh, Vietnam. This approach will result in evidence-based ART strategies for large populations in low income and low prevalence settings, which will have an impact on HIV treatment guidelines globally.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec22"><title>Study setting</title><p>Quang Ninh province is located along northeastern Vietnam with a population of 1.1 million and an area of 6100 km<sup>2</sup>. Quang Ninh has 14 cities/districts, in which Ha Long City is the biggest (20 communes, 221,000 habitants). It is also home to the famous World Heritage Site, Ha Long Bay. Coal mining, fisheries, and tourism are the main industries.</p><p>HIV prevalence in Quang Ninh was about 1%, of which 55% of PLHIV were IDUs (reported by Provincial AIDS Committee-2006). Patients were recruited from four outpatient clinics (OPC): Ha Long CDC-LifeGap clinic, located in the provincial hospital in Ha Long City and supported by PEPFAR which has more resources, and three Global Fund supported clinics (Uong Bi, Ha Long Health Center and Yen Hung). These were the only clinics in the districts and hence there was a low risk for selection bias from both patients and the project.</p><p>The cluster randomized controlled trial &#x0201c;Directly Observed Therapy for Antiretrovirals&#x0201d; (DOTARV), registration number NCT01433601 was carried out in 4 districts/cities (Ha Long, Uong Bi, Dong Trieu, Yen Hung). The reasons for choosing these 4 districts/cities were: (i) community based care was not available, (ii) these were adjacent districts, and (iii) each had high HIV prevalence. To minimize contamination (that the effect of peer support to patients in the intervention group would also influence the control groups due to personal relationships among patients in intervention and control group), the unit of randomization and analysis was the cluster (commune).</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participant recruitment and study procedures</title><p>This trial was conducted between July 2007 through November 2011, with 2&#x000a0;years of patient recruitment and 2&#x000a0;years of follow-up.</p><p>According to the National Guidelines (2005) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], HIV-infected individuals were eligible to be registered for free at an ART clinic if they: i) were confirmed HIV positive, ii) possessed valid civil registration information (home address and telephone), iii) had a family member who could act as a supporter, and iv) agreed to enroll and to be followed up in the ART program. Each clinic was staffed with two medical doctors, one adherence counselor, one reception nurse, one phlebotomy nurse, one pharmacist, and one volunteer who was a person living with HIV (PLHIV). The staff were trained on basic and advanced HIV care and treatment and certified by Ministry of Health.</p><p>All registered patients received a set standard of care, co-trimoxazole prophylaxis, and were assessed at baseline for socio-economic situations. They were also evaluated clinically, undergoing WHO HIV clinical staging, as well as screening for tuberculosis (TB), viral hepatitis B and C, and opportunistic infections (OIs). Their CD4 counts were taken, and those who were eligible for ART (clinical stage 4 with CD4 count &#x0003c;200 cells/&#x003bc;l or clinical stage 3 with CD4 count &#x0003c;350 cells/&#x003bc;l) were put on the waiting list for ART and selected on a &#x0201c;first come, first served&#x0201d; basis. Patients diagnosed with OIs were treated by OI medications. If TB was diagnosed, patients were referred to the provincial TB hospital in Ha Long City. They were initiated on ART after receiving two months of intensive TB treatment. Every month, a range of 15 to 20 patients per clinic, from both groups, were selected, based on the &#x0201c;first come, first served&#x0201d; recruitment list, to attend a pre-ART readiness training on both an individual and group basis. Each clinic received a quota of patients that were planned to initiate ART stipulated by the local health authorities. The training included HIV basics, stigma and discrimination, positive living, transmission prevention, ART regimens and treatment adherence. A family member also attended the training and became an adherence supporter for the patient. ARV drugs were provided in pre-packed dosage form for convenience and to promote adherence. The first-line ARV regimens included two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs): stavudine (d4T) or zidovudine (AZT) plus lamivudine (3TC) combined with one non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor NNRTI: nevirapine (NVP) or efavirenz (EFV). All care and medications were provided free of charge.</p><p>Patients who participated in the study were selected from the pre-ART waiting list. All patients fulfilling the criteria and planned for ART were asked for their consent to take part in the trial. The patients were informed about the trial by study doctors. The patients, if they agreed to participate, signed the informed consent form. Study doctors would assign patients to either the intervention group or the control group based on the commune where they were living from one of a total of 71 communes in 4 districts. The ratio for intervention: control communes was 36:35 (1:1). The clusters in all four districts were randomized by a statistician who was not involved in the study and were matched according to the following criteria (i) urban vs. rural (official registration, based on population density), (ii) vicinity to the clinic (more or less than 5&#x000a0;km), and (iii) population (more or less than 25,000). The randomization of matched clusters was through a computer software by a statistician not directly involved in the project with no local acquaintance. This study followed an open label cluster randomized controlled trial design.</p><p>

<bold><italic>Exclusion criteria were</italic></bold> (i) pregnancy or (ii) mental illness.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Intervention strategy: peer-support</title><p>The peer-support intervention strategy was home-based adherence counseling conducted by peer supporters who were HIV-infected individuals on ART and nominated by fellow patients and health care staff at each clinic site. The qualifications needed for peer-supporters were (i) social ability, (ii) good ART adherence for at least 6 months, (iii) high school graduation, (iv) willingness to participate in the study and (v) passed the qualifying test after the training. The OPC&#x02019;s and local health authorities proposed candidates that fulfilled the selection criteria&#x02019;s. The proportion of the peer-supporters to the number of recruited patients living in each district was about 1:20, meaning that one supporter would support a maximum of 20 patients. The peer-supporters received 1-week&#x02019;s training conducted by project researchers on basic HIV care and support, communication and counseling skills, and the process for completing the adherence checklist form. Two 1-week refresher trainings were provided yearly throughout the study.</p><p>The standard support performed by peer-supporters included home-based visits and completion of the adherence checklist form, in which patients were asked about their wellbeing, OI and adverse drug reaction (ADR) signs and symptoms, the times at which they took the pills, any doses missed for last 4 days, barriers to adherence, and pill count. If an incomplete adherence was reported, the peer supporter would counsel and discuss with the patients and family supporters how to improve the adherence.</p><p>The initial schedule of support was twice a week in the first 2 months, then once a week when patients&#x02019; adherence passed assessments. Additional visits were provided if patients were sick or had a serious ADR or a history of poor adherence. A telephone call was used to arrange a 15- to 30-min appointment place in advance between peer supporters and patients to minimize wasting time or to ensure confidentiality for patients who feared disclosure of their HIV status to others in their surroundings. Due to the associated stigma, the supporters did not wear a work outfit for home visits to minimize the patient&#x02019;s fear of stigma developing from others in their surroundings. Before being recruited for the study, patients were made aware that being a part of the study would require them to disclose their HIV status. They were warned about the possibility of stigmatization. If patients were not comfortable with that possibility or if they experienced any harm during the study, patients would choose not to be a part of the study. This was monitored during the OPC visits. To ensure satisfactory work by the peer supporters, bi-weekly supervision of peer-support activities was conducted by a peer-support group leader in each district. Monthly supervision meetings of peer-support activities were performed by project researchers.</p><p>Patients in both intervention and control groups received a set standard of care and treatment according to the National Guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] including pre-ART initiation, which consisted of three ART adherence training sessions in both individual and group settings. Health checks, blood sampling and drug dispensations were carried out on a monthly basis at the OPC. Selfreported adherence for the last-4-day period was assessed quarterly by an adherence counseling staff member. CD4 counts were run at baseline and every 6&#x000a0;months by using the Partec CyFlow&#x000ae; system in Uong Bi hospital and the Becton Dickinson&#x000ae; system in Quang Ninh provincial hospital.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Viral load and CD4 count screening</title><p>The Exavir&#x02122; Load, an enzyme-linked immune-sorbent assay (ELISA)-based VL quantification test (Cavidi AB, Uppsala, Sweden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]), was used in Vietnam for the first time to monitor the virologic outcomes for all participants every 6&#x000a0;months for 24&#x000a0;months of the study. The detection limits range from 200 to 410,000 copies/ml [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].

<italic>Incomplete adherence</italic> was defined as the patient stating in the 3-month adherence checklist form that he or she missed more than one dose (2 or more; either in morning or evening) of ARV during the 24&#x000a0;months of their follow-up time.</p><p>
<italic>Complete adherence</italic> was defined as the patient self-reporting in the 3-month adherence checklist form that he or she did not miss any dose or just one dose (either in the morning or evening) of ARV drugs during the 24&#x000a0;months of their follow-up time.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Definitions</title><p>
<italic>Virologic failure</italic> was defined as either (i) primary virologic failure if VL &#x0003e;1000 copies/ml after 6&#x000a0;months of ART initiation or (ii) secondary virologic failure if VL was undetectable (&#x0003c;200 copies/ml) after 6&#x000a0;months of ART initiation and then became &#x0003e;1000 copies/ml at any time point during the follow-up. Virologic failure patients were reported to the attending medical doctors and adherence counselors in their respective clinics. Then a follow-up VL test was repeated after at least one month but within 3&#x000a0;months of the initial virologic failure. If VL remained &#x0003e;1000 copies/ml, the patient was then reported to an OPC doctor and flagged for a confirmatory PCR VL. According to VGHADT (2009) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], patients were eligible for switching to second-line therapy if they meet the criteria of clinical or immunologic failure and, if available, they have been confirmed to have a PCR VL &#x0003e;5000 copies/ml. Additionally, patients with detectable viral load in the intervention group received an intensive adherence counseling support by the peer supporters through the provision of two to three home visits per week.</p><p>
<italic>Death</italic> events were ascertained by a medical doctor confirmation or, in the intervention group, by a peer-supporter through telephone calls or home visits. In cases of a missing follow-up, event of death was confirmed through telephone calls to family members and home visits by peer supporters.</p><p>

Our study showed a comparably low virologic failure risk, low mortality and high retention rate after 24&#x000a0;months of follow-up. This indicates that a well-funded and organized ART program implemented through PEPFAR and Global Fund in Vietnam can be rolled out successfully in remote and resource-limited settings.</p><p>After 24&#x000a0;months follow-up, the virologic failure risk in our study (7.2%) was lower than anticipated when the study was planned and compared to other countries (15 to 20%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. This, in retrospect, may have made the study underpowered. Among the 46 virologic failure cases in our study, 22 (48%) were secondary virologic failure (10 in the intervention group and 12 in the control group). In Sub-Saharan African countries, findings from systematic reviews showed an overall virologic failure risk (VL &#x0003e;1000 copies/ml) was 24% within 12&#x000a0;months of ART [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] and 15% after 24&#x000a0;months of ART [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], the highest risk (43%) was seen in a Rwanda [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p><p>In our study, the proportion of virologically suppressed patients on ART at 24&#x000a0;months was 94% which is higher than those reported from other resource-constrained settings including Uganda (86%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], Malawi (84%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] and Cameroon (52%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Studies in Vietnam reported that the proportion of patients with viral suppression among IDU populations were 73% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] and 70% in Ho Chi Minh City [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In neighboring Cambodia, 88% (306/346) of patients had achieved VL &#x0003c;400 copies/ml [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] and in Thailand, 15% (55/345) had virologic failure (&#x0003e;400 copies/ml) at 24&#x000a0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. However, most of these studies reported ontreatment results that were analyzed in a cross-sectional fashion and included both ARTna&#x000ef;ve and non-na&#x000ef;ve patients. The good treatment outcome in our study may be explained by several factors including that the vast majority of patients were ART-na&#x000ef;ve and the VL results were reported to the treating doctors since knowledge about viremia may result in intensification of the adherence support, both for intervention and control group patients.</p><p>Despite the fact that the majority of the patients were severely immune-suppressed with low CD4 counts at baseline and half were reported to be at clinical stage 3 or 4, our study showed a lower mortality risk (11% or 6.4/100 person-years) compared to other studies in resourcelimited countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. However, the mortality risk of this study was higher than that of studies in middle- and high-income countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. The survival and causes of death among patients in our cohort was previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>].</p><p>The retention rate of patients on ART was 78% after 24&#x000a0;months with no significant difference between the intervention and control groups (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.7). High retention rates in care indicate not only an improved health care system and ART programs in Vietnam, but also effective care and support activities in the community to motivate and engage patients in care. A recent study in Vietnam conducted among 4531 adults and 313 children showed that 81.2 and 84.4%, respectively, were still on ART after 12&#x000a0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. This result was similar with the retention rate in Thailand (80.8% after 5&#x000a0;years) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], Cambodia (80% after 4&#x000a0;years) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] and higher compared to studies in sub-Saharan Africa with 24&#x000a0;months of follow-up: Uganda (72%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] and Malawi (66%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Other studies also showed that engagement of HIV care is associated with improved clinical, virologic and immunologic parameters and survival outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Therefore, retaining HIV-infected patients in care has become a public health issue to ensure the success and sustainability of ART programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec17"><title>Immunologic outcomes</title><p>As shown in our study, CD4 counts responded well after 24&#x000a0;months of ART (overall increase of 286 cells/&#x003bc;l). This finding is in line with other studies that show how CD4 cell counts increased quickly, in particular after 6&#x000a0;months of ART [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. However, there was no significant difference between the intervention and control groups in CD4 trends after the adjustment (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.69). Factors that predict the increase of CD4 counts were the VL at baseline &#x02265;100,000 copies/ml, a baseline of CD4 counts &#x0003c;100 cells/&#x003bc;l, and having an HIV-infected family member. In a study in Thailand, CD4 count at baseline and changes in CD4 count were important in predicting CD4 counts &#x02264;200 cells/&#x003bc;l [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>].</p><p>In our study, after 24&#x000a0;months we found 45 patients (7%) had immunologic failure, of whom 23 (6.9%) were in the intervention group and 22 (7.1%) in the control group (no significant difference, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003e;0.05). Also, there was a high discordance (71%) between immunologic and virologic failure. Only 13 patients (29%) had both immunologic failure and virologic failure (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c;0.001).</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Factors associated with virologic failure</title><p>Our study showed that ART-non-na&#x000ef;ve status, high baseline VL (&#x02265;100,000 copies/ml) and incomplete adherence (missing more than one dose during 24&#x000a0;months) were risk factors for virologic failure. High VL (&#x0003e;100,000 copies/ml) at baseline can be a predictor for the slower increase of CD4 counts and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Therefore, our findings were in line with other studies that high VL at baseline is a predictor for virologic failure and mortality during ART [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. Contrarily, studies in Thailand shows low baseline CD4 count and race/ethnicity were independent predictors of virologic response, however baseline VL and gender were not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Also, univariate analysis showed having a child was significantly associated with lower virologic failure risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Impact of peer support intervention</title><p>The study results might answer the research question in that there was no significant difference between the intervention and control groups in both cumulative virologic failure risk and time to virologic failure after 2 years of follow-up. This result could be explained in several ways. While the simplest explanation is that peer support inherently does not affect treatment outcomes, we cannot exclude the possibility that our sample sizes may simply have been insufficiently large. With a larger study, we might have been able to gain enough statistical power to discern a difference between the intervention and control groups. Also, the adherence is self-reported, and may have been affected by observer bias. Also, the ART program in Vietnam has been well funded and implemented through international donors including PEPFAR and Global Fund. Before ART was initiated, each patient had to be assessed for ART readiness, name a supporting family member and attend three adherence counseling sessions according to the National Guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Furthermore, the eventual effect of the intervention might also be masked by a &#x0201c;ceiling effect&#x0201d; in which the control group also received a sufficient baseline adherence support. Free ARV may have also contributed to this &#x0201c;ceiling effect&#x0201d;. The baseline support may have been at such a high level that additional support did not affect treatment outcomes.</p><p>In addition, patient support could have originated from a number of different sources that may have contaminated the study including the OPCs and the community-based programs. Quang Ninh province, with a comparably high HIV prevalence, was receiving PEPFAR support in order to set up &#x0201c;comprehensive care, treatment and support&#x0201d; programs with NGOs, which were very active during the time of the project implementation. The availability of community-based activities provided by &#x0201c;the Bright Future&#x0201d; and other community outreach groups might have constituted a &#x0201c;contamination&#x0201d; where patients in the intervention group could meet and share adherence experiences with patients in the control group.</p><p>Furthermore, IDU in both the control and intervention groups had incentives to remain on the treatment regimens. Active IDUs may get arrested and placed into a drug rehabilitation centers. The risk of this may be increased if they fail to follow the treatment schedule, and thereby get attention from authorities. IDUs also received further counseling at the OPC and, for those in the intervention group, from the peer supporters.</p><p>In our study, 400 (63%) patients lived with their parents and other family members who might also play an important role as &#x0201c;internal supporters&#x0201d; to support patients in taking ARVs. Vietnamese culture strongly values the care of the extended family members, so most patients had good support for adherence from their families.</p><p>In our study, we only reported data to the 24-month-follow-up; hence the sustained or longterm effect of the adherence support intervention cannot be excluded. It should be noted that as patients started their ARV and improved their health, their perceived need for peer support may have declined. It was also apparent from discussion with peer supporters and patients that the personal relationship between the patient and supporter was crucial for long term peer support and follow up. Many patients saw the benefit and developed a close bound to their peer supporter, sometimes too close from the peer supporter&#x02019;s point of view. In other cases, the patients perceived the support as an annoyance. A recent study in Uganda has also shown that peer health care intervention had no impact on cumulative risk of virologic failure and virologic outcomes on short-term ART and suggested that it might be best suited for patients who have taken ART for longer periods, especially as it may mitigate the effects of &#x0201c;treatment fatigue&#x0201d; as patients tire of continually taking ART [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Therefore, to assess the sustained effect of the peer support intervention in our cohort, further research to continue following up patients with VL and CD4 count monitoring up to at least 48&#x000a0;months is needed.</p><p>Despite the results showing peer support had no significant effect on virologic failure, it is nevertheless clear that good outcomes can be achieved in resource-limited communities. The support the patients received may still be considered a global standard of care.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Methodological considerations</title><p>This is the first cluster randomized controlled trial on HIV conducted in a rural setting in Vietnam. We had some limitations and constraints in logistics, in recruiting patients, collecting data, and analysis due to a lack of precedence to follow. It took 2 years for recruiting enough patients instead of 10&#x000a0;months that we had originally planned. There were 35 (6%) patients who were ART-non-na&#x000ef;ve. However, as the study was intention-to-treat and the non-na&#x000ef;ve status was revealed after enrollment, these cases were still included in the study and the results might not represent whole treatment-na&#x000ef;ve population. Patients in both groups may receive other community-based supports that might be a &#x0201c;contamination&#x0201d;. In addition, patients in the intervention group could meet and share adherence experiences with patients in the control group at the clinic (i.e., there were 2 couples of whom the men in the intervention group married women in control group). Some patients were willing to move or even travel long distances in order to receive treatment from a certain clinic. This devotion to obtaining ARV could have contributed to the high adherence in both groups. The CD4 counts were done in two different hospital laboratories which may bias the estimation of immunologic failure. As the clusters were randomized before the recruitment of patients and the selection process of the patients should have randomized the individual clusters, the difference in the number of patients in each arm is unlikely to lead to bias. A limitation in our study was that the adherence data collected from peer supporters during their patient encounters in the intervention group wasn&#x02019;t included in the analyses.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec21" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>ART programs in resource-limited rural settings like Quang Ninh, Vietnam can provide an effective care and treatment with a low virologic failure risk if the patients are well-prepared for ART and followed up regularly by an out-patient clinic. Peer support to improve adherence did not show any impact on virologic failure and CD4 trends during first 2&#x000a0;years of ART. High VL at baseline is a predictor for virologic failure and CD4 trends.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA), the CHAIN EU FP7, Global Fund, CDC-Lifegap Project, and Health System Research Project of Hanoi Medical University in Vietnam for providing financial and technical supports.

Before conducting the study, written informed consent was obtained and all identifying information (names, initials, etc.) were then omitted to ensure the confidentiality. Patients in the intervention group were informed about the study and that they would be visited by a peer supporter and that the home visits might disclose their HIV status. Biological samples were collected and used only after written consent. All blood samples were coded to protect the identity of patients and to ensure confidentiality.</p><p>Both intervention and control groups received equal care and treatment and those who did not fulfill the inclusion criteria&#x02019;s for the study were managed with a set standard of care and treatment according to the National Guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Peer-supporters received ART at the study clinics and were treated in the same way as other HIV patients according to the National Guidelines. Moreover, peer-supporters&#x02019; viral loads (ExaVir&#x02122; Load) were also measured every 6&#x000a0;months, and they were compensated by receiving a salary and being refunded transportation fees each month. Data were accessible only to the research team, data manager, and coordinator of the project.</p></sec></ack><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">WHO (2015) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/hiv/en/">http://www.who.int/hiv/en/</ext-link>.
