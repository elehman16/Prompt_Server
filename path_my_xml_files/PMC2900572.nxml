Though rarely available, opioid agonist therapy (OAT) may be one way to improve HIV and substance abuse treatment outcomes after release. Of the 69 HIV-infected prisoners enrolled in a randomized controlled trial of directly administered antiretroviral therapy, 48 (70%) met DSM-IV criteria for opioid dependence. Of these, 30 (62.5%) selected OAT, either as methadone (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;7, 14.5%) or buprenorphine/naloxone (BPN/NLX; <italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;23, 48.0%). Twelve-week HIV and substance abuse treatment outcomes are reported as a sub-study for those selecting BPN/NLX. Retention was high: 21 (91%) completed BPN/NLX induction and 17 (74%) remained on BPN/NLX after 12&#x000a0;weeks. Compared with baseline, the proportion with a non-detectable viral load (61% vs 63% log<sub>10</sub> copies/mL) and mean CD4 count (367 vs 344 cells/mL) was unchanged at 12&#x000a0;weeks. Opiate-negative urine testing remained 83% for the 21 who completed induction. Using means from 10-point Likert scales, opioid craving was reduced from 6.0 to 1.8 within 3&#x000a0;days of BPN/NLX induction and satisfaction remained high at 9.5 throughout the 12&#x000a0;weeks. Adverse events were few and mild. BPN/NLX therapy was acceptable, safe and effective for both HIV and opioid treatment outcomes among released HIV-infected prisoners. Future randomized controlled trials are needed to affirm its benefit in this highly vulnerable population.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Buprenorphine</kwd><kwd>Substance abuse</kwd><kwd>Opioid dependence</kwd><kwd>HIV</kwd><kwd>AIDS</kwd><kwd>Prisoners</kwd><kwd>Incarceration</kwd><kwd>Prevention</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The New York Academy of Medicine 2010</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>In the USA, the prevalence of HIV among prisoners is approximately three times greater than in surrounding communities.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref> Indeed, 14% of all people living with HIV encounter the criminal justice system annually.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref> As such, prisons are an important place to detect HIV, treat it, and serve as a conduit to care after release.

Those who met DSM-IV criteria for opioid-dependence were assessed for interest in OAT with either methadone or BPN/NLX. Additional eligibility criteria included: (1) returning to either New Haven or Hartford; (2) age &#x02265; 18&#x000a0;years; (3) a negative urine pregnancy test for women and willingness to use contraception; and (4) expressing an interest in BPN/NLX treatment. As part of the ongoing parent study, subjects were randomized 2:1 to receive DAART versus self-administered therapy (SAT).</p><p><bold>Study Procedures</bold> Within 90&#x000a0;days before community-release, all subjects underwent informed consent, baseline assessments and chart review. Assessments included demographic information, mental illness and chemical dependence screening using the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref> Addiction Severity Index,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref><sup>,</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref> and Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref> Alcohol and drug use questions referred to the pre-incarceration period to establish historical diagnoses, as no subject was actively using drugs or alcohol. Subjects underwent secondary consent procedures after release to avoid any perceived or real coercion. Additional post-release activities included baseline physical exam and weekly assessment of opiate craving (10-point Likert-scale), buprenorphine satisfaction (10-point Likert-scale), urine toxicology screening using the NIDA-6 (opiates, cocaine, methadone, benzodiazepines, marijuana, and methamphetamines), and separate urine tests for oxycodone and buprenorphine (Redwood Biotech, Santa Rosa, CA). Baseline and quarterly HIV-1 RNA levels (Amplicor 1.5; Roche) and CD4 lymphocyte counts (FACS; Quest) were obtained.</p><p><bold>Buprenorphine Induction Process</bold> BPN/NLX induction was allowed up to 30&#x000a0;days post-release from prison; however, the day of release was targeted when possible. Due to low expected tolerance to opioids, subjects were initially administered 2.0&#x000a0;mg/0.5&#x000a0;mg BPN/NLX and increased by 2&#x000a0;mg/0.5&#x000a0;mg increments of BPN/NLX, as tolerated, to reduce the craving score to 1, while avoiding opiate agonist side effects. BPN/NLX dose, craving for opiates, opioid withdrawal symptoms, opioid-agonist side effects, and urine drug screening were all collected daily during the induction and weekly thereafter. All subjects received weekly, standardized, and manual-based counseling per protocol<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref> for 45&#x02013;60&#x000a0;min by a certified substance abuse treatment counselor. Study personnel linked counseling visits to collection of urine screens.</p><p><bold>Buprenorphine Administration</bold> For those randomized to DAART, BPN/NLX was observed daily along with their antiretroviral therapy and other chronically prescribed medications. BPN/NLX dispensing, similar to the SAT group, was contingent upon attending weekly counseling sessions. For those in the SAT arm, BPN/NLX was contingent upon attending weekly counseling sessions where a voucher was provided to allow the pharmacy to release the BPN/NLX. Counselors provided a 7-day prescription voucher after providing a urine specimen and attending weekly counseling sessions. The voucher was not contingent on urine specimen results.</p><p><bold>Follow-up</bold> Subjects were evaluated daily by the study clinician during the induction phase and at least monthly thereafter. Counselors met with subjects weekly, irrespective of study assignment, and assessed urine toxicology screening, opiate craving, BPN/NLX satisfaction, and adverse side effects. Structured interviews and phlebotomy for CD4 lymphocyte count and HIV-1 RNA level were conducted at weeks 4 and 12.</p><p><bold>Analytic Strategy</bold> Outcomes from the first 12&#x000a0;weeks are reported for the first 23 subjects recruited. The primary HIV treatment outcome was the proportion with a non-detectable HIV-1 RNA level 12&#x000a0;weeks after prison-release since this is the most vulnerable time period. CD4 counts are similarly reported. The primary substance abuse treatment outcome was retention in BPN/NLX treatment. Secondary drug treatment outcomes included the percentage of opioid-free urine toxicology results over 12&#x000a0;weeks. Missing urine results were adjudicated in the following sequential manner: (1) self-report at weekly visits; and (2) last value carried forward only if a single missing value was noted; (3) for subjects who remained in the trial, missing consecutive urine values were considered positive. Therefore, the proportion of positive urine tests was calculated as the percent positive out of the number who remained in the trial for each week and included missing value adjudication. Craving and satisfaction scores were calculated as the mean for those individuals whose results were reported weekly.Institutional Review Boards at both Yale University and the University of Connecticut and the Research Committee at the Connecticut Department of Correction approved the study; a Certificate of Confidentiality was also obtained.

First, it is the first study to demonstrate that HIV treatment outcomes persist during transition from prison and there were few adverse consequences. Second, it is also the first study to demonstrate the feasibility of BPN/NLX treatment as relapse prevention for opioid-dependent, HIV-infected prisoners transitioning to the community. Last, this study demonstrates not only a high preference for BPN/NLX over methadone or no OAT among those with opioid dependence, but demonstrates high levels of acceptability and satisfaction.</p><p>Prison-release studies of HIV-infected patients, including those from Connecticut, confirm poor virological and immunological outcomes within 12&#x000a0;weeks of release.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref><sup>,</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref> While case management interventions have successfully linked released prisoners to care, none have confirmed stability in HIV treatment outcomes. Recent data from Texas suggest that refilling prescriptions is low among released HIV-infected prisoners,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref> but this obstacle was not present in this study since all prescriptions were continued for all study subjects. The Texas study, however, did not assess the reasons for not filling prescriptions, which might have resulted from relapse to drug use. Though these pilot data are not powered sufficiently to determine if BPN/NLX treatment alone led to these successful clinical endpoints, these data remain compelling and suggest that BPN/NLX was an important factor in stabilizing the lives of subjects, resulting in improved adherence to antiretroviral therapy. Though insufficiently powered, it is now necessary to recruit larger sample sizes to determine if DAART plays a role in retention and outcomes. Ultimately, buprenorphine treatment alone without DAART needs evaluation through the rigors of a randomized controlled trial to determine its effectiveness.</p><p>Similar to most correctional settings in the Northeast where HIV prevalence rates are highest, the majority (70%) of all released HIV-infected prisoners on antiretroviral therapy met DSM-IV criteria for opioid dependence. Not only did the majority of those with opioid dependence choose OAT over no pharmacological therapy, but also BPN/NLX was preferred over methadone. Though numerous explanations may be posited, the greater preference for BPN/NLX may reflect previous negative experiences with or perceptions about methadone among this population;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref> this finding is supported by the near universal (&#x0003e;80%) prior experience with methadone treatment (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). One of the misconceptions by prisoners who are no longer using illicit drugs is that &#x0201c;OAT would no longer be needed&#x0201d; after prolonged periods of forced abstinence.

There are no other studies of BPN/NLX treatment for HIV-infected released prisoners, but compared with HIV-undifferentiated released prisoners, substance abuse outcomes are similar to other studies.

Fortunately, excess opioid-agonist effects were infrequent (17%) during the induction period (i.e., drowsiness, nausea, headache, constipation), extinguished by the end of the induction period. Induction did, however, require longer duration of induction due to the down-regulation of opioid receptors after prolonged periods of abstinence and potentially from known symptomatic pharmacokinetic interactions with ritonavir-boosted atazanavir.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref> Overall, tolerability remained high despite potential pharmacokinetic drug interactions reported between BPN/NLX and antiretroviral medications.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref><sup>,</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref><sup>,</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></p><p>Last, this study represents a population of HIV-infected individuals who often have many unmet needs and co-morbidities, and who might not otherwise receive such treatment. The unexpected universal co-occurrence of mental illness (100% of subjects with documented Axis I disorders) suggests a particularly challenging population to treat. Indeed, collectively all subjects met criteria for triple diagnosis and their management has traditionally been fraught with multiple challenges.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref><sup>,</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref> Left untreated, mental illness and substance use disorders contribute significantly to difficulty with maintaining appointments with medical professionals and often are associated with reincarceration.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref><sup>,</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref><sup>,</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref> When effective support is offered, however, they can maintain clinical benefit from treatment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></p><p>BPN/NLX may offer added incentives to correctional settings that might result in increased use of OAT. These include decreased: (1) regulatory procedures and licensing; (2) concerns about diversion and overdose; and (3) concerns about opioid withdrawal symptoms if a subject is not effectively and immediately linked to community services.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref> One of the major barriers to BPN/NLX treatment has been the actual cost of the medication, although it has been found to be similarly cost-effective as methadone.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref> This concern, however, may be obviated as the BPN/NLX patent ended in late 2009, potentially allowing for less expensive generics to emerge.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Buprenorphine induction and stabilization is a highly acceptable, tolerable and effective treatment to prevent relapse to opiate use in released HIV-infected prisoners. Importantly, it appears to be effective at maintaining HIV outcomes and potentially decreasing HIV-associated morbidity and mortality. This study initiated BPN/NLX after release from prison, but future studies, including randomized trials examining BPN/NLX induction before and after release are needed to determine the optimal timing for treatment. More importantly, better understanding of the impact that BPN/NLX treatment may have on recidivism, continuity of HIV care, ART adherence and HIV mortality through larger randomized controlled trials are urgently needed.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank Richard Schottenfeld for his thoughtful guidance and insight on providing buprenorphine to our study subjects, Paula Dellamura for her administrative assistance, and Maua Herme for her assistance with data management.
