Fractures of the distal forearm, the vertebrae and the hip are the most serious consequences of osteoporosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In the Netherlands, more than 27,000 distal forearm fractures, 6700 vertebral fractures, 17,000 hip fractures, and about 67,000 other fractures occur among persons aged &#x0003e;50&#x000a0;years every year, of which 32% can be attributed to osteoporosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Osteoporotic fractures are associated with increased morbidity and mortality for many years after the fracture, decreased quality of life and high costs for the society [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par16">Several drugs have become available, which have been shown to reduce the risk of fractures with 20-50% in controlled settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Optimal strategies to identify persons at high risk of osteoporotic fractures, and to prevent such fractures have been under discussion for a long time. The guidelines for treating osteoporosis vary strongly between different countries, and range from a conservative approach to almost complete screening of post-menopausal women aged &#x0003e;65&#x000a0;years with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) or even treatment of patients with fragility fractures without additional bone densitometry measurements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The Dutch guidelines for general practitioners (GP&#x02019;s) advocate a conservative approach and advise a stepwise approach which identifies patients with a high fracture risk, by using both clinical risk factors for fractures, which in case of a high risk score is followed by a DXA measurement, and the assessment of prevalent vertebral fractures (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Subsequently, patients at risk with a T-score&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;&#x02212;2.5 or with a prevalent vertebral fracture should be treated with bone sparing medication, such as bisphosphonates. The most important reason for this conservative approach is that only few patients will be treated unnecessarily. However, as a consequence, a large part of patients with an increased fracture risk will not be treated. A second reason for this conservative approach is the fact that the effectiveness of the treatment with bisphosphonates has mainly been shown in individuals with known low bone mineral density [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], and not in a general primary care population.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Risk factors for fractures according to the Dutch guideline for general practitioners (GP) for primary osteoporosis</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Risk factor</th><th>Risk score</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Vertebral fracture</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Recent fracture (&#x0003c;2&#x000a0;years) after the age of 50&#x000a0;years</td><td>4<sup>a</sup>

<sup>a</sup>In October 2012, when the trial had already started, the Dutch guidelines for GP&#x02019;s for primary osteoporosis were updated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In the previous guidelines, the treatment threshold of BMD (femoral neck or spine) was a T- score&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;&#x02212;2.5 for patients aged &#x0003c;70&#x000a0;years, or a Z-score&#x000a0;&#x02264;&#x000a0;&#x02212;1 for patients aged &#x02265;70&#x000a0;years</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap>
</p><p id="Par17">In the last decade, the need for more pragmatic designs of clinical trials has been recognized, and pragmatic designs have been emerging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].

They are characterized by a high heterogeneity, with respect to patients, treatments, and clinical settings, which results in a high external validity of the findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Because the effects of treatment with bisphosphonates have been demonstrated in controlled settings only, there is a need for more pragmatic studies in primary care in which patients with a high fracture risk are identified and the effect of the bone sparing treatment is examined. The objective of the current study is to describe the design of the SALT Osteoporosis Study aiming to examine the effect of screening and treatment of patients with a high fracture risk in primary care on fracture incidence in a pragmatic setting.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Trial design and participants</title><p id="Par18">The SALT Osteoporosis Study is a randomised pragmatic trial, which is currently performed in the Netherlands and that uses a stepwise approach (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

At baseline, only clinical risk factors for fractures are examined in the control group, because it has been considered to be unethical to offer women in the control group a DXA without informing them about the results.

Via our web-based database, group allocation is automatically assigned to every new patient that is included.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Blinding</title><p id="Par39">Complete blinding of the patients and study team is not feasible in this open study design. However, we took measures to blind the GP as much as possible: the GP only receives information about patients with a treatment indication in the intervention group. For the other patients, the GP does not know whether or not they have approved to participate, are low risk participants in the intervention group, or are assigned to the control group. In addition, data entry and verification of fractures are performed by study team members that are blinded to group allocation. Statistical analyses will not be performed blindly.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Outcomes</title><p id="Par40">The primary outcome is the time to the first new fracture and the total number of fractures during follow-up. Participants are asked to report fractures at 18 and 36&#x000a0;months, using questionnaires. All fractures will be verified with the GP or the hospital. Fracture information of patients who die during the study, move out of the region, or are otherwise lost to follow-up will be extracted from the GP medical records as well. Additionally, we will study the GP medical records of a subsample of 10% of the patients, who do not report fractures, to estimate the amount of fractures we might have missed using the questionnaires.</p><p id="Par41">Secondary outcomes are osteoporotic fractures (defined as all fractures except fractures of the head, hand/finger, and foot/toe), as well as hip fractures, self-reported falls, and mortality.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Qualitative evaluation</title><p id="Par42">Data for a qualitative process evaluation are collected by visiting a subsample of GP practices, patients, and pharmacies. Via interviews, medical records and pharmacy data we will gain insight in the process and anticipate on potential problems.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Statistical methods</title><p id="Par43">Cox proportional Hazards Models will be used to assess the effect on time to first new fracture between the groups. The proportional hazard assumption will be evaluated. The primary analyses will contain two different comparisons. First, to examine the effect of the screening program plus the structured treatment program, the women in the intervention group will be compared with the women in the control group. Following the intention to treat principle, this comparison includes all randomised women, both the ones with a high fracture risk and the ones with a low fracture risk. Second, we will examine the effect of the structured treatment program. In this analyses, women with a high fracture risk as identified by the screening program and adjoined treatment indication in the intervention group will be compared to women with a high fracture risk and adjoined treatment indication in the control group.</p><p id="Par44">For the latter comparison, data on the fracture risk at baseline will be missing for most of the women in the control group, because DXA and IVA measurements are only performed at the end of 3&#x000a0;years of follow-up in the majority of the controls. In controls who underwent DXA and IVA at baseline, the baseline data will be used. Otherwise, missing data on fracture risk will be substituted. If BMD at follow-up will be sufficient, it is assumed that it was sufficient at baseline too, and if no vertebral fractures are observed at follow-up, than it is likely that no vertebral fractures were present at baseline either. The remainder of missings will be substituted using multiple imputation. For multiple imputation, the available baseline data of the intervention and control group will be used to estimate fracture risk for the women with remaining missing data.</p><p id="Par45">In a secondary analysis we will examine the per protocol effect among adherent women only. All analyses will be adjusted for variables that differ between the intervention and control group at baseline. Interaction effects with age and previous fracture will be examined. An interim analysis has been performed to see if the study needed to be extended or stopped for futility. This analysis did not have consequences for the study continuation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Sample size calculation</title><p id="Par46">In our pilot study, 3% of all participants fulfilled the selection criteria for treatment with bone sparing drugs according to the actual GP guideline (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Based on the questionnaires we calculated the absolute 10-years fracture risk of the three main types of osteoporotic fractures using the FRAX. Based on this FRAX calculation and using the threshold levels of Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>, we estimated that 28.2% of the women would fulfil criteria for treatment and that the average absolute 10-years fracture risk of these women was 27.5%, or 8.3% in a 3-year follow-up.</p><p id="Par47">We assume that the incidence of new fractures will be reduced with 35% in the high risk treatment group compared to the control group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and aim for an &#x003b1; of 0.05 and a &#x003b2; of 0.2. Taking into account that 3% of the high risk patients in the control group fulfil criteria for treatment with bone sparing drugs based on the current Dutch guidelines, and allowing for a 30% lost to follow-up rate [extrapolated from 26], we calculated that we would need to include <italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1700 in the intervention group and in the control group in order to have <italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1190 patients in both treatment groups at the end of the trial.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Results of inclusion</title><p id="Par48">The inclusion started in 2010. After one year of recruitment, the inclusion was disappointing: only 50% of the approached patients approved to participate instead of the anticipated 80%, and less participants were identified as having a high fracture risk. As a result, more general practices are needed than the 100 practices that were planned, as well as more DXA examinations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par49">Because of the pragmatic study design the results of the SALT Osteoporosis Study will be very important for underpinnings of the prevention strategy of the osteoporosis guidelines. Currently, another large pragmatic trial to the effectiveness of screening older women for the prevention of fractures (the SCOOP study) is being performed in the United Kingdom [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The screening strategy of SCOOP is fairly similar to our strategy. In SCOOP, the indication for DXA is determined by the 10-year probability of a hip fracture as calculated by FRAX. After the DXA measurement in women at high risk, the 10-year probability is recalculated following inclusion of femoral neck BMD, to select the women that should be treated. In contrast to our study, IVA is not part of the screening program. The results of the SCOOP trial, are being expected in the coming year.</p><p id="Par50">In addition to its pragmatic design and the use of DXA and IVA, the strength of the current study is that it is being performed in a primary care setting. We will therefore be able to check the follow-up status on fractures and mortality of patient who will be lost during follow up in the medical files, and as a consequence, low rates of missing data on the outcome are expected.</p><p id="Par51">A limitation is the waiting list control group, in which the controls will undergo DXA after the end of the trial. This was done because of ethical considerations. However, inevitably, participants will be lost to follow-up, and therefore missing data on DXA will be increased in the control group, as compared to the intervention group. Multiple imputation will be used to solve this problem.</p><p id="Par52">The sample size calculation was made to examine the effect of the structured treatment program, not primarily to examine the effect of the screening plus treatment program. Therefore, the power to show an effect in the intention to treat analysis (effect of screening and treatment program) is probably not large enough, because of a limited contrast between the treatment groups in this analysis: both the intervention and the control group contain women that do not have an indication for treatment. A larger sample size was practically and financially not feasible. In addition, the sample size calculation was based on the incidence of the three main types of osteoporotic fractures, whereas the main outcome is all types of fractures. The reason for this is that the FRAX algorithm was used to estimate fracture incidence, and this tool is not available for all types of fractures. The choice for all fractures as primary outcome results in 20% more fractures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], and therefore increases the statistical power. Osteoporotic fractures will be analyzed subsequently.</p><p id="Par53">If our screening program is effective, it might reduce the cost of fractures, but will also bring additional costs for screening and treatment. A cost-effectiveness evaluation is therefore of major interest. However, only a restricted cost-effectiveness analysis is possible for this study. Patients will be asked about medical visits and hospital admission twice during the follow-up of three years. We will be able to estimate and compare the costs of a fracture in both treatment arms.</p><p id="Par54">In the Netherlands, usual osteoporosis care is problem-driven in reaction to, for example, a fracture or a question of the patient. Standardized screening in which x-ray examination is part of the process, is not allowed without special permit by the government. We are performing the study as a population study, with approval of the Dutch Health Council and Dutch Ministry of Health, Wellbeing and Sports, in which all women of 65&#x000a0;years or older are invited to participate and we will perform a process analysis of this approach by interviewing patients, doctors and general practices. This might lead to additional insights on how the prevention of osteoporosis in primary care can be improved. The primary result of the SALT Osteoporosis Study, that is the effectiveness of the screening and treatment program, will have a large impact on the strategy for fracture prevention.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>25(OH)D</term><def><p id="Par5">25-hydroxyvitamin D</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BMD</term><def><p id="Par6">Bone mineral density</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DXA</term><def><p id="Par7">Dual x-ray absorptiometry</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ESR</term><def><p id="Par8">Erythrocyte sedimentation rate</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FRAX</term><def><p id="Par9">Fracture risk assessment tool</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GP</term><def><p id="Par10">General practitioner</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IVA</term><def><p id="Par11">Instant vertebral assessment</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LASA</term><def><p id="Par12">Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SALT</term><def><p id="Par13">Stichting ArtsenLaboratorium en Trombosedienst</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TSH</term><def><p id="Par14">Thyroid stimulating hormone</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors gratefully thank all participants and participating GP&#x02019;s.
