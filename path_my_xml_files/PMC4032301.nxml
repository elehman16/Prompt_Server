constriction in the third trimester of pregnancy has been demonstrated in several
clinical and experimental studies. It is believed that the basic mechanism of this
association involves the inhibitory action of polyphenols on the synthesis of
prostaglandins, similar to anti-inflammatory drugs as classically described for many
decades.</p><p>Recently, we demonstrated that ductal constriction occurring in the absence of maternal
intake of anti-inflammatory drugs in the third trimester of pregnancy is reversed by
dietary restriction of polyphenol-rich foods, such as herbal teas, mate, coffee, dark
chocolate, coffee, from grape, orange, tangerine, red fruits, apple and olive
oil<sup><xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. Other clinical and
experimental evidences support the association of changes in fetal ductus arteriosus
flow and maternal consumption of foods with high concentration of natural
anti-inflammatory substances such as polyphenols<sup><xref rid="r02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>.</p><p>A food frequency questionnaire designed to quantify the concentration of polyphenols
ingested by pregnant women in the third trimester was recently validated in our
setting<sup><xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. It represents an
informative and practical method to determine the consumption of polyphenol-rich
substances, according to usual dietary habits.</p><p>This study tests the hypothesis that dietary maternal restriction of polyphenol-rich
foods during two weeks or longer, in the third trimester of pregnancy, also improves
ductus arteriosus flow dynamics in normal fetuses, as previously shown in fetuses with
ductal constriction.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study Design</title><p>This open clinical trial was designed to assess the effect of maternal restriction of
polyphenol-rich foods on ductus arteriosus flow dynamics in fetuses without cardiac
anatomical or functional abnormalities.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients</title><p>In November 2005, a structured program for routine evaluation of the ductus
arteriosus flow dynamics was implemented at the Fetal Cardiology Unit of the
Institute of Cardiology of Rio Grande do Sul. Third-trimester fetuses, with or
without risk factors for cardiac abnormalities, were assessed by Doppler
echocardiography. The study group was composed of 46 healthy fetuses with normal
ductal flow, from women over 28 weeks of gestation who customarily consumed
polyphenol-rich foods and consented to participate in the study. A control group of
26 third-trimester healthy fetuses from normal mothers was also evaluated. In this
group, used for comparison, no dietary intervention was applied. None of the mothers
reported the use of drugs containing nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID)
and/or steroids, or the use of other legal or illegal drugs during the third
trimester of pregnancy, and acute or chronic maternal disease was not present.</p></sec><sec><title>Dietary assessment and intervention</title><p>After signing an informed consent, and on the same day of the first fetal
echocardiographic study, all participants answered a detailed food frequency
questionnaire (FFQ) including the total gestation period. In the case of foods that
were not consumed during the whole of the pregnancy period, an estimate was made of
the daily consumption, by multiplying the reported portion by frequency of use and
dividing by the number of days of in the time unit (day, week, month or year). One
year was considered as the total days of gestation. The amount of food consumption
during the period of investigation was assessed through homemade measures and
estimated by pictures<sup><xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>.</p><p>Total polyphenols in the maternal diet were quantified with the validated
FFQ<sup><xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. This instrument
presents a list of 52 foods rich in polyphenols, defined as above the 75<sup>th</sup>
percentile, i.e. with at least 30 mg of polyphenol per 100 g of food. This
classification followed criteria established by American<sup><xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> and French databases<sup><xref rid="r07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>, which present flavonoid content and its subclasses in
385 and 300 foods, respectively. The amount of total polyphenols estimated by the
dietary questionnaire was described in milligrams (mg).</p><p>Since mate tea (infusion of yerba mate <italic>Ilex paraguariensis</italic>) is not
included in the American and French databases, polyphenols this substance were
quantified using the Official Methods of Analysis of AOAC International, 18th ed. For
this physicochemical test, the yerba mate concentration was 47.4% and the water
temperature was 80&#x000ba;C, to reproduce the form of consumption of this beverage in South
Brazil<sup><xref rid="r08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>.</p><p>After application of the FFQ in the first interview, a diet based on polyphenol-poor
foods or &#x0003c;30 mg polyphenols/100 mg as listed in the American database<sup><xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>, was prescribed to the pregnant women
of the intervention group. Two weeks later, at the time of the second fetal
echocardiogram , the participants answered again the FFQ, for calculation of the
amount of total polyphenols ingested during the period. All pregnant women were then
instructed to maintain a restricted diet until the end of pregnancy, and different
foods poor in polyphenols, i.e. with a concentration of less than 30 mg of
polyphenols per 100 g of food (below the 25<sup>th</sup> percentile), were suggested
to replace the essential micronutrients that are present in polyphenol-rich food.</p><p>The 26 pregnant women from the control group, in which no dietary intervention was
conducted, responded to the same questionnaire after completion of the first fetal
echocardiography and after two weeks of follow-up, when the control echocardiographic
Doppler evaluation was performed.</p></sec><sec><title>Assessment of ductal dynamics</title><p>A complete fetal Doppler echocardiography and color flow mapping was performed in all
patients, with sequential segmental analysis of fetal heart and determination of the
situs and atrioventricular and ventriculoarterial connections. Standardized pictures
were studied, including aortic and ductal arches. The ductus arteriosus was studied
after a suitable image in the sagittal plane was collected. For pulsed Doppler
assessment, the ultrasound beam was aligned as parallel as possible to the color flow
direction and to the long axis view of the ductus, with an angle smaller than 30&#x000ba;,
without using angle correction. The sample volume was positioned in the descending
aortic end of the ductus arteriosus.</p><p>The right to left ventricular dimensions ratio (RV/LV) was obtained on a four-chamber
view in late diastole to assess potential right ventricular pressure changes.</p><p>Peak systolic and diastolic ductal flow velocities (SDV and DDV, respectively) were
obtained and ductal pulsatility index (PI) obtained by the ratio [(systolic velocity
- diastolic velocity) / average velocity] and right to left ventricular diameters
ratio (RV/LV) were calculated<sup><xref rid="r09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>.
Since the PI is not dependent on gestational age, it was used to exclude the
diagnosis of ductal constriction<sup><xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>.</p><p>In fetuses of the intervention group, a control fetal echocardiography was performed
on the same day of the second nutritional evaluation (after a minimum period of 2
weeks), to assess the effect of maternal dietary intervention on fetal ductus
arteriosus flow dynamics and RV/LV ratio.</p><p>In the 26 pregnant women from the control group, a fetal echocardiogram was performed
at the time of the first nutritional evaluation and after 2 weeks, on the same day of
the dietary control evaluation.</p><p>For fetal echocardiography, a General Electric Vivid III Expert or Vivid 5S systems,
with high-resolution two-dimensional and M-mode imaging, pulsed and continuous
Doppler and color flow mapping capability, with multi-frequency convex sector
transducers and a frequency range of 4 to 8 MHz, were used. All the analyses were
performed by pediatric cardiologists with expertise in fetal echocardiography.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis </title><p>Numerical data were presented as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation (SD). For comparison of
ductal flow velocities, pulsatility indices and the RV/LV ratios before and after the
implementation of the dietary maternal restriction of polyphenol-rich foods, the
two-tailed Student's t-test for paired samples was used. The Wilcoxon test was
applied for comparison of maternal intake of polyphenols in the two groups. The
significance level of 0.05 was used for all statistical tests. The sample size was
established considering an alpha-type error of 5% and a beta-type error of 10%.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Maternal consumption of polyphenol-rich foods was documented in all case and control
participants. None of the patients included in this study presented a history of

average maternal consumption of polyphenols was 1,277 mg/day. After dietary orientation

dietary intervention for restricting the intake of foods rich in polyphenols by pregnant
women in the third trimester improves ductus arteriosus flow dynamics and decreases the
right ventricle size in normal fetuses.</p><p>The effects of ductal constriction on fetal hemodynamics, usually leading to right
ventricular overload, tricuspid regurgitation of varying degrees and especially
increasing the risk of neonatal pulmonary hypertension, a potentially severe and
sometimes fatal clinical situation, are well known<sup><xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. The best known
etiology of constriction of the ductus arteriosus, which was described almost three
decades ago, is the maternal consumption of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in the
third trimester of pregnancy. This effect of anti-inflammatory drugs upon the ductus is
secondary to inhibition of the metabolic route of prostaglandin, especially of
cyclooxygenase-2, preventing the transformation of arachidonic acid into
prostaglandin<sup><xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>-<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>.</p><p>The literature reports on the mechanism of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory action of
polyphenols, which are beneficial to a large portion of the population, and the
scientific evidence of their ethnomedicinal effect, show that a large number of
molecules derived from functional foods and plants have been isolated and even
introduced successfully in the international pharmaceutical industry<sup><xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. It has been demonstrated unambiguously that the polyphenols
decrease oxidative stress (including in pregnancy)<sup><xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>, plasma triglyceride and cholesterol levels<sup><xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>, blood pressure<sup><xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>-<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>, the consequences of gastric hypersecretion<sup><xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>, the development of some
neoplasms<sup><xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>-<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>and atherosclerosis<sup><xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>, the manifestations of
aging<sup><xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> and Alzheimer's
disease<sup><xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>, and various other health problems. Polyphenols such as
quercitin and kaempferol, among many others, are present in many foods and their
anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive activities have been shown to be as or more
powerful than those of indomethacin<sup><xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>-<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>. These effects are dependent on the
inhibition of modulation of the arachidonic acid and the synthesis of prostaglandins,
especially E-2, which is responsible for fetal ductus arteriosus patency. So, it seems
clear that this same mechanism is responsible for the only known harmful effect of these
substances and foods in which they are present in higher concentration, the observed
ductal constriction after maternal intake of foods rich in polyphenols in the third
trimester of pregnancy. Foods rich in polyphenolic compounds include mate, black and
green tea, other homemade teas, black chocolate, black coffee, grape, orange, tangerine,
red fruits, olive oil and other foods which are also usually consumed<sup><xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. Several experimental studies and
clinical trials have demonstrated the causal relationship between polyphenols and ductal
flow changes, as well as increase in ductal flow velocities and in the right ventricular
diameter in normal fetuses exposed to diets rich in polyphenols<sup><xref rid="r02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup>.</p><p>The conceptual hypothesis of this study was that the systolic and diastolic ductal flow
velocities would decrease and the ductal pulsatility index would increase, while the
ratio between the right and left ventricular diameters would be reduced, in normal
fetuses from mothers with a dietary restriction of polyphenol-rich foods, to levels
below the 25 percentile considering the mean consumption of the general population
previously described<sup><xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>, and in
comparison with a control group with no dietary intervention. As mentioned above, this
hypothesis was based on knowledge obtained in the past years, and particularly with the
demonstration of reversal of the ductal constrictive effects following maternal
restriction of polyphenol-rich foods<sup><xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>.
Ductal constriction is a non-categorical, "yes or no" phenomenon, but rather a
continuous spectrum with increasing severity related to the clinical manifestations of
right ventricular overload, tricuspid and/or pulmonary regurgitation and
Doppler-echocardiographic findings of increased systolic and mainly diastolic ductal
flow velocities, as well as decrease of the ductal pulsatility index. Therefore, it
seems logical to consider that the initial changes, even though still not filling in the
classic criteria of constriction, can develop into more serious forms, exceeding the
established diagnostic cutoff points. The sample assessed in this study was composed of
normal fetuses, with exclusion of those who already had a diagnosis of ductal
constriction, in order to demonstrate how the nutritional guidance can decrease the
potential risk for development of the disease.</p><p>The study was designed as an open clinical trial, in which participants of the control
and intervention groups were included at random and in a sequential and not intentional
manner, and the examiners were blind to the nutritional information. The results
obtained strongly support the conceptual hypothesis, since all the outcomes originally
expected were observed.</p><p>The food frequency questionnaire is considered the most practical, informative and the
most used method to measure the previous diet, allowing the classification of
individuals according to their usual eating patterns. It is also an instrument of easy
applicability and low cost, so that it can be used in population studies<sup><xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>. In 1973, the FFQ was recommended by the
American Public Health Association as one of the methods for dietary
assessment<sup><xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup>.</p><p>The adherence of the pregnant women who participated in this study to the prescribed
diet based on polyphenol-poor foods<sup><xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>
shows the feasibility of establishing dietary habits with low consumption of these
substances. Of course, it is very difficult to remove completely the polyphenols from
the diet, but the initial objective of improving the ductal flow dynamics was achieved
with the orientation of the prescribed diet. Since many substitute foods with small
amounts of polyphenols are widely available, the nutritional needs of the gestational
period can be maintained.</p><p>Other studies in this subject are underway, including a multicenter international
registry, an investigation of the association between neonatal pulmonary hypertension
with maternal consumption of polyphenols in the third trimester, a study investigating
the association between prostaglandin levels in maternal circulation with the
consumption and excretion of polyphenols by pregnant women, and experimental studies
with rat and sheep fetuses to explore the mechanisms of ductal constriction and their
relationships with the inflammatory cascade, oxidative stress and the levels of
polyphenols.</p><p>The number of evidences already available recommends, at least, a note of caution with
regard to the consumption by pregnant women of foods with high concentrations of
polyphenols.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, this study demonstrates that the intervention on maternal diet on the
third trimester of pregnancy, restricting the intake of polyphenol-rich food for a
period greater than or equal to two weeks, results in improved fetal ductal flow
dynamics and reduces the dimensions of the right ventricle. This new data can influence
obstetric monitoring and guidance of the eating habits of pregnant women at late
