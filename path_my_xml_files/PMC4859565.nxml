This study evaluated the effect of dexamethasone on POCD incidence after noncardiac and nonneurologic surgery. METHODS: One hundred and forty patients (ASA I-II; age 60&#x02013;87 years) took part in a prospective phase III, double blind, randomized study involving the administration or not of 8 mg of IV dexamethasone before general anesthesia under bispectral index (BIS) between 35&#x02013;45 or 46&#x02013;55. Neuropsychological tests were applied preoperatively and on the 3rd, 7th, 21st, 90th and 180th days after surgery and compared with normative data. S100&#x003b2; was evaluated before and 12 hours after induction of anesthesia. The generalized estimating equations (GEE) method was applied, followed by the posthoc Bonferroni test considering P&#x0003c;0.05 as significant. RESULTS: On the 3rd postoperative day, POCD was diagnosed in 25.2% and 15.3% of patients receiving dexamethasone, BIS 35&#x02013;45, and BIS 46&#x02013;55 groups, respectively. Meanwhile, POCD was present in 68.2% and 27.2% of patients without dexamethasone, BIS 35&#x02013;45 and BIS 46&#x02013;55 groups (p&#x0003c;0.0001). Neuropsychological tests showed that dexamethasone associated to BIS 46&#x02013;55 decreased the incidence of POCD, especially memory and executive function. The administration of dexamethasone might have prevented the postoperative increase in S100&#x003b2; serum levels. CONCLUSION: Dexamethasone can reduce the incidence of POCD in elderly patients undergoing surgery, especially when associated with BIS 46&#x02013;55. The effect of dexamethasone on S100&#x003b2; might be related with some degree of neuroprotection.</p><p><bold><italic>Trial Registration</italic>:</bold>

POCD was defined as a cognitive decline in two or more neuropsychology functions, according to the International Study of Postoperative Cognitive Dysfunction (ISPOCD) study group. Global cognitive function was evaluated by a neuropsychology battery, and the Z-score method was applied as a measure of cognition[<xref rid="pone.0152308.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>The ISPOCD demonstrated that in geriatric patients submitted to non-cardiac surgery under general anesthesia, this adverse event affected up to 26% of them, one week after the procedure. After three months of operation, POCD remained in up to 10% of that group[<xref rid="pone.0152308.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0152308.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In elderly patients, POCD increased the risk of comorbidities in the first year after surgery[<xref rid="pone.0152308.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, there is no consensus about precipitating factors and preventive measures for cognitive dysfunction in surgical patients. Besides age, the postoperative cognitive function may be compromised by hypoxia, hypotension, anesthetics and depth of anesthesia, surgical procedures and external factors such as quality of life[<xref rid="pone.0152308.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Patients might present different levels of mental status. It can vary from mental confusion to memory loss. Clinically, it is shown as a decrease in the consciousness level, also known as delirium.</p><p>Surgery can result in a complex neuronal system response, which includes inflammation and may directly affect patient outcome[<xref rid="pone.0152308.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Data support the concept that inflammation and brain injury are a possible pathogenic mechanism for POCD. S100b is a known biomarker related to brain injury. It is released into blood circulation in early stages of brain suffering when glial cells are activated [<xref rid="pone.0152308.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Corticosteroids such as dexamethasone are often used as additional drugs in anesthesia to mitigate its side effects, such as pain, vomiting and fatigue, all of which are physical symptoms that compromise cognitive functioning[<xref rid="pone.0152308.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0152308.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The use of dexamethasone was never investigated as a possible protective factor against cognitive impairment in surgery.</p><p>This study aimed to evaluate the effect of dexamethasone on the incidence of postoperative cognitive dysfunction in elderly patients undergoing surgery under general anesthesia.

Later, the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrial.gov/">www.clinicaltrial.gov</ext-link> registration was performed. Identifier: NCT01332812.</p><p>Inclusion criteria were as follows: candidates for noncardiac and nonneurologic surgery under general anesthesia that was not expected to exceed 6 hours, no history of brain disease, dementia or other psychiatric disorders that affect cognition, literate, and no continuous use corticosteroids, antidepressants or opioids preoperatively.</p><p>The mental state was preliminarily assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), which is validated for the Brazilian population as a brief screening instrument designed to measure and quantify the global cognitive state, assessing reasoning, spatial-temporal orientation, memory, and schooling. The test uses for the Brazilian people a cut-off of 18 points for subjects who have completed up to 4 years of formal academic study and 23 points for individuals with higher levels of education. Patients were excluded if they had an MMSE score below 18 or 23 by educational level[<xref rid="pone.0152308.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><sec id="sec004"><title>Preoperative evaluation and neuropsychological assessment</title><p>Demographic data were analyzed, including education, marital status, occupation, and current medication. Signs and symptoms of depression were assessed preoperatively using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), which consists of 21 questions that explore depressive symptoms on a scale of 0 to 4, where zero represents no symptoms and four is the maximum symptomatology. A total of 14 points was considered indicative of the presence of moderate depressive symptoms[<xref rid="pone.0152308.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The quality of life was investigated using the Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) to investigate health-related conditions, activities of daily living, productivity, emotional problems, relationships, and motivation, and one question about the perception of the patients itself[<xref rid="pone.0152308.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>The Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (TICS) was used as a standardized test to assess neuropsychological functioning when assessing cognitive skills. This test was used when screening personally was impractical or when patients were unable to attend the clinic. This test consists of a structured interview with 11 items that assess the skills of spatial and temporal orientation, mental control, memory, general information, language, and calculations[<xref rid="pone.0152308.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>POCD diagnosis was performed by TICS and Neuropsychological Battery, near the seventh postoperative day.</p><p>The specific neuropsychological battery test, based on the International Studies of POCD 1 and 2 translated and adapted for the individually studied population, was performed one day before surgery (baseline) and on the 3<sup>rd</sup>, 7<sup>th</sup>, 21<sup>st</sup>, 90<sup>th</sup> and 180<sup>th</sup> postoperative day. The cognitive functions assessed were memory, attention and executive function in aspects such as strategy, elaboration of thought and inhibiting the control of actions. Tests used for the evaluation of these skills are redundant, especially for the assessment of attention.</p><p>Memory was evaluated using the Rey-Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT), which consists of a list of 15 words to be memorized and recalled on three successive attempts, with delayed recall after 15 to 25 minutes, evaluating the number of words recalled and the number of errors made for each presentation[<xref rid="pone.0152308.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>The Symbol Digit Modified Test (SDMT) was applied for the evaluation of short-term memory, visual search skill, and attention. SDMT is a graphical task where the individual has to fill in symbols exemplified in the spaces below the corresponding number within 180 seconds. The result is measured as the number of symbols drawn and the number of errors[<xref rid="pone.0152308.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Attention was also evaluated using the Trail Making Test (TMT) for the assessment of selective and alternating attention. In part A of the test, the subject must consecutively draw lines connecting numbered circles. In part B, the subject must draw lines connecting circles alternately with letters and numbers in a sequence. The result is measured as time and trail errors[<xref rid="pone.0152308.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Criteria for POCD diagnosis</title><p>TICS values were used to evaluate the evolution of general cognition postoperatively and were applied in every phase&#x02019;s pre and postoperatively. For the diagnosis of POCD, a composite cognitive index was established defined by the occurrence of cognitive impairment in TICS and at least 1 of 8 possible deficits of the others neuropsychologist tests. Changes in neuropsychological tests have been compared with the results of tables of normative subjects matched for age, gender, and formal education[<xref rid="pone.0152308.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Assessment of serum levels of S100&#x003b2;</title><p>Serum levels of S100&#x003b2; protein were obtained from venous blood samples collected before anesthesia induction and 12 hours after surgery. Samples were placed in dry tubes and centrifuged; serum was removed and stored to -80&#x000b0;C until the analysis; and S100&#x003b2; protein was measured by a commercially available S100&#x003b2; enzyme-linked immune absorbent assay, (ELISA) kit (Diasorin, Italy).

When this corticosteroid was associated with BIS 46&#x02013;55 rather than BIS 35&#x02013;45, their cognitive functions established more rapidly. A better quality of life was also observed in the postoperative period in the dexamethasone groups, as a lower incidence of depressive symptoms.</p><p>In anesthesia practice, patients who have postoperative injuries, such as pain, nausea, and vomiting return to daily activities in more time than patients who presented fewer postoperative symptoms. Nowadays, dexamethasone is commonly used in the perioperative setting by anesthetists, both for its antiemetic properties and its ability to reduce airway swelling and fatigue. Our findings corroborate some of the observations made in other studies on corticosteroids such as the decrease in the postoperative recovery time. The inhibitory effect of dexamethasone on inflammation could also prevent some undesirable neuropsychological adverse events such as cognitive dysfunction, delirium, and even stroke[<xref rid="pone.0152308.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0152308.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Until now, no specific study have evaluated the possible effects of dexamethasone on the incidence of POCD in patients undergoing general surgery.</p><p>Although some controversy remains, several authors were able to demonstrate a relationship between the degree of cognitive dysfunction and S100&#x003b2; protein[<xref rid="pone.0152308.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0152308.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], which is consistent with our present findings. In the present study, S100&#x003b2; postoperative injuries serum levels were significantly elevated after surgery regardless BIS values. The glial cells are activated, In the early stages of brain injury, and S100&#x003b2; is released into blood circulation[<xref rid="pone.0152308.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The dexamethasone group presented a smaller incidence of cognitive dysfunction. During surgical procedures without direct brain involvement; S100B increase might be due a variety of clinical states that might cause BBB disruption[<xref rid="pone.0152308.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0152308.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>In our study, an enormous neuropsychological battery evaluated the cognitive function. Some cognitive functions are assessed by more than one test. So, we have chosen a specific test for each cognitive function evaluation. It is not a big limitation but a concern regarding data analysis. We have tried to avoid data duplication that might lead to an overestimation of cognitive function impairment. For example, the selective attention was evaluated only by TMT-A. The long-term memory was assessed only by VLT.</p><p>Our study found significant differences between groups concerning the BIS values. POCD incidence was increased in BIS 46&#x02013;55 compared to BIS 35&#x02013;45. The data also showed a more rapid cognitive function restoration in the last group, mainly in the group that received dexamethasone. We can suggest that anesthesia depth might influence the POCD grade and its recovery. Some other studies have shown that superficial anesthesia may benefit the patient and prevent postoperative cognitive dysfunction[<xref rid="pone.0152308.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0152308.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>Although our study demonstrated the benefit of dexamethasone associated with BIS 46&#x02013;55 regarding prevention of cognitive dysfunction, other factors should be investigated. Demographic data might have a significant influence on cognitive reserve. People with a higher educational level tend to be healthier than people with a lower educational level old age, and comorbidities may contribute as risk factors for POCD. Cognitive decline is inevitable during the aging process, but this impairment may also be associated with surgery and anesthesia.</p><p>One limitation of the current study was the loss of follow-up for some patients. Sometimes, they were not able to attend the assessments face to face in the hospital.</p><p>In conclusion, dexamethasone when administered with BIS 46&#x02013;55 can help to preserve most cognitive functions in surgery. Additional studies could contribute to defining the neuroprotective properties of dexamethasone in the prevention of postoperative cognitive dysfunction in patients undergoing surgery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec011"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0152308.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>CAPpesq appoval.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0152308.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0152308.s002"><label>S2 File</label><caption><title>Cappesq_no99806_Disfuncao_Cognitiva-TODOS_OS_DOCUMENTOS 5.</title><p>(ZIP)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0152308.s002.zip"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0152308.s003"><label>S3 File</label><caption><title>CONSORT Checklist Completed 021216.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0152308.s003.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We wish to thank the timely help given by professor Lars Simon Rasmussen, University of Copenhagen in the support with the neuropsychologic battery that we applied in our study.</p><p>We also would like to thank professor Terri Monk, Duke University in the support with the neuropsychological battery analysis and in interpreting the results of our study.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0152308.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Newman</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Stygall</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Hirani</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Shaefi</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Maze</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name> (<year>2007</year>) <article-title>Postoperative cognitive dysfunction after noncardiac surgery: a systematic review</article-title>. <source>Anesthesiology</source>
