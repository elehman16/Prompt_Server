There are widely recognised failures to introduce effective new clinical practices quickly enough, consistently use those already proven to be effective or stop those found to be ineffective or even harmful. The gap between evidence and practice is an important problem for policy-makers, healthcare systems and research funders because it limits the health, social and economic impacts of clinical research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Dissemination of best practice is necessary but seldom sufficient by itself to ensure implementation.</p><p id="Par37">The context of general practice in the United Kingdom (UK) presents particular implementation challenges&#x02014;given the limited practice organisational capacity, the increasing complexity of care and the dispersed and independent nature of practices. Many implementation studies focus on one condition (e.g. depression, back pain). This limits generalisability; it is uncertain how an intervention developed for one clinical condition will work for another [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In 2012, we identified 107 clinical guidelines relevant to general practice produced by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. It is impracticable and inefficient to invent an implementation strategy for every new guideline. Implementation strategies are required which can be adapted to a range of targeted problems and sustainably integrated into available primary care systems and resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par38">Action to Support Practices Implement Research Evidence (ASPIRE) is a research programme that aims to develop and evaluate an adaptable intervention package to target implementation of &#x02018;high impact&#x02019; clinical practice recommendations in general practice. ASPIRE comprises five, sequential work packages:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par39">Screening of NICE guidelines and associated quality standards to derive a set of &#x02018;high impact&#x02019; indicators based on burden of illness, potential for significant patient benefit from improved practice, likelihood of cost savings without patient harm and feasibility of measuring change using routinely collected data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par40">Cross-sectional analysis of patient data to identify high impact recommendations with greatest scope for improvement (low adherence) and explore variations in adherence.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par41">Interviews with primary care professionals to explore barriers to and enablers of adherence to selected high impact recommendations, matching of behaviour change techniques to identified barriers and enablers and development of an adaptable intervention package (based on audit and feedback, outreach educational visits and computerised prompts).</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par42">Evaluation of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the adapted intervention package in targeting the implementation of high impact recommendations.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par43">Conduct of a parallel process evaluation to examine intervention delivery, mechanisms of action and unintended consequences.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p id="Par44">This protocol paper describes the randomised evaluation and summarises the process evaluation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design and setting</title><p id="Par45">We are conducting a pair of pragmatic cluster-randomised trials with general practices as the unit of allocation. Cluster randomisation was chosen because the intervention is delivered at the practice level and aims to change clinical practice of the whole practice team. Balanced incomplete block designs equalise Hawthorne effects whilst maximising power and efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and also reduce the risk of overburdening practices through exposure to more than one intervention. In trial 1, practices will be randomised to adapted intervention packages targeting either diabetes control or risky prescribing. In trial 2, practices will be randomised to adapted intervention packages targeting either blood pressure control in patients at high risk of cardiovascular events or anticoagulation in atrial fibrillation. The balanced incomplete block design has two treatment arms per trial. Within both trials, all intervention packages were assumed to be independent in terms of their outcomes and each treatment arm will therefore be used as the control arm for the other treatment arm in the same trial&#x000a0;(Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> detail a full CONSORT checklist). We are also including a fifth, non-intervention control group to further assess Hawthorne effects. Practices allocated to this arm will not receive any of the ASPIRE interventions, but we will examine outcomes via the same routinely collected data.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>CONSORT 2010 checklist of information to include when reporting a cluster randomised trial</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13012_2016_387_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>
</p><p id="Par46">The study is set within West Yorkshire, which covers a socioeconomically and ethnically diverse population of approximately 2.2 million residents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Around 330 general practices are organised within 10 clinical commissioning groups (CCGs), which have roles including the purchasing of specialist services and improving quality of primary care.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Participants</title><p id="Par47">General practices are eligible if they used the <italic>SystmOne</italic> computerised clinical system (TPP, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.tpp-uk.com/">http://www.tpp-uk.com/</ext-link>). Approximately two thirds of West Yorkshire practices use <italic>SystmOne</italic>. The use of a single system simplifies the process of data extraction and of implementing software support. We will exclude practices which had been involved in earlier stages of intervention development and piloting. We will also exclude from trial 2 practices in one CCG involved in a concurrent initiative addressing anticoagulation in atrial fibrillation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Recruitment and consent</title><p id="Par48">Following consultations with our Programme Steering Group, our Public and Patient Involvement Panel and all 10 CCGs, we will use an &#x02018;opt-out&#x02019; approach to recruit and consent general practices. Apart from facilitating the recruitment process, we judge that opt-out recruitment will enhance pragmatism and hence generalisability by resembling recruitment processes typically used by routine quality improvement initiatives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. We will send all eligible practices an invitation and information sheet via email. This outlines the purpose of the trial and what involvement entails and states that practices will be included unless they indicate otherwise. We will follow this with a duplicate pack (including a Freepost return envelope to return the opt-out notification) sent via recorded postal delivery. After 2&#x000a0;weeks, we will send reminders by both email and recorded postal delivery to all non-responding practices. Four weeks post-initial invitation, we will consider all practices which have not opted-out to have consented to participate. Patient-level consent is not required as all patient-level data are anonymised.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Intervention</title><p id="Par49">We broadly conceptualise the implementation intervention as comprising a range of behaviour change techniques (e.g. social comparison, information on health consequences, action planning). These will be embedded within a package based around three delivery mechanisms that possess a known evidence base and are increasingly central to routine implementation activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]: audit and feedback [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], educational outreach visits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and computerised prompts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. We have further developed the packages iteratively through a series of exchanges with our professional and patient advisory groups and piloting in five general practices.</p><p id="Par50">Following earlier work and consultations with professional and patient advisory groups, we decided to target the implementation of four high impact indicators:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par51">Control of HbA1c, blood pressure and cholesterol in type 2 diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par52">Risky prescribing, largely focusing on avoiding adverse effects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and anti-platelet drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par53">Control of blood pressure in people at high risk of cardiovascular events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par54">Anticoagulation in people with atrial fibrillation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p></list-item></list>
</p><p id="Par55">We conducted semi-structured interviews with primary care professionals based on the Theoretical Domains Framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] to explore barriers and enablers to achieving the above indicators. For each indicator, we matched behaviour change techniques targeting clinicians to the most salient barriers and enablers and embedded them within intervention packages.</p><p id="Par56">In brief, the audit and feedback component will comprise quarterly reports individualised for each practice and presenting their performance against targeted clinical indicators, together with motivational messages based on key theoretical domains identified by our qualitative research. The educational outreach visits will be delivered by trained pharmacist facilitators and involve discussion of practice performance and development of action plans. The computerised support will include modified versions of the searches used to prepare the audit reports and, for risky prescribing only, automated messages triggered by potentially risky prescribing combinations. We will also offer practices up to 2&#x000a0;days of additional pharmacist support. The nature of this support will be decided in discussion with practice but can include review of patient notes or modification of computerised searches to identify specific patient groups to invite for consultation. All practices in the intervention arms will be sent electronic and postal copies of the feedback reports. They will also be offered educational outreach, additional pharmacist support, searches to identify patients and, where applicable, computerised prompts. Given the pragmatic nature of these trials, the acceptance and engagement with all components is optional.
