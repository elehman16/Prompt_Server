Ocular injuries which result in visual loss invariably affect the posterior segment of the eye, and prevention of visual loss involves posterior segment (vitreoretinal) surgery. Despite improvements in vitreoretinal surgical techniques, outcomes in these patients remain unsatisfactory, and development of the intraocular scarring response proliferative vitreoretinopathy is the leading cause. Proliferative vitreoretinopathy is the most common cause of recurrent retinal detachment in these eyes; it is reported to occur in up to 45&#x000a0;% of cases.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>The Adjunctive Steroid Combination in Ocular Trauma (ASCOT) trial is a multi-centre, double-masked, parallel-arm randomised controlled trial with an internal pilot designed to investigate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of using intravitreal and sub-Tenon&#x02019;s triamcinolone acetonide peri-operatively in patients undergoing vitrectomy following open globe trauma. In total, 300 eyes of 300 patients will be recruited and randomly allocated to one of two treatment groups. Both groups will receive standard surgical treatment and routine pre-operative and post-operative treatment and care. The treatment group will receive an adjunctive peri-operative steroid combination (triamcinolone acetonide) consisting of 4&#x000a0;mg/0.1&#x000a0;ml into the vitreous cavity and 40&#x000a0;mg/1&#x000a0;ml into the sub-Tenon&#x02019;s space. The trial incorporates a two-stage internal pilot to examine projected recruitment and retention rates. Progression criteria from the internal pilot study will enable us to determine whether to undertake the main trial. Patients and primary outcome assessors will be masked to treatment allocation. The primary outcome will be an improvement from baseline to 6&#x000a0;months of at least 10 on the corrected visual acuity as measured by ETDRS letter score. Secondary outcomes will be development of scarring, retinal detachment, intraocular pressure abnormalities, quality of life and public sector service use.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This is the first powered, controlled clinical trial to investigate the use of adjunctive triamcinolone in patients undergoing vitrectomy following open globe trauma.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/trial/2014-002193-37/GB">EudraCT2014-002193-37</ext-link>.

Globally, it has been estimated that 1.6 million people are blind as a result of ocular trauma, with 2.3 million having bilateral low vision [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Ocular trauma is the most common cause of unilateral blindness in the world today, with up to 19 million individuals having unilateral blindness or low vision [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. It is estimated that almost 1 million people in the United States live with trauma-related visual impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Ocular trauma has extensive socio-economic costs: Patients with open globe injuries lose a mean of 70&#x000a0;days of work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In the United States, work-related eye injuries costs over $300 million per year (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.preventblindness.org/">http://www.preventblindness.org/</ext-link>), which equates to an annual cost to the U.K. economy (for which no comparable data exist) of &#x000a3;37.5 million.</p><p>In the United Kingdom, it is estimated that 5000 patients per year sustain eye injuries serious enough to require hospital admission, and that 250 of these will be permanently blind in the injured eye [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Recent European studies document incidences of 2.4 and 3.2 per 100,000 per year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] for open globe injuries, which suggests an annual incidence of between 1500 and 2000 for the United Kingdom.</p><p>Ocular injuries which result in visual loss frequently affect the posterior segment of the eye, and prevention of visual loss involves posterior segment (vitreoretinal) surgery. It is clear on the basis of recent published data that, although vitreoretinal surgical techniques have improved, outcomes remain unsatisfactory, and development of the intraocular scarring response proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) is the leading cause of this [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Proliferative vitreoretinopathy</title><p>Eyes sustaining penetrating or open globe trauma (OGT) are at high risk of severe visual impairment. Retinal detachment is common in these eyes, and multiple surgical interventions are often necessary. PVR is the most common cause of recurrent retinal detachment and visual loss in eyes with OGT. It is documented to occur in 10&#x02013;45&#x000a0;% of all OGT cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], its incidence varying with the nature of the penetrating injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>PVR is a process of fibrocellular scar tissue formation, which complicates 5&#x02013;12&#x000a0;% of cases of primary retinal detachment, 16&#x02013;41&#x000a0;% of cases of giant retinal tears and 10&#x02013;45&#x000a0;% of cases of posterior segment trauma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. PVR represents a difficult vitreoretinal surgical challenge, and, although final retinal attachment may now be achieved, multiple surgeries are needed in many cases and visual results are frequently poor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Binocular vision outcomes are notably unsatisfactory in PVR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. PVR management is costly in terms of patient time and healthcare resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Experimental data</title><p>Clinical observations and laboratory investigations undertaken on eyes with PVR and surgical specimens have identified potential targets for pharmacological adjuncts to surgical management of PVR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The cellular components of PVR peri-retinal membranes (retinal pigment epithelial, glial, inflammatory and fibroblastic cells) proliferate and may also be contractile, and they are thus targets for anti-proliferative agents. There is a notable inflammatory component to the PVR process, with marked blood-retinal barrier breakdown and a greater tendency to intraocular fibrin formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Macrophages and T lymphocytes have been identified in PVR membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], and, although relatively small in number, they may play an important role in membrane development and contraction through growth factor production. Thus, both cellular proliferation and the intraocular inflammatory response are realistic targets for adjunctive treatments in PVR.</p><p>Corticosteroid treatment can potentially influence both the inflammatory and proliferative components of PVR. Experimental work has suggested that the corticosteroid triamcinolone acetonide can reduce the severity of PVR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In addition, it has been demonstrated that peri-ocular corticosteroids can reduce the severity of experimental PVR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Laboratory work has also demonstrated that triamcinolone appears to have no significant retinal toxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], although in vitro it downregulates the proliferation of retinal cells.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Clinical data</title><p>Clinically, intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide (IVTA) has recently been extensively used to treat macular oedema, intraocular inflammation and sub-retinal neovascularisation without demonstrable retinal toxicity, but with a notable incidence of raised intraocular pressure (IOP) and cataracts. Previous small-scale, uncontrolled clinical studies of PVR have suggested that systemic prednisolone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], infused dexamethasone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and IVTA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] may reduce the severity of PVR. An external, single-centre pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT) investigating intravitreal and sub-Tenon&#x02019;s triamcinolone as an adjunctive treatment in eyes undergoing pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) following OGT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] suggested an improved visual outcome in eyes receiving adjunctive corticosteroid treatment and supported an adequately powered RCT to provide a definitive answer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Investigational medicinal product triamcinolone acetonide</title><p>Triamcinolone is a hydrophobic, long-acting corticosteroid which is licensed for intra-articular use to treat arthritis and for intramuscular use in a variety of systemic inflammatory conditions. Ophthalmologists have experience using triamcinolone off-license via peri-ocular administration for over 50&#x000a0;years, with administration via the intraocular route adopted for over 30&#x000a0;years. It has been used to treat a variety of posterior segment ocular inflammatory pathologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Its use to visualise the posterior hyaloid during PPV has been well established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Additionally, IVTA has been found to reduce post-operative inflammation following vitrectomy surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].

As the study intervention remains investigational, in patients with bilateral eye injuries, the eye with the worse injury (i.e., the eye with the poorest visual potential according to the clinician&#x02019;s discretion) will be considered as the study eye for randomisation, and the better eye will receive standard treatment.

In the external pilot trial, the majority of patients (35 of 40) had a score of 0 for VA baseline values, and the shape of the distribution of VA at 6&#x000a0;months was non-identical between the treatment group and the control group. Both of these factors impact the choice of suitable methods for analysis and thus an appropriate approach to calculating the sample size.</p><p>As a result of a small mean difference and non-identical distributions observed in VA between treatment groups in the external pilot study, we chose to define the primary outcome to be a clinically meaningful improvement in VA of 10 letters or more in the treatment group.

Operating surgeons will be encouraged to anticipate this occurrence and communicate this to the reviewing team in the immediate post-operative period. However, it is possible (although unlikely) that patients may attend a unit other than their study site within the early post-operative period. In this circumstance, a treating clinician should be made aware of the patient&#x02019;s treatment allocation if the patient suspects a diagnosis of endophthalmitis, such that (1) the patient is not subjected to unnecessary invasive interventions where the findings are of an innocuous pseudohypopyon or (2) urgent treatment is withheld under the false premise that the observed hypopyon is a pseudohypopyon.</p><p>The study code should be broken only for valid medical or safety reasons highlighted in the circumstances above where it is necessary for the investigator or treating healthcare professional to know which treatment the patient is receiving before the patient can be treated as per standard clinical care.

We will specifically analyse the influence of the study intervention on VA, the incidence of retinal detachment and the development of scarring (proliferative vitreoretinopathy) in patients with OGT. Side effects and complications will be monitored and reported. We will undertake QoL assessments of the study patients, and a cost-effectiveness analysis will be carried out.</p><p>We have based the projected recruitment on data derived from the external pilot study at the principal study site, in addition to projections provided by participating sites following local internal audits. Due to the poor prognosis associated with current standard treatment, we expect a high recruitment uptake following successful eligibility screening as observed in the external pilot. However, we have designed the study with a two-stage internal pilot to assess recruitment and retention. Progression criteria for each stage of the internal pilot will determine the decision whether to undertake the main trial, and data from this two-stage internal pilot will contribute to the final analysis.</p><p>We accept that, as our eligibility criteria are inclusive and relatively unrestricted, it is likely that the cohort will be a heterogeneous group. The severity of open globe injury may range from a relatively minor injury at one end of the spectrum (i.e., a small anterior corneal wound and secondary lens capsule breach requiring a posterior vitreolensectomy) to a severe posterior globe rupture with total retinal detachment and extensive suprachoroidal haemorrhage. However, we expect the adequacy of randomisation to compensate for this and shall acknowledge any unequal weighting within the groups as limitations of the study. However, we accept that we may limit our sensitivity analysis to small differences between the two groups.</p><p>The authors have designed the study to reduce investigator bias by masking the primary outcome assessors, the patients and the operating surgeons (until the point of randomisation). The investigators are not formally masked to the treatment allocations, as the IMP is sometimes visible on posterior chamber assessment for up to 4&#x000a0;weeks. However, data entry points for secondary outcomes are at 3 and 6&#x000a0;months post-injection, and thus knowledge of individual patients&#x02019; treatment allocation at these time points is unlikely.</p><p>In summary, this is the first powered RCT to investigate the use of triamcinolone in patients undergoing vitrectomy surgery following OGT, with an accompanying economic evaluation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec40"><title>Trial status</title><p>The authors confirm that the trial remained in active recruitment&#x000a0;as of the 14th July 2016.</p></sec><sec id="Sec41"><title>Abbreviations</title><p>AE, adverse event; AR, adverse reaction; CI, chief investigator; CONSORT, Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials; CRF, Case Report Form; CSRI, Client Service Receipt Inventory; DMEC, Data Monitoring and Ethics Committee; eCRF, electronic Case Report Form; ESMS, Emergency Scientific and Medical Services; ETDRS, Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study; GCP, good clinical practice; IMP, investigational medicinal product; IOP, intraocular pressure; IVTA, intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide; KCTU, King&#x02019;s Clinical Trials Unit; MHRA, Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency; NIMP, non-investigational medicinal product; OGT, open globe trauma; PI, principal investigator; PIN, patient identification number; PPV, pars plana vitrectomy; PVR, proliferative vitreoretinopathy; QALY, quality-adjusted life-year; QoL, quality of life; RCT, randomised controlled trial; REC, research ethics committee; SAR, serious adverse reaction; SAE, Serious adverse event; SOP, standard operating procedure; SPIRIT, Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials; SUSAR, suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction; TMG, Trial Management Group; TSC, Trial Steering Committee; VA, visual acuity; VFQ-25, 25-item Visual Function Questionnaire</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec42"><title>Additional file</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="13063_2016_1445_MOESM1_ESM.doc" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>SPIRIT 2013 Checklist: recommended items to address in a clinical trial protocol and related documents.
