Herceptin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> is approved for use in the United States (US), the European Union (EU), Japan, and much of the rest of the world for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer, early breast cancer, and metastatic gastric cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], and is the standard of care for subjects with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-overexpressing breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Trastuzumab and ABP 980 are produced by recombinant DNA technology in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and both monoclonal anti-bodies (mAbs) bind with high affinity and specificity to the extracellular domain of the HER2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Binding of trastuzumab to HER2 blocks receptor activation and subsequent proliferation of HER2-overexpressing cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In addition to blocking HER2-mediated proliferation, binding of trastuzumab to HER2 elicits anti-body-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) by binding to antigens expressed on target cells, while the anti-body Fc domain engages Fc receptors (e.g., Fc&#x003b3;RIIIa) on the surface of immune effector cells. This binding sequence leads to the activation of the effector cell, granule exocytosis, and target cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>There is increasing interest in biosimilars as alternatives to their respective reference products, since they can provide additional safe and efficacious treatment options for patients. A biosimilar is a biologic product that is similar to a reference product with respect to quality, safety, and efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Biosimilars are likely to have differences in product quality attributes owing to differences in cellular expression systems, processes, and product purification processes but should not have clinically meaningful differences with respect to safety, purity, and potency. Guidelines describing non-clinical and clinical considerations for the development of biosimilars, including mAbs, were issued by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2012 and 2014 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], and by the United States Department of Health and Human Services and its Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2014 and 2015 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>Both FDA and EMA guidelines are similar in that each recommends a stepwise approach beginning with comprehensive analytical characterization to establish structural and functional similarity of the biosimilar with the reference or innovator product, followed by a pharmacokinetic (PK) study and a pharmacodynamic (PD) study, if a suitable PD marker is available, to establish equivalence. Finally, a comparative clinical study is conducted in a sensitive population to confirm similar efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of the proposed biosimilar to the reference product.</p><p>ABP 980 is being developed for the same indications, dosages, and route of administration as trastuzumab. Previous studies have shown that ABP 980 has the same amino acid sequence and is analytically and functionally similar to trastuzumab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. This Phase I, single-dose, PK study in healthy male subjects was conducted to determine the PK equivalence of ABP 980 to US FDA-licensed trastuzumab and EU-authorized trastuzumab, hereafter referred to as trastuzumab (US) and trastuzumab (EU), respectively. The secondary objectives were to compare the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of ABP 980, trastuzumab (US), and trastuzumab (EU). Finally, to establish a scientific bridge between reference products sourced from the US and the EU, the PK equivalence between trastuzumab (US) and trastuzumab (EU) was evaluated.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>This study was conducted in accordance with the provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki and in accordance with the ICH E6 Guidelines on Good Clinical Practice.

(Thousand Oaks, CA, USA). Trastuzumab (US) was sourced from Genentech, Inc. (South San Francisco, CA, USA), and trastuzumab (EU) was sourced from Roche Pharma AG (Grenzach-Wyhlen, Germany). ABP 980 and trastuzumab (US) were supplied in vials containing 440&#x000a0;mg of investigational product, and trastuzumab (EU) was supplied in vials containing 150&#x000a0;mg of investigational product. All investigational products were reconstituted to 21&#x000a0;mg/mL. The protein content of each of the drug lots obtained by the clinical sites was evaluated by Amgen, Inc. No adjustment to dosage was necessary as the differences in protein content between formulations were determined to be less than 5%.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study design and subject population</title><p>This randomized, single-blind, single-dose, three-arm, parallel-group study in healthy adult males was conducted at a single center (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

Additional exclusion criteria included a history or evidence of a clinically significant disorder, condition, or disease that could pose a risk to subject safety or interfere with the study; history or presence of conditions known to interfere with the distribution, metabolism, or excretion of drugs; history of surgery or major trauma within 12&#x000a0;weeks of screening, or surgery planned during the study; prior exposure to trastuzumab or related compounds; known or suspected sensitivity to products derived from mammalian cell lines; and subjects who were receiving or had received any investigational drug, device, or medication (prescription or over-the-counter) within 30&#x000a0;days or 5 half-lives (whichever was longer) of receiving study medication.</p><p>Subjects were screened and informed consent was obtained within 28&#x000a0;days of treatment administration. Day-1 assessment included medical history, physical examination, vital signs, and body weight. Body weight on Day-1 was used to calculate dose.

They were discharged on Day 2 after the 24-h assessments were completed. Subjects returned to the CPU on Days 3, 5, 9, 15, 22, 29, 36, 43, and 50, and Day 64 [end-of-study (EOS) visit] for safety evaluations and PK assessments.

Blood sampling for PK analysis during each return visit to the CPU, including the EOS visit, occurred per the scheduled timepoint.</p><p>A validated electrochemiluminescence (ECL) assay was used to quantify serum concentrations of ABP 980 and trastuzumab using a mouse anti-trastuzumab monoclonal anti-body (mAb) to capture the investigational product. After capturing ABP 980 or trastuzumab to the immobilized anti-body, unbound materials were removed, followed by the addition of ruthenium labeled mouse anti-trastuzumab mAb to detect the captured ABP 980 or trastuzumab. A tripropylamine buffer was added to enhance the electrochemiluminescent signals. The ECL counts were directly proportional to the amount of ABP 980 or trastuzumab bound by the capture reagent. Conversion of ECL counts to concentrations was performed using the Gen5&#x02122; Secure Software v1.08.</p><p>Safety and tolerability were reviewed by the medical monitor on an ongoing basis.

Treatment-emergent AEs were reported in 42 (84.0%) subjects in the ABP 980 group, 39 (75.0%) subjects in the trastuzumab (US) group, and 43 (78.2%) subjects in the trastuzumab (EU) group. The majority of TEAEs were mild to moderate in severity. Treatment-related AEs (i.e., TEAEs assessed as possibly or probably related to study drug) were reported in 33 (66.0%), 33 (63.5%), and 39 (70.9%) subjects in the ABP 980, trastuzumab (US), and trastuzumab (EU) groups, respectively.</p><p>There were no deaths or life-threatening TEAEs or TEAEs leading to study discontinuation. Two subjects reported TEAEs rated as severe; one subject in the trastuzumab (EU) group had an SAE of infusion-related reaction that was considered probably related to study drug; and one subject in the trastuzumab (US) group had multiple SAEs resulting from a motor bike accident, including pulmonary embolism secondary to deep vein thrombosis, not related to study medication. None of the SAEs resulted in premature study discontinuation.</p><p>The most frequently reported TEAEs (reported in &#x0003e;5% of subjects in any treatment group) were headache, upper respiratory tract infection, chills, pyrexia, myalgia, nausea, epistaxis, arthralgia, and lethargy (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>).

Study enrollment was restricted to healthy male subjects, because healthy subjects should provide the most homogenous population for sensitive comparisons of the PK of ABP 980 and trastuzumab. The dose and sampling schedule chosen in this study were based on a previous study of trastuzumab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. A dose of 6&#x000a0;mg/kg provided sufficient exposure to study medication for an accurate evaluation of PK in healthy subjects within the dose range with linear kinetics and is, therefore, appropriate to detect potential PK differences between ABP 980, trastuzumab (US), and trastuzumab (EU). A dose of 6&#x000a0;mg/kg is also consistent with the prescribing instructions for Herceptin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Based on <italic>t</italic>
<sub>&#x000bd;</sub> of 6&#x02013;6.8&#x000a0;days in healthy males in a prior pilot study for ABP 980 and trastuzumab (EU), 64&#x000a0;days of PK sampling post-infusion was considered sufficient to fully characterize the ABP 980 or trastuzumab PK profiles in healthy subjects.</p><p>This study was conducted to meet FDA and EMA guidelines for the development and approval of biosimilar agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Both agencies recommend a stepwise developmental approach designed to determine the similarity of the proposed biosimilar to the reference product with respect to physicochemical and functional characteristics, PK profile, and clinical efficacy, safety, and tolerability. The analytical and functional similarity of ABP 980 to trastuzumab sourced from the USA and EU has been extensively studied, and the results have been reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. ABP 980 was shown to be similar to trastuzumab (US) and trastuzumab (EU) with respect to primary and higher order structure, HER2 binding affinity, inhibition of proliferation, and in vitro anti-body-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. The results of this study further support that ABP 980 is similar to trastuzumab by demonstrating equivalence of ABP 980 to both trastuzumab (US) and trastuzumab (EU) with respect to PK profile.</p><p>A single 6&#x000a0;mg/kg IV infusion of ABP 980 in healthy male subjects resulted in a similar PK profile to both trastuzumab (US) and trastuzumab (EU) with respect to the primary PK parameters of AUC<sub>inf</sub> and <italic>C</italic>
<sub>max</sub>. For both PK parameters, the 90% CIs were contained within the prespecified standard equivalence margin of 0.8&#x02013;1.25. The safety and tolerability of ABP 980, trastuzumab (US), and trastuzumab (EU) also were comparable and consistent with what is known for trastuzumab. No new or unexpected safety signals were noted.</p><p>The study design used here also allowed a direct comparison between trastuzumab (US) and trastuzumab (EU). Direct comparison between reference products sourced from different regions also has important regulatory and clinical implications. Strong evidence for similarity between ABP 980 and trastuzumab, based on comprehensive analytical and functional assessment, is necessary to support clinical studies and ultimately extrapolation to all approved trastuzumab indications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The FDA and EMA have each developed guidelines that allow the use of foreign-sourced reference products in comparative clinical trials provided that there is sufficient scientific evidence demonstrating similarity between the foreign-sourced and locally-sourced reference products. In this three-arm study, the 90% CIs for AUC<sub>inf</sub> and <italic>C</italic>
<sub>max</sub> were within the equivalence margin of 0.8 to 1.25 for trastuzumab (US) versus trastuzumab (EU), hence established PK bioequivalence between USA-sourced trastuzumab and EU-sourced trastuzumab, which is a required component to establish a scientific bridge between USA-sourced and EU-sourced trastuzumab, thus allowing use of one reference product in comparative Phase III clinical trials. Safety and tolerability also were comparable between trastuzumab (US) versus trastuzumab (EU).</p><p>As with all biologic agents, the risk for developing binding or neutralizing ADAs must be carefully assessed. In this study, immunogenicity was evaluated by assaying blood samples for the presence of binding or neutralizing ABAs on Day 1 before infusion and at the end-of-study visit. No subject in any treatment arm developed ADAs. This finding is consistent with previous studies demonstrating a low incidence of ADAs with trastuzumab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>In conclusion, in this Phase I study, there were no differences between ABP 980, trastuzumab (US), and trastuzumab (EU) with respect to PK profile, safety, and tolerability after a single IV infusion. No subject tested positive for binding ADAs. In addition to the results of structural and functional characterization, these results provide further support that the proposed biosimilar ABP 980 is highly similar to FDA-licensed and EU-authorized trastuzumab reference products.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Medical writing support was provided by Pasquale Iannuzzelli, Ph.D. (Innovation Communications Group) under the direction of Monica Ramchandani, Ph.D. (Amgen, Inc.).</p></ack><notes notes-type="COI-statement"><title>Compliance with ethical standards</title><sec id="FPar1"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>Vladimir Hanes, Vincent Chow, Nan Zhang, and Richard Markus are employees and stockholders of Amgen Inc.</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Ethical approval</title><p>All procedures performed in studies involving human participants were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and/or national research committee and with the 1964 Helsinki declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards.
