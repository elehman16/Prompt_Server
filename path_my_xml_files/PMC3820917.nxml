Empirical studies as well as neurobiological findings have supported the distinction of complex PTSD from &#x0201c;simple&#x0201d; PTSD (Thomaes et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0033">2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0032">2013</xref>; Van Der Kolk, Roth, Pelcovitz, Sunday, &#x00026; Spinazzola, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0034">2005</xref>).</p><p>Standard trauma-focused cognitive behavioral treatment has proven to be effective for PTSD (Bradley, Greene, Russ, Dutra, &#x00026; Westen, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0003">2005</xref>; Foa, Keane, Friedman, &#x00026; Cohen, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0017">2009</xref>), although drop-out rates in these studies are high (approximately 30%). In contrast, the effectiveness of treatments for child-abuse-related complex PTSD or PTSD with personality disorder (PD), has not been well studied (Bradley et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0004">2005</xref>; Cloitre, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0006">2009</xref>). Some data suggest that immediate trauma-focused treatment may be less efficacious and less well tolerated in these populations (Ehlers et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0014">1998</xref>; Ford &#x00026; Kidd, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0018">1998</xref>; McDonagh et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0023">2005</xref>; Tarrier et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0031">1999</xref>; Van Der Kolk et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0035">2007</xref>).</p><p>There is a clinical need for suitable treatments for patients with child-abuse-related complex PTSD. Stabilizing treatment addresses additional sequelae-like affect-dysregulation before the start of trauma focused CBT (Chard, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0004">2005</xref>; Cloitre et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0008">2010</xref>; Dorrepaal et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0013">2012b</xref>; Zlotnick et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0040">1997</xref>). Such a phase-based approach as advocated by experts (Cloitre et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0007">2011</xref>) aims at integrating the potentially complementary advantages of exposure-based methods with the benefits of affect-management models while limiting potential drawbacks of both treatments separately.</p><p>However, although tailoring treatment may thus be clinically relevant, child-abuse-related complex PTSD shows high inter-subject variability in psychiatric co-morbidity. Some patients have internalizing personality traits and may present themselves as inhibited, anxious and withdrawn, whereas others with externalizing personality characteristics appear disinhibited, angry, and affect-dysregulated (Allen, Huntoon, &#x00026; Evans, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0002">1999</xref>; Miller &#x00026; Resick, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0024">2007</xref>). Such co-morbid personality disturbances may explain differences in treatment results (Allen, Coyne, &#x00026; Huntoon, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0001">1998</xref>; Hyer, Davis, Albrecht, Boudewyns, &#x00026; Woods, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0020">1994</xref>; Talbot, Duberstein, Butzel, Cox, &#x00026; Giles, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0030">2003</xref>).</p><p>In a previous study (Dorrepaal et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0012">2012a</xref>) we reported a cluster analysis of PD symptoms, which resulted in five complex PTSD subtypes. First, we identified a relatively &#x0201c;adaptive&#x0201d; subtype associated with the fewest PD symptoms. The non-adaptive subgroups differed on dimensions of &#x0201c;introversion&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;disinhibition&#x0201d; resulting in four non-adaptive subgroups. Of these, the &#x0201c;withdrawn&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;aggressive&#x0201d; subtypes showed the most qualitatively distinct patterns, prototypical for &#x0201c;internalizers&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;externalizers,&#x0201d; respectively.</p><p>In this study, we aimed to investigate whether these subtypes differed with respect to (1) compliance as well as (2) improvement when treated with a 20-week stabilizing group cognitive behavioral treatment (CBT). We expected that the &#x0201c;adaptive&#x0201d; patients would show the lowest drop-out rate and that the &#x0201c;non-adaptive&#x0201d; patients in the &#x0201c;aggressive&#x0201d; subgroup would show the highest drop-out rate, since all these patients met the criteria for a co-morbid borderline PD. Furthermore, we expected that the &#x0201c;withdrawn&#x0201d; patients, who were most self-defeating, would show poor treatment outcome.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="S0001"><title>Method</title><sec id="S20002"><title>Study design randomized controlled trial</title><p>In a multi-site, randomized controlled trial (RCT) in which a total of 71 outpatients were enrolled, two treatment conditions were compared: (1) psycho-educational and cognitive behavioral stabilizing group treatment added to treatment as usual (TAU; <italic>N</italic>=38) and (2) TAU only (<italic>N</italic>=31) (Dorrepaal et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0013">2012b</xref>). For this study, we used the data of the 38 patients with child-abuse-related complex PTSD who were treated with stabilizing group treatment across four sites.</p><sec><title>Intervention</title><p>The treatment protocol consisted of 20 weekly 2-hour meetings in addition to individual TAU (Dorrepaal, Thomaes, &#x00026; Draijer, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0012">2008</xref>). The groups consisted of 8&#x02013;12 participants and two therapists. During the first 10 sessions, psycho-education was provided, as well as registration homework to recognize &#x0201c;triggers.&#x0201d; Psycho-education aimed at attaining a sense of cognitive mastery by explaining symptoms as adaptations once necessary to emotional survival in a context of child abuse. Subsequently, intentional avoidance to acquire greater cognitive and emotional control was taught, followed by skills training to learn to tolerate negative feelings and ultimately decrease avoidance. Sessions 11&#x02013;20 contained cognitive restructuring, on topics such as problems with anger, assertiveness, bodily experiences, shame, guilt, and distrust. The group format aimed at inducing hope and reframing patients&#x02019; symptoms as normal responses to trauma, thereby reducing shame, guilt, and isolation. Taken together, increased self-regulation, more adaptive beliefs, and improved interpersonal functioning to enhance stability were goals of the treatment.</p><p>The treatment manual consisted of a highly structured, detailed session-by-session script (psycho-educational presentations on a weekly topic, related skills training, assignments, and homework pages). The material in the stabilizing group treatment consisted of a tested manual by Zlotnick et al., (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0040">1997</xref>); Wolfsdorf &#x00026; Zlotnick, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0038">2001</xref>; Zlotnick et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0039">1995</xref>). Three of the authors (Dorrepaal et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0011">2008</xref>) extended this protocol by inserting additional sessions (14&#x02013;19) to cover all symptom domains of complex PTSD.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S20004"><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>Female patients who experienced sexual and/or physical abuse before the age of 16 who met the criteria for both PTSD (DSM-IV) and complex PTSD (assessed with the Structured Interview of Disorders of Extreme Stress; SIDES, Pelcovitz et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0026">1997</xref>) were enrolled in the study. Exclusion criteria included the presence of antisocial PD, current psychotic episode, dissociative identity disorder or severe alcohol or drug dependence or abuse (likely to interfere with attendance) as assessed by Structured Clinical Interviews for DSM: SCID-I (First et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0016">1986</xref>) and SCID-D amnesia part (Steinberg, Rounsaville, &#x00026; Cicchetti, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0029">1990</xref>). Subjects currently under exposure treatment or seeking such treatment were also excluded. The Davidson Trauma Scale (DTS; Davidson, Tharwani, &#x00026; Connor, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0009">2002</xref>) was used to measure PTSD severity. The SIDES was used to assess the severity of complex PTSD. Presence and severity of PDs were assessed with the Structured Interview for DSM-IV Axis II Personality disorders (SIDP-IV) (Pfohl, Blum, &#x00026; Zimmerman, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0027">1997</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S20005"><title>Outcome RCT</title><p>After 20 weeks, both treatments were associated with significant improvement.

Our drop-out rate in patients with co-morbid PD (10%) was low compared to drop-out rates in specific PD treatments, ranging from 25 to 51% (Doering et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0010">2010</xref>). Moreover, our patients with PDs showed larger effect sizes in terms of complex PTSD symptoms compared to patients without PD.</p><p>To our knowledge, this is the first study reporting enhanced PTSD treatment compliance in a specific complex PTSD population: non-adaptive patients with co-morbid PD. Additionally, besides more severe personality pathology, the level of dissociation was higher in the non-adaptive groups as well (Dorrepaal et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0012">2012a</xref>). This might indicate overlap with the newly appeared DSM-5 dissociative subtype, also shown in neurobiological studies (e.g., Thomaes et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0033">2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0032">2013</xref>) and suggest its predictive value. Note however, that these results should be considered highly preliminary due to the small sample size. Replication of our study in a larger sample would be very useful in order to examine whether the results obtained remain stable with larger groups.</p><p>Compliance may be associated with type of treatment. Factors that may be important include first the integrated approach in which not only PTSD symptomatology but also associated pathology was a focus of the treatment. Second, the group format is presumably an important feature, and it is likely to be effective in relieving stigma, isolation, and shame, while improving social relationships and self-esteem by recognition and learning from each other. Third, the primary focus of the treatment was on stabilization by psycho-education and increasing affect regulation skills, only later followed by cognitive restructuring on directly trauma-related and interpersonal issues, which may have attributed to enhanced compliance. A comparable paced treatment schedule, starting with affect-management followed by narration and cognitive reappraisal of trauma memories has likewise been shown to be effective (Cloitre et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0008">2010</xref>). These treatments can be considered as examples of treatment extensions for patients with co-morbid PDs beyond the standard manual for Axis I disorders (Weertman, Arntz, Schouten, &#x00026; Dreessen, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0037">2005</xref>). In contrast, for many adaptive patients without co-morbid PD, the content, duration, (group) format or heterogeneous elements of stabilizing treatment may not provide a good match, thereby resulting in high drop-out rates, and other treatments may suit these patients better. Note, however, that adaptive completers reached good results indicating that (part of) this treatment may be valuable for them as well.</p><p>These results contrast sharply with previous findings on trauma-focused treatment, showing that the presence of Axis II <italic>disorders</italic> &#x02013; especially BPD &#x02013; was associated with enhanced drop-out rates (McDonagh et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0023">2005</xref>), while studies investigating borderline <italic>features</italic> (Clarke, Rizvi, &#x00026; Resick, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0005">2008</xref>; Feeny, Zoellner, &#x00026; Foa, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0015">2002</xref>; Karatzias et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0021">2007</xref>; Van Minnen, Arntz, &#x00026; Keijsers, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0036">2002</xref>) in trauma-focused treatment have found no differential drop-out rates or treatment effects, but this latter finding probably does not generalize to the more severe BP <italic>Disorder</italic> patients. Taken together, these findings indicate that trauma-focused treatment is most suitable and effective for PTSD patients without co-morbid PD, whereas stabilizing CBT is appropriate for non-adaptive child-abused patients with co-morbid PD. Axis II co-morbidity may therefore be considered a &#x0201c;prescriptive&#x0201d; variable that predicts a different pattern of treatment outcome between various treatment modalities (Olatunji, Cisler, &#x00026; Deacon, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0025">2010</xref>; Resick et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0028">2008</xref>). Future research aimed at a direct comparison of initially stabilizing versus immediate trauma-focused treatment in complex PTSD patients with co-morbid PD in terms of compliance as well as treatment effectiveness is warranted to corroborate these preliminary findings.</p><p>In conclusion, these preliminary findings may aid in providing optimal treatment to patients with child-abuse-related (complex) PTSD. When Axis II disorders are absent, drop-out risk is high in a 20-week stabilizing group CBT, whereas in patients with co-morbid Axis II diagnosis, drop-out risk is likely to be low compared to trauma-focused cognitive behavioral treatment. Such considerations would be in line with the rationale of a phased approach in Complex PTSD patients: stabilization if necessary; trauma focused if possible.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank Caron Zlotnick for granting permission to use and adapt her manual, the main interviewers Natalie Ran, Rinske de Vries, Carolijne Klunne and Monique Burger, and all the participating patients and their institutions: PsyQ (formerly GGZ Dijk en Duin), Altrecht, GGZ Noord-Holland-Noord and GGZinGeest (formerly GGZ Buitenamstel) for their participation in this study.</p></ack><sec id="S0017"><title>Conflict of interest and funding</title><p>A grant was provided by ZONMW (The Netherlands Organisation for Health Research and Development, Den Haag) under contract 100-002-024.</p></sec><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="CIT0001"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Allen</surname><given-names>J.
