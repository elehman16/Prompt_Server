Evidence of prevention of depression has not been reported in a trial in adults but may be feasible; in a recent meta-analysis synthesizing the results of 19 small prevention trials (Cuijpers <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref012">2008</xref>), the mean incidence rate ratio (IRR) of developing a depressive disorder (including postpartum depression) was 0.78 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.65&#x02013;0.93], indicating a reduction of the incidence by 22% in experimental compared to control groups.</p><p>Prevention can be considered as avoiding future illness in those already at risk although disease free or, more strictly, as avoiding future illness for all the population, not just those at immediate risk (Rose, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref030">2001</xref>), hence the term universal prevention (Gordon, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref018">1983</xref>; Mrazek &#x00026; Haggerty, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref027">1994</xref>). But how might this be achieved? A highly significant predictor of depression within adulthood is &#x02018;subthreshold&#x02019; depression (Judd <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref020">2002</xref>; Cuijpers &#x00026; Smit, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref010">2004</xref>). Depression prevention through the extension of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to at-risk adolescents who had symptoms that fell short of the threshold for case depression (Clarke <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref008">2001</xref>; Garber <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref015">2009</xref>) may be effective because subthreshold levels are highly predictive of depression (Cuijpers <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref011">2005</xref>). It is not known whether such skilful psychological approaches could also benefit a much wider range of people at risk of developing depression if delivered universally across an entire population to adults at all risk levels.</p><p>In the UK all infants and all mothers, following childbirth, receive individual care from a specialist community nurse, known as a &#x02018;Health Visitor&#x02019; (HV). In addition to supporting infant care, the HV has a role in maternal mental health that should involve establishing a relationship with the mother and the use of interpersonal and communication skills (Morrell <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref026">2009<italic>b</italic></xref>). However, such practitioners are given little more than basic mental health knowledge. Could training HVs in psychological skills benefit women under their care who were not at immediate risk? In this paper we report on the benefits for all non-depressed postnatal women randomized to receive support from primary care nurses with specialized training in psychologically informed approaches to health care, in a large pragmatic cluster randomized controlled and economic evaluation trial.</p><p>We have already reported on postnatal women in randomly allocated intervention group (IG) clusters cared for by an HV who had received additional training in postnatal mental health assessment and in one of two psychologically informed approaches that were compared to usual HV care (Morrell <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref024">2009<italic>a</italic></xref>). Clinical assessment and psychologically informed approaches were designed to be offered by intervention group HVs to women scoring positive on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) (Morrell <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref026">2009<italic>b</italic></xref>) at 8 weeks following childbirth. The EPDS is a widely used self-report measure to identify women at risk of postnatal depression (PND) with good evidence of sensitivity and specificity (Gibson <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref017">2009</xref>; Hewitt <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref019">2009</xref>) and a score ranging from 0 to 30, consisting of eight depression and two anxiety items. We compared IG care with postnatal care as usual (CAU). We showed that these scoring positive IG women were less likely than CAU women to have later depression, indicated by scoring &#x02a7e;12 on a postal EPDS at 6 months postnatally [odds ratio (OR) 0.62, 95% CI 0.04&#x02013;0.97, unadjusted <italic>p</italic>=0.036] (Morrell <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref024">2009<italic>a</italic></xref>).</p><p>The trial was also designed to assess effectiveness according to severity of depression at baseline (<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN92195776">www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN92195776</uri>). Because outcome data were obtained on all randomized and consenting women, we were able to estimate any effects on women with baseline symptom scores below the 6 weeks postnatal EPDS threshold of &#x02a7e;12 (Cox <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref009">1987</xref>). Thus, the present paper reports new, unpublished analyses of outcomes from the original treatment trial, principally for women who scored &#x0003c;12 on the postal EPDS at 6 weeks postnatally, using the same trial primary outcome: EPDS &#x02a7e;12 at 6 months. First, effects on outcomes at 6, 12 and 18 months postnatally were examined for women with an EPDS&#x0003c;12 at 6 weeks. Second, to test whether additional training of HVs was of benefit to women across a lower range of EPDS-negative scores, we compared the effectiveness in women at the lowest EPDS severity levels (EPDS&#x0003c;6 at 6 weeks) with subthreshold scoring women (6-week EPDS scores from 6 to 11). Third, we examined differences in HV care, including the use of randomly allocated face-to-face administered depression assessment, because such additional practitioner involvement could explain any observed effect on later risk of depression.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec002"><title>Method</title><p>The main pragmatic cluster randomized trial design and methods, on which the present analysis is based, are reported in detail elsewhere (Morrell <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref024">2009<italic>a</italic></xref>). The present study involved assessing outcomes for women in 101 primary care practices (clusters) (in one region of England, serving a population of 5.1 million), termed &#x02018;EPDS-negative&#x02019;, who had a postal EPDS score &#x0003c;12 at 6 weeks postnatally. Following recruitment of participating practices, an independent statistician generated the random allocation sequence using a computer randomization program (Morrell <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref024">2009<italic>a</italic></xref>). Thus, HVs registered to consenting practices were randomized either to continue to provide postnatal CAU or to an experimental IG in which all HVs received additional training in systematic assessment of depressive symptoms, establishing warm, therapeutic relationships, and in one of two distinct experimental psychologically informed approaches. Eligible antenatal women were then recruited if they were registered with participating (and therefore randomized) GP practices, aged &#x02a7e;18 years and had no severe or enduring mental health problems. HVs were asked to send these women a research information leaflet and a consent form at 36 weeks of pregnancy or 4 weeks antenatally. Women returned their signed forms to the HVs. Altogether, 4084 (53.4%) of 7649 eligible antenatal women provided written informed consent during 2003&#x02013;2004. Consenting women were sent a questionnaire at 6 weeks and 6, 12 and 18 months postnatally from the research office. Women who scored &#x02a7e;12 on their 6-week postal EPDS were regarded as EPDS positive (<italic>n</italic>=595 women in 86 clusters) and were excluded from all of the present outcomes analyses. Half of all women in the intervention clusters (including EPDS-negative women) were randomly allocated to complete a face-to-face EPDS 6 weeks postnatally to coincide with usual HV care during an existing HV contact. The intervention cluster HVs, if their clinical assessment indicated that any mother might benefit, could also offer the psychologically informed sessions to which their practice had been randomized.</p><p>Identical to the treatment trial protocol (Morrell <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref026">2009<italic>b</italic></xref>), the pretrial determined primary outcome was the proportion of women scoring &#x02a7e;12 on the EPDS at 6 months postnatally. We assumed an intra-cluster coefficient (ICC) of 0.006 (Morrell <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref026">2009<italic>b</italic></xref>) and an average cluster of practice size of 25 EPDS-negative women. Thus, 2489 women (1659 IG and 830 CAU) were required to have 80% power at the 5% two-sided level of significance, to detect a 3.5% absolute difference (10% <italic>v</italic>. 6.5%) in the proportions of 6-week EPDS-negative IG and CAU women scoring &#x02a7e;12 on the EPDS at 6 months postnatally. Clusters were allocated for the trial to one of two HV psychologically based approaches (experimental IG) or HV CAU, in a ratio of 1:1:1. The clusters were stratified by the number of expected births per cluster per year, into three groups (&#x0003c;70, 70&#x02013;100, &#x0003e;100).</p><p>The cluster level intervention comprised the package of HV training in assessment of postnatal women and identification of depressive symptoms using the EPDS and additional clinical assessment skills and establishing warm, therapeutic relationships. They were trained to deliver one of two distinct psychologically informed approaches [a cognitive-behavioral approach (CBA) and a person-centered approach (PCA)], delivered at the individual level, with the provision of additional supervisory support for the HVs (Morrell <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref026">2009<italic>b</italic></xref>). The HV-provided psychologically informed session was a one-hour visit, once a week, for a maximum of 8 weeks, commencing around 8 weeks postnatally. Sessions were offered to women who scored &#x02a7e;12 on the postal EPDS at 6 weeks and also on a face-to-face EPDS administered at 8 weeks postnatally.</p><p>IG HVs received a day of training in the identification of depression using the EPDS and clinical assessment. The group training in the pretrial preparatory phase lasted 8 days in total (including four half-days), focusing on the development of cognitive behavioral or person-centered intervention skills delivered in a group training format. A common element of the training, preceding specific approach-based skills, concerned development of empathic relationships. The training package was followed by two half-day reflective practice sessions and access to regular supervision sessions. Two experienced psychotherapist practitioner trainers delivered the training, which followed a prepared manualized form and was agreed by a training reference group composed of experienced psychotherapy trainers. HVs were asked to tape record their intervention sessions (with the women's consent) so that session treatment fidelity could be checked. From the recorded sessions available it was clear that high levels of adherence were achieved. HVs and women were also asked to complete the Agnew Relationship Measure to measure the therapeutic relationship between them. Further details of the training are available in Morrell <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref026">2009<italic>b</italic></xref>) and in findings to be reported separately.</p><p>HVs were blind to all research outcomes. Secondary outcomes were measured in all women who were followed up at 6, 12 and 18 months postnatally by postal questionnaires (including the EPDS at 6 and 12 months only). These included the 12-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12) and the SF-6D (Ware <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref037">1995</xref>), the Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation &#x02013; Outcome Measure (CORE-OM) scales (Barkham <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref001">2001</xref>) and the State&#x02013;Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI; Spielberger <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref033">1970</xref>). We used the CORE-OM as a measure of global distress as used by psychological therapy services to distinguish between clinical and general populations. We measured postnatal anxiety symptoms using the STAI (Spielberger <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref033">1970</xref>). To achieve the required sample size for the 6-month primary outcome, the recruitment phase was extended. However, the follow-up phase was not similarly extended; therefore, all the women for whom a 6-month outcome was available did not have a baby who was 1 year or 18 months old within the follow-up phase. Therefore, fewer questionnaires were administered at these time points. We requested funds to extend the recruitment phase but none were provided.</p><p>Ethical approval was received from Trent Region Multi-centre Research Ethics Committee.</p><sec id="sec002-001"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The primary comparison reported for this analysis was between eligible women in randomized IG practices <italic>versus</italic> those in CAU randomized practices, with an EPDS score &#x0003c;12 at 6 weeks postnatally in addition to a valid 6-month EPDS outcome score (<italic>n</italic>=2241 EPDS-negative women in 101 clusters). All analyses were by intention to treat with a <italic>p</italic> value &#x0003c;0.05 regarded as statistically significant. A marginal generalized linear model (GLM), with coefficients estimated using generalized estimating equations (GEEs), with robust standard errors and an exchangeable autocorrelation matrix in Stata version 11 (StataCorp, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref035">2009</xref>) was used to analyze outcomes and allow for the clustered nature of the data, with associated 95% CIs. We fitted simple unadjusted models, and also adjusted outcome comparisons for individual level covariates: living alone, history of PND, presence of stressful life events (Brugha <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref002">1985</xref>) and 6-week EPDS score, as the most widely identified significant predictors of PND (O'Hara &#x00026; Swain, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref028">1996</xref>). To test whether any intervention effect was confined to those scoring immediately below the EPDS scoring cut-off only, we performed an intervention by baseline (6-week) EPDS score statistical interaction test. This compared women grouped to baseline EPDS scores of 6&#x02013;11 with women with a baseline EPDS score &#x0003c;6. We compared 6-month outcomes according to whether women were in practices randomized for HVs to provide a face-to-face assessment at 6 weeks plus postal assessment compared to postal EPDS only. Evidence for diminished and differential health benefit over time, between the groups, was tested for in a longitudinal model by looking for evidence of an IG by time interaction. Thus, longitudinal modeling of 6, 12 and 18 months secondary outcomes, also using a marginal GLM with coefficients estimated by GEEs, was performed to examine time effects, group differences and possible time by group interactions on the secondary outcomes. The longitudinal models adjust for clustering of individual responses over time and not by practice. For the primary outcomes, the binary EPDS scores at 6 and 12 months, we used the multiple imputation procedure in STATA version 11 (StataCorp, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref035">2009</xref>) to impute missing EPDS outcomes based on 100 imputations using a logistic regression model with 6-week EPDS score, lives alone, history of PND and life events as predictors. The trial is reported according to the CONSORT guidelines for cluster trials (Campbell <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref007">2004</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec003"><title>Results</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig001">Figure 1</xref> shows the trial profile.

Multiple imputation computing for missing 6-month EPDS scores increased the sample size from 2241 to 2786, and the OR using the imputed data, with adjustment for covariates, was similar to the observed data (0.76, 95% CI 0.56&#x02013;1.03, <italic>p</italic>=0.073).</p><p><table-wrap id="tab002" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Primary outcome: proportion of EPDS-negative women with EPDS score &#x02a7e;12 at 6 months, by intervention group (IG) or care as usual (CAU) group, comparing EPDS subthreshold and lowest EPDS score subsamples defined according to EPDS score at 6 weeks (n=2241)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="S0033291710001467_tab2"/><table-wrap-foot><fn id="tfn002_000"><p>EPDS, Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale; OR, odds ratio; CI, confidence interval.</p></fn><fn id="tfn002_001"><p><italic>p</italic> value for interaction term between lowest score (EPDS &#x02a7d;5) and subthreshold (5&#x0003c;EPDS&#x0003c;12) groups=0.782.</p></fn><fn id="tfn002_002"><label>*</label><p><italic>p</italic> value for interaction term adjusted for lives alone (yes/no), history of postnatal depression (PND) (yes/no), any life events (yes/no)=0.749.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p><p>The EPDS-negative women were divided into two subgroups: a &#x02018;subthreshold&#x02019; subgroup scoring between 6 and 11 on the 6-week EPDS (<italic>n</italic>=999) and a &#x02018;lowest severity&#x02019; subgroup scoring 0&#x02013;5 on the 6-week EPDS (<italic>n</italic>=1242) based on the approximate median score for the sample.

No group or time effects were observed for the State Anxiety outcome.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec004"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our analysis has shown that women who scored below the EPDS threshold at 6 weeks after childbirth were less likely to score above the EPDS threshold at 6 months after childbirth if their HV had undergone training in identifying depressive symptoms, developing therapeutic relationships and providing psychological approaches to managing depression. Furthermore, this effect applied equally across women at all initial levels of risk, not just those close to the above threshold, thus suggesting a universal effect. This effect did not diminish over later assessments at 12 and 18 months following childbirth. How plausible is this effect and can it be explained?</p><p>We found that the training was effective in the separately reported treatment trial in EPDS positive (EPDS score &#x02a7e;12) women (Morrell <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref024">2009<italic>a</italic></xref>), although 61% agreed to, and only 28% of all EPDS positive IG women providing outcome data had completed, HV sessions. In the present study, approximately 1% of IG EPDS-negative women were offered and completed at least one session. So we need to ask why and how was HV training universally effective most notably in the EPDS-negative women? Cross-contamination effects are likely to have been minimized by clustering HVs. One previous primary care trial, using a similarly powered clustered design, in which midwives were trained in a protocol to focus on specific physical and mental health needs of mothers after childbirth, also reported significantly lower EPDS scores at 4 months follow-up in women in IG practices (MacArthur <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref022">2002</xref>). However, there were insufficient baseline data available to identify women with greater depression severity to determine whether effectiveness was confined to a subgroup of likely cases of depression or was preventive across the whole range of baseline severity.</p><p>What seems to matter is the difference between being registered with a practice that has adopted the experimental <italic>versus</italic> the CAU policy. This involves differences in practice environment and culture. More specifically, receiving training and developing the skill to assess mental health and provide psychologically informed sessions is likely to affect the practitioners themselves through increased confidence. It creates a focus of care on the mother's psychological well-being and not just on the physical welfare of the child. Women may benefit from the HVs' enhanced communication skills and knowing that emotional issues are open for discussion if needed, without the possibly stigmatizing requirement to refer to a different profession or service. We were able to show evidence in the women who were below threshold at 6 weeks of a positive effect of being randomly assigned to receive a face-to-face EPDS administration and clinical assessment, when compared with a research office postally administered EPDS questionnaire only. As reported separately, empirical support for change in HV activity was shown in the resource use logs of these lower-risk women (Brugha <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref005">2009</xref>). As the EPDS score increased, in the IGs, a clear increase in the number of visits was seen (Brugha <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref005">2009</xref>), which seemed to be due to a greater recognition of the need for professional input relating to PND by IG teams; whereas concurrently, there were fewer visits by intervention HVs relating to the mothers with lower EPDS scores, presumably because visits are judged to be unnecessary.</p><p>The question remains unanswered: how did intervention cluster women benefit without formal psychological therapy sessions? The purpose of training was also to establish a high-quality, warm, therapeutic relationship with the women (Morrell <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref026">2009<italic>b</italic></xref>). Concepts of social support have been suggested to explain the common underlying mechanisms in the effectiveness of cognitive behavioral, interpersonal and other therapies (Brugha, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref003">1995</xref>). Tailoring to need and availability of support from a trained professional could potentially influence perception of available support, which may be the key parameter, rather than objective support. The value of tailoring and flexible care has certainly been suggested by MacArthur <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref022">2002</xref>), but in that study women were provided care from midwives and followed only to 4 months postnatally.</p><p>Psychological interventions focusing on interpersonal issues during pregnancy have also shown some promise (Spinelli &#x00026; Endicott, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref034">2003</xref>; Zlotnick <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref038">2006</xref>). This result contrasts with two previous ineffective prevention trials conducted in the same population by the present authors (T.S.B., C.J.M.) that employed external (research) therapists (Brugha <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref006">2000</xref>; Morrell <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref025">2000</xref>). Thus, individually delivered psychosocial interventions by professionals may be more effective postnatally (Dennis, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref014">2005</xref>) when integrated into routine visits. For example, one other randomized trial of enhanced and personalized midwife-managed care in the early postnatal period also reported better EPDS outcomes at 7 weeks postnatally (Shields <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref032">1997</xref>). The similarity of both sets of research findings runs counter to the suggestion that our result is a chance, fortuitous finding.</p><p>Study limitations need to be considered given the potential public health significance of the results. A potential limitation of the study is that the EPDS subgroup by IG interaction tests have limited power to detect anything other than large interactions (Montgomery <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref023">2003</xref>). The CI for the OR for the interaction effect at 6 months after adjustment for covariates (0.44&#x02013;1.87) was relatively wide, so we cannot exclude such an effect, although the point estimate of the OR of 0.91 suggests this is unlikely. However, the interaction was not of primary interest and the trial was adequately powered to detect a reasonable target intervention effect, equivalent to an OR of 0.63. A full clinical interview was not performed on all CAU and IG EPDS-negative women and our primary outcome was thus not clinically assessed depression caseness. However, the EPDS is a well-established, reliable indicator of likelihood of clinical depression (Gaynes <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref016">2005</xref>). Bias may arise with cluster randomization because individual recruitment occurs after randomization (Puffer <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref029">2005</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab001">Table 1</xref>, the profiles of IG and CAU women were remarkably balanced but, nevertheless, our analysis adjusted for key predictors of depression outcome. A planned replication and extended generalization of findings will be needed in other populations.</p><p>Rose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref031">1992</xref>) argued that more people would benefit from a universal intervention. In our treatment trial (Morrell <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref026">2009<italic>b</italic></xref>) we found that 31 (11.4%) of 271 EPDS positive women benefited from intervention. In this prevention analysis, in EPDS-negative women, 46 (3.1%) of 1474 women benefited. Accordingly, the new intervention policy benefited far more women in the prevention (EPDS-negative) than in the treatment (EPDS positive) groups. Our finding that mental health benefits did not diminish over 18 months of follow-up contrasts with the short-term effectiveness of depression interventions in general and may reflect the ongoing extended contact that HVs often have with postnatal women. Additional analyses from this trial showed the probability that the intervention is cost-effective at various &#x02018;threshold values&#x02019; of a quality-adjusted life year (QALY). In the range of QALY values between &#x000a3;20 000 and &#x000a3;30 000, the probability of the intervention being cost-effective is over 99% (Brugha <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref005">2009</xref>). Thus, costs were lower and outcomes better in IG compared to CAU women, a concept often referred to by economists as &#x02018;dominance&#x02019;.</p><p>Until now, governments and policy makers have held back from investing significantly in depression prevention programs, arguably because of lack of convincing evidence for policy change and cost. To date, there have been no large-scale trials testing whether universal prevention effects have occurred across a whole population. There is now new evidence for clinically significant, useful and persistent reductions in the prevalence of depression in a key part of the population, women following childbirth, which requires further independent evaluation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The trial was commissioned, funded and sponsored by the National Health Service (NHS), England, R&#x00026;D Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Programme.
