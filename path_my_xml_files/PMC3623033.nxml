Twenty-five (12%) children whose mothers received betamethasone had reported learning difficulties compared with 27 (14%) control children. Dyslexia was the most common learning difficulty reported followed by attention deficit disorder (ADHD) (nine controls and seven treatment children with dyslexia, four controls and three treatment children with ADHD). Two children in the betamethasone group had severe learning difficulties; one had X linked mental retardation and the other global developmental delay with dysmorphic features. One child in the control group with severe learning difficulties had Down's syndrome.

The results of the SATs key stages 1 and 2 demonstrated that the treatment and control populations did not differ in academic achievement, with results comparable with the normal population and within government targets. No children were reported to have cerebral palsy or neurological disability. There was no evidence that general health was adversely affected with no significant difference in the number of children admitted to hospital with infections and accidental injury. Antenatal betamethasone did not affect the number of children who developed asthma or atopic disease.</p><p>This is the first published study to assess the long-term outcome for children whose mothers received a single course of betamethasone antenatally before elective CS at term. For logistical reasons only children whose mothers were recruited at the four main centres were identified for the follow-up study.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref> Demographic data of these mothers and children was comparable with that of the whole group.</p><p>A primary strength of this study was the children were more than 8&#x02005;years old&#x02014;an age when physical, behavioural and learning difficulties are more likely to be evident. There are a number of limitations, however. Although we achieved a 51% response rate to those who were traced, the total number of children in the control and betamethasone groups (190 vs 217) is small. With the time delay between the initial recruitment to the ASTECS study and the start of the follow-up study, ASTECS-2, not all mothers could be traced. Mothers who had no recollection of the ASTECS trial, predominantly from the control group, were less likely to respond to the initial letter potentially leading to bias. Follow-up phone calls of all who did not respond allowed the study to be discussed with an effective increase in recruitment. The trial allocation remained blinded throughout the process.</p><p>Responses to the questionnaires depended on the mothers&#x02019; recall and assessment. We did not refer to general practitioner or hospital records and teachers were not asked to complete SDQ questionnaires. However large community studies suggest that parents and teachers provide information of roughly equal predictive value. Behaviour determined through the SDQ has been well validated,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref> and there was no difference between the two groups although slightly more children in the betamethasone group had scores in the abnormal range for hyperactivity and emotional symptoms. This may indicate a difference in behaviour but comes from only one source of information. The SDQ is a screening tool to identify those at increased risk but clinical assessment, teacher's reports and psychological testing are necessary to identify a problem. Normative SDQ data for Britain from 10&#x02005;438 children 5&#x02013;15&#x02005;years old shows 16% of 5&#x02013;10&#x02005;years old and 12.9% of 11&#x02013;15&#x02005;years old children had a hyperactivity health score in the abnormal range.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref> For the emotional health symptoms score the corresponding figures are 10.6% and 12.2%, respectively. There were more children reported to have ADHD, dyslexia and autism in the control group.</p><p>Academic progress, including details of learning difficulties requiring additional support, was substantiated by the questionnaire to the schools. However not all mothers or young people agreed to the school being contacted, potentially introducing bias, although this could affect both groups. We obtained information on key stages 1 and 2 SATs for those attending schools in England. SATs were abolished for pupils resident in Wales in 2004 with the grade achieved derived by teacher assessment. The difference between the school assessments recorded in quartiles of academic ability, appeared a discordant finding. Ideally standardised, age-appropriate, cognitive and psychological assessments would have been undertaken on all in the follow-up study but this was not possible.</p><p>Follow-up studies reporting outcome up to 31&#x02005;years after a single course of antenatal steroid given to mothers delivering before 34&#x02005;weeks gestation have not shown adverse effect on physical growth and neurological or cognitive development.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref> However outcome studies following repeated courses of antenatal steroids from 24&#x02005;weeks gestation, or high doses used postnatally to reduce chronic lung disease, have shown conflicting results with increase in cerebral palsy and behavioural changes reported.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16 R17 R18">16&#x02013;18</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref> With three or more courses of antenatal steroid, an increase in rates of aggressive/destructive, distractible, and hyperkinetic behaviour at 3 years and 6&#x02005;years are reported.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref> The current evidence suggests that the very immature brain is vulnerable when exposed to high doses of corticosteroid for prolonged periods either antenatally or postnatally. As with the preterm infant, our findings suggest that there were no adverse consequences of a single course of antenatal betamethasone at term gestation.</p><p>Dalziel <italic>et al</italic> reported no difference in lung function at 30&#x02005;years between 181 betamethasone-exposed and 202 placebo-exposed participants whose mothers were randomised at 24&#x02013;36&#x02005;weeks gestation to receive a single course betamethasone.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref> The prevalence of asthma, eczema and hay fever was similar between groups, and comparable with the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood phase 3 studies conducted between 1999 and 2004.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref> Our findings suggest that antenatal steroids do not significantly affect the rate of development of atopic disease.</p><p>Our follow-up study has provided no reason to change our original recommendations that delivery by elective CS should be delayed until the 39th week wherever possible to reduce the risk of respiratory morbidity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref> When it is necessary to deliver by prelabour CS at 37 weeks or 38&#x02005;weeks, parents can be reassured that the administration of a single course of antenatal betamethasone is not only beneficial in the short term, but does not have any adverse long term consequences.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank Kirsty Macguire, Darren Baker, Huw Roberts, Debbie Skelhorn, Sarah Evans, Sarah Kotecha, Professor Ben Shaw, Dr Jim Turner, Haydn and Rachel Sigsworth, Dr Mathew Ellis, Phil Shrimpton, Dr Jonathan Cox, Lesley Poole, Dr Eduardo Moya, Barry Clarke and Richard Walker for their contributions to the smooth running and success of the research.
