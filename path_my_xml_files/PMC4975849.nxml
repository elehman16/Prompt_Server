Eighteen children were esophoric (greater than +1), 18 were orthophoric (&#x02212;1 to 1) and 26 were exophoric (less than &#x02212;1) at near.

With the PALs, exophoric children exhibited significantly increased head tilt angle (p=0.003) and reduced ocular gaze angle (p=0.004) compared with esophoric children. Near non-exophoric children exhibited similar eye and head postures when wearing SVLs and PALs, whereas exophoric children exhibited reduced ocular gaze angle (t=&#x02212;3.18, p=0.04) with PALs compared with SVLs.

<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> However, PALs do not help to reduce the progression of myopia in subjects with near exophoria.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3&#x02013;5</xref> The reasons underlying these differences remain unclear.</p><p>Accommodation and convergence are the key factors in the oculomotor near response mechanism. In near vision, additions decrease accommodative convergence due to the accommodation&#x02013;convergence linkage, resulting in a more divergent phoria position. Jiang <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> reported that the near phoria shifts in the exophoric direction when subjects view a near target through +2.00&#x02005;D additions. Therefore, near phoria can shift to the normal range in myopic subjects with near esophoria when they are wearing +2.00&#x02005;D addition lenses for reading, whereas the near phoria may become more exophoric and even exceed the normal range in subjects with near orthophoria or exophoria.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Consequently, near additions create an increased demand on positive fusional vergence, particularly in individuals with near exophoria.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> How myopic children with different phoria statuses address this mismatch of the accommodative and vergence systems has yet to be established. The present study investigates whether myopic children with different phoria statuses will change their near vision posture to attain a better oculomotor balance, while wearing the PALs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Subjects</title><p>The experiment was performed on 62 children (33 boys and 29 girls) aged 7&#x02013;11&#x02005;years (mean&#x000b1;SD, 9.6&#x000b1;0.9&#x02005;years).

Posture measurements were collected after an adaptation of at least 2&#x02005;weeks to the SVLs. During testing, the subjects were instructed to read grade-appropriate Chinese stories on standard A5-size paper that included 15 lines in Chinese Song font (14&#x02005;pt). After reading, the subjects were asked three questions about the text passage that they read to confirm that they truly read and understood the text. Then, each subject was provided with PALs (Essilor Myopilux Pro, +2.00&#x02005;D addition, progression length=14.5&#x02005;mm, Essilor International S.A.).

Reading distance was defined as the distance from the base of a child's nose to the centre of each line. Head tilt angle was defined as the angle in the sagittal plane between the head and the vertical upright position. Ocular gaze angle was defined as the angle in the sagittal plane between the normal line of the head and the child's line of sight and was corrected for the prismatic effects of the lenses. For both angles, positive values corresponded to downward head tilt or ocular gaze. The vertical prismatic effects were calculated based on the Prentice law<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> for SVLs and based on the prismatic effects of the PALs along the meridian line, which were provided by the lens manufacturer. The addition powers of the PALs were calculated based on the power distribution along the meridian line as a function of the ocular gaze angle as provided by the lens manufacturer. Both vertical prismatic effects and addition values were adjusted for the downward deviation of the frame.</p><p>One-way analysis of variance was used to compare the means of the basic biometric characteristics (ie, age, height and refractive error) between the phoria groups and to compare the means of the postural data between the phoria groups within each lens type. A repeated measure analysis of variance was used to analyse the mean differences in the postural data. One-way analysis of variance was used to compare the means of the postural data between the phoria groups. Paired t tests were used to compare the postural data between the lens types within each phoria group.

When the children were grouped according to their phoria status, near esophoric or orthophoric children using the PALs exhibited head and eye postures that were similar to those exhibited during the use of SVLs. In contrast, exophoric children exhibited decreased ocular gaze angles with the PALs. Furthermore, exophoric children exhibited increased head tilt angles and decreased ocular gaze angles compared with esophoric children, resulting in viewing through a lower near addition power. These results may partially explain the treatment differences between phoria groups that have been observed in myopia control trials using PALs.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3&#x02013;5</xref>
<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p><p>A previous study reported that reading conditions, such as a relaxed armchair setting or a chair/desk setting, and the size of the child relative to the desk height can strongly influence reading distance.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Moreover, the comfort and familiarity of a reading posture appear to be important determinants of reading distance and posture.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> In our study, myopic children adopted similar reading distances (SVLs, 30.8&#x02005;cm; PALs, 29.8&#x02005;cm) and head tilt angles (SVLs, 31.3&#x000b0;; PALs, 33.0&#x000b0;) independent of their lens type or phoria status. We simulated a typical school desk/chair setting and used grade-appropriate stories such that these common and familiar conditions made the children feel comfortable and allowed them to maintain their habitual head postures.</p><p>With the SVLs, the phoria status did not significantly influence eye or head posture. With the PALs, near exophoric children exhibited a 6.2&#x000b0; reduction in ocular gaze angle and a 7.7&#x000b0; increase in head tilt angle compared with those who had esophoria, as well as a 4.7&#x000b0; reduction in ocular gaze angle and a 3.5&#x000b0; increase in head tilt angle compared with those who had orthophoria. In other words, exophoric children used an upper portion of the PALs compared with esophoric or orthophoric children. Based on the design of the PALs used in this study, we calculated the near addition power of the PALs that corresponded to the average ocular gaze angle used for reading while accounting for the downward deviation of the frame. On average, exophoric children experienced 0.36 and 0.30&#x02005;D less addition powers than esophoric and orthophoric children, respectively, while reading. Based on the accommodative lag theory, near additions reduce accommodative lag during near work, thereby decreasing hyperopic retinal blur, axial elongation and myopia progression.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> During near work, in esophoric myopic children, higher near additions reduce accommodative error and also the demand on negative fusional vergence, thus enhancing oculomotor balance.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Higher near addition values used by esophoric myopic children may be a factor to explain the different effects in reducing myopia progression between phoria groups in PALs studies.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3&#x02013;5</xref>
<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> In myopic children with exophoria, the addition may lead to a conflict between the reduced accommodative demand and the relatively large vergence demand,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> resulting in eye strain.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Cheng and colleagues<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> reported that the average near exophoria increased to 6 &#x00394; in myopic children wearing +2.00&#x02005;D addition lenses, which is beyond the normal range. Therefore, compared with esophoric or orthophoric children, exophoric children could use less addition power to exert less vergence effort and thus reduce potential eye strain.</p><p>Although, we carefully instructed and reminded the children and their parents on how to use the PALs when we dispensed these lenses, we still found that several children did not use the near addition for reading and had the spectacles placed low on their faces. Consequently, even in myopic children with esophoria, the mean addition power they used was just 1.19&#x02005;D. This result indicates that only 60% of the full addition power (+2.00&#x02005;D) was used. Hasebe <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> proposed that downward deviations of PALs (ie, the distances from the subject's corneal light reflection point to the PALs fitting cross) could lead to insufficient addition values by limiting the access to the lower portion of the lens as children perform near vision work. Although the frames were properly adjusted when initially given to the children, we found that 27% of the children (17 out of 62) (eso, 4; ortho, 6; exo, 7) had downward deviations of &#x0003e;2&#x02005;mm after the adaptation period of at least 1&#x02005;month. Consequently, the children had to lower their eyes further, if they wanted to access the full near vision power of their lenses, which may reduce the overall therapeutic effect of the PALs. Therefore, frequent frame adjustments are recommended in myopia control trials with PALs. In addition, the possibility for exophoric children to wear PALs deliberately lower to avoid looking through the addition cannot be excluded.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> JB set up the testing room, helped conceive the study, performed the statistical analyses and drafted and revised the manuscript.
