Catecholamines, renin-angiotensin system, and especially vasopressin are all released during the presence of pneumoperitoneum and may contribute to increase in the afterload. Use of &#x003b1;-2 adrenergic agonists such as clonidine or Dexmedetomidine significantly reduces hemodynamic changes and anesthetic requirements as it has sedative, analgesic, and anxiolytic properties. Dexmedetomidine has greater affinity to &#x003b1;-2 A subtype, which may account for superior analgesic versus clonidine, does not interact with the GABA mimetic system so does not depress respiratory drive and centrally mediated reduction in sympathetic tone offers cardio-protective effect.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>Though, the laparoscopy allows a significant reduction in post-operative pain, there may be pain resulting from the diaphragmatic irritation. Multimodal analgesia[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] is now recommended to prevent and treat the post-laparoscopic pain.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Paracetamol and Dexmedetomidine are both effective component in respect of multimodal analgesia in combination with opioids. Paracetamol has both analgesic and antipyretic effects similar to aspirin and it is devoid of many side-effects of NSAIDs such as GI ulceration, impaired platelet function, and adverse cardiorenal effects.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] The mechanism of action is considered to be inhibition of putative central cycloxygenase (COX) 3 causing reduced production of prostaglandin in CNS.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] In addition, there may be modulation of descending inhibitory serotonergic pathways and it may act on opioidergic system and NMDA receptors.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is a distressing complaint in laparoscopic cholecystectomy, which is aggravated by use of opioids. The anesthetic and opioid sparing effects of Dexmedetomidine in the early post-operative period may decrease the risk of respiratory depression and incidence of PONV.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>After obtaining institutional ethical clearance at and written informed consent, 80 female patients aged 19-60 year, ASA-PS-I scheduled for laparoscopic cholecystectomy were taken for these randomized study. Patients with body weight &#x0003e;80 kg, cardiovascular disease, broncho-pulmonary disease, renal, neurologic, gastrointestinal, and hepatic dysfunction, history of allergy, long-term use of medications such as beta-blocker and other anti-hypertensives, antipsychotic, analgesic, alcohol, sedative, TCA etc., patients with psychiatric illness, patient refusal were excluded from this study.</p><p>Patients were randomly assigned to one of the following two groups: Group P (<italic>n</italic> = 40) received IV 1 g Paracetamol infusion over 10 min pre-operatively and 6 hourly thereafter and Group D (<italic>n</italic> = 40) received IV Dexmedetomidine 1 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/kg bolus over 10 min pre-operatively and 0.2-0.4 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/kg/h thereafter for 24 h using a computer generated random-number table.</p><p>In the pre-operative holding area the patients learned and familiarized about 10 point visual analog scale (VAS) to assess their baseline pain with 0 = none to 10 = maximum. Immediately before entering the operating room patients were pre-medicated with the Midazolam 2 mg, Ondansetron 4 mg and Glycopyrrolate 0.2 mg IV. Intra-operative monitoring devices included pulse-oximetry, non-invasive blood pressure, ECG, and capnography.</p><p>After obtaining base line measurement of heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP) diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP), infusion of Paracetamol 1 g was given over 10 min for Group P and infusion Dexmedetomidine was given 1 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/kg (diluting in normal saline making a 50 ml solution) over 10 min and 0.2-0.4 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/kg/h thereafter for 24 h for Group D. Anesthetic induction was accomplished with pre-oxygenation, injection Fentanyl 1 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/kg, and injection Propofol 2 mg/kg IV followed by injection Succinylcholine 1.5 mg/kg IV to facilitate tracheal intubation. Anesthesia was maintained with nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) 66% and oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) 34% mixture in combination with 0.5-1 vol% Isoflurane, and injection Atracurium. The end tidal carbondioxide was maintained within 35-40 mmHg. The HR, SBP, DBP, and MAP were recorded intra-operatively at 5 min, 15 min, 30 min, 45 min, and 60 min starting from the completion of bolus dose infusion of study drug and HR and MAP post-operatively at 1<sup>st</sup>, 4<sup>th</sup>, 8<sup>th</sup>, 16<sup>th</sup>, and 24<sup>th</sup> h. MAP were maintained within &#x000b1; 25% of the baseline values by varying the inspired Isoflurane concentration. Hypotension[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] (defined as MA<italic>P</italic> value &#x0003c;25% of the baseline value on 2 consecutive readings within 2-3 min) not responding to reduction in inspired Isoflurane concentration and 200 ml fluid bolus was treated with injection Phenylephrine. The infusion of study medication was discontinued if the hypotension persisted &#x0003e;2 min after these interventions. Upon return of the MAP &#x000b1; 25% of the baseline values the study medication infusion was resumed at 50% of the initial infusion rate. In the presence of hypertension[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] (defined as MA<italic>P</italic> value &#x0003e;25% of the baseline value on two consecutive readings within 2-3 min) and or tachycardia[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] (defined as HR value &#x0003e;25% of the baseline value on 2 consecutive readings within 2-3 min) inspired concentration of Isoflurane and study medication was increased. Bradycardia[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] (defined as HR &#x0003c;45/min) persisting for &#x0003e;2 min was treated with injection Atropine.

The choice of anesthetic technique for upper abdominal laparoscopic surgery is mostly related to general anesthesia with muscle relaxation, tracheal intubation, and intermittent positive pressure ventilation.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] This study was conducted in 80 adult patients belonging to ASA-PS-I to evaluate the effect of IV Paracetamol and Dexmedetomidine infusion on peri-operative hemodynamic response and the post-operative analgesia in the laparoscopic cholecystectomy.</p><p>According to New South Wales Therapeutic Advisory Group Current Opinion October 2005, the recommended dose of Paracetamol is 1 g IV up to 4 times daily with a minimum interval between each dose at least 4 h in adults.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] At recommended dosages Paracetamol is not associated with the increased incidence of nausea, vomiting, and respiratory depression observed with opioids. Furthermore, Paracetamol due to its different action mechanism interferes neither with platelet nor kidney function. Its analgesic action is not clear although its central level action has been hypothesized.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Because of the lower adverse events compared to NSAIDs, Paracetamol be the preferred choice for peri-operative baseline analgesia.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Paracetamol does enhance analgesic efficacy when added to NSAIDs compared to NSAIDs alone.</p><p>Dexmedetomidine, and &#x003b1;-2 adrenoreceptor agonist is approved for sedation of initially intubated and mechanically ventilated patients by continuous infusion for only less than 24 h in intensive care setting. &#x003b1;-2 adrenoceptor agonists are being increasingly used in anesthesia and critical care as they not only decrease sympathetic tone and attenuate the stress responses to anesthesia and surgery; but also cause sedation, analgesia, and anxiolysis. The bolus of 1 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/kg Dexmedetomidine initially results in a transient increase of the blood pressure and a reflex fall in HR, especially in younger, healthy patients.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Given the propensity of the drug to produce hypotension and or bradycardia when it is administered to volunteers or patients, it was important to determine an infusion rate that would maximize the anesthetic and analgesic sparing effect although, minimizing the occurrence of adverse cardiovascular side-effects requiring therapeutic intervention. Jung <italic>et al</italic>. in their comparative study showed significant advantage of Dexmedetomidine at dose of 1 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/kg bolus followed by 0.2-0.7 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/kg/h infusion for 24 h.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] It is a safe sedative alternative to benzodiazepine/opioid combination in patients undergoing monitored anesthesia care for a multitude of procedures because of its analgesic, &#x0201c;co-operative sedation&#x0201d; and lack of respiratory depression properties.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Several findings lead to the conclusion that the major sedative and antinociceptive effects of Dexmedetomidine are attributable to its stimulation of the &#x003b1;-2 adrenoceptors in the locus coeruleus.</p><p>In our study at a dose of 0.2-0.4 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/kg infusion had a significant hemodynamic stability over post-operative h, which corroborates with the study done by Jung <italic>et al</italic>. in a prospective randomized double blind study compared the effects of Dexmedetomidine and remifentanil on hemodynamic stability, sedation and post-operative pain control in PACU with the Dexmedetomidine at a dose of 1 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/kg IV over 10 min followed by 0.2-0.7 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/kg/h continuous IV infusion had a significant advantage in terms of post-operative hemodynamic stability.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>Talke <italic>et al</italic>. in 1995 in their study showed that both HR and SBP reduced in response to the 1 h Dexmedetomidine infusion to the targeted plasma conc. of 0.45 ng/ml, which appears to benefit peri-operative hemodynamic management in patients undergoing vascular surgery.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>In another study, Talke <italic>et al</italic>. administered Dexmedetomidine infusion for its ability to attenuate stress responses during emergence from anesthesia after major vascular operation and found that Dexmedetomidine attenuates increase in HR and plasma noradrenaline concentration during emergence from anesthesia, which is supporting the hemodynamic finding in our study.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>In our study, we found post-operative pain and sedation score in Group D remained significantly in acceptable range.
