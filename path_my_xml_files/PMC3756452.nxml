Of these, 627 had &#x0003e;5 years&#x02019; follow-up (4418 patient-years). A pooled placebo population (n=818) (placebo+methotrexate (MTX)) was also analysed. Serious adverse event and infection rates generally remained stable over time and multiple courses. The overall serious infection event (SIE) rate was 3.94/100 patient-years (3.26/100 patient-years in patients observed for &#x0003e;5&#x02005;years) and was comparable with placebo+MTX (3.79/100 patient-years). Serious opportunistic infections were rare. Overall, 22.4% (n=717) of rituximab-treated patients developed low immunoglobulin (Ig)M and 3.5% (n=112) low IgG levels for &#x02265;4&#x02005;months after &#x02265;1 course. SIE rates were similar before and during/after development of low Ig levels; however, in patients with low IgG, rates were higher than in patients who never developed low IgG.

We focused on specific AEs that could potentially be attributed to the immunological effects of peripheral B cell depletion as well as on AEs of special interest in RA patients. The current analysis involves a larger number of patients than previously reported (&#x0003e;3000 patients with nearly 12&#x02005;000 patient-years of observation), including a substantial number of patients treated for &#x0003e;5&#x02005;years.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Studies and analysis</title><p>This was a pooled observed case analysis of safety data of patients with moderate-to-severe, active RA treated with rituximab in combination with MTX in a global clinical trial programme (eight randomised trials and two long-term, open-label extensions).

Prior to each infusion, all patients received intravenous methylprednisolone 100&#x02005;mg; most patients also received acetaminophen and an antihistamine. Repeat treatment was based on the physician's decision of clinical need and included evidence of active disease (either swollen joint count and tender joint count &#x02265;8 or disease activity score in 28 joints&#x02013;erythrocyte sedimentation rate &#x02265;2.6). Patients received concomitant MTX 10&#x02013;25&#x02005;mg/week at a stable dose. Background oral corticosteroids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were also permitted.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Safety assessments</title><p>Safety assessments were conducted as previously reported.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref> Patients were followed for the study period and for 1&#x02005;year after completion or withdrawal. Patients who remained B cell depleted after this time were followed until peripheral B cells returned to lower limit of normal or baseline, whichever occurred earlier. All AEs were captured for the first month in safety follow-up periods, after which time only SAEs and all infection events were collected. Original reported terms were assigned preferred terms using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA), V.13.1. All potential malignant events (identified by the wide, malignant or unspecified tumours standard MedDRA query (SMQ)), were medically reviewed by the Sponsor to confirm actual malignancies (evidenced by reported histology and information from investigational sites). AEs classified as infections included all preferred terms of the &#x02018;Infections and Infestations&#x02019; System Organ Class (SOC) and an additional nine terms from other MedDRA SOCs that could be considered to be due to underlying infection. SIE were defined as infections reported as an SAE or which required treatment with intravenous anti-infectives.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Data analysis</title><p>The analysis populations consisted of the All Exposure population (all patients exposed to at least one or part of one rituximab infusion, regardless of dose), the 5-year population (a subset of the All Exposure population with &#x0003e;5&#x02005;years&#x02019; follow-up) and the pooled placebo population (all patients who received placebo during placebo-controlled study periods and patients who initially received placebo but were subsequently treated with rituximab (placebo-switch patients)) (placebo+MTX). For placebo-switch patients, safety data were included in the placebo+MTX population up to the time of first rituximab exposure; thereafter, the data were included in the rituximab-treated population. The All Exposure population included patients who had never received prior MTX treatment, DMARD-inadequate responders and inadequate responders to prior TNF inhibitors and/or other biologicals (primarily anakinra). TNF inhibitor/biological-inadequate responders comprised 40% of the All Exposure population.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Duration of exposure</title><p>As of September 2010, 3194 patients had been treated with up to 17 courses of rituximab for up to 9.5&#x02005;years, providing 11&#x02005;962 patient-years of observation in the All Exposure population. Of patients exposed to rituximab, 1935 had been followed for &#x0003e;3&#x02005;years and 627 for &#x0003e;5&#x02005;years. All patients received at least one treatment course; 2428, 1739, 1451, 1154 and 849 patients received &#x02265;2, &#x02265;3, &#x02265;4, &#x02265;5 and &#x02265;6 courses, respectively (see online supplementary figure S2). The greatest number of withdrawals occurred following the first two courses (962 patients (30%)), principally for non-safety reasons and because two studies limited patients to receive one or two courses per protocol. Across the trials, there was a normal expected drop-out rate (1%&#x02013;13%) for subsequent courses. Overall, withdrawals due to AEs were infrequent (190 patients). Most withdrawals were attributed to &#x02018;other&#x02019; reasons which included insufficient therapeutic response, failure to return, violation of selection criteria at entry, other protocol violation, refused treatment/did not cooperate, withdrew consent, administrative/other (including patient entry to extension protocols), lost to follow-up, physician's decision to withdraw and pregnancy. Of those patients who remained in the study, there were very little data that were not recorded and of the data that were missing, they were missing at random.</p><p>The placebo+MTX population included 818 patients (1107 patient-years) with a substantially shorter mean duration of follow-up (&#x0003e;50% withdrew from placebo follow-up by 1&#x02005;year and 93% by 3&#x02005;years).

Analysis was performed to assess the rates of all infections and SIE in patients before and after a low (&#x0003c;lower limit of normal) IgG or IgM level for at least a 4-month period (or two consecutive clinical study visits) following treatment with rituximab. Low Ig levels at baseline screening (IgG &#x0003c;5.65 and IgM &#x0003c;0.55&#x02005;mg/ml) were exclusion criteria for trial entry. Overall, 22.4% (n=717) of rituximab-treated patients developed low IgM and a smaller proportion developed low IgG (3.5%; n=112) or low IgA (1.1%; n=36) for &#x02265;4&#x02005;months after &#x02265;1 course.

For IgM, SIE rates were not significantly higher during/after low IgM versus before low IgM, and were similar to rates in patients who never developed low IgM. In patients with low IgM/IgG, the SIE profile was consistent with the All Exposure population. Analysis of SIE onset relative to the timing of low Ig was limited due to discrete protocol-defined time points for Ig assessments; in addition, low patient numbers in some subgroups and the lack of a placebo comparator further restricted Ig analysis.</p><table-wrap id="ANNRHEUMDIS20122201956TB4" position="float"><label>Table&#x000a0;4</label><caption><p>Summary of infections in patients with IgG/IgM &#x0003c;LLN for at least 4&#x02005;months</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/></colgroup><thead valign="bottom"><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" colspan="3" rowspan="1">Patients with IgG&#x0003c;LLN*</th><th align="left" colspan="3" rowspan="1">Patients with IgM&#x0003c;LLN*</th></tr><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Before &#x0003c;LLN (n=112)</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">During/after &#x0003c;LLN (n=112)</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Never &#x0003c;LLN (n=3082)</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Before &#x0003c;LLN (n=717)</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">During/after &#x0003c;LLN (n=717)</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Never &#x0003c;LLN (n=2477)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Total pt-years</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">223</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">307</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">11&#x02005;432</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1171</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">2084</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">8707</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Infections, n</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">325</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">262</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">9179</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1264</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1699</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">6803</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Infections/100 pt-years (95% CI)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">146 (131 to 162)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">85 (76 to 96)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">80 (79 to 82)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">108 (10 to 114)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">82 (78 to 86)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">78 (76 to 80)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">SIEs, n</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">18</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">28</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">425</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">34</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">98</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">339</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">SIEs/100 pt-years (95% CI)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">8.06 (5.08 to 12.80)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">9.13 (6.30 to 13.22)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">3.72 (3.38 to 4.09)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.90 (2.0 to 4.06)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.70 (3.86 to 5.73)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">3.89 (3.50 to 4.33)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>*Below LLN for &#x02265;4&#x02005;months.

Following rituximab treatment, low Ig concentrations (particularly IgM) were observed in some patients. Patients with low IgM had no increased risk of infections or SIE. It is well established that reduced IgG levels are inherently associated with an increased risk of infections.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref> Nevertheless, for the small subgroup of patients with low IgG, a higher SIE rate was seen both before and after the development of low IgG compared with patients who never developed low IgG, suggesting that these patients had a higher inherent risk of developing SIE, possibly associated with demographical and/or clinical characteristics rather than with low IgG itself. Thus, for both Ig classes, SIE rates were similar before and after development of low levels.

Data were pooled from diverse studies in which rituximab doses, retreatment regimens and prior or active disease status could differ. Notably, two of the studies limited patients to receive one or two rituximab courses, thus reducing the overall number of patients receiving higher numbers of courses. In addition, clinical trial data are heavily influenced by the fact that patients are selected at baseline to exclude significant comorbidities, and only those who did well clinically remained in the study. Finally, the mean observation period of patients in the placebo+MTX population was considerably shorter than that of patients in the All Exposure population, and this should be borne in mind when making comparisons. Notwithstanding these limitations, the key strength of this analysis is the long observation and follow-up period in a population of patients with active RA, which included frequent assessments, including those performed after study withdrawal or completion (minimum 1&#x02005;year) and during extended periods of peripheral B cell depletion. In addition, the overall number of patients withdrawing due to AEs was low (6% in total).</p><p>In summary, evidence from the RA clinical trial data of up to 9.5&#x02005;years of follow-up of 3194 patients treated with rituximab, including a substantial number of patients with &#x0003e;5 years&#x02019; observation, revealed no new safety signals. Rituximab has remained generally well tolerated over time and over multiple courses, with a safety profile consistent with published data of patients with moderate-to-severe RA. These findings also indicate that repeated peripheral B cell depletion with rituximab did not give rise to any increased safety risk over time or increased reporting rates of any types of AEs (including infections, cardiovascular events, malignancies or fatal AEs) in the global RA clinical trial programme. Overall, these results are encouraging and should provide clinicians with reassurance regarding the long-term safety of rituximab in RA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="loca-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Web supplement</title></caption><media xlink:href="annrheumdis-2012-201956-s1.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e1034" position="anchor" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>Support for third-party writing assistance for this manuscript was provided by F Hoffmann-La Roche.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> All authors contributed to the interpretation of the data, drafting and/or revising the manuscript for intellectual content and approved the final version of the manuscript.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Funding:</bold> This study and the manuscript preparation were funded by F Hoffmann-La Roche.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Ethics approval:</bold> The study was conducted in full accordance with the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki or with the laws and regulations of the country in which the research was conducted, whichever afforded greater protection to the individual.
