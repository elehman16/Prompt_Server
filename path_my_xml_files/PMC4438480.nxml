As there is rising evidence about immuno-modulatory effects of lipid emulsions required for parenteral nutrition of ARDS patients, we sought to investigate whether infusion of conventional soybean oil (SO)-based or fish oil (FO)-based lipid emulsions rich in either n-6 or n-3 fatty acids, respectively, may influence subsequent pulmonary inflammation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In a randomized controlled, single-blinded pilot study, forty-two volunteers received SO, FO, or normal saline for two days. Thereafter, volunteers inhaled pre-defined doses of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) followed by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) 8 or 24 h later. In the murine model of LPS-induced lung injury a possible involvement of resolvin E1 (RvE1) receptor ChemR23 was investigated. Wild-type and ChemR23 knockout mice were infused with both lipid emulsions and challenged with LPS intratracheally.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In volunteers receiving lipid emulsions, the fatty acid profile in the plasma and in isolated neutrophils and monocytes was significantly changed. Adhesion of isolated monocytes to endothelial cells was enhanced after infusion of SO and reduced by FO, however, no difference of infusion on an array of surface adhesion molecules was detected. In neutrophils and monocytes, LPS-elicited generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines increased in the SO and decreased in the FO group. LPS inhalation in volunteers evoked an increase in neutrophils in BAL fluids, which decreased faster in the FO group. While TNF-&#x003b1; in the BAL was increased in the SO group, IL-8 decreased faster in the FO group. In the murine model of lung injury, effects of FO similar to the volunteer group observed in wild-type mice were abrogated in ChemR23 knockout mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>After infusion of conventional lipid emulsions, leukocytes exhibited increased adhesive and pro-inflammatory features. In contrast, FO-based lipid emulsions reduced monocyte adhesion, decreased pro-inflammatory cytokines, and neutrophil recruitment into the alveolar space possibly mediated by ChemR23-signaling. Lipid emulsions thus exert differential effects in human volunteers and mice <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://drks-neu.uniklinik-freiburg.de/drks_web/navigate.do?navigationId=trial.HTML&#x00026;TRIAL_ID=DRKS00006131">DRKS00006131</ext-link> at the German Clinical Trial Registry, 2014/05/14</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13054-015-0933-6) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is still linked with a high mortality rate. Despite major advances in intensive care medicine, a successful pharmacologic approach for the management of patients with ARDS is still missing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Pro-inflammatory mediators have been suggested to contribute to primary and secondary organ dysfunction in experimental models of ARDS, and excessive generation of these mediators has been observed in patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>Monocytes have been suggested to be intimately involved in controlling inflammatory cascades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], as they release both pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines directing activation and recruitment of leukocyte populations, such as polymorphonuclear granulocytes (PMN). The PMN represent the first line of defense against invading bacteria, yet they are capable of causing serious tissue destruction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>Eicosanoids play an essential role in the modulation of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The n-6 fatty acids, including arachidonic acid, represent the predominant polyunsaturated fatty acid in common Western diets, and current nutritional regimes. Eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid are the most important members of the n-3 family of fatty acids. Both may serve as alternative lipid precursors for the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Moreover, by incorporation into various membrane (phospho)-lipid pools, n-6 and n-3 fatty acids may affect lipid-signaling events and may be mediated by the potent pro-resolution lipid mediator class of resolvins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>Diets with specific fat composition may influence inflammatory and immunological events. Beneficial effects of n-3 fatty acids have been demonstrated in experimental models of acute lung injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In patients with lung injury or sepsis, an enteral diet enriched in n-3 fatty acids and anti-oxidants reduced ventilation time, improved the oxygenation index, and reduced the length of stay in the intensive care unit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, recent studies including a large multi-center trial conducted by the ARDSnet (OMEGA) investigating the effect of an enteral supplementation of n-3 fatty acids in ARDS patients revealed no beneficial effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The study OMEGA was stopped early for futility, displaying a higher rate of complications in the group receiving n-3 fatty acids. Due to the inconsistency of data on the enteral use of n-3 fatty acids in ARDS there is an ongoing debate in the scientific community with a final recommendation lacking at the moment. Data on the use of n-3-based lipid emulsions in parenteral nutrition in ARDS or even to reduce subsequent injury as currently applied are scarce [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, we assessed the impact of two commercially available lipid emulsions on isolated leukocyte function and intra-alveolar recruitment of leukocytes on subsequent endotoxin inhalation in healthy volunteers. As recent studies suggest an involvement of the novel n-3 derived lipid mediator resolvin E1 (RvE1) and its receptor ChemR23 in the mediation of n-3-induced (patho-)physiological effects, we additionally subjected wild-type and ChemR23 knockout mice to a model of experimental ARDS after infusion of lipid emulsions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>The University Ethics Committee (<italic>Ethikkommission des Fachbereichs Medizin</italic>, Justus-Liebig University Giessen) approved the study, and written informed consent was obtained from each volunteer.

Each infusion was started at 4 pm and lasted for 12 h. At 4 h after completion of the second infusion (8 am on the third day), the volunteers inhaled the endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS).

In volunteers receiving NaCl or SO-based lipid emulsions, leukocytes and neutrophils were even more increased after 24 h, which is well in line with kinetics in the murine model. In contrast, in volunteers with pre-infusion of FO-based lipids leukocytes and neutrophils were significantly decreased 24 h after LPS inhalation. This may be interpreted as reduced or shortened influx of neutrophils invading the alveolar space due to reduced cytokine generation and decreased adhesive properties. It is tempting to speculate that FO-based lipids shortened the time-frame for transmigration of neutrophils. Alternatively, resolvins, which are exclusively metabolized from eicosapentaenoic acid or docosahexaenoic acid, were shown to lead to a faster resolution of the allergic airway inflammation and may influence leukocyte kinetics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Generation of these novel mediators may have fastened the resolution of the LPS-induced inflammation and increased the resolution of inflammatory response.</p></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>Rolling and adhesion of monocytes</title><p>Monocytes adhere spontaneously to endothelial cell monolayers using a static assay, but substantial monocyte-endothelial adhesion under flow conditions demands preceding cytokine stimulation of the endothelial cells: E-selectin-L-selectin, ICAM-1-&#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> integrin and in particular VCAM-1-VLA-4- interactions were shown to represent predominant adhesive forces under these conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The finding of increased adhesive features after application of SO and reduced adhesion and rolling after infusion of FO-based lipids is corroborated by our previous study showing a similar effect of lipid emulsions in volunteers without LPS inhalation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The marked change of endothelial adhesion and rolling of monocytes isolated after infusion of lipid emulsions might be mirrored in monocyte adhesion molecules. However, no major differences in expression of adhesion molecules between infusion groups were noted. This confirms previous data obtained from healthy volunteers undergoing infusion of lipid emulsions without LPS challenge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. However, the findings are in contrast to the observation that supplementation of the diet of healthy volunteers with 3 g FO per day for three weeks resulted in a significant reduction in the expression of ICAM-1 and CD11a on both freshly prepared and interferon-stimulated peripheral blood monocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Interestingly, an effect of LPS inhalation on the upregulation of CC11b and CD18 was detected 8 h after LPS inhalation in all groups irrespective of infusion regimen. This upregulation contrasts with the finding of a reduced expression of CD11b in monocytes after LPS inhalation in asthmatic subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] but differences in timing of the analysis and dose of inhaled LPS may account for the difference.</p><p>Irrespective of the common trend of increased expression of CD11b and CD18 in all groups 8 h after inhalation, rolling and adhesion differed between the infusion groups. It is speculated that changes in membrane lipid composition as mirrored by the n-3: n-6-ratio may be at least in part responsible for the difference. As rolling and adhesion of monocytes require cross-talk between the activated endothelium and monocytes, reduced intracellular and intercellular signal transduction after infusion of FO-derived lipids may translate into a decrease in adhesive properties of monocytes. Second messenger pathways include generation of inositol phosphates with a known reduction of these products in leukocytes after ingestion of fish oil capsules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. However, generation of inositolphosphates is only one part of a major network of signal transduction pathways (for example, phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase, diacylglycerol, membrane rafts, and phospholipase A<sub>2</sub>) being dependent on membrane lipids and modulated by their change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. These pathways and their actions are referred to as lipid signaling. A change in these lipid-dependent pathways may also account for a possible impact of SO- and FO-derived lipids on a change in avidity of integrins. However, it cannot be fully excluded that further adhesion molecules are responsible for the difference in rolling and adhesion of monocytes, such as chemokines of the GRO family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], which were not determined in the present study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec32"><title>Changes in fatty acid profile</title><p>A rapid and sustained increase in free eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid concentration was noted after infusion of FO-based lipids, counterbalancing arachidonic acid. The arachidonic acid:(eicosapentaenoinc acid + docosahexaenoic acid) quotient in this compartment shifted from n-6 predominance to an n-3:n-6-equivalence within 48 h of infusion therapy. This prompt appearance of free n-3 fatty acids indicated rapid hydrolysis of n-3 fatty acid-containing triglycerides supplied by the lipid emulsion. The rapid rate of appearance of free n-3 fatty acids exceeds corresponding alterations in response to conventional dietary FO uptake by order of magnitude [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The changes in plasma fatty acid profile are paralleled by an increase in n-3 fatty acids in the membranes of leukocytes. In fact, a significant increase in the n-3:n-6 fatty acid ratio in the monocyte and neutrophil membrane lipid pool was noted; however, within the short infusion time and high percentage of arachidonic acid in the membranes the changes were not as dramatic as in the plasma free fatty acid fraction.</p></sec><sec id="Sec33"><title>Cytokine generation in isolated monocytes and neutrophils</title><p>No significant difference in cytokine generation of the isolated blood leukocytes before and after LPS inhalation in the NaCl group was detected. It is possible that the absence of an LPS effect on circulating leukocytes is due to largely compartmentalized inflammation in the alveolar space. However, this idea is not supported by the upregulation of CD11b and CD18 on monocytes after LPS inhalation. On the other side, leukocytes activated due to the LPS challenge may sequester in the lung capillaries and transmigrate. The remaining circulating leukocytes assessed for this study may be a non-activated population.</p><p>The rate of generation of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1, and IL-8 in monocytes and IL-8 in neutrophils induced by LPS was significantly reduced after infusion of FO-based lipid emulsions. In contrast, increased synthesis in IL-8 in neutrophils was noted in the SO group. A reduction in the generation of TNF-&#x003b1; after long-term dietary intake of FO capsules was first described by Endres <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] and confirmed after infusion of FO-derived lipids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. However, the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. As discussed for the adhesive properties, enrichment of membrane n-3 fatty acids may have a modulating effect on second messenger pathways. In addition, generation of eicosapentaenoic acid-derived eicosanoids such as leukotriene (LT)B<sub>5</sub> and thromboxane (Tx)A<sub>3</sub> has been demonstrated after infusion of FO-based lipid emulsions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Such a shift might interfere with eicosanoid-dependent auto-amplification loops, as described for the regulation of TNF-&#x003b1;-synthesis in monocytes by TxA<sub>2</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec34"><title>Inflammatory cytokines in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid</title><p>Several groups have used bronchoscopy in healthy volunteers to investigate the impact of inhalation of LPS or LPS challenge on local inflammatory responses in the alveolar compartment, which is mirrored by invasion of neutrophils, and an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines in the BALF, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. In the BALF, a marked increase in TNF-&#x003b1; and in IL-8 was noted after LPS inhalation when compared to cytokine concentrations determined as being close to the detection limit in group of unexposed healthy volunteers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. After LPS inhalation, TNF-&#x003b1; concentration was elevated at 8 h and fell after 24 h in all infusion groups. The IL-8 concentrations 8 and 24 h after LPS inhalation were considerably higher than in unexposed volunteers in the present study, and similar data have been reported by others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. When comparing the effect of infusion therapy on cytokine generation a threefold increase in TNF-&#x003b1; concentration in the SO group compared to the NaCl group after 8 h and a 50 % reduction in IL-8 in the FO group compared to this group after 24 h were visible. Most data available on effects of n-3 and n-6 lipids point to a reduction in inflammatory reactions by FO-derived lipids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The finding of a pro-inflammatory effect of n-6 lipids is more difficult to document [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec35"><title>Onset and persistence of the effect of lipid emulsions</title><p>The differential effect of lipid emulsions on isolated monocytes or neutrophil cytokine generation required pre-infusion and was measurable after only a two-day infusion course and sustained up to 24 h after cessation of the infusion, whereas the effect on adhesion and rolling of monocytes was found at 8 h, but not at 24 h. This finding is confirmed by the modulation of TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-8 concentrations in the BALF by the lipid emulsions after 8 h or 24 h, respectively. In contrast to a previous study in volunteers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] where the effect of lipid emulsions was observed in isolated monocytes 2 h after termination of the infusion period, persistence of the effect of a short-term 48-h infusion period for 24 h after termination of the infusion was confirmed in the present study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec36"><title>Impact of lipid emulsions on the inflammatory response</title><p>Infusion of conventional (SO) or FO-based lipid emulsions may not only regarded as a source of calories for patients with a need for parenteral nutrition as these lipid emulsions also modify the inflammatory response. This is the first study in human volunteers to show that after subsequent standardized LPS inhalation, the ability of lipid emulsions to change adhesive properties of leukocytes, including the generation of cytokines translating into a modified invasion of leukocytes into the alveolar space. After infusion of FO-based emulsions, recruited neutrophils in the alveolar space were reduced. In contrast, rolling and adhesion of monocytes, and TNF-&#x003b1; concentration in BALF were increased in the group receiving conventional (SO-based) lipid emulsions. Both lipid emulsions differ only in the fatty acids supplied and are used in many countries worldwide; however, both may not be regarded as immune-neutral. It may be of interest for the choice of lipid emulsions when considering parenteral infusions. Currently, the use of lipid emulsions rich in n-6 lipids is not encouraged by European Guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. This is in line with a recent Spanish multicenter study demonstrating a higher infection rate in critically ill patients receiving a standard lipid emulsion as compared to a lipid emulsion enriched with FO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. For our study, we chose a pre-treatment strategy by administration of lipid emulsions prior to induction of pulmonary inflammation. This concept is of clinical relevance as we might pre-treat/pre-condition patients with an expected trauma (for example, operation) with lipid emulsion to modulate an immune response. Thus far there is a paucity of data investigating this concept in terms of FO-based lipid emulsions and inflammation/sepsis. Augmenting the line of our reasoning, a randomized controlled trial in surgical patients found that pre-operative intravenous application of an FO-based lipid emulsion modulated the post-operative immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p><p>The involvement of resolvins as a novel class of n-3 fatty acid derived lipid mediators might be responsible for the different effects observed after infusion of FO or SO in the context of ALI. This is the first study elucidating the impact of the resolvin E1 receptor ChemR23 on the pathogenesis of ARDS and lipid mediators. ChemR23&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice show a diverse behavior compared to WT controls, especially when challenged with FO, this novel pathophysiologic hint appears promising and deserves further investigation. Furthermore, the difference between WT and ChemR23&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice is quite striking and reinforces a role for the ChemR23-endogenous chemerin pathway in the modulation of the innate immune response in vivo.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec37" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The present study extends previous observations in demonstrating that a 48-h lipid infusion period suffices to modify leukocyte adhesive properties as well as cytokine generation and leukocyte invasion into the alveolar space. This observation is of major interest as both lipid emulsion employed in this investigation are approved for parenteral nutrition in many countries. When considering parenteral nutrition in stable patients, for example, before an operation, use of lipid emulsions enriched in n-6 lipids does not seem to be beneficial. In fact, meta-analysis of surgical patients and intensive care patients undergoing parenteral nutrition supports the view that including a small fraction of n-3 lipids into parenteral regimes did reduce secondary infections and shortened the length of stay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. The findings of this study leave no doubt that in addition to fulfilling nutritional functions, intravenous administration of lipid emulsions has a strong impact on immunological functions and inflammatory processes in humans.</p></sec><sec id="Sec38"><title>Key messages</title><p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Lipid emulsion commercially available for clinical use exerts different immunological effects on alveaolar recruitment of leukocytes and generation of cytokines in human volunteers</p></list-item><list-item><p>FO-based lipid emulsions appear to reduce alveolar recruitment of leukocytes and levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines after LPS challenge.</p></list-item><list-item><p>After infusion of SO-based lipid emulsions a predominantly pro-inflammatory pattern is observed</p></list-item><list-item><p>Beneficial effects of FO might at least in part be mediated by resolvinE1 via ChemR23 receptor</p></list-item></list></p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec39"><title>Additional file</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="13054_2015_933_MOESM1_ESM.pdf" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>
