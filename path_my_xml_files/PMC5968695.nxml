Caries results from an imbalance between many cycles of demineralization and remineralization rather than from continued demineralization. The earliest clinical sign is the &#x0201c;white spot lesion.&#x0201d; Therapeutic intervention if done at this stage can totally arrest or reverse the whole caries process by remineralization.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>Fluoride is the most commonly used agent to promote remineralization. This is attributed to the formation of fluorhydroxyapatite which is less soluble under low pH.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Dentifrices containing various fluoride compounds such as sodium fluoride, sodium monofluorophosphate, stannous fluoride, and amine fluoride are known to be effective in the remineralization of early white spot lesions.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Sodium monofluorophosphate is most widely used in dentifrices due to its greater compatibility with dentifrice abrasives.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Earlier studies have shown that amine fluoride, a type of organic fluoride-containing dentifrices, is superior to other fluoride dentifrices.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Dentifrices containing 1000 ppm of fluoride have been recommended for all age groups due to its effectiveness in reducing caries. However, the use of greater amount may increase the risk for fluorosis, especially among children &#x0003c;6 years of age.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Hence, nonfluoride-containing dentifrices with remineralizing agents have been developed. Since the process of remineralization is limited by the availability of calcium and phosphorous ions, calcium phosphate-based remineralization systems like Anticay<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> which is a mixture of calcium sucrose phosphate with inorganic amorphous calcium phosphate are commercially available.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>The remineralizing effectiveness of Anticay<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> in comparison with fluoride dentifrices is not known. Since remineralization results in a change in the surface roughness, morphology, and the mineral content of enamel, these parameters can be used to determine the extent of remineralization. Hence, the present study was carried out to compare the remineralization effectiveness of sodium monofluorophosphate, amine fluoride, and calcium sucrose phosphate with inorganic amorphous calcium phosphate (Anticay<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>)-containing dentifrices by evaluating the changes in surface roughness, morphology, and mineral content of the demineralized enamel lesion after treatment with dentifrices. The null hypothesis was that there is no difference in the dentifrice groups in terms of surface roughness and mineral content of enamel after remineralization.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Subjects and Methods</title><p>The study followed an <italic>in vitro</italic> experimental design and was carried out after obtaining Institutional Ethics Committee clearance. Sample size for assessing change in surface roughness was calculated as 12 in each group, based on the formula E = N-B-T where N is the assumed sample size for each group minus 1; B is the blocking component representing the environmental effects allowed for the design minus 1; and T is the treatment component minus 1 (E=[12-1]-[0-1]-[1-1] =12) and E is the degree of freedom of the error component (desired value between 10 and 20). The sample size for scanning electron microscope and energy dispersive X-ray analysis (SEM-EDAX) was calculated as 6 in each group; keeping the power of the test as 0.25 with a predetermined type 1 error 0.8 as per cumulative distribution function.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>Inclusion criteria were permanent maxillary molars with no carious lesions. Teeth with enamel or dentinal defects, erosions, microcracks, visible stains, developmental anomalies, restorations, and sealants were excluded. Eighteen human maxillary molars extracted for periodontal reasons were collected and stored in formalin. The surface debris and calculus were removed using an ultrasonic scaler (Dental EMS Airflow S2 ultrasonic, Nyon, Switzerland) and immersed in distilled water. The teeth were examined under a stereomicroscope (Reichert Star Stereo Zoom, New York, USA) for any defects such as stains or cracks and such specimens were discarded. All the molar teeth were decoronated. The coronal part of each tooth was then sectioned buccolingually and mesiodistally into four sections using a high-speed diamond disc (LM Abrasivi, L. M. Pianotti S. r. l. Grugliasco, Italy) with a slow speed handpiece (Saeyang Microtech, Daegu, Korea) and air-water spray, providing a total of 72 specimens. The four sections of each tooth were identified by a number given to the corresponding tooth. They were randomly assigned to the four test groups, using block randomization method. This ensured that each tooth serves as its own control. Twenty-four sections (six in each group) were used for scanning electron microscope analysis and 48 sections (12 in each group) were used for profilometric analysis.</p><p>The enamel surface of the specimens was smoothened with an acrylic trimmer, polished with 300, 600, 1200 grit-sized sandpaper and finished with pumice slurry to obtain a flat surface. The specimens were coated with colored nail varnish leaving a window of approximately 4 mm &#x000d7; 2 mm size at the middle third and then subjected to demineralization. One half of this window (2 mm &#x000d7; 2 mm) was coated with colored nail varnish after demineralization to obtain baseline values. Dentifrice application was done in the exposed 2 mm &#x000d7; 2 mm window. The specimens were put in cassettes and kept immersed in a 300 ml demineralizing solution (pH 4.5) for 96 h and agitated intermittently to induce white spot caries-like lesions. The demineralizing solution contained 2.2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2.2 mM NaH<sub>2</sub> PO<sub>4</sub>, and 0.05M acetic acid, 1M KOH.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] The demineralization was confirmed under a stereomicroscope (Reichert Star Stereo Zoom, New York, USA).

</p><p>The specimens in Groups B, C, and D were brushed with the respective dentifrices twice daily for 2 min at 12 h intervals using a powered toothbrush (Colgate Kids Spiderman Battery Operated Toothbrush, Colgate-Palmolive Company, New York, USA) to standardize the force applied during brushing. A smear of toothpaste as recommended by American Academy of Paediatric Dentistry for children under 3 years of age was used.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] After brushing, the samples were placed in artificial saliva. All specimens, including that of the control group, were subjected to pH cycling (alternative phases of demineralization and remineralization) for a period of 4 weeks. The specimens were brushed twice a day and subjected to 3 h of demineralization twice daily, with 2 h of remineralization between the periods of demineralization.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] The teeth were placed in 50 ml artificial saliva for the rest of the day.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] The composition of artificial saliva was 2.2 g/L Gastric mucin, 0.381g/L NaCl, 0.213g/L CaCl<sub>2</sub>.2H<sub>2</sub>O, 0.738 g/L K<sub>2</sub> HPO<sub>4</sub>.3H<sub>2</sub>O, and 1.114 g/L KCl with 85% lactic acid and with pH 7 at 37&#x000b0;C.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] The remineralizing solution contained 1.5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.9 mM NaH<sub>2</sub> PO<sub>4</sub>, and 0.15M KCl with a pH of 7.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Before each cycle, the solutions were freshly prepared and the pH was measured. Separate containers were used for each group, throughout the experiment. At the end of 4 weeks, the nail varnish was peeled off from all of the specimens using cotton swabs soaked in acetone solution (1:1).</p><p>The change in surface roughness was measured using a Profilometer (Surface Roughness Tester, SJ-301, Mitutoyo, Kanagawa, Japan) with a 5-&#x003bc;m radius diamond stylus tip under 4-mN load. The stylus traveled across each window of every specimen at a velocity of 0.25 mm/s, perpendicular to the specimen surface. Three traverses of the stylus were randomly made across each window of the specimen. A sampling length of 0.25&#x02013;0.8 mm was measured. A graph representing the surface profile was obtained. The average surface roughness (R<sub>a</sub>) was the arithmetic average height of roughness-component irregularities (as represented in the graph) from the mean line measured within the sampling length (in &#x003bc;m). The profilometer was calibrated before each measuring session.</p><p>The samples were dried in a hot air oven before SEM analysis to ensure that the samples were moisture free, and care was taken to avoid any direct contact with air or moisture. The samples were covered with a carbon paper and placed on a metal mounting block, then sputtered with gold in a vacuum-closed container at high temperature. The samples were analyzed using SEM (Jeol JSM-638 OLA, Peabody, Massachusetts, USA) for surface changes. The mineral changes were assessed by EDAX carried out using an energy dispersion X-ray spectrophotometer (Jeol JSM-638 OLA, Peabody, Massachusetts, USA) at &#x000d7;2000 magnification and 20 kV voltage. The calcium, phosphate, and the fluoride content in enamel after demineralization and after 4 weeks of remineralization were quantified as atomic weight percentage. All readings were recorded by an expert examiner who was not aware of group allocation and not involved in the specimen preparation and intervention methods used in the study.</p><p>All data were analyzed using the SPSS version 16 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). Values obtained after demineralization and remineralization were entered, and descriptive statistics was tabulated. Repeated measures ANOVA were performed to check the statistical difference between the groups. Paired <italic>t</italic>-test was performed to analyze the change in the surface roughness and the mineral content after 4 weeks of remineralization within the groups.

The enamel surface appeared rough and uneven, and increased porosities were observed. A minor honeycomb pattern of demineralized enamel was observed [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. After 4 weeks of remineralization, multiple porosities and an irregular surface with slight surface precipitation of minerals were visible in the control group [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>]. All the test groups [Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>] post-remineralization revealed a layer of surface deposition of minerals obliterating the defects, filling up the rods and interrod region, showing an uneven yet more homogeneous surface compared to the control group. The enamel rods and prismatic substance were not discernable, but the areas of calcified deposits comprising of irregularly shaped fluorhydroxyapatite crystals were evident.

The results of the study confirmed the null hypothesis. During remineralization, a superficial layer of fluorapatite is formed. For prolonged anticaries effect, the fluoride needs to be released and deposited slowly and continuously over time, which can occur due to the formation of CaF<sub>2</sub> precipitation on the enamel surface. The calcium fluoride (CaF<sub>2</sub>) formed during the conversion of hydroxyapatite to fluorapatite, acts as a reservoir which slowly releases fluoride. This fluoride is available for further conversion to fluorapatite, thus enhancing remineralization.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] This explains the significant increase in fluoride content seen in the amine fluoride group after 4 weeks&#x02019; exposure to the dentifrice. However, it was not significantly different from other dentifrices which was contrary to the results of other studies which claim superior remineralizing effect of amine fluoride-containing dentifrices.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] The difference in results could be due to variation in methodological aspects such as the type of substrate used, characteristics of the artificial enamel lesion formed, and the pH cycling model used.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Amine fluoride also has the advantage of antiplaque effect which results in inhibition of bacterial adhesion due to its amine (organic) component. Furthermore, the tensioactive property of the amine component favors the accumulation of fluoride close to the tooth surface providing a sustained fluoride release.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] The monofluorophosphate in the sodium monofluorophosphate-containing dentifrice directly reacts with hydroxyapatite to form fluorapatite without the formation of CaF<sub>2</sub>.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] The monofluorophosphate undergoes hydrolysis into phosphate and fluoride ions. The fluoride is incorporated into the apatite crystal to form fluorapatite in an exchange with orthophosphate.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] The hydrolysis of monofluorophosphate is catalyzed by salivary enzymes which decrease the effectiveness of monofluorophosphate-containing dentifrice in an <italic>in vitro</italic> study design.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Thus, the lack of superiority of sodium monofluorophosphate dentifrice in remineralization of enamel lesions as per the results of this study should be interpreted with caution.</p><p>Ca/P of 1.6 is considered optimal for enamel remineralization. However, in plaque fluid, the Ca/P is approximately 0.3, indicating the presence of an excess of phosphate. Therefore, calcium is considered the major mineral required for remineralization, and an increase in Ca/P is considered favorable for remineralization.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] In the Anticay<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> group, the calcium and phosphate ions that are released into the solution increase the rate of remineralization due to the common ion effect. The sucrose phosphate ions are adsorbed on the enamel surface which helps in decreasing the rate of acid dissolution of hydroxyapatite.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] However, no significant increase after remineralization could be seen in the Ca/P in the Anticay&#x000ae; group in this study although it showed a maximum increase compared to other groups. There was a decrease in fluoride content after 4 weeks of remineralization. Thus, the soluble calcium and phosphates due to nonavailability of fluoride ions were unable to substantially localize at the tooth surface to produce effective concentration gradients for better remineralization than the other two fluoride-containing dentifrices.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Considering that there was no significant difference in the remineralizing effectiveness between the groups, calcium sucrose phosphate with inorganic orthophosphate (Anticay<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>)-based dentifrice can be an alternative for fluoride dentifrices, especially in children below 6 years of age who are at risk for dental fluorosis due to their tendency to swallow dentifrices.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>Profilometry is an effective method of measuring the surface roughness of a specimen quantitatively in micrometers. Surface roughness not only affects the esthetic properties of a tooth but also gives an idea about the susceptibility to plaque retention or bacterial adhesion.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] All the test groups showed a decrease in the surface roughness post-remineralization suggestive of the deposition of minerals into the porous defects[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] as confirmed by SEM images and an increase in the mineral content as seen in the EDAX analysis. A certain amount of remineralization was seen in the control group as there is a tendency for the minerals to diffuse out and supersaturate on the surface during demineralization and also due to immersion of the specimens in the remineralizing solution and artificial saliva.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>In this study, sections from the same molar were used in four different groups after random allocation which simulated the split-mouth design, <italic>in vivo</italic>. Such a study design enabled each tooth to serve as its own control and any change observed can be attributed to the dentifrice so that confounding variables such as variations in enamel structure or composition between the teeth of different individuals are eliminated, thus minimizing bias.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] The pH cycling model used in this study helps to simulate conditions in the oral cavity and mimic the dynamics of the mineral loss and gain during caries process.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] <italic>In vitro</italic> studies have several advantages such as the smaller sample size required, maintenance of high-level scientific control, and lower variability in the samples.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] However, the study has its limitations due to the design.
