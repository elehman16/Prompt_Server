Figures from the World Health Organization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] indicate that in those &#x0003e;60&#x000a0;years of age, 9.6&#x000a0;% of men, and 18.0&#x000a0;% of women will have some symptoms of OA, and pain is likely to be the most troublesome symptom. Swedish guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], in common with other countries such as the UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], recommend paracetamol and/or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for the initial treatment of OA pain. However, NSAIDs are not suitable in the elderly population because they increase the risk of gastric ulcers, kidney dysfunction, increased blood pressure, and heart failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. If the initial treatment regimen does not provide adequate pain relief, second-line treatment with a low-potency opioid analgesic is suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>The availability of low-dose buprenorphine patches makes them a candidate for this second-line treatment according to these guidelines, and the transdermal route of administration is suitable in the elderly population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Adverse events (AEs), common among opioids, include the risk of respiratory depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], suppressed immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], effect on the gonadal hormones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], and a possible contribution to the induction of hyperalgesia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Buprenorphine has a ceiling effect for respiratory depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], which confers a greater safety margin against this serious AE. Buprenorphine does not cause immunosuppression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], has no effect on hormone levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], and has a pronounced antihyperalgesic effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Also, buprenorphine clearance is only dependent on renal function to a limited degree, making it appropriate for use in those with impaired renal function in whom no dose adjustment is necessary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Finally, in common with other opioids, if needed, its effects can be completely reversed by naloxone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>All these factors combined indicate that buprenorphine patches can be considered a particularly suitable method of pain relief in the elderly. A possible caveat could possibly be increased transdermal bioavailability or decreased elimination in the elderly. To investigate these concerns, this study was compared the PK (PK) of buprenorphine patches in elderly (&#x02265; 75&#x000a0;years) and younger (50-60&#x000a0;years) individuals.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Overview and study design</title><p>This was a single-center, multiple-dose, open-label, parallel-group, phase 1 study conducted to characterize the PK of buprenorphine 5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/h transdermal patch. The low-dose strength and short treatment period (2&#x000a0;weeks) were decided upon in order to limit the number of AEs that might occur and to increase compliance. The study was designed and conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice guidelines, received ethics approval from an independent ethics committee in Stockholm, Sweden, and was conducted between 7 January 2010 (first participant first visit) and 26 March (last participant last visit) 2010 by a contract research organization [Trial Form Support (TSF) AB, Sweden] on behalf of Mundipharma AB, Sweden.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study participants and setting</title><p>Of the 89 participants enrolled, 74 were randomized into the study and were split into two groups depending on age (younger: 50-60&#x000a0;years; elderly: &#x02265; 75&#x000a0;years). There were 37 participants in each group, and a minimum of 72 (36 in each group) were required for evaluation. To enter into the study, all participants had to provide informed consent and inclusion/exclusion criteria had to be fulfilled. Inclusion criteria were men and aged 50&#x02013;60&#x000a0;years of age in one group and &#x02265;75&#x000a0;years in the other group, at a ratio of 1:1. Exclusion criteria were history of or ongoing chronic condition requiring frequent analgesic therapy (e.g., OA, frequent headaches, frequent migraine, gout, rheumatoid arthritis); individuals on ongoing opioid treatment or had been on opioid treatment during the 3 months prior to the screening visit; any recent history of frequent nausea or emesis regardless of etiology.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Treatments</title><p>All participants received treatment with two consecutive buprenorphine 5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/h transdermal patches (Norspan&#x000ae; Mundipharma). In the first week, the patch was applied to the right upper outer arm on day 0 and was removed a week later, on day 7. The second patch was applied on day 7 on the left upper outer arm and removed on day 14. The patches were applied and removed by study-site staff. Application site was to be on nonirritated, intact skin without scars and relatively hairless, or hair was to be removed with scissors, not shaven. The area was to be clean (cleaned with water only, if needed; no soap, alcohol, oil, lotion, or abrasive devices) and dry before application. Upon application, the patch was pressed firmly in place for up to 30&#x000a0;s to ensure contact was complete. Should the patch start to peel at any stage during the week, it was to be stuck down with skin tape. Study participants were allowed to shower, not bathe, but had to refrain from showering until the day after the patch application and were not allowed to wash or rub the site of the patch application. Medication or substances that were not allowed, such as alcohol and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), were listed in the exclusion criteria. Any substance metabolized via cytochrome (CY)P3A4, including grapefruit juice, was also prohibited throughout the study period.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Pharmacokinetic evaluations</title><p>Blood samples (6&#x000a0;ml each) were collected for PK analysis on day 7 (predose) and days 8, 9, 10, 12, and 14 [e.g., at 0 (predose), 24, 48, 72, 120, 168 (&#x000b1;2&#x000a0;hours)] and were analyzed under blinded conditions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Buprenorphine assay in plasma</title><p>A sensitive and highly specific method of determining buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine in human plasma using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) with electrospray ionization was validated. Following solid-phase extraction using mixed-mode cation-exchange extraction plates, samples were evaporated to dryness under nitrogen at 50&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C before reconstitution in acetonitrile and injection onto the LC-MS/MS system. An ultraperformance LC (UPLC) system with a C18 1.7-&#x003bc;m acquity (100&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;2.1&#x000a0;mm i.d.) reversed-phase column was used for chromatographic separation, together with a mixture of acetonitrile and 10&#x000a0;mM ammonium formate buffer (pH 3) as the mobile phase. The lower limit of quantification (LLQ) was 25&#x000a0;pg/ml for buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine, with calibration curves linear over the range for buprenorphine (25&#x02013;25,000&#x000a0;pg/ml) and norbuprenorphine (25&#x02013;10,000&#x000a0;pg/ml). The mass spectrometer used was a Sciex API 5000, and nominal masses for precursor/product ions were 468/396&#x000a0;m/z for buprenorphine and 414/101&#x000a0;mass-to-change ratio (m/z) for norbuprenorphine. Buprenorphine-D4 and norbuprenorphine-D9 were used as internal standards, and recoveries were between 76&#x000a0;% and 82&#x000a0;%, respectively; intrabatch precision and accuracy were &#x02264;&#x02009;6.1&#x000a0;% and &#x02264;&#x000a0;&#x000b1; 6.8&#x000a0;% for buprenorphine and &#x02264;&#x02009;10.8&#x000a0;% and &#x02264;&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;14.0&#x000a0;% for norbuprenorphine.

In order for data from these participants to be included in the analysis, and to ensure that mean parameters were not reported as being artificially high due to exclusion of these values, all plasma concentration levels of buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine below the LLQ (&#x0003c; 25&#x000a0;pg/ml) were presented as half (12.5&#x000a0;pg/ml) of the LLQ. This was done before PK analysis was carried out. Plasma concentrations were used to calculate the area under the plasma concentration-time curve measured from the time of dosing over one dosing interval at steady state (AUC<sub>tau</sub>), maximum observed plasma concentration measured over one dosing interval at steady state (C<sub>maxss</sub> ), minimum observed plasma concentration measured over one dosing interval at steady state (C<sub>minss</sub>), and the fluctuation index (FI). AUC<sub>tau</sub> was determined using the linear trapezoidal method. C<sub>maxss</sub> and C<sub>minss</sub> were obtained directly from reported data. FI was determined from the ratio of C<sub>maxss</sub> to C<sub>minss</sub>. The primary PK comparison was based on the PK variable AUC<sub>tau</sub> of buprenorphine at steady state. Secondary PK comparisons were based on the AUC<sub>tau</sub> of norbuprenorphine and C<sub>maxss</sub>, C<sub>minss</sub>, and FI of both analytes (buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine). All PK calculations were conducted by Mundipharma Research Limited using WinNonlin Enterprise&#x000ae; version 4.1, Pharsight, Mountain View, CA, USA.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Safety evaluations</title><p>During the trial, AEs were recorded, and safety was monitored continuously. Standard laboratory safety tests (hematology, clinical chemistry, urinalysis), and assessment of vital signs and electrocardiograms (ECG) were performed at screening, end of treatment (day 14), and the follow-up visit (urinalysis was not carried out at follow-up). A physical examination was carried out at screening, day 14, and the follow-up visit (day 21).</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>The sample size for this study was chosen to compare ratios of AUC<sub>tau</sub> between the two age groups. A previous phase 1 study (unpublished data) provided an estimated SD for the log-transformed AUC<sub>tau</sub> of 0.318. Therefore, 72 participants (36 in each age group) would be needed to provide 80&#x000a0;% power to obtain a 90&#x000a0;% confidence interval (CI) for the ratio that lay between 80&#x000a0;% and 125&#x000a0;%. It was assumed there would be some withdrawals, so approximately 90 potential participants were needed to achieve 72 actual participants for evaluation. The enrolled population all provided written informed consent. The safety population had the buprenorphine patch applied, with at least one safety assessment after patch application; the full analysis set (FAS) for PK metrics all had at least one PK metric calculated. The following protocol violations excluded a participant from the FAS: failure to comply with the inclusion/exclusion criteria, significant failure to comply with the treatment regime, significant deviation from the study schedule where treatment duration or visit intervals were significantly different to the schedule in the protocol, and failure to collect data for the primary endpoint as detailed in the protocol (i.e., one or more PK blood sample was missing).</p><p>The primary objective of this study was to determine whether elderly individuals (&#x02265;75&#x000a0;years) have similar PKs to younger individuals (50-60&#x000a0;years) when treated with buprenorphine transdermal patches. For the primary PK variable (buprenorphine AUC<sub>tau</sub>), the following null hypothesis (H<sub>0</sub>) was tested versus the alternative hypothesis (H<sub>1</sub>): H<sub>0</sub> (R&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;80&#x000a0;%) or (R&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;125&#x000a0;%), H<sub>1</sub> 80&#x000a0;%&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;R&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;125&#x000a0;% , where R&#x02009;=&#x02009;ratio of buprenorphine AUC<sub>tau</sub> geometric mean levels at steady state between the elderly and the younger age populations. Log-transformed data of AUC<sub>tau</sub> were modelled using linear regression with a fixed term for age group, which is identical to a simple<italic> t</italic> test comparing age groups. Ratios between age groups and their associated 90&#x000a0;% CIs were calculated by back-transforming estimates from the linear regression from the logarithmic scale to the original scale. A statistically significant result of bioequivalence between age groups was to be concluded if the 90&#x000a0;% CI for the ratio of mean AUC<sub>tau</sub> comparing age groups lay between 80&#x000a0;% and 125&#x000a0;%. This method is equivalent to two one-sided tests at the 5&#x000a0;% significance level, requiring rejection of both hypotheses (R&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;80&#x000a0;%) and (R&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;125&#x000a0;%) to state bioequivalence. The secondary PK variables (AUC<sub>tau</sub> of norbuprenorphine and C<sub>maxss</sub>, C<sub>minss</sub>, and FI of both buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine) were analyzed using the same equivalence limits and the same method as for the primary PK variable.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Participant demographics and disposition</title><p>Eighty-nine participants were enrolled in the study, and 74 were randomized to treatment with buprenorphine patches (37 in the younger age group and 37 in the older age group). Fifteen were excluded from the randomized population because they either did not meet the inclusion criteria or they met the exclusion criteria. The safety population and the FAS were used for analysis. The safety population included all 37 participants in each group. Demographic data for all participants in the safety population is given in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, which shows that there were no notable differences between groups apart from age (as required by the study) and sex. Unequal gender distribution is a factor in OA as more women than men suffer from the condition. The FAS included 36 participants in each group. One participant from each group was excluded because they deviated from the study schedule with regards to the intervals between visits; for one participant in the elderly group, the day-7 visit was carried out 1 day too early, meaning the patch was removed prematurely and assessments were carried out on the wrong day; and one participant in the younger group failed to comply with the treatment regimen. Therefore, these individuals were excluded from the FAS. Two participants did not have the full 14-day exposure to the buprenorphine patch; in addition to the aforementioned participant who removed the patch 1 day prematurely, one further participant left the study due to AEs, which were reported the day following treatment initiation. Thus, almost all participants (97.3&#x000a0;%) had the patches attached for the entire 2-week study duration. Compliance was not formally assessed but could be assumed on the basis of the determined plasma concentrations of buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine. Patch-wear observations were also carried out on days 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, and 14.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Summary of demographic data (safety population)</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th>Statistic</th><th>Younger (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;37)</th><th>Elderly (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;37)</th><th>Total (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;74)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="2">Age (years)</td><td>Mean (SD)</td><td>53.8 (3.1)</td><td>78.7 (3.3)</td><td>66.3 (12.9)</td></tr><tr><td>Min, max</td><td>50, 60</td><td>75, 91</td><td>50, 91</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">Sex</td><td>Male</td><td>12 (32.4%)</td><td>8 (21.6%)</td><td>20 (27.0%)</td></tr><tr><td>Female</td><td>25 (67.6%)</td><td>29 (78.4%)</td><td>54 (73.0%)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="7">Body mass index (kg/m<sup>2</sup>)</td><td>Mean (SD)</td><td>26.48 (3.78)</td><td>25.82 (3.97)</td><td>26.15 (3.87)</td></tr><tr><td>Min, max</td><td>20.1, 35.7</td><td>18.2, 34.0</td><td>18.2, 35.7</td></tr><tr><td>&#x0003c;18.5</td><td/><td>1 (2.7%)</td><td>1 (1.4%)</td></tr><tr><td>18.5 to &#x0003c;25</td><td>15 (40.5%)</td><td>18 (48.6%)</td><td>33 (44.6%)</td></tr><tr><td>25 to &#x0003c;30</td><td>14 (37.8%)</td><td>13 (35.1%)</td><td>27 (36.5%)</td></tr><tr><td>30 to &#x0003c;35</td><td>7 (18.9%)</td><td>5 (13.5%)</td><td>12 (16.2%)</td></tr><tr><td>35 to &#x0003c;40</td><td>1 (2.7%)</td><td/><td>1 (1.4%)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">Cigarette smoker</td><td>No</td><td>32 (86.5%)</td><td>34 (91.9%)</td><td>66 (89.2%)</td></tr><tr><td>Yes</td><td>5 (13.5%)</td><td>3 (8.1%)</td><td>8 (10.8%)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><italic>SD</italic> standard deviation</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Pharmacokinetic evaluations</title><p>When plasma concentrations for buprenorphine were examined, mean concentrations in the younger participants were slightly higher than in the elderly participants (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Mean plasma concentrations for buprenorphine for each group.

The most common AEs in both groups were nausea, constipation, fatigue, dizziness, and headache, and all were reported by more participants in younger than in the elderly group. Most AEs were mild (250) or moderate (111) in severity; there were only 19 severe AEs, which were generally typical of the most commonly reported AEs and mostly reported by younger participants. No serious AEs were reported, but one participant in the younger group discontinued the study due to nausea and vomiting.

It was important to investigate the PKs of buprenorphine in this population due to the fact that the elderly often have altered pharmacodynamics (PD) and PK because of their age, and also, perhaps, due to other conditions that are more prevalent in the elderly population. A first step in studying the possible difference in effects across the age range is to determine PKs, thereby allowing the PK effects to be teased out from the influence of PDs.</p><p>This study determined that the average buprenorphine exposure at steady state is only slightly lower for the elderly than for the younger population However, a relatively high level of variability was noted in individual plasma profiles, and the 90&#x000a0;% CIs did not meet the 80&#x02013;125&#x000a0;% bioequivalence criteria. Similarly, bioequivalence was not demonstrated for secondary buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine PK parameters, except for AUC<sub>tau</sub> at steady state for norbuprenorphine. Again, the ratio of elderly to younger values was relatively close to 1 for all parameters (in the range 80&#x02013;112&#x000a0;%), but confidence intervals were wide due to large interparticipant variability. More AEs were reported by younger individuals (216 AEs) than elderly participants (164 AEs). The reason for this is at present unknown but may be due to levels of exposure, as buprenorphine concentrations were, in general, higher in the blood of the younger participants. All except four AEs were treatment related.</p><p>Though bioequivalence was not formally proven between elderly and younger participants in this study, the systemic exposure to buprenorphine was sufficiently similar between groups, particularly given the large interindividual differences, which are not to be a decisive dosing factor in the clinic. There is an on-going study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of buprenorphine patches between elderly and younger populations in a clinical setting (EudraCT No. 2010-020748-37), but other studies have also examined buprenorphine use in the elderly. Likar et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] carried out a study of buprenorphine patches in patients with OA who were &#x02265;65&#x000a0;years and compared results with patients &#x0003c;65&#x000a0;years. The patches were found to be at least as effective in the elderly group in relieving pain, with no age-related differences in safety and with comparable plasma concentrations. The results seen by Likar et al.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] were similar to those seen for PK and safety seen in another phase 1 study with buprenorphine patches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Also, a long-term (6-month) study of buprenorphine patches versus placebo in OA patients &#x0003e;40&#x000a0;years (average approximately 63&#x000a0;years) previously na&#x000ef;ve to opioids was carried out by Breivik et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Though the primary objective was not statistically significant (24-h Western Ontario and McMaster Osteoarthritis Index of pain), the addition of buprenorphine patches (5&#x02013;20&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g) provided greater relief of daytime movement-related pain compared with NSAIDs or Cox-2 selective inhibitors plus paracetamol. The impression of participants&#x02019; improvement at the end of 6&#x000a0;months was also significantly better with the addition of buprenorphine. Increasing age induces various changes in physiology, with changes to the skin, including reduced dermal absorption, compromised vascular response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], and changes to hydration and lipidic structure. However, there is little evidence to suggest significant differences in transdermal absorption in the elderly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>Although there were a high number of AEs in our study, this was not unexpected, and the events were consistent with the expected AE profile of opioid analgesics. Elderly individuals tolerated the patches at least as well as the younger individuals. AEs were generally mild or moderate, and this study, along with others, demonstrated good adherence to buprenorphine patch treatment compared with other opioids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], indicating a net gain of pain relief versus occurrence of any AEs and pointing toward a positive risk&#x02013;benefit ratio.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Although we did not prove bioequivalence of PK parameters between younger and elderly individuals, this study may suggest that no dosage alterations are necessary for PK reasons when treating elderly people with buprenorphine transdermal patches.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This manuscript was written with the assistance of Hazel Olway and Karen Paine from Mundipharma Research Limited, in accordance with the European Medical Writers&#x02019; Association (EMWA) guidelines.</p><sec id="d29e1250"><title>Funding sources</title><p>This study was funded by Mundipharma AB and Mundipharma International.</p></sec><sec id="d29e1255"><title>Conflicts of interest disclosure</title><p>Nabil Al-Tawil, Ingegerd Odar-Cederl&#x000f6;f, and Jan Persson have no competing interests or other disclosures.
