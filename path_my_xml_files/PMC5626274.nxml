Seventy-two patients were included, and were randomly allocated to an intervention group or a control group at a 1:1 ratio. All patients met the inclusion and exclusion criteria and provided written informed consent.</p><p>This study included the patients under American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I-III aged from 20 to 70 years, 50 to 80&#x0200a;kg in mass. All patients were scheduled for elective modified radical mastectomy with axillary dissection. Patients were excluded if they were allergic to the study drugs; or had conduction abnormalities, bleeding diathesis, prior breast surgery, neurological disease or psychiatric illness, maternal cardiovascular disease, severe liver or renal diseases, pregnant, or breast-breeding.</p><p>The randomization of this study was performed using a SAS 8.1 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC) computerized number generator, and the assignments were masked to the participants, investigators, outcome assessors, and data analysts in this study.</p><p>All participants were recruited from the department of the obstetrics and gynecology at The Affiliated Hongqi Hospital of Mudanjiang Medical University. All patients were randomly divided into an intervention and a control group after confirmation of breast cancer diagnosis. All researchers and investigators were trained before this study.</p><p>All patients in both groups received general anesthesia. It was induced by 1.5&#x0200a;&#x003bc;g/kg fentanyl, 2 to 3&#x0200a;mg/kg propofol, and 1.5&#x0200a;mg/kg lidocaine. Endotracheal intubation was facilitated with 0.15&#x0200a;mg/kg cisatracurium. After intubation, anesthesia was maintained using 1 to 1.5 MAC isoflurane. Doses of 0.5&#x0200a;&#x003bc;g/kg fentanyl and 0.03&#x0200a;mg/kg cisatracurium were administered as necessary.</p><p>In addition, patients in the control group received 20&#x0200a;mL of 0.25% bupivacaine paravertebrally, which was divided into 3- to 4-mL aliquots in each level. The participants in the intervention group received 20&#x0200a;mL of 0.25% bupivacaine and 1&#x0200a;&#x003bc;g/kg dexmedetomidine paravertebrally, divided into 3- to 4-mL aliquots in each level. The block was administrated over 10 to 15&#x0200a;minutes. The block success was tested by decreased pin prick sensation at the expected dermatomal level. After the block, the patient was immediately placed in the supine position.</p><p>Heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were measured during surgery at 0, 30, 60, and 120&#x0200a;minutes. In addition, HR and pain [using the visual analogue scale (VAS)] were measured and evaluated immediately at 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, and 48&#x0200a;hours after surgery. The time of initial administration and the mean use of analgesic were also evaluated. Adverse events (AEs) after surgery were also recorded.</p><sec><label>2.1</label><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The estimated sample size was 30 participants in each group; &#x003b1;&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.05 (2-sided) and &#x003b2;&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.20. Assuming a 20% dropout rate, at least 72 patients should be recruited for this study, with 36 in each group. All outcome data were analyzed using an intention-to-treat approach. Analysis of variance (ANOVA), Bonferroni, Friedman, and Wilcoxon rank tests with relative risks and 95% confidence intervals were used for data analysis. <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003c;&#x0200a;.05 was considered significant.</p></sec></sec><sec><label>3</label><title>Results</title><p>Ninety-six patients with breast cancer undergoing surgery were initially recruited (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).

One study reported that the adjunctive fentanyl or clonidine to the levobupivacaine (0.05%) has promising effect of analgesics. In addition, such intervention can significantly reduce the consumption of supplemental postoperative morphine in patients with breast cancer surgery.<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> The other study noted that both rescue analgesic consumption and cumulative pain scores were significantly lower at rest and during movement in the treatment groups.<sup>[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup> Another study demonstrated that the addition of 1&#x0200a;&#x003bc;g/kg dexmedetomidine to 0.25% bupivacaine in thoracic PVB in patients undergoing a modified radical mastectomy improved the quality and duration of analgesia and provided an analgesic sparing effect with no serious side effects.<sup>[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup> The results of our study are consistent with the previous study.<sup>[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup></p><p>In this study, we demonstrated that participants who received general anesthesia and TPVBRA with bupivacaine and dexmedetomidine showed superior postoperative analgesia, prolongation of the time to initial rescue analgesic requirement, and decreased total intravenous tramadol consumption compared with patients who received general anesthesia combined with TPVBRA and bupivacaine alone in the first 48&#x0200a;hours after breast cancer surgery.</p><p>Although positive results were achieved in this study, it still had several limitations. First, the sample size was quite small, which may have affected the results. Second, this study was only conducted at 1 center at The Affiliated Hongqi Hospital of Mudanjiang Medical University, and all patients were of Han Chinese ethnicity, which may influence the generalizability of this finding to other ethnicities and other hospitals. Third, patients also received general anesthesia, which may have affected this study; the observed effect may have been the result of the synergistic effect of general anesthesia with bupivacaine and dexmedetomidine, or of bupivacaine alone.</p></sec><sec><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study found that TPVBRA combined with bupivacaine and dexmedetomidine had a positive effect on anesthesia and had similar safety in breast cancer patients compared with the control treatment.
