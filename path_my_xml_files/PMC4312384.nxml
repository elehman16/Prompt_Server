In a phase 2 trial, ODN 50&#x000a0;mg once weekly reduced bone resorption while preserving bone formation and progressively increased BMD over 5&#x000a0;years. We describe the phase III Long-Term ODN Fracture Trial (LOFT), an event-driven, randomized, blinded placebo-controlled trial, with preplanned interim analyses to permit early termination if significant fracture risk reduction was demonstrated. An extension was planned, with participants remaining on their randomized treatment for up to 5&#x000a0;years, then transitioning to open-label ODN.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The three primary outcomes were radiologically determined vertebral, hip, and clinical non-vertebral fractures. Secondary end points included clinical vertebral fractures, BMD, bone turnover markers, and safety and tolerability, including bone histology. Participants were women, 65&#x000a0;years or older, with a BMD T-score &#x02264;&#x02212;2.5 at the total hip (TH) or femoral neck (FN) or with a prior radiographic vertebral fracture and a T-score &#x02264;&#x02212;1.5 at the TH or FN. They were randomized to ODN or placebo tablets. All received weekly vitamin D<sub>3</sub> (5600&#x000a0;international units (IU)) and daily calcium supplements as needed to ensure a daily intake of approximately 1200&#x000a0;mg.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Altogether, 16,713 participants were randomized at 387 centers. After a planned interim analysis, an independent data monitoring committee recommended that the study be stopped early due to robust efficacy and a favorable benefit/risk profile. Following the base study closeout, 8256 participants entered the study extension.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This report details the background and study design of this fracture end point trial and describes the baseline characteristics of its participants.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s00198-014-2944-6) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Cathepsin K</kwd><kwd>Fracture</kwd><kwd>Odanacatib</kwd><kwd>Osteoporosis</kwd><kwd>Postmenopausal</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; International Osteoporosis Foundation and National Osteoporosis Foundation 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Osteoporosis is a metabolic bone disease characterized by a chronic excess of bone resorption relative to bone formation, leading to progressive bone loss, deterioration of bone microarchitecture, and increased risk of fracture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p>Bone formation and resorption are tightly coordinated during the remodeling cycle. Osteocytes exhibit a mechanosensory capacity and are major regulators of bone remodeling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Osteoclast-mediated bone resorption releases growth factors from the bone matrix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] that increase osteoblast progenitor number, recruitment, differentiation, and activity. In addition, osteoclasts regulate osteoblasts directly via cell-cell contact [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and by secreting additional factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] that increase osteoblast number and/or activity. Osteoclast number and activity are regulated by receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL), a membrane-bound protein produced by neighboring osteocytes and osteoblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Thus, the products of osteoclast activity play a key role in the complex interactive regulation of bone remodeling.</p><p>With the exception of parathyroid hormone (PTH) and its analogs, all agents currently used in the treatment of osteoporosis, such as bisphosphonates, selective estrogen receptor modulators, and the anti-RANKL antibody, act primarily by decreasing osteoclast-mediated bone resorption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], allowing osteoblasts to increase bone mass by filling in the remodeling space [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Furthermore, slower bone remodeling allows increased bone mineralization, at least for some agents, and leads to a reduction in cortical porosity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. However, inhibition of osteoclast activity also leads to a secondary reduction in bone formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], limiting the ultimate increase in bone mass.</p><p>The mechanism of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption is well characterized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Osteoclasts attach to the bone surface and secrete hydrogen ions and proteolytic enzymes into the remodeling space. The acidic environment dissolves bone mineral and exposes bone matrix proteins. Cathepsin K (CatK) is the primary osteoclast-produced protease involved in the degradation of type I collagen and other bone matrix proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]; its pH optimum is in the range of the acidic remodeling space.</p><p>Congenital absence of CatK in humans results in pycnodysostosis, a rare autosomal recessive osteochondrodysplasia. This disease is characterized not only by high bone mass but also increased risk of fractures and bone deformities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Importantly, the increased fragility and bone deformities are not present in heterozygotes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Targeted disruption of the CatK gene in mice produced a high bone mass phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] while overexpression of CatK increased bone turnover and decreased trabecular bone volume [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>The effect of CatK inhibition has been studied in estrogen-deficient non-human primates and rabbits. In these studies, CatK inhibitors significantly reduced bone resorption while relatively preserving bone formation, resulting in both increased BMD and bone strength, in contrast to congenital absence of CatK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. CatK inhibition decreased the removal of bone matrix protein but did not reduce osteoclast number or affect other osteoclast activities, such as the production of osteoblast-stimulating factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>Odanacatib (ODN, MK-0822) is a selective, orally administered CatK inhibitor. Unlike basic CatK inhibitors, ODN is neutral, so it does not accumulate in the acidic environment of lysosomes, which could lead to off-target inhibition of other cathepsins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. ODN is metabolized by CYP3A4, has an apparent terminal half-life of approximately 40 to 80&#x000a0;h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], and its absorption is not impaired by food intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>A phase IIb dose-ranging trial and its extensions have demonstrated progressive dose-dependent increases in BMD in postmenopausal women with low BMD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. ODN substantially reduced biochemical markers of bone resorption. However, markers of bone formation decreased to a lesser degree than was previously observed with other anti-resorptive treatments and returned towards baseline within 2&#x000a0;years, on continued treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Histomorphometry of bone biopsies from participants in the phase IIb study indicated that osteoclast number was maintained [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], confirming preclinical results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Lack of reduction of serum TRAP5b levels with ODN treatment in the phase IIb trial confirmed osteoclast viability. Discontinuation of ODN treatment resulted in increased bone turnover and reduction in BMD, which returned to baseline within 1 to 2&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Based on BMD data after 12&#x000a0;months from the phase IIb trial, ODN 50&#x000a0;mg once weekly was selected as the dosing regimen for the phase III trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>A prospective study was designed to assess the anti-fracture efficacy and safety of ODN in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.

They were given 5600 international units (IU) of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> weekly and calcium supplements as needed to ensure a total daily calcium intake of approximately 1200&#x000a0;mg. A dietary calcium questionnaire was administered at intake and at yearly intervals during the trial. Following screening and randomization visits, study visits in the clinic were scheduled every 3&#x000a0;months in the first year of the study and every 6&#x000a0;months thereafter.

It employed a placebo control group, consistent with previous and current registration trials of drugs for that indication. This approach has been the subject of extensive discussion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], including a US FDA Advisory Committee Meeting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] which provided a frame of reference for recent trial design. Placebo-controlled pivotal trials in osteoporosis were considered acceptable, provided that appropriate limits are placed on the severity of disease in those individuals who could otherwise be treated with available medication. Background treatment with adequate calcium and vitamin D<sub>3</sub> intake for all participants was also regarded as an important consideration. Limits regarding the range of acceptable BMD and fractures prior to study entry as well as monitoring for excessive on-study bone density decreases have been generally consistent in more recently completed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] and ongoing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] phase III trials.</p><p>Accordingly, the present study excluded participants at relatively high risk for fracture, using specific criteria based on BMD and prior fracture history, and employed safeguards to protect participant safety. The trial was overseen by an external data monitoring committee (DMC) that periodically reviewed unblinded safety data. BMD was measured yearly and identified participants with excessive bone loss (EBL) (predefined as &#x0003e;7&#x000a0;% from baseline at any time at the LS or TH). If the decrease was confirmed, the participant was then discontinued from study medication and treated conventionally. Adverse events of interest were referred for adjudication by panels of experts with relevant scientific expertise (see section on &#x0201c;<xref rid="Sec15" ref-type="sec">Adverse event reporting and adjudication</xref>&#x0201d;).</p><p>The study was powered to detect a significant effect of ODN to reduce the risk of hip fractures. Because of the safety criteria at enrollment, the baseline individual hip fracture risk in the study population was limited. Hence, the sample size estimate was about twice that of the largest osteoporosis trial. The event-driven design of the study allowed for some uncertainty in the estimate of the rate at which participants would experience fracture events.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Recruitment, follow-up, and assessments</title><sec id="Sec6"><title>Recruitment</title><p>Informed consent was obtained from all study participants before any study procedure was performed. It was required that a qualified physician discuss alternative treatment options with each participant. At the request of a regulatory agency, participant enrollment was conducted in two phases to allow expansion of the safety experience for ODN before the entire study was enrolled.</p><p>The first phase (the lead cohort) randomized 1499 participants between November 2007 and March 2008. After 9&#x000a0;months of treatment, the lead cohort safety data were evaluated by the DMC (see below for details), which recommended that the enrollment of the remainder of the participants (the main cohort) could commence. The enrollment of 15,214 participants in the main cohort occurred from January to November 2009 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Thus, a total of 16,713 women were recruited at 387 investigational sites in 40 countries.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>CONSORT Diagram.

The sponsor determined that these findings warranted exclusion of that site&#x02019;s data from the primary efficacy and safety analyses and informed the US FDA. (All data, including those excluded from the primary analyses, are to be provided in regulatory submissions). Data from 483 participants were affected, including 111 in the lead cohort.

Thus, the number of evaluable participants was 16,071, including 1373 in the lead cohort.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Randomization and stratification</title><p>Randomization was performed by a computer-generated allocation schedule using an interactive voice recognition system (IVRS), which randomly assigned each participant to ODN or placebo. Participants were assigned to one of two strata, according to vertebral fracture status. Participants without prior vertebral fracture were assigned to the no-prior-vertebral-fracture stratum. At least two thirds of the participants in the no-prior-fracture stratum were required to be at least 70&#x000a0;years of age. Participants with a prior vertebral fracture were assigned to the prior-vertebral fracture stratum. IVRS was used to keep track of enrollment and the number of participants randomized into each stratum and to close a stratum as needed. IVRS was also available for emergency unblinding if this were required for an individual participant&#x02019;s safety.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Blinding</title><p>Study participants, investigators and their staff, and sponsor&#x02019;s personnel were blinded to treatment allocation. Only the DMC and support statistical personnel (see below) had access to unblinded data.

Follow-up assessments were conducted as follows: limited physical examination including vital signs and laboratory assessment every 3&#x000a0;months during the first year, and then every 6&#x000a0;months. Drug accounting and AE assessments were performed at every visit. Lateral spine radiographs were performed at baseline, month 6, month 12, and every 12&#x000a0;months thereafter. BMD was measured at baseline and yearly thereafter. Height was assessed using a calibrated stadiometer at baseline and yearly.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Radiographic vertebral fracture assessment</title><p>Spine radiographs were evaluated at a central site (Synarc, Newark, CA, USA). Screening spine radiographs were evaluated for the presence or absence of a vertebral fracture using the Genant semi-quantitative scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Only vertebral fractures in the region T4 to L4 were counted. Participants with Genant grade 1&#x02013;3 deformities (mild, moderate, or severe) were included in the stratum with prior vertebral fracture.</p><p>Follow-up radiographs were evaluated to detect incident (new or worsening) vertebral fractures, first using the Genant semi-quantitative method and upon detection of a fracture, morphometric analysis for confirmation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>BMD measurements</title><p>BMD was measured using Lunar, Hologic, or Norland densitometers, at femoral sites (total hip, femoral neck, and trochanter) and the lumbar spine in all participants and at the 1/3 radius and total body (excluding head) in a randomly selected 10&#x000a0;% subset of participants from sites with appropriate equipment.

Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D, PTH, and biochemical markers of bone turnover were measured in the same subset of participants who underwent 1/3 radius and total body DXA measurements as described above. The following bone turnover markers were measured by Synarc Labs (Lyon, France) on specimens obtained in the fasting state: urinary N-telopeptides of type I collagen (NTx, VITROS ECL/ECIQ, Ortho Clinical Diagnostics, Rochester NY, USA), serum C-telopeptides of type I collagen (CTx, Elecsys-CrossLaps/serum ECL, Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim Germany), serum procollagen type 1 N-terminal propeptide (P1NP, Elecsys/serum ECL kit, Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim Germany), and serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP, Access Ostase, Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA). Fasting urine and serum specimens were archived from each participant at all visits.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Bone biopsy</title><p>Transilial bone biopsy was an optional procedure in participants who provided a separate consent. A total of 341 biopsies were obtained from 272 participants. Forty biopsies were obtained at baseline and 301 after 12, 24, or 36&#x000a0;months. Double-fluorochrome labeling with either tetracycline or demeclocycline was used to assess bone formation. The biopsy specimens were analyzed at the Osteoporosis Research Center, Creighton University, Omaha, NE, USA using histomorphometric and micro-CT techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Biopsy examiners were blinded to participant identity, treatment allocation and time-point. Histomorphometric variables were measured, calculated, and expressed according to the guidelines of the American Society of Bone and Mineral research (ASBMR) Nomenclature Committee [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Clinical fracture end point assessment</title><p>Clinical vertebral and non-vertebral fractures were key end points of the study. Therefore, all fractures reported as AEs were adjudicated by a clinical adjudication committee (CAC) of radiologists at the central evaluation site (Synarc, Newark, CA, USA). Based on clinical history and radiographs, the CAC determined whether a fracture was confirmed; its anatomic location and laterality; and whether it was osteoporotic or due to trauma, stress, or other pathology (neoplasm or infection). The adjudication involved a two-round process. A unanimous vote from three CAC members, chosen at random from a panel of four, who reviewed the participant data independently via internet-based software (Virtual Panel System, Parexel International, Waltham, MA, USA), was required to complete the adjudication during the first review. If the vote were not unanimous, then all four CAC members would review the case in a conference (second review) and a three-fourths majority vote was required to confirm the fracture. The CAC could also determine that insufficient data were available to complete the adjudication of a fracture event. Fractures that were possible atypical femoral shaft fracture events were adjudicated according to the ASBMR criteria and were always discussed by four CAC members in a one-round process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Adverse event reporting and adjudication</title><p>At each clinic or telephone visit, participants were queried about interval AEs and the responses recorded. Participants were also instructed to report any serious AEs such as hospitalization to the investigational sites immediately. Changes in laboratory parameters were evaluated by the investigators to determine whether they were clinically significant and reportable as AEs.</p><p>Several categories of specific AEs were designated for adjudication by external CAC committees (cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, dental, skin thickening and hardening, delayed fracture union, and serious respiratory events) to confirm their occurrence and specific attributes. These AEs, rationale for their adjudication, data collected for the adjudication, and specific attributes to be adjudicated are summarized in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. These AEs were adjudicated in a two-round process similar to that previously described for fractures.

At the initiation of the current trial, it was anticipated that up to 5&#x000a0;years of blinded therapy might be required to evaluate its end points, and this duration was specified in the protocol and participant consent forms that were approved by ERCs and IRBs. Provision was made for early termination of the study if significant reductions in fracture risk were demonstrated in either preplanned interim analysis. In order to ensure collection of long-term data, an extension study was planned in which study participants would continue in a blinded fashion on their randomized treatment until they reached the originally anticipated total of 5&#x000a0;years, after which participants would transition to open-label ODN.</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Current status</title><p>On July 11, 2012, the sponsor announced the decision to terminate the base study early based on the DMC recommendation following its review of the first interim analysis. That analysis was performed after approximately 70&#x000a0;% of the target hip fracture events (158 participants with an incident osteoporotic hip fracture) had occurred. The DMC based its recommendation on the observation of robust efficacy and a favorable benefit/risk profile of ODN relative to placebo. The DMC also recommended that additional safety data be obtained in the previously planned blinded extension study. Following this recommendation, study participants attended a final base study visit and, if eligible, were asked to consent to enter the extension study. The base study was closed out between August and November, 2012, and will form the basis for the primary comparative efficacy and safety analyses.</p><p>There were important differences between the base and extension studies in study design and conduct. In the base study, all participants who discontinued study medication were allowed to remain in the trial and be followed unless they withdrew consent. However, participants who were no longer taking study medication at the time of their final base study visit were not eligible to enter the extension. Of 16,713 women initially randomized in the base study, 8256 entered the extension study. Of the approximately 8000 women who did not enter the extension, most were ineligible because they had not completed the base study on therapy or because the investigational site did not participate in this phase of the trial. A total of 1281 women experienced excessive bone loss during the base study. Most of them discontinued prior to entering the extension. However, 245 women were excluded shortly after entering the extension because of excessive bone loss detected at the transitional visit.</p><p>The loss of nearly half the original participants created a substantial likelihood that the extension population would differ materially from the original trial population. Participants who experienced excessive bone loss during the base study were discontinued from study drug and were therefore ineligible to enter the study extension. It would be expected that a greater number of participants from the placebo arm were discontinued due to excessive bone loss. Thus, although it was blinded, the extension cannot be presumed to have maintained the randomization.</p><p>As osteoporosis requires long-term treatment, extension studies of active treatment, with or without a withdrawal arm, have become customary. Prior trials have not generally extended the randomized placebo phase beyond the primary end point. In the report of the 10-year extended phase III alendronate studies, the authors used the expected effect of aging on fracture rates in the original placebo group in order to provide context for interpretation of the rates observed on active treatment in the latter years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. A more sophisticated approach, taking more variables into account, was subsequently developed and validated using data from the alendronate FIT trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. This &#x0201c;virtual twin&#x0201d; model has been used in the analyses of data from the long-term extension of the denosumab phase III trial for which a placebo comparison was no longer available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. A similar model will be developed from the placebo group in the ODN base study. This may provide useful information about expected fracture rates and other efficacy and safety results for a virtual long-term placebo group with characteristics matching the active treatment population.</p></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Summary</title><p>Inhibition of cathepsin K is an attractive pharmacological approach with therapeutic potential in osteoporosis. Preclinical and initial clinical data provided a strong rationale for the use of ODN in the treatment of osteoporosis, and the phase IIb trial identified 50&#x000a0;mg once weekly as a dose regimen that is effective on BMD end points. The ODN phase III fracture trial was designed to rigorously investigate the efficacy and safety of this selective CatK inhibitor in the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women.</p><p>This placebo-controlled study excluded participants who were at excessively high individual risk of fracture and included safeguards to ensure participant safety. In addition to fractures, the study evaluated multiple end points that not only provide information about ODN but may also help expand our knowledge of osteoporosis. An interim analysis demonstrated sufficiently robust anti-fracture efficacy and favorable benefit-risk profile to warrant early termination of the base study. The blinded extension study enrolled more than 8000 continuing participants and will provide additional data concerning the longer-term safety and efficacy of ODN.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec31"><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="198_2014_2944_MOESM1_ESM.pdf"><label>ESM 1</label><caption><p>(PDF 1811&#x000a0;kb)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>This study was registered with clinicaltrials.gov with registration number NCT00529373.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><p>We would like to thank Boyd B Scott Ph.D., Elizabeth Rosenberg Ph.D., and Keith Kaufman M.D. (Merck &#x00026; Co.
