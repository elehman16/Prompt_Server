In this study we therefore evaluated the implementation of the APHRODITE lifestyle intervention for the prevention of type 2 diabetes in Dutch primary care. Based on this evaluation we discuss opportunities for refining intervention delivery.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A 2.5-year intervention was performed in 14 general practices in the Netherlands among individuals at high risk for type 2 diabetes (FINDRISC-score&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;13) (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;479) and was compared to usual care (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;446). Intervention consisted of individual lifestyle counselling by nurse practitioners (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;24) and GPs (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;48) and group-consultations. Drop-out and attendance were registered during the programme. After the intervention, satisfaction with the programme and perceived implementation barriers were assessed with questionnaires.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Drop-out was modest (intervention: 14.6&#x02009;%; usual care: 13.2&#x02009;%) and attendance at individual consultations was high (intervention: 80-97&#x02009;%; usual care: 86-94&#x02009;%). Providers were confident about diabetes prevention by lifestyle intervention in primary care. Participants were more satisfied with counselling from nurse practitioners than from GPs. A major part of the GPs reported low self-efficacy regarding dietary guidance. Lack of counselling time (60&#x02009;%), participant motivation (12&#x02009;%), and financial reimbursement (11&#x02009;%) were regarded by providers as important barriers for intervention implementation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>High participant compliance and a positive attitude of providers make primary care a suitable setting for diabetes prevention by lifestyle counselling. Results support a role for the nurse practitioner as the key player in guiding lifestyle modification. Further research is needed on strategies that could increase cost-effectiveness, such as more stringent criteria for participant inclusion, group-counselling, more tailor-made counselling and integration of screening and / or interventions for different disorders.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Type 2 diabetes</kwd><kwd>Primary care</kwd><kwd>Lifestyle intervention</kwd><kwd>Implementation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Type 2 diabetes is a serious illness, associated with severe complications and increased mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Global prevalence is estimated to rise to 438 million in two decades, increasing the worldwide burden posed by this disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Studies in experimental settings have however shown that type 2 diabetes incidence and risk can greatly be reduced by lifestyle counselling in high risk individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In the Netherlands, the &#x02018;Study on Lifestyle intervention and Impaired glucose tolerance Maastricht&#x02019; (SLIM) demonstrated a reduction of diabetes incidence of nearly 60&#x02009;% in 4&#x02009;years in individuals that completed a three-year lifestyle intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The beneficial effects of these behavioural interventions can be maintained long after counseling is stopped [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>As in clinical practice resources may be limited compared to experimental settings, implementation of successful lifestyle interventions into daily life settings is challenging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. It is therefore important to health policy makers to gain insight into factors influencing translation of evidence-based programmes into &#x02018;the real world&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. A better understanding of programme implementation may furthermore reveal opportunities for refining intervention delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. However, despite growing evidence on effectiveness of diabetes prevention in routine health care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], evaluation of intervention implementation remains limited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>The &#x02018;Active Prevention in High Risk individuals of Diabetes Type 2 in and around Eindhoven&#x02019; (APHRODITE) study investigates type 2 diabetes prevention in Dutch primary care. General practice was chosen for implementation, because in the Netherlands patients consider the GP trustworthy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and ~99&#x02009;% of inhabitants are registered with a practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Furthermore, Dutch GPs attach importance to primary prevention of chronic diseases and the majority of practices have a nurse practitioner to support preventive activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In this article we evaluate participant compliance with the intervention, attitudes and expertise of providers, satisfaction with the structure and intensity of the intervention and perceived implementation barriers of providers. Based on these insights we discuss opportunities for refining intervention delivery on different healthcare levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Participants were recruited in January 2008 by 48 GPs and 24 nurse practitioners from an association of 14 primary care practices in the Netherlands. A Dutch translation of the Finnish FINDRISC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] was sent to GP patients aged &#x02265;40 and &#x02264;70&#x02009;years (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;16032). The FINDRISC was validated in three Dutch cohorts and was found to be a reasonably good predictor of incident diabetes in the Netherlands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. All individuals with a score &#x02265;13 points (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;1533) were invited to participate in the intervention. Randomization was performed on the level of the individual. In total, 479 individuals were allocated to the intervention group and 446 individuals to the usual care group. Details of participant recruitment and intervention reach were described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><sec><title>Intervention protocol</title><p>The APHRODITE intervention was based on the transtheoretical model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Stage transition was supported by using behavioural change techniques to influence motivation (motivational interviewing, decisional balance), action (goal setting, action planning, barrier identification) and maintenance (relapse prevention) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Research objectives focused on weight loss, increasing the amount of physical activity and improving dietary composition. Clinical and lifestyle measurements were performed at baseline and after 6, 18 and 30&#x02009;months. Details of participant measurement taking were described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>To ascertain regular contact with health care providers, 11 consultations of 20 minutes were scheduled over 2.5&#x02009;years with alternately the nurse practitioner and the GP. To decrease workload for providers and stimulate contact between participants, five group-meetings of 1 hour were organised by dieticians and physiotherapists to provide more detailed information on diet and exercise. Moreover, all individuals were invited for a 1-hour personal consultation with the dietician. Participants were invited for the group-meetings in their own town directly by the dietician or physiotherapist. Participants could call the dieticians&#x02019; or physiotherapists&#x02019; office to join another meeting if the day or time didn&#x02019;t suit them.

practitioner, whom they consider trustworthy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Individual attention from these providers may therefore lead to high compliance. In line with this hypothesis, attendance at individual consultations was high, which was also found in other studies in general practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Furthermore, drop-out in our study was modest (intervention: 14.6&#x02009;%; usual care: 13.2&#x02009;%) and drop-out after 1&#x02009;year (intervention: 6.3&#x02009;%; usual care: 7.4&#x02009;%) was lower than in other prevention studies in primary care (German Praedias-study: 9.3&#x02009;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]; Finnish GOAL-study: 9.4&#x02009;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]). Completers in our study more often had a partner than drop-outs, which was also found in the GOAL study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>In our study, no difference in dropout rates between the two study groups was observed. Accounting for the individuals who were lost to follow-up because they developed type 2 diabetes, the statistical power to detect small, but clinically relevant differences in dropout rates between the study groups (Cohen&#x02019;s conventional effect size of 0.1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]) was 0.835. It is therefore unlikely that the lack of a difference in dropout rate between the groups is explained by a lack of statistical power.</p><p>In contrast to others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], attendance at individual consultations remained high throughout our study, to which several elements in the organisation of our intervention may have contributed. First, following daily routine, appointments for the next visit were made before completing of the current consultation. Second, persons who did not show up at their appointment were contacted by the practice assistant. Third, in each practice, one provider was made responsible for correct implementation of the programme, including coordination of the consultations.</p><p>Despite the high compliance in our study, providers regarded lack of participant motivation to change unhealthy habits as an important barrier for effective lifestyle counselling. This result underlines the importance of in-depth evaluation of participant behavioural change in diabetes prevention programmes to reveal starting points for refining intervention content [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], as was for example done by Rosal et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and Penn et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Furthermore, attention should be given to the identification of environmental factors influencing participant behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], such as the food products offered in worksite cafeterias or the availability of cycling-tracks. As was done in our study, it is recommended that counselling is based on shared decision making to enlarge participant empowerment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Moreover, participants should be stimulated to mobilize social support, which was found to be important for both achieving [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and maintaining change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. In our study, partner support was also found to contribute to weight loss success [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Professional level</title><p>A positive attitude of health care providers towards change is indispensable for implementation of innovations in clinical practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Satisfying this condition, the majority of providers in our study was confident about diabetes prevention by lifestyle counselling in Dutch primary care. Furthermore, attendance at training sessions was high and none of the providers refused participation or withdrew from the study. It must be remarked that provider compliance may be overestimated in our study as all practices were part of an association, which as a whole decided to participate in the project. In two recent Dutch studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], GPs were however also found to attach high importance to chronic disease prevention.</p><p>Remarkably, drop-out was lower and increases in 2&#x02009;h plasma glucose were smaller in participants receiving counselling from providers who considered the chance of success of diabetes prevention in Dutch primary care low or very low than in participants from providers who considered the chance of success medium or high. In line with these results, it was previously found in our study that a lack of motivation or confidence of providers does not negatively influence participant guidance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. These results may reflect a professional attitude, in which personal barriers to diabetes prevention by lifestyle intervention do not affect participant counselling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Furthermore, a reserved attitude of providers towards prevention obviously does not imply a lack of capacity for guiding lifestyle change.</p><p>Although primary care is regarded as a highly suitable setting for disease prevention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], debate is ongoing about the optimal division of the workload between the GP and the nurse practitioner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. The lower participant satisfaction with GP guidance and the lower self-efficacy of GPs regarding dietary counselling in our study support a role for the nurse practitioner as the key player in guiding lifestyle change. As most nurse practitioners in the Netherlands provide care to diabetes patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], this role is compatible with existing routines. Moreover, Dutch GPs recently reported a preference for nurse practitioners to perform preventive activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In our study the MI-course was however only offered to nurse practitioners, which may have contributed to their skills. Furthermore, after the admission interview, participants did not meet with the GP for nine months, which may have influenced their perception of GP importance in the study.</p><p>Although our findings suggest that they are very suitable to guide participant lifestyle change, nurse practitioners in our study reported a lack of nutritional knowledge. Moreover, nearly 40&#x02009;% regarded themselves as only moderately suitable for dietary counselling. Referral to dieticians may be necessary to fill these gaps and may furthermore relieve time&#x02013;pressure for nurse practitioners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. As an alternative, the motivational interviewing course &#x02013;which was considered useful and desirable by all nurse practitioners in our study- may be extended towards a specialized prevention manager training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], which also focuses on aspects of nutrition and physical activity in diabetes prevention. This training could then for example only be offered to a subset of highly motivated nurses, to which all GPs in a certain region can refer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. A disadvantage of this latter approach is however that participants may not receive counselling from their familiar provider and/or in their own practice.</p></sec><sec><title>Organisational level</title><p>Most providers in our study were satisfied with both the frequency and the duration of the individual consultations. However, comparable to other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], limited counselling time was regarded as an important bottleneck for programme implementation. Furthermore, although individual lifestyle interventions can save money even when effectiveness is low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], financial reimbursement for preventive activities is mostly lacking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Moreover, in several programmes in clinical practice &#x02013;including ours-, risk factor reductions were modest compared to studies in experimental settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. In diabetes translational research, it is therefore essential to consider strategies that could increase cost-effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>A first approach could be to allow less persons to participate by applying more strict &#x02018;selection at the gates&#x02019;. Following other programmes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], a FINDRISC value of 13 points was chosen in our study as selection criterium, which may have led to inclusion of individuals with a relatively healthy lifestyle. Furthermore, disturbed glucose values were not a prerequisite for participation. More stringent criteria -and thus a less favourable risk profile- leave more room for improvement and may lead to higher participant efforts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In addition, pre-screening based on the motivation to change the lifestyle, &#x02013;as was done in the Dutch &#x02018;beweegkuur&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]- may be useful to include only those most willing to change.</p><p>A second strategy to reduce costs and thus potentially increase cost-effectiveness is group-counselling, which was applied in several prevention programmes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. However, although most providers in our study regarded primary care as an appropriate setting for group-based lifestyle interventions, attendance at group-consultations was low. This could be explained by the purely didactive nature of the group-meetings and by the fact that they were supplementary to individual counselling. In line with this hypothesis, &#x02018;I already received enough information from the GP / nurse practitioner&#x02019; was on often-mentioned reason for missing group-meetings. In other studies however, participants also reported a preference for personal guidance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Furthermore, in several group-based interventions the number of participants initially refusing to participate was not mentioned [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Preceding analysis of the attractiveness of group-counselling for participants is therefore necessary.</p><p>Third, a more tailor-made counselling approach may be considered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Although regarded useful and desirable by most providers, only half of the participants in our study for example favoured exercise programmes and personal dietary counselling. A better adapted or more patient-centred intervention structure may result in higher participant compliance. Furthermore, restricted offering of intervention modules may reduce costs. Based on their preferences, persons may for example participate in (a combination of) weight loss, dietary and exercise modules, offered by means of brief, intensive or group-based counselling, whether or not supported by exercise programmes or dietary guidance. However, feasilibity, acceptability and (cost-)effectiveness of such a design require further research.</p><p>Fourth, as the risks of an unhealthy lifestyle are not confined to diabetes, individuals may be enrolled in several behavioural change initiatives at the same time, which is time- and money-consuming. Integration of screening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] and/or intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] for different disorders is therefore recommendable, whereby general intervention modules aimed at shared risk factors may be supplemented with disease specific components.</p></sec><sec><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>In our study we evaluated a wide spectrum of opportunities for diabetes prevention in Dutch primary care. The high questionnaire response rates make it unlikely that missing values have significantly influenced the results. However, when filling out the questionnaires, both participants and professionals may have been affected by recent experiences. In addition, the missing records from drop-outs and individuals with diabetes may have influenced participant outcomes. Reasons for withdrawal did not however indicate dissatisfaction among drop-outs. Self-reported outcomes of participants and providers on knowledge and skills of professionals must be interpreted with caution.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>High participant compliance and a positive attitude of providers make primary care a suitable setting for diabetes prevention by lifestyle counselling in the Netherlands. Results support a role for the nurse practitioner as the key player in guiding lifestyle modification, whereby referral to supporting staff or more extended training may be necessary.
