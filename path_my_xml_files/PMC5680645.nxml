Maintenance of an effective plaque control is the cornerstone in preventing and controlling gingival and periodontal diseases. The most commonly employed plaque control at home is by tooth brushing.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] The use of toothpaste has ancient root. Ancient Greeks, Egyptians, and Roman civilizations were known to develop their own tooth powder containing pumice, talcum, coral powder, and alabaster.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Delmopinol ((+)-3-(4-propylheptyl)-4-morpholineethanol hydrochloride) inhibits plaque formation by interfering with plaque adhering to the tooth and gingiva by acting at the interface between the plaque bacteria and the tooth or gingival surface and also shows significant effect in penetrating into the existing plaque.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Chlorhexidine is a large dicationic molecule, (1,6-di(4-chlorophenyl-diguanido)) hexane, with the positive charge distributed over the nitrogen atoms on either side of the hexamethylene bridge and has ability to absorb into negatively charged surfaces, such as bacterial cell walls, where it exerts its bacteriostatic and bactericidal effects. The reported side effects of chlorhexidine are extrinsic staining of the teeth and tongue, (painful) desquamations of the oral mucosa, and rarely parotid swelling. The most obvious side effect as a result of chlorhexidine is the development of stain.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] In plaque regrowth studies, plaque accumulation from day 1 (zero level), in the absence of mechanical cleaning and under the influence of the allocated formulation, was scored on day 5.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] The teeth with gingivitis had a supragingival flora of predominantly filamentous cells and a scanty but distinct subgingival flora. Supragingival plaque control is the effective method of controlling gingivitis and it is important part of periodontal therapy. The mechanical removal of plaque by home care regime is time-consuming and tedious, so the supplementation of chemotherapeutic agents would be beneficial to gingival health. Recently, it has been found that metal ions and essential oils have their own limitations. Thus, the alternative approach has been very much essential for effective plaque control. Hence, the present study was undertaken to compare the clinical and microbiological efficacy of chlorhexidine gluconate, delmopinol-containing dentifrice with the conventional triclosan-containing regularly used control dentifrice on plaque formation and gingivitis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>After due authorization from the Institutional Ethical Board, a total of 45 healthy volunteer students fulfilling the inclusion criteria were selected for this randomized control group parallel study.</p><p>A total of 45 systemically healthy patients (29 males and 16 females), aged between 20 and 30 years with a mean age of 24.42 &#x000b1; 1.52 years without any systemic diseases and who are able to maintain oral hygiene by their own were included in the study. Patients should also have healthy indexed teeth, and the teeth adjacent to the index teeth should be without dental restorations and prosthesis.</p><p>Patients who are excluded are with periodontal pockets &#x02265;5 mm, with previous history of periodontal therapy within the past 1 year, with a history of hypersensitivity to any of ingredients of test compounds, receiving antibiotics, corticosteroids, anticholinergic, antidepressants, current smokers, pregnant, and lactating women.</p><p>All the patients were randomly assigned by computer-generated randomization into three groups (Group I-delmopinol dentifrice), (Group II-chlorhexidine), (Group III-triclosan) depending on the dentifrice prescribed. After the selection of patients, thorough scaling and polishing were performed for all the patients, and in a 4 days' washout period, they were asked to refrain from their regular oral hygiene maintenance (mechanical plaque control), and 0.9% NaCl (normal saline) rinse was prescribed to obtain plaque regrowth.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] A detailed case history was taken and the following clinical parameters, namely, plaque index (PI),[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] gingival index (GI),[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] staining index,[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and oral malodor using hedonic scale,[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and microbiological morphotypes such as cocci, bacilli, and spirochetes were assessed using darkfield microscope, after supragingival plaque was collected with a sterile curette. The curette with the collected plaque was dispensed in Eppendorf tube containing normal saline and then immediately sent to laboratory where they were analyzed under darkfield microscope. To minimize clumping and the loss of bacterial motility, samples were prepared and the examination completed within 1 h of their collection.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] One drop of the suspension was applied to a microscopic slide and coverslipped. Excess fluid was removed by inverting the slide over an absorbent surface and applying moderate pressure. Care was taken to avoid excessive bubbling of air during the dispersion. The slide was examined under darkfield microscopy at a magnification of 10X. A fixed reference line in the ocular was used to count the cells using a manual cell counter, and the cells were counted once only if they are showing movement.</p><p>Generally from the 100 bacteria in the selected field were categorized morphologically into three distinct classes such as coccoid cells, rods, and spirochetes. After recording the parameters and sample collection, thorough scaling and polishing were performed and patients were assigned to use respective dentifrices in a modified bass method twice daily. The sample collection was done, and clinical parameters and microbiological morphotypes were recorded again on 15<sup>th</sup> day and 30<sup>th</sup> day from baseline and were analyzed and compared.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The data were analyzed using the SPSS-software 19.00 program (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The intragroup comparison of PI scores, oral malodor scores, and GI scores was done at various study intervals using Kruskal&#x02013;Wallis ANOVA test, and intergroup comparison was done using Mann&#x02013;Whitney U-test.

Bacterial accumulation may cause breath odor. Comparing plaque samples among healthy sites and sites with gingivitis, clear shift in bacterial types were noticed.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Gingivitis is an inflammatory condition of the gums that affects most of the adult population. Epidemiological studies revealed a peculiarly high correlation between supragingival plaque levels and chronic gingivitis, and clinical researches led to the proof that plaque was the primary etiological factor in gingival inflammation.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>A dentifrice is usually used in combination with tooth brushing with the purpose of facilitating plaque removal and applying agents to the tooth surfaces for therapeutic or preventive reasons.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of chlorhexidine, delmopinol containing dentifrices with regular dentifrice containing triclosan on plaque formation and gingivitis by clinical and microbiological analysis by examination of supragingival plaque sample collected from the patients in a 1 month randomized parallel balanced group study.</p><p>Many studies using darkfield microscopy proved that the cocci bacteria were increased in healthy samples, and rods and spirochetes were decreased in diseased samples when using either chlorhexidine[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] or triclosan antiplaque agents. However, in the present study, when the gingival status, Clinical &#x00026; Microbiologic parameters were compared at baseline between Delmopinol, Chlorhexidine, and Triclosan-containing regular dentifrice groups no significant difference was observed. Statistically significant PI and GI reduction was observed in all groups from baseline day to 30<sup>th</sup> day. This may be due to all the participants (dental students) in this study who were well aware of brushing techniques and mechanical plaque control. Better plaque and gingivitis reduction was observed in chlorhexidine group.</p><p>In the present study, 0.004% chlorhexidine dentifrice group showed mean PI and GI reduction from baseline to each study interval time which is statistically significant. Yates <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] also reported that 1% chlorhexidine dentifrice showed mean PI and GI was reduced significantly at each time in a 6 months' study. These results confirm the findings of an experimental gingivitis study conducted by Jenkins which served to show the activity of the chlorhexidine in the dentifrice formulation. This might be due to the anionic and cationic agents in dentifrice did not have any interactions when they were formulated as a dentifrice, and this improvement in plaque reduction certainly reflected a Hawthorne effect by knowingly involved participants in the present study.</p><p>In 1970 Gjermo and Rolla[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] reported that 0.8% chlorhexidine dentifrice showed mean PI reduction was better in compared to Colgate control dentifrice and in accordance to this study, present study also showed that 0.004% chlorhexidine dentifrice group showed significant PI and GI reduction compared to Colgate control dentifrice. Tooth staining is a well-established side effect of chlorhexidine products.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Experimental gingivitis study conducted by Yates and Jenkins[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] observed with the use of 1% chlorhexidine dentifrice showed significantly increased staining. The present study also showed that 0.004% chlorhexidine dentifrice cause teeth staining which was significantly more than other two dentifrice groups. The reduction in the PI and GI indices in the present study was also accomplished by shift in the supragingival microbiological flora.</p><p>Delmopinol (0.2% w/v) mouthwash in a study conducted by Claydon <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] showed statistically significant reduction in PI, GI scores, and increased staining, and the results of present study were in accordance with it. The reduction in PI and GI scores was also accomplished by the shift in the microbiological flora. Delmopinol (0.2%w/v) dentifrice showed significant increasing in cocci scores and decreased in rods during study intervals.</p><p>Palomo <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] reported that triclosan-containing dentifrice alone without copolymers did not showed significant reduction of PI and GI score at any of the examination intervals, as compared to placebo. In the present study, triclosan-containing regular used dentifrice showed significant reduction of PI and GI scores during study intervals. This might be due to all participants in the present study were well aware of mechanical plaque control. Nonnenmacher in an experimental gingivitis study reported that in gingivitis phase, cocci were reduced and rods and spirochetes were increased with triclosan mouth rinse. The present study showed that cocci were increased, rods and spirochetes were decreased during study intervals with using triclosan as dentifrice, but significantly less effective when compared chlorhexidine dentifrice.</p><p>Although the hedonic scale may be useful for measuring the effects of compounds that mask malodor, it gives little information about whether or not treatments interfere with the fundamental malodor processes occurring in the mouth that is the biogenic transformation of substrates into volatile compounds (VCs), including volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs).[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] In this present study, no significant reduction was found in any dentifrice group from baseline to study intervals.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION</title><p>The present study was undertaken to evaluate and compare the efficacy of chlorhexidine, delmopinol containing dentifrices with regularly used triclosan-containing dentifrice on plaque and gingivitis reduction in a 1 month randomized, and parallel group controlled clinical and microbiological study and the results showed that PI and GI was reduced in accomplish with increased cocci and reduced rods and spirochete count in all dentifrice groups and chlorhexidine group showed better plaque and gingivitis reduction compared to other active (delmopinol) and control (triclosan-containing regular used) groups.
