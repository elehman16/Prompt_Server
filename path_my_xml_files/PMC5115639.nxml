The prevalence of this phenomenon in Iran has led to a wide range of psychological, social, and family damages. Accordingly, in the course of substance abuse and addiction treatment, detoxification, and withdrawal from drugs are insufficient. Hence, numerous psychotherapy techniques must be adopted to analyze psychological dependence.<xref rid="b1-AHJ-08-068" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> The United Nations Office for Drug Control and Crime Prevention has estimated the number of substance abusers at 200 million people or 5% of the world&#x02019;s population, among which 16 million people or 4% of abusers are consumers of opium. Iran has the world&#x02019;s highest proportion of heroin and opium addicts. According to this report, one out of every 17 people is addicted to these drugs in Iran. Furthermore, 20% of Iran&#x02019;s 15-60 years old population has an affiliation with substance abuse.<xref rid="b2-AHJ-08-068" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p><p>Emotion regulation refers to an individual&#x02019;s effort to influence the kind, time, manner of experience and expression, and change of duration or severity of behavioral, experiential, or physical processes of emotions. Emotion regulation is performed in an automatic or controlled manner, either consciously or unconsciously, and through the application of emotion regulation strategies such as reappraisal, obsessive rumination, self-declaration, avoidance, and inhibition.<xref rid="b3-AHJ-08-068" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b4-AHJ-08-068" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Since emotion regulation constitutes an important part of every individual&#x02019;s life, it is no wonder that disturbances in emotion and its regulation can lead to sadness and psychological harm.<xref rid="b5-AHJ-08-068" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>Different approaches have been introduced regarding emotion regulation such as emotion- focused therapy, as well as attachment, insight-oriented, dialectal behavior, and cognitive- behavioral therapies. Among these, one of the introduced models is presented by Gross (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-AHJ-08-068">Figure 1</xref>).<xref rid="b6-AHJ-08-068" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b7-AHJ-08-068" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>This model consists of five stages (beginning, situation, attention, evaluation, and response). According to Gross, each stage of the emotion generation process has a potential regulatory goal, thus emotion-regulating skills can be applied to different points of this process. Factors exist at the beginning or selection that place individuals in emotional excitement or avoidance. In the second stage (situation), changes can be made to the process of emotion generation through situation correction. In this stage, one of the emotion- regulating strategies is self-declaration. In the third stage (attention), redirection or attention expansion is a means to change and regulate emotion. Three ways of attention expansion are a distraction, focus, and obsessive rumination. Among these techniques, distraction is considered to be one of the emotion-regulating metacognitive techniques. With concentration, an individual focuses his/her entire attention on a situation or a certain part of it; obsessive rumination includes focusing attention on feelings and their consequences. In the fourth stage of emotion generation (evaluation), making cognitive changes is the duty of regulating. In this stage, one of the strategies is a cognitive reappraisal. The last stage of emotion generation is the stage of response, whereas response adjustment constitutes the last part of the emotion- regulating process.<xref rid="b7-AHJ-08-068" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>Although emotion regulation conceptualizations may differ,<xref rid="b7-AHJ-08-068" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> several authors agree that emotion regulation be treated as a combination of physiological, behavioral, and cognitive processes that enable individuals to adjust their experiences and the tools of negative and positive emotions.<xref rid="b8-AHJ-08-068" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><p>Emotion regulation appears to create a doubled ability to avoid substance abuse and helps to control the temptation of relapse, which is a type of tendency-avoidance conflict.<xref rid="b9-AHJ-08-068" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>-<xref rid="b11-AHJ-08-068" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Despite the advances in addiction treatment, the return of heavy and uncontrollable periods of abuse remains problematic.<xref rid="b12-AHJ-08-068" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p><p>If the intense and resistant desire for substance abuse (craving) is not satisfied, it will lead to psychological and physical ailments such as weakness, anorexia, anxiety, insomnia, aggression, and depression.<xref rid="b13-AHJ-08-068" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> A low level of emotional regulation that results from failure in effectively dealing with and managing emotions plays a role in the onset of substance abuse and craving.<xref rid="b10-AHJ-08-068" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b14-AHJ-08-068" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p><p>Numerous studies have addressed the role and effect of emotion regulation in anger control. In two studies,<xref rid="b15-AHJ-08-068" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="b16-AHJ-08-068" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> the effects of various strategies of emotion regulation on experience and anger expression were addressed. In another study,17 it has been shown that cocaine-dependent individuals when compared to a control group reported problems with understanding and managing emotions during the 1st week of avoidance. Cocaine- dependent individuals showed obvious defects in emotion regulation which were attributed to more stress reaction and control of reduced impulse.<xref rid="b17-AHJ-08-068" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p><p>In the presence of peer pressure for substance abuse, effective management of emotions will reduce the risk for this abuse. The ability to manage emotions causes that an individual to adopt appropriate coping strategies in situations where the risk of substance abuse is high. People with high emotion regulation are more capable of predicting others&#x02019; demands. These individuals understand unwanted peer pressures and control their emotions more efficiently, consequently showing more resistance against substance abuse.<xref rid="b18-AHJ-08-068" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> In contrast, people who have a lower emotion regulation are attracted to substance abuse to cope with their negative emotions.<xref rid="b18-AHJ-08-068" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p><p>Previous studies have shown that one of the main factors of an individuals&#x02019; tendency toward or return to substance abuse is the temptation of substance abuse. Therefore, the present study seeks to determine if Gross model-based emotion regulation training impacts reduction of craving beliefs in drug-dependent individuals.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>This semi-pilot research utilized a pre- and post-test design with a control group and random replacement. The population consisted of all addicts who visited addiction centers in Marivan, Iran. We used the simple random sampling method to choose 30 drug-dependent individuals. Participants were randomly assigned to either the experiment (n = 15) or control (n = 15) groups.</p><p>Inclusion criteria included: Male gender, 18-50 years of age; the presence of drug dependence criteria according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5th edition-Text revision (DSM-IV-TR); no severe psychological disorders such as psychosis, bipolar or dissociative disorder according to medical evaluation and psychotherapy; and no physical illnesses which would preclude their participation in the study curriculum, according to medical opinion.</p><p>Initially, we visited Marivan&#x02019;s addiction centers after which cooperation from the addiction centers&#x02019; officials were requested to better perform the project. Next, 30 persons who met the inclusion criteria were randomly selected. We applied the Gross model-based emotion regulation training protocol as the interference factor. This protocol is a recommended method designed by James Gross to teach the proper management and regulation of an individual&#x02019;s emotions. We implemented different stages of emotion regulation training based on the above-mentioned package in the form of eight, 2-hour group sessions. A summary of Gross model-based emotion regulation training sessions is presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-AHJ-08-068">table 1</xref>.</p><p>
<italic>Craving beliefs questionnaire</italic>
</p><p>This questionnaire is a self-evaluation scale designed by Beck19 that evaluates substance abuse temptation-related beliefs. The questionnaire contains 20 items, each rated according to a 7-point scale (1-7 points). Reliability of this test has been reported as 0.84 according to Cronbach&#x000a2;s alpha.<xref rid="b19-AHJ-08-068" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Rahmanian et al.<xref rid="b20-AHJ-08-068" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> and Mohammadkhani et al.<xref rid="b21-AHJ-08-068" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> have reported the reliability of this test as 0.84 and 0.77 according to Cronbach&#x000a2;s alpha. In the present study, we determined test reliability to be 0.72 with Cronbach&#x000a2;s alpha.</p></sec><sec sec-type="result"><title>Results</title><p>Subjects of the study were 22-45 years of age, with a mean age of 32.33 &#x000b1; 6.62 years. With regards to educational status, 20.0% were illiterate, whereas 13.3% had an elementary education, 13.3% had guidance school education, 40.0% had high-school diploma, and 13.3% had a degree higher than a diploma. In terms of marital status, 40.0% were single, 46.7% were married, and 13.3% were divorced. There were 13.3% unemployed subjects, 73.3% self-employed, 6.7% employees, and 6.7% were military personnel. In terms of social class, 53.4% were low social class and 46.7% were middle class. In terms of parents&#x02019; education level, 73.3% were illiterate, 13.3% had attended elementary school, and 13.3% had guidance school degree. The drugs abused by subjects in this study were opium (40.0%), heroin (7.3%), glass (3.1%), tramadol (3.1%), and crack (7.6%).</p><p>Investigating descriptive statistics in two groups indicated that in pre-test, the experimental group [mean = 89.20; standard deviation (SD) = 16.93] had higher scores in craving belief than the control group (mean = 70.66; SD = 16.67). However, in post-test, the control group (mean = 69.46; SD = 14.45) had more craving belief than the experimental group (mean = 56.93; SD = 13.79), which indicates a decrease in the latter group.</p><p>In the pre-test stage, there was no significant difference between the experimental and control groups according to the Levine F test (F = 1.101; P &#x0003e; 0.050). Moreover, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test confirmed the normality of dependent variable distribution (Z = 0.82; P &#x0003e; 0.050). Therefore, we applied the univariate covariance test for analysis of the results. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-AHJ-08-068">table 2</xref>, after controlling for the pre-test effect, there was a significant difference between the items of craving beliefs in the experimental and control groups. The observed reduction in craving beliefs variance (0.088) observed in the post-test stage could be attributed to the effectiveness of teaching emotion regulation. The statistical power was more than 0.8, which confirmed that the numbers of participants were adequate. Therefore, the research hypothesis that emotion regulation teaching influences reduction of craving beliefs was supported.</p><p>In general, the research findings showed that emotion regulation training was influential in reducing craving beliefs among drug-dependent individuals.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The present study aimed to investigate the effect of Gross model-based emotion regulation training on the reduction of craving beliefs in substance- dependent individuals. The results were consistent with findings by numerous investigators.<xref rid="b11-AHJ-08-068" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="b22-AHJ-08-068" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>-<xref rid="b26-AHJ-08-068" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> According to this model the experience of negative emotions such as anxiety, depression, and stress led to activation of substance-abuse temptation. An individual&#x02019;s ability to use emotion regulation strategies could influence the effect of temptation on substance abuse.</p><p>According to psychologists, one of the features of drug abuse is the temptation that it creates in individuals for renewed tendency toward substance abuse. Exposure to situations where the individuals have previously used drugs leads to drug re-abuse temptation. Thus, teaching how to control emotions and the way to appropriately manage an individual&#x02019;s thoughts under such circumstances largely reduces the risk of return to substance-abuse, which has been supported by the results of the present study.</p><p>The results were generally consistent with Khantzian&#x02019;s hypothesis of self-medication. According to study of Khantzian,<xref rid="b27-AHJ-08-068" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> a disorder in emotion regulation and low tolerance were among the reasons for individuals turning to addiction. The lower tolerance seen in these individuals has been shown to force them to find a quick way for getting rid of emotions.<xref rid="b28-AHJ-08-068" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></p><p>Negative emotions and failure to properly manage such emotions were stated as another important stimulus for resuming substance-abuse. Empirical research in this area has shown that abusers who use more adaptive strategies of emotion regulation were more successful in treatment courses. On the contrary, people unable to control their emotions more likely become permanent substance abusers.<xref rid="b24-AHJ-08-068" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Therefore, by informing avoiding people of substance, temptation and associated positive and negative emotions, and accepting and effectively dealing with them, emotion regulation training can promote these individuals&#x02019; mental health.<xref rid="b29-AHJ-08-068" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></p><p>In numerous studies, cigarette smokers reported the main reason for their tendency to smoke was negative affection.<xref rid="b23-AHJ-08-068" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="b30-AHJ-08-068" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Results showed that problematic use of alcohol was related to maladaptive efforts to reduce depression signs,<xref rid="b31-AHJ-08-068" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> regulation and negative emotions.<xref rid="b32-AHJ-08-068" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></p><p>Numerous proposed treatments for disorders of anxiety, eating, and substance-abuse include reducing maladaptive methods for emotion regulation and increasing different methods for emotion regulation and psychiatric disorders. This enables current psychological-social treatments to be a more effective and becomes the preferred guidance for time of using each one of them and the guidance for method selection.<xref rid="b11-AHJ-08-068" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> According to Beck&#x02019;s model19 and research findings, the severe temptation of drugs can weaken emotion regulation strategies. Studies have suggested that people who experience severe temptation during the avoidance period are not capable of controlling their feelings and emotions. The more severe the temptation is the weaker the strategies will be.<xref rid="b24-AHJ-08-068" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></p><p>In a study of brain images, it is shown that performing mindfulness exercises reduced biological vulnerability relative to stimuli from negative emotions by increasing the activities within the frontal part of the brain associated with positive affections and by reducing activities within the basal part of the brain associated with abnormal behavior resulting from emotions.<xref rid="b33-AHJ-08-068" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Therefore, the use of emotion regulation strategies are now considered to be among the comprehensive treatment programs in relapse prevention. Cooper et al. have shown that teenagers drink as a coping strategy because of negative emotions such as anxiety and depression. The resultant overuse alcohol will lead to more problems concerning this overuse.<xref rid="b34-AHJ-08-068" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> As a result, teaching coping strategies is an appropriate way to replace substance-abuse. Therefore, considering the findings of the present study, we recommend that substance abuse treatment centers and clinics implement workshops or perianal treatment programs to provide people under-treatment and their spouses with the foundation to familiarize themselves with emotions, types of emotion, how to express and control emotions, and recognition of emotion-exciting situations. This will enable substance abusers to better adapt themselves to the environment and avoid reusing substances during the occurrence of unpleasant emotions.</p><p>The limitations of this study included difficulties in sample selection among individuals who presented to Marivan&#x02019;s Addiction Treatment Clinic, low literacy level of study participants which might have led to bias in answering questionnaires, inconsistent attendance of some participants in sessions, and the enrollment of only male subjects. Therefore, a comparison between genders regarding the effectiveness of using this method was not possible.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The research findings have shown that implementation of emotion regulation workshops can reduce craving beliefs in drug-dependent individuals. Therefore, we recommend that therapists of addiction treatment centers and camps teach the matter of emotion, the way of expressing emotion in different situations, recognition of emotion-exciting situations, and emotion regulation methods to drug-dependent people by implementation of emotion regulation workshops and/or group therapy and individual treatment sessions with the intent to prevent individuals from reusing substances.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank all the individuals who participated in this research.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p>
