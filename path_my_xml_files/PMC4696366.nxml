IR means that circulating insulin does not do its function in insulin sensitive tissues such as skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, liver, and endothelium.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] IR is related with central obesity, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high triglycerides, raised blood pressure, and hemostatic defects.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] IR is regulated by genetic and environmental factors and their interaction. Diet, body composition, and usual physical activity (PA) levels are known factors. Diet management is a key component in the long-term health and quality of life of people with IR, and many features of the diet composition have been considered to be critical in the alteration of IR.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] One of these diets is the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), which encourages the eating of vegetables, fruits, and low-fat dairy products with sodium restriction. It is a balanced diet that is currently recommended for all adults. This diet is high in unsaturated fatty acids, fiber, antioxidant constituents, and low-fat dairy, which may be beneficial for decreasing IR. The metabolic efficiency of the DASH diet, including its impact on insulin sensitivity is less known.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Genetic variations with affecting on insulin signaling, as well as environmental factors such as diet and PA, plays an important role in insulin sensitivity.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Candidate genes for insulin sensitivity either directly or indirectly encode the proteins, which are participated in glucose metabolism. Insulin receptor substrate (IRS) Type 1 which is a main substrate for the insulin receptor, controls insulin signaling in skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, and the vascular, so it is an important candidate gene for IR.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] It is determined that decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of the IRS1 proteins and dysregulation of the insulin receptor participates in peripheral IR and B-cell malfunction.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] The gene-environmental interaction may effect on insulin sensitivity, clarify the fundamental mechanisms of Type 2 diabetes, and provide effective prevention strategies. Dietary factors and nutrient intake are the main environmental factors in the incident and expansion of the typical polygenic, diet-related diseases such as IR.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] There are few data regarding the effect of diet on gene expression.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] To date, no intervention studies in humans have thoroughly explored the effects of DASH diet on gene expression. The purpose of this study, therefore, was to evaluate whether DASH diet effects on IRS1 gene expression and IR.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>Fifty-one healthy, overweight, or obese (body mass index &#x0003e;25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) female volunteers aged 20-50 years that were referred by the general health center were recruited. Subjects were not included by nutritionist if they were pregnant or lactating women or they had history of incidence of cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, thyroid, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, severe infection, trauma, allergy, and if they consumed of multivitamin and mineral or omega-3 fatty acids supplements, antacid drugs that containing magnesium and calcium, aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, anti-inflammatory and anti-depressant, and hormone drugs.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] They were excluded if they had changed their normal PA or they had not complete compliance. The nature of the trial was explained to the individuals, and all subjects provided written informed consent. The ethical reviewer committee of the Isfahan University of Medical Sciences approved the study. This trial was registered at Iranian clinical trial registry as IRCT2014090719072N1.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study design</title><p>This study was a randomized, parallel clinical trial. After a 2-week run-in period with the Usual Dietary Advices (UDA) diet participants were randomly assigned to 12 weeks to a UDA diet or the DASH diet. We conducted a run-in to homogenize in the consumption of macronutrients and base of diets. In this period, patients consumed a UDA diet. Group assignments were made by statistic using random sequencing created in SPSS (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The nutritionist that prescribed the diets had to be aware of the group assignment, but laboratory staff members were not aware of that. The socioeconomic status was evaluated using a questionnaire, which validated for Iranian.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Participants were controlled every 2 weeks, and measurements were taken. During the study period, patients were prescribed the diet and prepared their own meals while living independently. They were demanded to record their PA for 3 days every month and not to change and it was assessed by using compendium of PA.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Diets</title><p>Participants were randomly assigned to one of two diets: A UDA diet and the DASH diet. The UDA group was not given a diet and simply recommended to eat as regular and the intervention group was prescribed DASH diet that was rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat dairy products, and low in saturated fat, total fat, cholesterol, refined grains, sweets, and red meat. Furthermore, it contained 2400 mg sodium per day [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>].[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] To calculate the energy requirement for each participant, we used Mifflin-St equation.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] The participants were assessed every 2 weeks. The diets were individually prescribed using a calorie count system, and an exchange list was given to each patient for changing food items and counting the calories. A nutritionist explained subjects how to apply the exchange list and writing food diaries. Every participant had to bring her 3-day dietary records every month, and trained nutritionist reviewed the diaries. In these sessions, they were questioned about their diets and the food items that they should be eaten and their compliance was assessed by analyzing the three food record diaries by the NUTRITIONIST IV software (version 7.0; N-Squared Computing, Salem, OR, USA) that was modified for Iranian food items.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Dietary goals of the DASH intervention versus usual dietary advice</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JRMS-20-832-g001"/></table-wrap></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>The anthropometric measurements</title><p>Participants were weighed wearing minimal clothing and without shoes, using digital scales (Seca, Germany) and recorded to the nearest 0.1 kg.

Total RNA was isolated from the PBMC using Trizol<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 1.0 ml TRIZOL reagent and 200 &#x003bc;l chloroform were added to the sample, and the admixture was vortexed for 15 s and stood at 25&#x000b0;C for 3 min. The supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube after centrifugation at 12,000 &#x000d7;<italic>g</italic> for 15 min at 4&#x000b0;C, and then 500 &#x003bc;l isopropanol was added.

Ethanol was removed by centrifugation at 7500 &#x000d7;<italic>g</italic> for 5 min at 4&#x000b0;C, and RNA was air-dried for 5 min and then dissolved in 25 &#x003bc;l RNase-free water. The purity of isolated RNA was ascertained by OD260/280 using a Nanodrop ND-1000 (Thermo Scientific, Worcester, MA). Isolated RNA was dissolved in RNase-free water, and the amount of RNA was determined by measuring absorbance at 260 nm with a spectrophotometer. The RNA samples were treated with DNase I (Thermo Scientific) in order to avoid potential contamination with genomic DNA. Two micrograms of total RNA were used to synthesize double-stranded cDNA by Revert Aid First Strand cDNA synthesis kit (Thermo Scientific) and oligo dT primers. The primers for all assayed genes were designed using the Allele ID 7 software (Premier Biosoft International, Palo Alto, USA) [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>]. The real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed using SYBR Green PCR Master mix (Thermo Scientific) and the Step One Plus&#x02122; Real time PCR detection System (Applied Bio systems). Glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used as an endogenous control.

This suggests that DASH diet may increase the expression of IRS1 [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec1-4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The finding of this study indicated that the DASH diet could induce the expression of IRS1, which is an early substrate for the insulin receptor and plays a key role in mediating some of the insulin's actions. However, to the best of our knowledge, effect of the DASH diet on gene expression has not been reported previously, but a number of studies show the DASH diet is high in fiber, unsaturated fatty acids, antioxidant components, and low-fat dairies improve IR.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>The mechanism behind this effect is not clear, but it may be due to the increased expression of some genes such as IRS1 whose activation leads to translocation of GLUT4-containing vesicles and subsequent increase in glucose uptake.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Because IRS1 is a membrane-bound protein and its function is membrane-dependent, it is logical to hypothesize that alteration in membrane lipid induced by dietary fat may impression on the function of the plasma membrane insulin receptor. As it can be seen from the <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>, fat intake is significantly less in DASH group, and its composition is different between two groups such as polyunsaturated fat (PUFA), saturated fatty acid (SFA) and monounsaturated fatty acids (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). These findings further support the idea of previous studies have shown that long-term high-fat diets and increased plasma free fatty acid levels impair insulin signaling by alteration in IRS1 expression and tyrosine/serine phosphorylation of IRS1, leading to decreased IRS1-associated PI3K activity.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] In fact, the insulin-stimulated uptake of glucose in visceral fat deposits and muscle were damaged by the high fat diet (HFD) as corn oil-based HFD intervention causes the expansion of IR concurrently in the liver, adipose tissue, and skeletal muscle in young adult C57BL/6 mice.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Furthermore, the evidence shows that the diet composition, such as quality and quantity of fat, plays a notable role in glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity. It is commonly approved that saturated fats have a negative effect on insulin sensitivity, whereas unsaturated fats have a positive effect. Accordingly, animal and human studies have confirmed that SFAs decrease insulin sensitivity.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] It has been established that a high-PUFA diet can increase receptor tyrosine kinase activity and a high PUFA:SFA diet also improved insulin receptor function, glucose oxidation, and glucose transport in rats.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p><p>Some studies established that dietary supplementation with calcium and magnesium reduce IR and low amount of potassium, magnesium, calcium, and fiber in the diet are correlated with diminished insulin sensitivity,[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] so fruits and vegetables; rich sources of magnesium, potassium, and fibers may improve IR.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Thus, as regard to a transactional study that shown the fruit and vegetable consumption was inversely associated with mRNA expression of some pro inflammatory indicators in healthy young adults[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] a possible explanation for our results may be higher fruit and vegetable consumption in DASH diet that may similarly effects on IR related genes. In the same way, epidemiologic research data show a useful effect of raised whole grain, nuts, and dairy on diabetes risk and insulin sensitivity.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] Thus, other possible explanations for IRS1 up-regulation are consumption more dairy product, and so more Ca intake that may be supported by study which show high-calcium whey, causes smaller adipocyte size, can also partly explain the clustering of up-regulated genes in the insulin signaling pathway.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</p><p>Another important finding was that weight for the DASH diet group significantly has reduced in spite of fixing calorie intake and no change in PA during the study. As regards to the dairy product were higher in the DASH diet than the UDA diet, this finding are consistent throughout the study which has indicated the macronutrient variability of the DASH diet might be related to weight reduction.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>Although the study has successfully demonstrated that DASH diet induces IRS1 expression, it has certain limitations in terms of dietary intake in this study was self-reported, and patients were advised to follow a special diet rather than getting prepared foods, thus possibly lead to incomplete adherence to the diets.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>DASH diet increased IRS1 gene expression and it may be one of the mechanisms, which diets influence on IR.</p><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Food Security Research Center, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-7"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec1-6"><title>AUTHOR's CONTRIBUTION</title><p>MK involved in conception, design, data collection, statistical analysis, and data interpretation.
