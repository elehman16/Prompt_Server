The PsA musculoskeletal presentation is heterogeneous, involving peripheral joints, entheses, other periarticular tissues, and/or axial spine. The PsA radiographic spectrum is highly variable and includes patients with mild, non-destructive joint inflammation and those with severe, debilitating joint pain and deformities resulting from progressive joint damage. Diverse radiographic findings are reported to include erosions and joint space narrowing, soft tissue changes, and new bone formation including juxta-articular periosteal reaction and ankylosis.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Recent data implicate T helper (Th)-17 cells, key effectors in inflammation and tissue damage in several immune-mediated diseases, as playing a role in the immunopathophysiology of PsA.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> This cytokine axis can be targeted via inhibiting blockade of IL-23, which is required for Th17 cell development, or blocking the activity of the primary cytokine produced by these cells, IL-17.</p><p>Reflecting the considerable unmet clinical need, several novel therapeutics have been explored in PsA. One agent, ustekinumab (Stelara, Janssen Biotech Inc, Horsham, Pennsylvania, USA), is a human immunoglobulin G1<italic>&#x003ba;</italic> monoclonal antibody that binds to the common p40-subunit shared by IL-12 and IL-23. Ustekinumab is approved for treating moderate to severe psoriasis, as established in large phase three trials.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4&#x02013;6</xref> Ustekinumab also demonstrated efficacy in patients with active PsA in a phase two trial<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> and in the larger, phase 3 PSUMMIT-1<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> and PSUMMIT-2<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> trials, and has recently gained approval in this indication in the USA and the EU. PSUMMIT-1 included only patients naive to biologic antitumour necrosis factor-&#x003b1; (anti-TNF) treatments, whereas PSUMMIT-2 enrolled patients naive to and previously treated with biologic anti-TNF agents. Change in radiographic progression from baseline at wk 24 using data combined from the two studies, assessed via PsA-modified van der Heijde-Sharp (vdH-S) scores, was a prespecified major secondary study endpoint for both studies. This approach was taken because of the similar trial designs and contemporaneous enrolment and reading of radiographs adopted in the programme, and because the initial power calculation indicated the need for a sample size larger than would be available from either study individually to detect a significant treatment effect (also see online supplementary text). These integrated radiographic analyses through 1&#x02005;year of ustekinumab treatment in the combined phase 3 PSUMMIT-1 and PSUMMIT-2 trials are reported herein.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Patients and trial designs</title><p>Patient inclusion criteria and trial designs, which were similar across the PSUMMIT-1<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> and PSUMMIT-2<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> trials, have been detailed. Briefly, adult patients with active PsA for &#x02265;6&#x02005;months, despite &#x02265;3&#x02005;months of disease-modifying antirheumatic agents and/or &#x02265;4&#x02005;wks of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents were eligible. In PSUMMIT-2, 150 to 180 of the 300 planned randomised patients were required to have been previously treated, without consideration of reasons why therapy was discontinued, with biologic anti-TNF agents for at least 8 (etanercept, adalimumab, golimumab, certolizumab) or 14 (infliximab) wks at typical doses. However, entry with less exposure was permitted if there was documented intolerance to a TNF-inhibitor. For both PSUMMIT-1 and PSUMMIT-2, active PsA was defined by the presence of &#x02265;5/66 swollen and &#x02265;5/68 tender joints at screening and baseline, a serum C-reactive protein level &#x02265;6.0&#x02005;mg/L (modified to &#x02265;3.0&#x02005;mg/L after study start; upper limit of normal 10&#x02005;mg/L) at screening, and active or a documented history of plaque psoriasis.</p><p>The PSUMMIT-1 (NCT01009086, EudraCT 2009-012264-14) and PSUMMIT-2 (NCT01077362, EudraCT 2009-012265-60) studies were conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki and International Committee on Harmonisation good clinical practices. The protocols were reviewed and approved by each site's governing institutional review board/ethics committee, reflecting national requirements for study conduct approval. All patients provided written informed consent.</p><p>In these phase 3, multicenter, placebo-controlled trials, patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive ustekinumab 45&#x02005;mg, 90&#x02005;mg, or placebo, at wk 0, wk 4 and every 12&#x02005;wks (q12wks) thereafter. Randomisation was stratified by investigational site, baseline weight (&#x02264;/&#x0003e;100&#x02005;kg), and baseline methotrexate (MTX) usage (yes/no). At wk 16, patients with &#x0003c;5% improvement from baseline in tender and swollen joint counts entered blinded early escape; patients receiving placebo switched to ustekinumab 45&#x02005;mg, those receiving ustekinumab 45&#x02005;mg increased to 90&#x02005;mg, and patients receiving ustekinumab 90&#x02005;mg continued with their blinded dose regimen. Placebo patients who did not early escape crossed over to receive ustekinumab 45&#x02005;mg at wk 24, wk 28 and q12wks thereafter.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Radiographic assessments</title><p>Radiographic evaluations of the hands and feet were performed at baseline, wk 24 and wk 52 regardless of early escape status, or at the time of study drug discontinuation (unless radiographs were obtained within the prior 8&#x02005;wks). Centrally digitised images for each patient at all three time points within each trial were scored at the same reading session by two independent readers (and by an adjudicator if the absolute difference of the change from baseline in total vdH-S score between the two readers was &#x0003e;10 or if the change from baseline in total score was missing for one reader), in a random order and without knowledge of time point, patient identity, or treatment assignment; scoring occurred continuously from June 2011 to November 2012 within the clinical programmes. The images were scored using the PsA-modified vdH-S method.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> To assess PsA-specific radiological damage, scores for the distal interphalangeal hand joints and pencil-in-cup/gross osteolysis deformities were added to the original vdH-S score.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> The total PsA-modified radiographic score ranges from 0 to 528 (total score is sum of erosion score (0&#x02013;320) and joint space narrowing (JSN) score (0&#x02013;208)). Higher scores and more positive score changes indicate more existing radiographic damage and more radiographic progression, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Statistical analysis </title><p>Progression of structural damage was measured by change from baseline in total PsA-modified vdH-S scores of the hands and feet at wk 24. As prespecified, this major secondary study endpoint was analysed based on an integrated data analysis combining data from the PSUMMIT-1 and PSUMMIT-2 studies with all randomised patients included. Patients were analysed according to randomised treatment group, irrespective of early escape. Analysis of variance on the van der Waerden normal scores, that is, rank-transformed scores based on normal distribution,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> with treatment, patients&#x02019; baseline MTX usage (yes/no), and study indicator (PSUMMIT-1 or PSUMMIT-2) as factors in the model was employed to test the treatment difference. To control for multiplicity, the initial analysis tested the difference between the combined ustekinumab groups (45&#x02005;mg and 90&#x02005;mg combined) and the placebo group. If this was significant, then pairwise tests, using integrated data from both studies, were to be performed for each individual dose group versus the placebo group.</p><p>If the total PsA-modified vdH-S score was missing for a given patient at any of the wk 0, wk 24, or wk 52 visits, missing data were imputed. Two methods were used for imputation. If the X-ray data were available at two time points during the period from wk 0 to wk 24, or from wk 24 to wk 52, the total PsA-modified vdH-S scores at these two time points were linearly extrapolated to the missing visit in the same period. Alternatively, if radiographic data were insufficient for linear extrapolation, the median of the change in the total scores based on all patients within the same MTX stratification at the missing visit was assigned. Please see online supplementary text for a description of the sensitivity analyses performed.</p><p>Radiographic data were also analysed as a binary variable based on observed data (no imputation of missing data), using the following cut-points of change from baseline to wk 24 in total vdH-S score for &#x02018;nonprogressors,&#x02019; as defined by (1) change less than the smallest detectable change (SDC), which measures the variability of the difference in the change score between two readers, and can be viewed as the amount of change from baseline for which any smaller change cannot be reliably distinguished from random error in the measurement<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> and (2) change &#x02264;0.0. The Cochran&#x02013;Mantel&#x02013;Haenszel test adjusting for baseline MTX use and individual studies was used to assess differences between the active treatment and placebo groups. All tests were two-sided at a significance level of &#x003b1;=0.05, and radiographic data from the individual studies were analysed in a similar manner. Please see online supplemental text for details of sample size estimation.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Patient disposition and baseline radiographic characteristics</title><p>Patient screening began in November 2009, and the wk 52 clinical database locks occurred in July (PSUMMIT-1) and December (PSUMMIT-2) of 2012; the radiographic database was locked in January 2013. Overall, 1771 patients were screened for the PSUMMIT-1 and PSUMMIT-2 trials, of whom 927 patients (747 anti-TNF-naive, 180 anti-TNF-experienced) were randomised to treatment. A majority of the anti-TNF-experienced subgroup had been exposed to &#x02265;2 anti-TNF agents (55% of patients) and had previously demonstrated lack of efficacy or intolerance to anti-TNF-therapy (&#x0003e;70% of patients). The trials were conducted at 189 sites in European (565 patients), North American (319 patients), and Asia-Pacific (43 patients) countries. Patient disposition through 1&#x02005;year has been previously described for each trial.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p><p>Missing data were imputed via linear extrapolation or assignment of the median of change scores within the same MTX stratification. For the integrated dataset, the overall rates of missing radiographic data at wk 24 were low in all groups (ie, 2.3&#x02013;10.3%) and would not be expected to impact the interpretability of the integrated analyses of the effect of ustekinumab on structural damage. Across both studies, median imputation was the predominant means of replacing missing data. However, the PSUMMIT-1 and PSUMMIT-2 studies differed in terms of the amount and pattern of missing radiographic data. The highest rate of missing data was observed in the anti-TNF-experienced population in the PSUMMIT-2 study, mainly resulting from early (within initial 8&#x02005;wks) study agent discontinuation, and was more than twofold higher among placebo-treated than ustekinumab-treated patients for anti-TNF-experienced (24.2% vs 9.3%) and anti-TNF-naive (11.9% vs 5.6%) patients within the PSUMMIT-2 study. The missing data rate was generally lower and more consistent across treatment groups in the PSUMMIT-1 study (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ANNRHEUMDIS2013204741TB1">table 1</xref>).

The observation of less progression of structural damage in obese patients has been reported in RA patients, although the mechanistic basis of this observation has not been determined.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>
<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></p><p>Analysis of individual study results indicated the treatment effect observed in the predefined integrated PSUMMIT-1 and PSUMMIT-2 analyses was derived from the PSUMMIT-1 study (see online supplementary table S2). While differences in treatment effect between the two studies may derive from the smaller size and heterogeneity of the PSUMMIT-2 population, the two studies also differed in terms of missing data. The highest rate was observed in anti-TNF-experienced, placebo-treated patients within the PSUMMIT-2 study that included substantial numbers of anti-TNF-refractory patients, which then translated into higher rates of mandated data extrapolation. The higher rate of missing data in PSUMMIT-2 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ANNRHEUMDIS2013204741TB1">table 1</xref>) was mainly a result of early (within the first 8&#x02005;wks) discontinuations from the trial, with the majority occurring in the placebo arm. Per protocol, such patients did not qualify for radiographs upon discontinuation due to concerns related to excessive short-term radiation exposure. By contrast, the rate of missing data was generally low and consistent across the treatment groups in PSUMMIT-1 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ANNRHEUMDIS2013204741TB1">table 1</xref>). Thus, the application of data-handling rules impacted PSUMMIT-2 more than PSUMMIT-1. Specifically, since most missing data required median imputation, the prespecified median imputation rules can be considered to have conservatively favoured the placebo group due to a higher proportion of placebo patients having a score of 0 applied to missing data. Although the treatment effect was not demonstrated in the anti-TNF-naive population in PSUMMIT-2 (unlike PSUMMIT-1), comparison of radiographic findings between these two trial populations is limited by the low progression rate seen across all randomised groups (including placebo) of the PSUMMIT-2 trial relative to placebo-treated patients in PSUMMIT-1.</p><p>Thus, ustekinumab 45&#x02005;mg and 90&#x02005;mg through 1&#x02005;year afforded significant and sustained inhibition of radiographic progression in active PsA, supporting the role of IL-23 and the Th17 pathway in the radiographic damage of PsA. This is the first alternate mechanism of action for which the effect on PsA radiographic progression has been established, following anti-TNF agents. The PSUMMIT-1 trial continues through 2&#x02005;years, and radiographic progression through 2&#x02005;years of ustekinumab therapy will be assessed. The effect of ustekinumab on progression of structural damage in anti-TNF-experienced patients has not been established, although it also has not been adequately studied.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Web supplement</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="annrheumdis-2013-204741-s1.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e1136" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Michelle Perate MS, a paid consultant for Janssen Biotech, Inc., and Mary Whitman PhD, an employee of Janssen Biotech, Inc., for writing and editorial support; Lisa T Dooley PhD, an employee of Janssen Research &#x00026; Development, LLC, for statistical support; and Bruce Randazzo MD PhD and Philippe Szapary MD, employees of Janssen Research &#x00026; Development, LLC, for assistance with critical review of the manuscript contents.
