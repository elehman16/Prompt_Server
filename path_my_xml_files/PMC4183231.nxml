decades<sup><xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. Frequent
exposure to stress is considered an important risk factor for the development of
cardiovascular diseases<sup><xref rid="r02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. Another
well-documented risk factor for cardiovascular disease is systemic hypertension
which, in turn, has been related to elevated blood pressure reactivity
(BP<sub>R</sub>) to stress<sup><xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. Exacerbated BP<sub>R</sub> may
suggest poor autonomic modulation due to increased sympathetic drive, a condition
that has been associated with medium to long-term cardiovascular
complications<sup><xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. Also, some
reports<sup><xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> have demonstrated that individuals who are
hyperreactive to stress chronically increase their risk for psychological disorders
such as anxiety, irritability, and frustration. These feelings are associated with
increased sympathetic drive induced by chronic elevation in BP<sup><xref rid="r07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>.</p><p>Maintaining BP within the normal range can require changes in lifestyle including
good nutrition and regular physical activity<sup><xref rid="r09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. Several studies
have attempted to examine the immediate (acute) benefits of exercise both for
healthy individuals<sup><xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> and those
with cardiometabolic disorders<sup><xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. These studies observed the
significant effects of exercise, particularly on hemodynamic control, due to a
phenomenon defined as "post-exercise hypotension"<sup><xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. Moreover, 24h ambulatory blood pressure
measurements showed a protective effect of previous exercise on BP<sub>R</sub>
during activities of daily living, including a greater nocturnal dip in BP, when
compared to a control day without exercise<sup><xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>.</p><p>Although the hemodynamic benefits of aerobic and resistance exercises have been
documented in a variety of reports<sup><xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>-<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>, the acute effects of the
aforementioned exercise modes combined in a circuit method on post-exercise BP,
including the responses to a cardiovascular stress test, warrant further
investigation. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to examine the acute
BP and stress-induced BP<sub>R</sub> responses following a circuit training session
composed of both resistance and aerobic exercises at moderate intensity. Based on
the literature<sup><xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>-<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>, we hypothesized that the proposed circuit
training session would promote post-exercise hypotension and that this phenomenon
would be associated with attenuated stress-induced BP<sub>R</sub>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title><p>To test the hypothesis of the present study, volunteers were invited to participate
in two randomly assigned sessions at the exercise physiology laboratory as follows:
1) combined resistance and aerobic exercises performed in a circuit format; and 2) a
control session without exercise. In both sessions, BP was measured at rest and
every 15 minutes post-session during 1 hour of recovery following the exercise and
non-exercise control sessions. In addition, BP<sub>R</sub> was evaluated using a
cardiovascular stress test before and after the experimental sessions. The
relationship between post-exercise BP and BP<sub>R</sub> response to stress test was
also examined.</p><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>Twenty apparently healthy individuals of both genders (10 men and 10 women), with
a mean age of 33.4&#x000b1; 6.9 years (24-50 years), weight of 70.2&#x000b1; 15.8
kg (45-96 kg), height of 170.4&#x000b1; 11.5 cm (149-192 cm), body mass index
(BMI) of 23.9&#x000b1; 3.5 kg/m<sup>2-1</sup> (19.2-23.7 kg/m<sup>2-1</sup>), and
body fat percentage of 22.3&#x000b1; 6.8% (8.5-35.0%), volunteered to
participate. The classification of the subjects as "apparently healthy" was
based on the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) guidelines for risk
stratification of 1995 (interview to gather information on signs, symptoms
and/or cardiopulmonary risk factors). None of the subjects were using any
medication or had a history of diagnosed cardiovascular or metabolic
disease.</p><p>The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was
approved by the Ethics Committee of Universidade Federal do Vale do S&#x000e3;o
Francisco, Petrolina, PE, Brazil (protocol 0047.0.441.000-10). All participants
were informed of the experimental methods before giving written consent.</p></sec><sec><title>Anthropometric assessment</title><p>Standard procedures were used to measure weight, height, and body mass index
(BMI). Body density was determined according to specifications by Jackson and
Pollock<sup><xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> for men
([1.1093800 - 0.0008267 * (sum of skinfolds of the chest, abdomen and

of the triceps, suprailiac, and thigh)<sup><xref rid="r02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> - 0.0001392 * age]). Body fat percentage was
derived from Siri equation ([4.91 / density - 4.5] * 100).</p></sec><sec><title>Blood pressure measurement</title><p>All BP measurements were taken by the same trained technician through the
auscultatory method following previously described recommendations<sup><xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>, using a stethoscope (Duo
Sonic, Brazil) and a calibrated sphygmomanometer (Missouri<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>,
S&#x000e3;o Paulo, SP, Brazil) certified by Inmetro (National Institute of
Metrology, Quality, and Technology). Measurements were taken from the left arm
with the individual comfortably seated in a quiet room at a controlled
temperature of 25 &#x000ba;C. The standard auscultatory method was tested against
the automated and previously validated<sup><xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> oscillometric method (Microlife BP 3AC1-1, Microlife
USA Inc., Dunedin, FL, USA). Another sample of 30 independent individuals of
both genders rested for 10 minutes and their BP was randomly measured using both
the auscultatory and oscillometric methods, the latter conducted by another
blinded evaluator. Correlations between methods were r=0.90 (p&#x0003c;0.001) for
systolic blood pressure (SBP) and r=0.80 (p&#x0003c;0.001) for diastolic blood
pressure (DBP). Also, agreement between methods was evaluated using the
Bland-Altman<sup><xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> method.
Mean differences were 3.9 mmHg [20.2/-12.4 mmHg] and -3.4 mmHg
[10.5/-17.3 mmHg] for SBP and DBP, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Blood pressure reactivity (BP<sub>R</sub>) assessment</title><p>BP<sub>R</sub> measurements were performed using the Cold Pressor Test (CPT)
according to specifications previously described by Hines and Brow<sup><xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. These authors demonstrated the
high reproducibility of the procedure for both normotensive and hypertensive
individuals. The protocol consisted of immersing the right hand for 1 minute in
water carefully maintained at 4 &#x000ba;C (Incoterm<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Porto
Alegre, RS, Brazil). BP measurements were respectively taken at 30 and 60
seconds of immersion through the auscultatory method. The two BP values were
respectively named Peak30" and Peak60", and the procedure is considered an index
of BP<sub>R</sub>. BP was also measured 2 minutes after the end of immersion
(After2'). Of note, the adoption of the auscultatory method for BP evaluation
was due to the requirement of measurements at 30 and 60 seconds, which would not
be possible using the automated oscillometric device.</p></sec><sec><title>Experimental sessions</title><p>The volunteers underwent two experimental sessions in random order on different
days, 48 to 72 hours apart. The combined exercise session consisted of 3 laps of
a circuit with 2 minutes of recovery between laps, including the following
resistance and aerobic exercises: knee extension, bench press, knee flexion,
rowing in the prone position, squat, shoulder press, and 5 minutes up and down a
15-cm high step at 75-85% maximum heart rate and/or 13 on the 15-point Borg
Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE), a scale that ranges from 6 to 20<sup><xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. Resistance exercise loads
were implemented using dumbbells for upper body exercises and weights attached
to lower limbs for lower body exercises. Each resistance exercise was performed
in sets of 15 repetitions at 50% of the estimated 1 repetition maximum (1RM) as
suggested by Tiggemann et al.<sup><xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> with the use
of the RPE<sup><xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. The resistance
exercises were performed with rhythmic control (Metronome
Plus<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) of one second for the concentric phase and one
second for the eccentric phase. The control session was conducted under the same
conditions as the combined exercise session, with the exception that the
subjects did not perform exercises.</p></sec><sec><title>Measurements during the experimental sessions</title><p>Resting SBP, DBP, and mean arterial pressure (MAP) measurements were taken every
5 minutes over a 20-minute period and the average was considered for the
analyses (Missouri<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, S&#x000e3;o Paulo, SP, Brazil). Also, BP
was measured after each circuit lap and every 15 minutes during the 1 hour
post-exercise recovery. The same timeline and measures were followed during the
control session. The CPT was conducted before each session (after 20 minutes of
rest) and one hour after the combined exercise and control sessions. Heart rate
(HR) was also measured during each exercise and at the respective moment in the
control session (Pulse Tronic Club Trainer<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Direction
Technology Co. Ltd., Taiwan). The HR measurements were considered for aerobic
exercise control and identification of the cardiovascular load imposed by the
experimental sessions. The RPE was taken during the combined exercise session
for control of exercise intensity and the mean value considered for subsequent
analyses<sup><xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data are presented using descriptive statistical procedures (mean, standard
deviation, minimum and maximum values). The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to verify
and present the normality of data distribution. Pearson's correlation was used
to examine the relationship between resting BP measured with auscultatory and
oscillometric methods, as well as BP<sub>R</sub> in the different moments and
the BP response during and after the exercise and control sessions. The
Bland-Altman method<sup><xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> was used
to verify agreement between the two BP measurement methods. The paired-samples t
test was used to compare data for correspondent moments of experimental
sessions. A two-way repeated measures ANOVA was conducted to compare BP and
BP<sub>R</sub> responses within and between experimental sessions
[Time (Pre vs. Post) * Session (Exercise vs. Control)]. Data were
considered significant at <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05, and statistical
analyses were performed using the SPSS15.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL,
USA).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="t01">Table 1</xref> presents the mean values for HR and

hypotension after a circuit session involving aerobic and resistance exercises and
the attenuation of BP<sub>R</sub> in response to subsequent stress induction in
apparently healthy adults of both genders. In addition, the observed results suggest
that the post-exercise decrease in BP is associated with the attenuated
BP<sub>R</sub> in response to a stressor test. Consistent with previous
reports<sup><xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>-<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>, it was observed post-exercise hypotension,
however, research on this phenomenon after a combined aerobic and resistance
exercise session is still necessary. Moreover, this investigation brings the new
finding that the magnitude of post-exercise hypotension is associated with the
degree of BP<sub>R</sub> attenuation during stress.</p><p>To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate and compare BP responses and
BP<sub>R</sub> before and after a circuit session of aerobic and resistance
exercises in apparently healthy adults of both genders. Significant acute
cardiovascular effects of exercise were observed that suggest a transient
cardiovascular protection during rest and induced stress situations even in
normotensive individuals. When examining absolute BP values during recovery, we
found a favorable reduction only after the exercise session. In contrast, DBP had
acutely increased after the control session. This acute exercise-induced reduction
in BP was on average 6 and 5 mmHg for SBP and DBP, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure 1A</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">B</xref>). Similarly, stress-induced BP<sub>R</sub> was significantly
attenuated after the circuit exercise session but not after the control session,
reaching a mean difference of 7 mmHg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Figure
2A</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">B</xref>). The results presented here
can have important clinical implications. Whelton et al.<sup><xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> demonstrated that small changes in BP over a
long-term follow-up can have a relevant impact on cardiovascular disease survival.
More specifically, the authors showed that reductions of 3 and 5 mmHg can reduce the
risk of acute myocardial infarction by 8 to 14%, of coronary artery disease by 5 to
9%, and of overall mortality by 4 to 7%. Furthermore, they showed that a reduction
of only 2 mmHg in both SBP and DBP is associated with a decrease of 6 to 14% and 4
to 6% in acute myocardial infarction and coronary artery disease, respectively. A
small decrease of 2 mmHg in DBP was also associated with a reduction of 17% in
hypertension prevalence in the general population.</p><p>Previous reports have demonstrated the protective effect of a single 30-minute
exercise session performed at 70% of maximum oxygen consumption on BP of
hypertensive subjects during subsequent activities of daily living<sup><xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. These authors verified an
attenuated BP response after exercise in comparison with a control session. Brownley
et al.<sup><xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> showed exercise-induced
attenuation of BP<sub>R</sub> in young normotensive subjects in response to
different modes of stress induction (math and speech challenges). These observations
were done while comparing stress responses between pre and post-aerobic exercise
conditions. Similarly, in the present study, BP<sub>R</sub> was examined before and
60 minutes after a combined exercise circuit session. A protective effect of
exercise was observed during the post-exercise recovery period in relation to the
resting pre-exercise period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure 1A</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">C</xref>), at the same moments of pre-exercise
cardiovascular stress (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t02">Table 2</xref>), and when
comparing the same moments in the control session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Figure 2A</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">B</xref>). A new piece of
evidence found here was the significant relationship between post-exercise BP (i.e.
post-exercise hypotension) and BP<sub>R</sub> in response to the CPT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f03">Figure 3</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that some
mechanisms of exercise-induced post-exercise hypotension are the same as those
underlying attenuated BP<sub>R</sub> after exercise. In this sense, the protective
effect of exercise on BP<sub>R</sub> in response to stress would be dependent on its
capability to elicit post-exercise hypotension, however, further investigation is
needed.</p><p>Over the last decade, the mechanisms involved in the BP responses to a single bout of
exercise have been investigated with a focus on the peripheral and neural
pathways<sup><xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>. Although it was not within the scope of the
present study to investigate the mechanisms involved in post-exercise cardiovascular
responses, it is plausible that changes in baroreflex sensitivity and the consequent
attenuation of sympathetic tone may be involved<sup><xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. Previous studies demonstrated a possible interaction
between the release of <italic>P</italic> substance (a neuropeptide) from the
terminals of sensory nerves during exercise and its receptor (NK1<sub>R</sub>) in
the post-exercise recovery period in conjunction with GABAergic activation. This
combination makes the nucleus of the solitary tract more active and consequently
inhibits the activity of the ventrolateral medulla, reduces output to sympathetic
nerves, finally promoting post-exercise hypotension. Therefore, it is possible that
reduced sympathetic tonus is involved in the attenuated BP<sub>R</sub> during the
CPT after a combined exercise circuit session since a significant correlation was
noted between post-exercise BP and BP<sub>R</sub>, a condition determined through
neural reflex<sup><xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. In contrast,
exercise-induced nitric oxide release and thus peripheral resistance reduction may
also be involved<sup><xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>. Future
studies are necessary to confirm the relationship between those mechanisms and the
present results.</p><p>Regarding the intensity of the combined exercise circuit protocol, there was a
cardiovascular demand of 79&#x000b1; 11% of age-predicted maximum HR and the mean RPE
was 13&#x000b1; 1 on the 15-point Borg scale (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t01">Table
1</xref>). Previous studies examined the acute effects on BP in different
populations. Sim&#x000f5;es et al.<sup><xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> showed the occurrence of post-exercise hypotension in type 2
diabetics after a resistance exercise session performed at 43% of 1RM, in which the
mean RPE was 11 13 on the Borg scale. Motta et al.<sup><xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> investigated the acute effects of aerobic exercise
performed at 90% of the anaerobic threshold in adults of both genders and observed a
cardiovascular demand of 80% of maximum HR and a mean RPE of 13, an intensity
similar to the present study. If we also take into account other reports on RPE and
blood lactate responses as indexes of resistance exercise<sup><xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> and aerobic exercise<sup><xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> intensity, it is plausible to assume that the
combined exercise circuit examined in this study would correspond to a stimulus
within the moderate intensity domain. Therefore, exercise protocols within other
intensity domains (i.e. intense or severe domains) should be analyzed.</p><p>In relation to the design of the experimental exercise session, the practical
application is that a combined exercise circuit session involving both aerobic and
resistance exercises constitutes an interesting option to attenuate subsequent
cardiovascular stress with relatively short sessions (30-40 minutes). The circuit
method is also considered more dynamic, which may significantly influence adherence
and chronic benefits (i.e. neuromuscular and cardiovascular adaptation).</p><p>The main limitations of the present study were no measurements of BP<sub>R</sub>
during activities of daily life and no measurements for a longer period but only
during the CPT 1h post-exercise. It is speculated that this protective effect of
combined exercise on BP<sub>R</sub> lasts for a longer period, however more research
is needed to investigate this hypothesis. Furthermore, the stress test was shown to
be efficient in eliciting cardiovascular stress regardless of the moment it was
applied (pre or post-experimental sessions; <xref ref-type="table" rid="t02">Table
2</xref>). Another limitation was the non-measurement of heart rate variability
and nitric oxide release. Those measurements would enable us to examine their
relationship with the observed findings and possibly gather information regarding
the mechanisms involved.</p><p>The results presented here can be useful for professionals involved in prescribing
exercise for cardiovascular health. Apparently, healthy adults of both genders
aiming to reduce cardiovascular stress, particularly BP and BP<sub>R</sub>, can
benefit from circuit training involving aerobic and resistance exercises, with
duration ranging from 30 to 40 minutes. The training sessions can consist of a
circuit of six resistance exercises, alternating lower and upper body muscle groups,
followed by 5 minutes of aerobic exercise. The circuit can be performed in 3 laps
with sets of 15 repetitions at 50% of the estimated 1RM or 13 on the 15-point Borg
scale [6-20] for each resistance exercise and a 2-min recovery
interval between laps. The aerobic exercise can be conducted using the linear model
between 75-85% of age-predicted maximum HR and/or 13 on the Borg scale.</p><p>Despite the potential practical applications of moderate-intensity combined exercise
for decreasing BP and BP<sub>R</sub>, previous reports have demonstrated that
post-exercise hypotension depends on the intensity<sup><xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. Therefore, higher intensities should be
considered for both aerobic and resistance exercises, however prior medical
screening including orthopedic, cardiovascular, and metabolic evaluation is strongly
recommended.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>A single circuit session of resistance and aerobic exercises performed at moderate
intensity promoted significant post-exercise decreases in BP. Moreover,
BP<sub>R</sub> measures were attenuated during this post-exercise hypotension
condition. Finally, the decrease in BP was significantly correlated with attenuated
BP<sub>R</sub> in healthy adults of both genders.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We are grateful to <italic>Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient&#x000ed;fico e
