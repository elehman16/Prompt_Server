</p><p>The purpose of our study was to compare the efficacy of 3&#x000a0;days of treatment using a potentiated sulfonamide antibiotic (TMP&#x02010;SMX) with 10&#x000a0;days of treatment using a first&#x02010;generation beta&#x02010;lactam (cephalexin) in female dogs with uncomplicated bacterial cystitis. We hypothesized that short&#x02010;duration sulfonamide (SDS), the standard of care for uncomplicated cystitis in women, would be more efficacious than long&#x02010;duration beta&#x02010;lactam (LDBL), the historical first&#x02010;line treatment for female dogs, in achieving clinical and microbiological cures. Our primary outcomes were clinical and microbiological cure rates, both short term (4&#x000a0;days after antibiotic discontinuation) and long term (&#x0003e;30&#x000a0;days after antibiotic discontinuation). A secondary objective was to determine whether there was any evidence of immunologic sensitization to SMX in dogs treated for 3&#x000a0;days with TMP&#x02010;SMX.</p><sec id="jvim12324-sec-0008"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="jvim12324-sec-0009"><title>Selection of Dogs</title><p>Enrollment was considered for client&#x02010;owned female dogs that presented to the University of Wisconsin Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital from October 2010 to December 2012 with clinical signs consistent with bacterial cystitis. Each dog was evaluated for the presence of &#x02265;1 of the following primary complaints: dysuria, pollakiuria, stranguria, hematuria, or malodorous urine. Eligible dogs needed to have a complete medical history, including any drug treatment during the previous 3&#x000a0;months. In addition, each owner was asked to commit to returning with his or her dog for 3 additional assessments on study days 7, 14, and 42 after the start of antibiotic treatment.</p><p>A complete physical examination, including neurological and digital rectal examination, was performed on each dog to rule out any underlying causes that might predispose the dog to bacterial cystitis. Dogs were not eligible if they were systemically ill, had a history of bacterial cystitis or lower urinary tract signs within the previous 6&#x000a0;months, had received antibiotic, anti&#x02010;inflammatory, or immunosuppressive treatment within the previous 3&#x000a0;months, were found to have an underlying predisposing condition for cystitis, including a history of urinary incontinence, urolithiasis, azotemia (serum creatinine concentration &#x0003e;1.4&#x000a0;mg/dL and urine specific gravity &#x0003c;1.030), hyperadrenocorticism, diabetes mellitus, or myelopathy, or had a prior history of hypersensitivity to potentiated sulfonamides or keratoconjunctivitis sicca. Doberman Pinscher dogs also were excluded because of reported predisposition to sulfonamide hypersensitivity.<xref rid="jvim12324-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">20</xref>
</p><p>Eligible dogs were further screened to rule out the presence of radiopaque uroliths using a right lateral abdominal radiograph. A complete blood count (CBC), serum biochemistry profile, and urinalysis (UA) were performed to further exclude possible predisposing conditions for cystitis and to serve as baseline data to monitor for adverse effects of treatment. A Schirmer tear test (STT) was performed before enrollment to document normal tear production. All owners provided informed consent at the time of enrollment, and all study protocols were reviewed, approved, and conducted in accordance to the University of Wisconsin Animal Care and Use Committee.</p></sec><sec id="jvim12324-sec-0010"><title>Study Design</title><p>This study was a prospective, randomized, investigator&#x02010; and owner&#x02010;blinded, placebo&#x02010;controlled clinical trial. A computer&#x02010;generated randomization table was used to allocate dogs into 1 of 2 treatment groups. Dogs assigned to the SDS group were treated with 15&#x000a0;mg/kg TMP&#x02010;SMX PO q12h for 3&#x000a0;days, followed by a placebo capsule PO q12h for 7&#x000a0;days. Dogs assigned to the LDBL group were treated with 20&#x000a0;mg/kg cephalexin PO q12h for 10&#x000a0;days. A pharmacist dispensed study medications directly to owners to ensure that investigators remained blinded to treatment group assignment. After the initial screening process and before starting treatment, a urine sample was submitted for bacterial culture and antimicrobial susceptibility, and serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were banked as baseline controls for assessment of sulfonamide sensitization.</p><p>Treatment was initiated based on a clinical diagnosis of uncomplicated bacterial cystitis, defined as compatible clinical signs of acute dysuria in an otherwise healthy dog. Three days after starting antimicrobial treatment, each owner was contacted by phone or email regarding his or her dog's clinical response and status of presenting clinical signs. Clinical and microbiological outcomes were evaluated 4 and &#x0003e;30&#x000a0;days after discontinuation of antibiotics. To retain investigator and owner blinding, all dogs were re&#x02010;evaluated at the hospital on study days 7, 14, and 42 after the start of antimicrobial treatment. Study day 7 served as the short&#x02010;term assessment point (4&#x000a0;days after antibiotics were completed) for SDS dogs, and study day 14 served as the comparable short&#x02010;term assessment point (4&#x000a0;days after antibiotics were completed) for LDBL dogs. Study day 42 served as the long&#x02010;term assessment point (&#x0003e;30&#x000a0;days after antibiotics were completed) for dogs in both groups. At each re&#x02010;evaluation, complete history, physical examination, urine culture, and STT were performed. In addition, on study day 7, CBC, serum biochemistry profile, and UA were performed to evaluate for hematologic abnormalities or evidence of organ dysfunction. On study day 42, serum and PBMC were obtained for assessment of immunologic sensitization to SMX. Dogs were monitored throughout the study for occurrence of inappetence, vomiting, diarrhea, lethargy, fever, skin eruption, joint swelling or pain, petechiae, ecchymoses, jaundice, pallor, ocular discharge, and decreased tear production (STT &#x0003c;8&#x000a0;mm/min).</p><p>Primary outcomes were determined 4&#x000a0;days and &#x0003e;30&#x000a0;days after discontinuation of antibiotics and defined as follows: (1) dogs with clinical failure had persistent clinical signs independent of culture results; (2) dogs with clinical cure had resolution of clinical signs independent of culture results; and (3) dogs with microbiological cure had resolution of bacteriuria independent of clinical signs. Dogs with persistent clinical signs on study day 3 were considered clinical failures and were removed from the study protocol; these dogs were eligible for rescue antibiotic treatment as indicated by culture and susceptibility results or were considered for additional diagnostic tests. Dogs that had a positive clinical response to antibiotic treatment within the first 3&#x000a0;days but had a negative urine culture at the time of enrollment were included in the study on an intention&#x02010;to&#x02010;treat basis, given that approximately 10% of women with uncomplicated bacterial cystitis have negative urine cultures at the time of diagnosis, but still respond clinically to antibiotic treatment.<xref rid="jvim12324-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">21</xref> Dogs that had recurrence of clinical signs during the course of the study also were considered treatment failures and underwent an unscheduled urine culture and susceptibility to guide further treatment outside of the study protocol. Dogs that had recurrence of bacteriuria without clinical signs were diagnosed with asymptomatic bacteriuria (ABU), which in women is defined as a positive urine culture in a patient without clinical signs of fever, urgency, increased frequency, dysuria, or some combination of these. In healthy women, treatment of ABU is not indicated because it does not decrease the frequency of symptomatic infection nor does it prevent further episodes of ABU.<xref rid="jvim12324-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">22</xref> These dogs were monitored at the scheduled re&#x02010;evaluation time points, but were not treated unless clinical signs developed.</p></sec><sec id="jvim12324-sec-0011"><title>Sample Collection and Analysis</title><p>Cystocentesis was the preferred method of urine collection, but if cystocentesis was not possible because of patient compliance, a midstream voided sample was obtained. Urine was collected by the same method for each individual dog throughout the study, whenever possible. For voided samples, the perineum of dogs was not routinely cleaned before urine collection. Significant bacteriuria (&#x0003e;100,000 colony forming units [CFU]/mL) was not observed in urine samples collected from normal dogs by means of this midstream collection technique.<xref rid="jvim12324-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">23</xref>
</p><p>Urine was submitted directly to the laboratory or stored at 4&#x000b0;C if submission was delayed. Urine cultures were plated for a quantitative culture within 24&#x000a0;hours of collection. Urine cultures were evaluated for growth at 24 and 48&#x000a0;hours. Growth was quantitated as CFU/mL of urine. Bacterial growth cut&#x02010;offs were defined for each urine collection method used and based on both human and veterinary recommendations.<xref rid="jvim12324-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">24</xref>, <xref rid="jvim12324-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">25</xref>, <xref rid="jvim12324-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">26</xref>, <xref rid="jvim12324-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">27</xref> Significant growth from voided samples was defined as having 1 to 3 pathogens present at &#x0003e;10,000&#x000a0;CFU/mL.

Most dogs in both treatment groups had resolution of clinical signs by treatment day 3 (89% in SDS group, 94% in LDBL group). Clinical cure rates 4&#x000a0;days after discontinuation of antibiotics also were comparably high in both groups (85% in SDS group, 72% in LDBL group). However, durable clinical remission rates were lower (only 50% in SDS group and 65% in LDBL group) when evaluated &#x0003e;30&#x000a0;days after completing antibiotics. This demonstrates a relatively high rate of recurrence of clinical infections in this population of female dogs.</p><p>Microbiological cure rates were relatively low in both treatment groups. Only 59% of SDS and 36% of LDBL group dogs had microbiological cures 4&#x000a0;days after completion of antibiotics, and only 44% of SDS and 20% of LDBL dogs had microbiological cures &#x0003e;30&#x000a0;days after completing treatment. All 7 dogs that had clinical relapse between short&#x02010;term (4&#x000a0;days after treatment was completed) and long&#x02010;term (&#x0003e;30&#x000a0;days after treatment was completed) follow&#x02010;up also had evidence of recurrent infection. However, some dogs had ABU (positive cultures at follow&#x02010;up without clinical signs); specifically, 35% of dogs in the SDS group and 43% in LDBL group, which contributed to the lower microbiological cure rates as compared with clinical cure rates. Most of these ABU dogs (9 of 12) did not develop a recurrence of clinical signs during the study observation period.</p><p>The relative importance of clinical versus microbiological cure for bacterial cystitis in dogs is not clear. Clinical cure rather than microbiological cure is the primary outcome for short&#x02010;duration antibiotic treatment in women with uncomplicated lower urinary tract infections. Short&#x02010;duration antibiotic treatment is aimed at decreasing the bacterial load to a level that allows clinical signs of the infection to be controlled, while the patient's immune system eradicates the remaining bacterial organisms from tissues (ie, bladder, vagina, and rectal reservoirs).<xref rid="jvim12324-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref>
</p><p>The clinical cure rates reported in women treated for uncomplicated cystitis are 90% (SDS) and 85% (LDBL) at short&#x02010;term follow&#x02010;up and 85% (SDS) and 70% (LDBL) at long&#x02010;term follow&#x02010;up.<xref rid="jvim12324-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref>, <xref rid="jvim12324-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref>, <xref rid="jvim12324-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref> The microbiological short&#x02010; and long&#x02010;term cure rates reported for SDS and LDBL in women are similar to their reported clinical cure rates. The lower long&#x02010;term clinical and microbiological cure rates in the dogs reported in this study may be attributable to differences in anatomy, endogenous estrogen concentrations, gut flora, perineal hygiene, degree of involvement of the upper urinary tract, or other factors between the 2 species.</p><p>Treatment failures occur most commonly in women with occult upper urinary tract infections.<xref rid="jvim12324-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref> Although upper urinary tract involvement in the dogs in our study could not be completely ruled out, dogs with polyuria and polydipsia or azotemia and concurrent dilute urine were not eligible. Nine of 11 dogs in this study with clinical recurrence had concurrent bacteriuria. In this study, there was a subjective difference in the timing of clinical recurrence relative to completion of treatment between the 2 treatment groups, but in each case, the organism cultured at recurrence was the same bacterial species cultured at enrollment. This is in contrast to women with recurrent infections restricted to the bladder, which typically are caused by an organism different from the original isolate (ie, reinfection).<xref rid="jvim12324-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref> However, without genotyping, discernment between a relapsing infection and reinfection is not possible in this group of dogs.</p><p>Factors that may contribute to antibiotic treatment failure in dogs with bacterial cystitis include antibiotic choice, duration of treatment, owner compliance, superficial versus deep bladder wall involvement, dysbiosis of the vaginal vault, or concurrent illness, even if subclinical. At study enrollment, all dogs in this study were screened for common complicating factors, and all bacterial isolates cultured had <italic>in vitro</italic> susceptibility to the study antibiotics. The high long&#x02010;term failure rates of both treatment groups suggest that in some female dogs, &#x0201c;uncomplicated&#x0201d; bacterial cystitis, diagnosed on the basis of acute onset of clinical signs in the absence of predisposing factors, may be more complicated than previously recognized.</p><p>The clinical use of and published reports describing short&#x02010;duration antimicrobial treatment for the treatment of cystitis in dogs are limited to a single experimental study and recently reported clinical study. In the small experimental study, bacterial cystitis was induced with pathogenic <italic>E.&#x000a0;coli</italic> in dogs and after development of clinical signs, a 3&#x02010;day antimicrobial regimen was evaluated in 8 female dogs using either trimethoprim&#x02010;sulfadiazine (TMP&#x02010;SDZ) or amikacin.<xref rid="jvim12324-bib-0037" ref-type="ref">37</xref> The 4 female dogs treated with TMP&#x02010;SDZ achieved microbiologic cures at 48&#x000a0;hours and 14&#x000a0;days after 3&#x000a0;days of treatment. A recent clinical study, published after initiation of this study, compared long&#x02010;duration beta&#x02010;lactam treatment to short&#x02010;duration enrofloxacin.<xref rid="jvim12324-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">38</xref> The study found that high&#x02010;dose short&#x02010;duration enrofloxacin (20&#x000a0;mg/kg for 3&#x000a0;days) was not inferior to a 14&#x02010;day course of amoxicillin&#x02010;clavulanic acid in the treatment of male and female dogs with bacterial cystitis.<xref rid="jvim12324-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">38</xref> Clinical cure rates of 77% (short&#x02010;duration enrofloxacin) versus 81% (long&#x02010;duration amoxicillin&#x02010;clavulanate) were based on short&#x02010;term follow&#x02010;up only (7&#x000a0;days after completion of treatment). Microbiological cure rates at the 7&#x02010;day follow&#x02010;up were 81% versus 80% for the short&#x02010;duration enrofloxacin and long&#x02010;duration amoxicillin&#x02010;clavulanate groups, respectively. Long&#x02010;term assessment of the clinical and microbiological cure rates of high&#x02010;dose short&#x02010;duration enrofloxacin is needed because long&#x02010;term cure also is a relevant clinical outcome, as demonstrated in this study.</p><p>Although short&#x02010;term clinical cure rates are comparable between the 2 short&#x02010;duration therapies (77% in the high&#x02010;dose short&#x02010;duration enrofloxacin group 7&#x000a0;days after treatment versus 85% in the SDS group 4&#x000a0;days after treatment reported here), the short&#x02010;term microbiological cure rate appears higher for short&#x02010;duration enrofloxacin than for SDS in this study (81% versus 59%, respectively). However, 76% (13 of 17) of the SDS dogs had microbiological cure 11&#x000a0;days after discontinuation of treatment (data not shown, but available because of the double&#x02010;blinded design of this study).</p><p>Fluoroquinolones are only considered first&#x02010;line treatment in women with uncomplicated bacterial cystitis in regions where bacterial sulfonamide resistance is high (eg, &#x02265;20%), in women with known sulfonamide hypersensitivity, or in women in whom lower urinary tract signs persist or recur within a week or two of antibiotic treatment.<xref rid="jvim12324-bib-0039" ref-type="ref">39</xref> In this study, dogs considered treatment failures that had positive bacterial urine culture were rescued with antibiotic treatment. Because these dogs were considered treatment failures, additional treatment for &#x0201c;uncomplicated&#x0201d; bacterial cystitis was not pursued. Eight of the 9 treatment failure culture&#x02010;positive dogs were treated with a 2&#x02010;week course of fluoroquinolone treatment. This treatment was thought to be a logical second&#x02010;tier intervention in the dogs in this study that failed traditional long&#x02010;duration beta&#x02010;lactam treatment or short&#x02010;duration sulfonamide treatment (treatment group was unknown to investigators and owners at the time of dispensing rescue antibiotics).</p><p>The strengths of this study include the double&#x02010;blinded, placebo&#x02010;controlled experimental design and long&#x02010;term follow&#x02010;up. One limitation was the use of abdominal radiographs and not a complete ultrasound examination to rule out complicating factors at enrollment. However, full abdominal ultrasound examination is not performed routinely for first time or isolated urinary tract infections in dogs, and the study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of the 2 treatments in a clinically relevant setting.</p><p>Additional limitations of this study were single&#x02010;center recruitment and smaller than planned study population. Based on an interim analysis of clinical cure rates 2&#x000a0;years into enrollment, we closed the study because the results failed to show superior efficacy of TMP&#x02010;SMX at 4 or &#x0003e;30&#x000a0;days after discontinuation of treatment and our hypothesis was that clinical cure would be 20% higher for SDS. In addition, the rates of microbiological cure, which were higher in the SDS group at both short&#x02010; and long&#x02010;term follow&#x02010;up, did not reach significance in this population of dogs. If present, this would be a clinically relevant difference, but based on a post hoc sample size calculation using our actual data, 80 dogs would have been needed in each treatment group to detect these differences, if real, as significant.</p><p>This relatively small canine patient population limited our ability to adequately evaluate the SDS&#x02010;treated dogs for sulfonamide immunoreactivity. In women, longer durations (eg, &#x02265;5&#x000a0;days) of sulfonamide treatment are associated with more adverse effects compared with short&#x02010;duration (ie, single dose or 3&#x02010;day) protocols. However, published studies did not specifically evaluate the sulfonamide&#x02010;treated patients for a sulfonamide&#x02010;specific immune response.<xref rid="jvim12324-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref>, <xref rid="jvim12324-bib-0040" ref-type="ref">40</xref>, <xref rid="jvim12324-bib-0041" ref-type="ref">41</xref> In this study, none of the dogs (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;20) treated with TMP&#x02010;SMX for 3&#x000a0;days developed clinical signs consistent with a sulfonamide hypersensitivity reaction, and the subpopulation of dogs (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;8) tested for antisulfonamide antibodies and sulfonamide&#x02010;specific T cells after 3&#x000a0;days of TMP&#x02010;SMX did not develop a sulfonamide&#x02010;specific immune response. These data only provide a pilot assessment of immunoreactivity in dogs treated with short&#x02010;duration sulfonamide treatment. Larger studies are needed to adequately determine if limiting a sulfonamide naive dog's exposure to 3&#x000a0;days is safe and avoids immune sensitization associated with longer duration protocols.<xref rid="jvim12324-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">31</xref>
</p><p>In summary, this study did not demonstrate a difference in cure rates between SDS and long&#x02010;duration beta&#x02010;lactam treatment regimens for uncomplicated cystitis in female dogs. No serious clinical or biochemical adverse events were noted during the study in either treatment group.
