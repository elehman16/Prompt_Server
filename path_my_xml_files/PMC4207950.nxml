After menopause, increased RANKL results in increased bone resorption and bone loss, which can lead to osteoporosis (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), a condition characterized by compromised bone strength and increased risk of fracture (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).</p><p>Denosumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds with high specificity to human RANKL (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), thereby reducing osteoclast number and activity and decreasing bone resorption. In postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, denosumab significantly reduced bone turnover markers (BTMs), increased bone mineral density (BMD), and reduced new vertebral (68%), hip (40%), and nonvertebral (20%) fractures compared with placebo during the pivotal 3-year Fracture Reduction Evaluation of Denosumab in Osteoporosis Every 6 Months (FREEDOM) trial (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p><p>Evaluating the long-term safety and efficacy of denosumab is important because osteoporosis is a chronic disease requiring long-term treatment. A phase 2 dose-ranging study demonstrated that up to 8 years of continued denosumab treatment in a small group of women was well tolerated and associated with continued gains in BMD and maintained reductions in BTMs (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). There is increasing interest in the long-term effects of antiosteoporotic treatments, and it is important to confirm key clinical trial results. Therefore, in addition to the long-term phase 2 extension, the 3-year, phase 3 FREEDOM trial has been extended for 7 additional years, during which all participants receive open-label denosumab. We report here the effects of denosumab on BTMs, BMD, safety, and fracture rates for the first 3 years of the extension. For women from the FREEDOM placebo group who enrolled in the extension, these data (as the crossover group) provide a unique opportunity for comparison with the original 3-year denosumab FREEDOM observations because these subjects have now received 3 years of denosumab exposure. In addition, for women from the FREEDOM denosumab group who enrolled in the extension, these data (as the long-term group) allow for evaluation of safety and efficacy beyond 5 years of treatment.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Patients and Methods</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>The FREEDOM pivotal trial design (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="clinicaltrials.gov">clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>: NCT00089791) and the extension design (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="clinicaltrials.gov">clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>: NCT00523341) have been described in previous publications (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) and are summarized here. FREEDOM was a phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 3-year study conducted at 214 centers globally. Postmenopausal women who enrolled had a lumbar spine or total hip BMD T-score less than &#x02212;2.5 at either location and &#x02212;4.0 or greater at both locations and were 60&#x02013;90 years old. Participants were randomized to receive placebo or 60 mg denosumab (Prolia; Amgen Inc) sc every 6 months for 3 years and were instructed to take calcium (&#x02265;1 g) and vitamin D (&#x02265;400 IU) daily. All women who completed the FREEDOM trial [ie, completed their 3 y visit and did not discontinue the investigational product (IP)] and did not miss more than one dose of IP were eligible to enter the extension. The extension was originally planned for 2 years but was subsequently extended to 7 years. At the end of 2 years, participants consented again to continue for the additional 5 years. During the extension period, all participants are scheduled to receive denosumab 60 mg sc every 6 months (&#x000b1;1 mo) with daily calcium and vitamin D. The study is ongoing and annual/preplanned data analyses are performed as part of continuing pharmacovigilance. The data reported here include the first 3 years of the extension, representing up to 6 years of denosumab exposure for the long-term group.</p><p>Representatives of the sponsor designed the study in collaboration with investigators and conducted the statistical analyses according to a prespecified plan. The study protocol was approved by an institutional review board or ethics committee for each site. Participants provided written informed consent. All authors had access to the data, participated in drafting or revising the manuscript, approved the final version for submission, and take responsibility for the integrity of the analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Study procedures</title><p>During the extension, study visits are scheduled at baseline (corresponding to the end of the FREEDOM trial) and every 6 months for 7 years.</p><p>Measurements of serum C-terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen (CTX; Nordic Bioscience Diagnostics A/S) and procollagen type 1 N-terminal propeptide (P1NP; Orion Diagnostica Oy) were determined using overnight fasting serum samples collected from a subset of women who participated in the FREEDOM BTM substudy and continued in the extension. To increase the sample size of the BTM substudy, the protocol was amended to include additional participants at year 2 of the extension, and evaluation of these additional participants began at year 3 of the extension. Subsequent to the publication of the data from the first 2 years of the extension (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), additional samples for P1NP from the second year were identified in storage by the central laboratory. P1NP levels were measured in these samples and the data have been included in the current analysis. Undetectable values were imputed using the corresponding assay's established lower limit of detection value (CTX, 0.049 ng/mL; PINP, 10 &#x003bc;g/L).</p><p>BMD measurements were performed by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry at the lumbar spine and proximal femur (all women) and at the forearm (subset of women) at extension baseline and years 1, 2, and 3.</p><p>Vertebral fractures were identified by a central facility (Synarc Inc) using the Genant semiquantitative grading scale (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) using thoracic and lumbar lateral radiographs obtained at extension baseline, year 2, and year 3. Prevalent vertebral fractures at baseline and new vertebral fractures were defined as described previously (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Clinical and nonvertebral fractures required confirmation by a radiologist's report or diagnostic imaging and were documented as they occurred.</p><p>Subjects were queried about adverse events (AEs), clinical fracture information, and concomitant medications by study site staff every 3 months. Each potential case of osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) was reviewed by an independent, blinded, external adjudication committee, as described previously (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p><p>An adjudication process was initiated during year 6 to review potential cases of atypical femoral fracture. Available x-ray images of femoral fractures that occurred at any time between baseline and year 3 of the extension were retrospectively reviewed by a panel at the central radiographic vendor site (Synarc Inc). Only the major criteria established by the ASBMR 2010 Task Force for Atypical Subtrochanteric and Diaphyseal Femoral Fractures (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) were used for adjudication by this panel: fracture location (subtrochanteric or femur diaphysis); fracture type (noncomminuted, simple transverse, or short oblique); no or minimal trauma; and the absence of any evidence of malignancy, prosthesis, pins, or other hardware at or near the fracture site prior to the fracture event. A finding of indeterminate was not permitted.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>The primary objective of the extension is to describe the safety and tolerability of denosumab. Secondary objectives include evaluation of the changes in BTMs and BMD and the incidence of vertebral and nonvertebral fractures.</p><p>Safety analyses included participants who received one or more doses of investigational product. Treatment groups were defined by the original randomized assignments in FREEDOM. For consistency with our prior report of the FREEDOM extension data (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Authorities version 13.0 was used to code and report AEs for this publication. The analyses of AEs included exposure-adjusted subject incidence rates and were descriptive. A selected group of serious AEs/AEs are reported, consistent with the primary FREEDOM publication (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) and the first long-term follow-up report (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p><p>Analyses of BTM included participants who received one or more doses of investigational product in the extension and had observed values at the time points of interest. Results are presented as actual values and correspond to medians and interquartile ranges. Analyses of BMD percentage change from baseline were conducted as described previously (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), required observed values at FREEDOM baseline and the time points of interest, and are presented as least squares means with 95% confidence intervals.</p><p>Crude subject incidence rates for new vertebral fracture and new and worsening vertebral fracture were calculated and Kaplan-Meier estimates of the cumulative incidence of clinical vertebral, all clinical, nonvertebral, major nonvertebral, and hip fractures were calculated. Nonvertebral fractures included low-trauma fragility fractures only, as defined previously (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). New vertebral and nonvertebral fracture incidence rates were also calculated for a per-protocol (PP) subset and a modified per-protocol (MPP) subset, both of which were prespecified. Both subsets included participants who were compliant with the protocol (characterized by the nonviolation of any of the important protocol deviations). The MPP subset further excluded subjects who missed two or more (not necessarily consecutive) doses of denosumab during the extension.</p><p>Because there was no placebo group in the extension, a simulation method developed for such an extension study design (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) was used to estimate expected fracture rates in a hypothetical cohort of placebo controls (virtual twin). As described previously, this modeled fracture risk for a theoretical placebo-treated population matched to actual study participants with regard to characteristics that were predictive of fracture risk in the participants in the original FREEDOM placebo group (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Protocol-specified exploratory analyses were carried out comparing the model group's estimated lumbar spine and nonvertebral fracture rates with those observed in the treatment groups. Estimates of the relative risks (RRs) and their respective bootstrap 95% confidence intervals were calculated.</p><p>Fracture and safety data from all women enrolled in FREEDOM are summarized in this manuscript to allow for comparison with the 3-year extension results. For BTMs and BMD, data from women enrolled in the extension are presented.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>There were 7808 participants enrolled in the FREEDOM pivotal trial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>).

The purposes of the study extension are to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of continued denosumab administration (long- term group) in a large number of participants and to assess the consistency of findings from 3 years of denosumab treatment (crossover group) as compared with the parent study.</p><p>For the long-term group that continued denosumab for a total of 6 years, BTMs were maintained at lower than pretreatment levels and BMD continued to increase. These distinctive long-term effects on BMD confirm the results of the extended phase 2 study (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) and are consistent with the previously reported effects of denosumab on trabecular and cortical bone structure (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Evidently the apparent differences from bisphosphonate effects reflect the differences in biological mechanisms. However, exactly how the differences in drug mechanism of action result in the observed differences in structural effects remains to be fully elucidated. Fracture incidence in the long-term group remained low and below the rates reported in the FREEDOM placebo group. New vertebral and nonvertebral fracture rates were also lower than the fracture rates that would have been expected if extension participants had received placebo, as estimated with a previously reported methodology (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). As discussed previously (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), this methodology is improved from a previous osteoporosis study (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), not only in the sophistication of the model but also in the use of data from the placebo group of the same trial rather than a different population. These observations are consistent with a 6-year maintenance of effect by denosumab to reduce fractures.</p><p>A main objective of the extension was to further characterize the safety of denosumab. Importantly, the subject incidence rates of adverse events reported by participants in the long-term group during the first 3 years of the extension were similar to or lower than those reported by the FREEDOM placebo and denosumab groups. There was no evidence of increased frequency of any specific event, including malignancy and infections (including erysipelas and cellulitis), despite the fact that the participants were aging. Cases consistent with atypical femoral fracture and ONJ have been observed in patients receiving denosumab in this study, but the incidence remains low.</p><p>Because the cross-over group was treated with denosumab for 3 years during the extension, there was a unique opportunity to compare these efficacy and safety results with those obtained during the 3 years of denosumab treatment in the parent trial. The data obtained were consistent with FREEDOM observations: rapid and marked reduction in BTMs, large increases in BMD, low fracture rates, and a favorable benefit/risk profile. These data provide further supportive evidence for the consistency of results obtained with denosumab treatment.</p><p>The ultimate objective of osteoporosis treatment is the reduction of fractures. Although this study did not have a long-term placebo group, it is particularly noteworthy that the rates of all fractures during the first 3 years of the extension, for both the long-term and crossover denosumab groups, were similar to or lower than the 3-year rates observed during the parent trial for the denosumab group. Interestingly, the rate of new vertebral fractures in the crossover group was similar to that observed in the extension long-term group. For nonvertebral fractures, the rate in the crossover group was similar to that seen in the denosumab group during the parent trial, whereas the rate in the long-term group appears to have declined further. The comparisons with the virtual placebo model are consistent with these findings.</p><p>It was recently reported that gains in total hip BMD predict a considerable proportion of the fracture risk reduction observed with denosumab in the parent trial (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), suggesting the possibility of using change in total hip BMD as a predictor for the effect of denosumab treatment on fracture risk. With this in mind, the continued gains in total hip BMD observed over 6 years of treatment with denosumab in this extension study are encouraging.</p><p>One inherent limitation of the study is that not all qualified FREEDOM participants enrolled in the extension, so long-term efficacy and safety observations were limited to those who were eligible and chose to participate. In addition, the open-label design of the study and the lack of a continuing placebo group precluded direct comparisons of results from denosumab-treated participants and placebo-treated participants for all measures. A virtual placebo (virtual twin) model was used to estimate the fracture risk for a placebo-treated population otherwise similar to the denosumab-treated subjects.</p><p>In summary, in the ongoing extension to the FREEDOM trial, 6 years of denosumab treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis was associated with sustained but not progressive decreases in bone turnover, continued increases in BMD, and maintenance of low fracture rates. Efficacy data from the cross-over group were consistent with observations from the 3 years of the original FREEDOM trial. There was no apparent increase in the risk of AEs with extended exposure or with cross-over from the placebo group.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group content-type="abbreviations"><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations:
