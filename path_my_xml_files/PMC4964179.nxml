Tofacitinib monotherapy was previously shown to inhibit structural damage, reduce clinical signs and symptoms of RA, and improve physical functioning over 24&#x02005;months in methotrexate (MTX)-naive adult patients with RA. In this post hoc analysis, we compared efficacy and safety of tofacitinib in patients with early (disease duration &#x0003c;1&#x02005;year) versus established (&#x02265;1&#x02005;year) RA.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>MTX-naive patients &#x02265;18&#x02005;years with active RA received tofacitinib monotherapy (5 or 10&#x02005;mg two times a day, or MTX monotherapy, in a 24-month Phase 3 trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Of 956 patients (tofacitinib 5&#x02005;mg two times a day, n=373; tofacitinib 10&#x02005;mg two times a day, n=397; MTX, n=186), 54% had early RA. Baseline disease activity and functional disability were similar in both groups; radiographic damage was greater in patients with established RA. At month 24, clinical response rates were significantly greater in patients with early versus established RA in the tofacitinib 5&#x02005;mg two times a day group. Both tofacitinib doses had greater effects on clinical, functional and radiographic improvements at 1&#x02005;and 2&#x02005;years compared with MTX, independent of disease duration.

Binary end points (eg, achievement of ACR20 response) were compared between tofacitinib (5 or 10&#x02005;mg two times a day) and MTX in a post hoc analysis using the normal approximation to the binomial distribution. Missing values were computed using the non-responder imputation method. Continuous end points, such as change from baseline in HAQ-DI scores, were analysed using a linear mixed-effect model for repeated measures. Treatment, visit, treatment-by-visit interaction and baseline were included as fixed effects, and with patients as a random effect. Estimates of mean changes from baseline for each treatment, as well as mean differences versus MTX were obtained from the model as least squares (LS) means, with corresponding SEs. For vdHmTSS, missing values due to patient discontinuation were linearly extrapolated based on the baseline value and postbaseline value prior to discontinuation. The binary variable of progression/non-progression was obtained from linearly extrapolated imputation data. Observed case data were used in any descriptive analyses. ORs with 95% CI, comparing early versus established disease for each treatment group, were provided for each end point of interest. If the 95% CI did not contain the value 1.0, the difference between the two groups was considered statistically significant at the 5% significance level. No preservation of type I error or multiple-comparisons correction was applied to p values, as statistical significance defined as p&#x0003c;0.05 was exploratory in nature.</p><p>Analyses of safety data were based on observed cases. Incidence rates (IRs; unique patients with events per 100 patient-years of observation) for SIEs were based on the number of patients with an event, and the total exposure time censored at time of event, death or discontinuation from the study, and compared between treatment groups. Exact Poisson 95% CIs adjusted for exposure time were calculated for IRs.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Demographics</title><p>Baseline patient demographics and disease characteristics are summarised in <xref ref-type="table" rid="RMDOPEN2016000262TB1">table 1</xref>.

Patients who received tofacitinib monotherapy had a statistically greater likelihood of achieving clinical response compared with those who received MTX, whichever tofacitinib dose or disease duration was compared. Baseline mean vdHmTSS and erosion scores were observed to be higher in this study in patients with longer compared with shorter disease duration, as expected, with increased joint damage in established RA that has not been treated effectively.</p><p>It has been postulated that there is a window of opportunity during which it may be possible to prevent joint damage with early and aggressive treatment of RA.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>

Although this analysis demonstrated that treatment response at month 24 in patients treated with tofacitinib 5&#x02005;mg two times a day was higher in patients with shorter disease duration, no significant difference between early and established RA was seen in the tofacitinib 10&#x02005;mg two times a day or MTX treatment groups. Thus, our post hoc analysis did not provide any definitive support for the concept of a window of opportunity. This study was not designed to address differing responses dependent on disease duration, and further investigation of the effect of tofacitinib in early versus established RA is warranted.</p><p>In considering these results in terms of clinical practice, it could be concluded, in line with the principle of treating to target, the best results with tofacitinib or MTX are obtained in patients with early RA. Therefore, the diagnosis of RA should be made, and treatment started, as early as possible after the development of symptoms. If after 3&#x02005;months of aggressive MTX therapy (ie, at least 20&#x02013;25&#x02005;mg/week) an adequate response is not observed, or if MTX is not tolerated, then, if possible, the patient could be switched to tofacitinib monotherapy. If a patient has some response to MTX, but not a significant response, it would be reasonable to add tofacitinib to MTX. An ongoing Phase 4 study will evaluate an add-on versus switch strategy in patients with RA with an inadequate response or intolerance to MTX.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></p><p>One potential limitation of this post hoc analysis is that disease duration was defined by the reporting of time since diagnosis at baseline by the investigator, rather than any objective criteria. Diagnosis of RA will vary from clinic to clinic, depending on local practice; the fact that the mean duration of disease for patients in the established RA group was around 6&#x02005;years, but that these patients were still MTX-naive, highlights the potential uncertainty around disease duration for some patients. A further possible limitation is that this analysis was not prespecified; as such, comparison of tofacitinib effects with those of MTX within disease duration groups was not planned. Also, randomisation into the clinical trial was therefore not stratified by disease duration; the distribution of patients between groups is therefore determined by the decision to use disease duration of &#x0003c;1 and &#x02265;1&#x02005;year to categorise early versus established RA. However, the results of the sensitivity analysis suggest that the selection of 1&#x02005;year as a cut-off to define early RA was not critical.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Within treatment groups, improvements in signs and symptoms, physical function and inhibition of progression of structural damage were generally similar between patients with early RA and patients with established RA, although statistically significantly greater improvements in signs and symptoms of disease were observed at month 24 with tofacitinib 5&#x02005;mg two times a day monotherapy in patients with early RA versus those with established RA.</p><p>Tofacitinib 5 and 10&#x02005;mg two times a day monotherapy significantly improved signs and symptoms and physical function, and inhibited the progression of structural damage, in MTX-naive patients with early or established RA, as compared with MTX monotherapy.
