Patients over 40&#x000a0;years of age admitted to the post-operative care unit after a Whipple procedure or major gynaecological surgery and presenting with signs of hypovolaemia are eligible for inclusion. Patients are randomised in a 1:1 fashion with no stratification to either rapid (30&#x000a0;minutes) or slow (180&#x000a0;minutes) infusion of 5% albumin at a dose of 10&#x000a0;ml/kg ideal body weight. Plasma volume is measured using <sup>125</sup>I human serum albumin at baseline (prior to albumin infusion) as well as at 30&#x000a0;minutes and 180&#x000a0;minutes after infusion start. The primary endpoint is change in plasma volume from baseline to 180&#x000a0;minutes after the start of 5% albumin infusion. Secondary endpoints include the integral of plasma volume over time from baseline to 180&#x000a0;minutes after the start of the infusion and transcapillary escape rate of albumin (%/h) from 180&#x000a0;minutes to 240&#x000a0;minutes after the start of albumin infusion. In addition, diuresis, change in central venous oxygen saturation, lactate and blood pressure will be evaluated.

Hypovolaemia will amplify the inflammatory reaction by reducing cardiac output and oxygen delivery, which creates a vicious circle. Fluid therapy is therefore a cornerstone in the peri-operative treatment of patients undergoing major surgery as well as in patients with increased vascular leakage of other aetiologies. However, even if fluid therapy is life-saving, it is also associated with side effects such as further oedema formation, coagulopathy and further endothelial dysfunction. Several studies indicate that these side effects may adversely affect outcome following surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Also, in other patient groups with SIRS in the intensive care unit (ICU), it has been shown that fluid overload is associated with increased incidence of respiratory failure and worse outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>From a clinical perspective, it is therefore important that the fluid administered to antagonize hypovolaemia remains intravascular as far as possible. Colloids are macromolecules for which the vessel wall has a low permeability, and proponents of colloids argue that less volume is required for equal plasma volume compared with crystalloids. However, extravasation of colloids not only is a function of the vessel wall permeability but also is dependent on the volume of fluid that is filtered across the capillary wall, which in turn depends on the transcapillary hydrostatic pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In addition, transient hypervolaemia induced by rapid administration of colloids may induce increased release of the permeability-increasing diuretic agent atrial natriuretic peptide and components of the endothelial glycocalyx [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>Taken together, these data indicate that slow administration may reduce extravasation of colloids by minimizing transient hypervolaemia and transient increases in hydrostatic pressure. This hypothesis is supported by results derived from two animal model studies of sepsis-induced systemic inflammatory response showing that the plasma volume expansion was greater in animals randomised to receive a slow infusion than in those randomised to receive a rapid infusion of the same volume of colloid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>Fluid administration is one of the most common therapeutic interventions in ICUs and in post-operative units around the world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], and a fluid bolus is a recommended method to assess fluid responsiveness. However, to date, no study has addressed the importance of infusion rates in a clinical setting. Although rapid correction of hypovolaemia makes intuitive sense, the need for further knowledge in this aspect of fluid resuscitation was highlighted by the recent Fluid Expansion as Supportive Therapy trial, which showed a surprising increase in mortality following a rapid administration of resuscitation fluids compared with less aggressive fluid resuscitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Based on these considerations, the primary objective of the present study is to test the hypothesis that plasma volume expansion of a given volume of colloid is greater if fluid is administered slowly rather than rapidly.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><p>We are conducting a single-centre, investigator-initiated, prospective, parallel-group, randomised study of two different albumin infusion rates in patients following major abdominal surgery. The study is approved by the regional ethical vetting board in Lund, Sweden (Dnr 2014/15), and will be conducted at Sk&#x000e5;ne University Hospital in Lund. Overviews of the trial design according to the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) statement and an overview of patient flow through the study are presented in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, respectively. A SPIRIT checklist is provided in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>. Informed consent will be obtained non-consecutively from eligible participants when a member of the research team is available. The length of the study will be from signing of informed consent until 36&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;7&#x000a0;days after the start of infusion of the test substance. All patients will be followed by a study investigator in a visit at the trial centre. All patients will be evaluated with regard to potential adverse effects by one of the investigators. The first patient was included on 18 June 2014. The protocol has been amended two times. The first amendment extended inclusion criteria to also include post-operative patients after major gynaecological surgery to promote recruitment. The second amendment changed the interim analysis plan by adding the Haybittle-Peto approach for the testing of efficacy. In addition, ongoing vasopressor and inotropic therapy was omitted as an exclusion criterion. The first amendment was made after 1 patient had been included, and the second was made after 24 patients had been included. The amendments were approved by both the regional ethical vetting board and the Swedish Medical Products Agency (MPA), and the current protocol version 1.3 2015-04-03 was approved by MPA 2015-05-27.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Overview of enrolment, interventions and assessments according to the SPIRIT (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials) statement</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="2"/><th colspan="8">Study period</th></tr><tr><th>Enrolment</th><th>Allocation</th><th colspan="5">Post-allocation</th><th>Close-out</th></tr><tr><th>Time point</th><th>-t<sub>1</sub>

Blood samples are collected 5&#x000a0;minutes prior to injection of <sup>125</sup>I-HSA and 10&#x000a0;minutes after injection of <sup>125</sup>I-HSA for the plasma volume calculations. Plasma concentration is determined in a gamma counter (PerkinElmer 1480 Wizard; PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA), and plasma volume is calculated by dividing the injected&#x000a0;dose of <sup>125</sup>I-HSA by the change in concentration of <sup>125</sup>I-HSA in plasma at 10&#x000a0;minutes post-injection. Injected doses are corrected for remaining activity in the syringes.</p><p>Haematocrit is measured by colorimetric analysis using a blood gas analyser (Radiometer 850; Radiometer, Copenhagen, Denmark). Assuming that no blood loss occurs during the study period, changes in haematocrit will reflect changes in plasma volume. By this methodology, plasma volumes can be estimated every half-hour during the infusion of albumin. By measuring plasma volume with <sup>125</sup>I-HSA at three different points in time, the potential effect of alterations in small- to large-vessel haematocrit can be corrected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The area under the plasma volume curve will then be calculated for each patient (plasma volume over time).</p><p>The TER for albumin is a measure of leakage of albumin from microvessels into the microvasculature. Changes in TER reflect changes in microvascular permeability and changes in parameters influencing convective transport of albumin such as transvascular hydrostatic pressure. Plasma concentration of <sup>125</sup>I-HSA is measured at 10&#x000a0;minutes, 30&#x000a0;minutes, 45&#x000a0;minutes and 60&#x000a0;minutes after the last injection of the tracer. Plasma concentration of <sup>125</sup>I-HSA as a function of time will be plotted in a log-linear plot. The slope of the line represents TER and will be expressed as the percentage decrease in plasma concentration of <sup>125</sup>I-HSA per hour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].

Information on co-morbidities, medications, results of pre-operative physical examinations, routine laboratory analysis results, American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classifications, Physiological and Operative Severity Score for the enUmeration of Mortality and morbidity and Revised Cardiac Risk Index will be collected from the hospital electronic chart system. Peri-operative data will be collected from the anaesthesia chart, and data that will be registered include anaesthesia methods and drugs, type and volume of fluids, peri-operative bleeding, and diuresis. Inclusion criteria will be registered in CRFs before randomisation. Clinical haemodynamic evaluation will be performed and recorded at inclusion and at 180&#x000a0;minutes after the start of albumin infusion.

In the present study, we wish to compare differences in changes in plasma volume, and it is reasonable to assume that the SD is in the lower part of this range. In an experimental study, a 50% greater plasma volume expansion was found after slow administration of 5% albumin compared with a bolus dose of the same volume [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. If we wish to detect a 40% difference in volume-expanding effect following administration of 10&#x000a0;ml/kg of 5% albumin, assuming that the SD of the plasma volume is 5, then about 30 patients in each group are required to obtain a power of 80%. To adjust for a slightly lower than expected treatment effect and for the possibility that patients may not complete the protocol, we intend to include a total of 70 patients: 35 patients in each arm. Should the number of patients who complete the protocol be &#x0003c;30 in any of the treatment groups, we plan to increase the sample size to maintain power.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Statistical analysis plan</title><p>The study will continue until the planned number of patients has been included, unless the interim analysis indicates that the study should be stopped.

The sponsor will delegate auditing to the Clinical Research Unit, Sk&#x000e5;ne University Hospital in Lund, an independent party that will perform on-site monitoring before, during and after the study. Considering that the patients will be treated according to normal routine during major abdominal surgery, that the infusion rates and volumes are within the normal range, and the low frequency of adverse events (AEs) in an earlier large prospective randomised clinical trial comparing albumin with normal saline in an ICU setting, the study will be performed without the use of a data monitoring board [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Interim analysis</title><p>An independent statistician will perform an interim analysis for assessment of efficacy and futility after 36 patients have completed the protocol.

A SAE is defined as an event that fulfils one or more of the following criteria: results in death, is life-threatening, requires prolongation of hospitalisation, results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity or any other important medical event. The investigator evaluating the patient at the end of the study is responsible for the treatment of any AE or SAE until resolution of the AE or SAE. Depending on the nature of the AE or SAE, the treatment will take place at either the trial centre, the local hospital or as an outpatient.

The decision to include patients subjected to a Whipple procedure or major gynaecological surgery is based on the clinical experience that these patients often appear hypovolaemic in the immediate post-operative period and thus are likely to require fluid resuscitation. Post-operative hypovolaemia in these patients is at least partly due to vascular leak secondary to the systemic inflammatory response initiated by the operation, and these patients are therefore likely to share pathophysiological mechanisms with other critically ill patients requiring fluid resuscitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Given the transient nature of the need for fluid resuscitation in the majority of these post-operative patients, the immediate post-operative period was believed to represent the optimal time point for our purposes.</p><p>Albumin is chosen as the study colloid because albumin is a naturally occurring colloid with very few contraindications in the current setting and with an excellent safety record [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The rates of infusion are chosen to differ as much as possible within the range of clinical practice for this patient category. In routine clinical practice, the anaesthesiologist caring for the patient decides how quickly 5% albumin is to be administered, and the rates and doses to be tested are within the limits normally used in our institution as well as in others, and they do not differ from our clinical routine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p>Plasma volume measurement using <sup>125</sup>I-HSA is considered to be the gold standard for measurement of plasma volume and is used clinically in many hospitals worldwide. The radiation dose received by the patients due to participation in the study is approximately 0.12&#x000a0;mSv and is less than the background radiation that patients are naturally exposed to during a 6-month period, and also &#x0003c;0.1% of the dose used during radioiodine treatment of hyperthyroidism. Therefore, in accordance with World Health Organisation guidelines, patients will not receive treatment with potassium iodide to block thyroid uptake of radiolabelled iodine.</p><p>Measurement of TER for albumin is commonly used to evaluate vascular leak of albumin. After a bolus dose of <sup>125</sup>I-has, there is a steep decline in plasma concentration during the first 10&#x000a0;minutes, which is thought to represent mixing and distribution into a rapidly equilibrating space. After the first 10&#x000a0;minutes, the rate of decline in plasma concentration of <sup>125</sup>I-HSA reflects extravasation and a gradual increase in lymphatic return of the tracer. To minimize the influence of lymphatic return on the decrease in in plasma concentration of tracer, TER is measured during the first hour after injection. It could be argued that recirculation of <sup>125</sup>I-HSA from the two preceding plasma volume measurements (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) could influence the TER measurement. The magnitude of this influence during the 4-h experimental period can be modelled by assuming a TER value of 15%, a ratio of 1:4 between the intravascular and interstitial extracellular compartments. On the basis of these assumptions, it can be estimated that recirculation will have a negligible influence on a difference in TER between the two treatment groups (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>). This conclusion aligns with results from a similar analysis concerning repeated TER measurements in patients with sepsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec25"><title>Trial status</title><p>Recruitment has been completed.
