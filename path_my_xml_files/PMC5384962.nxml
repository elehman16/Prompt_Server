No safety concerns or dose-limiting toxicities were identified (Study-1). Incidence of gastrointestinal-related AEs was not dose related but higher incidences of rash AEs were associated with higher-dose seletalisib (Study-2 rash AEs: 18 in 12 seletalisib-treated subjects versus 1 in 1 placebo-treated subject). Mean seletalisib plasma concentration-time profiles increased with increasing doses after single and multiple dosing, with no major deviations from dose-proportionality.

Despite these advances, suboptimal outcomes continue to be a barrier to the effective management of immune-inflammatory diseases and there remains a clinical need for novel therapeutic interventions.</p><p>PI3Ks are key enzymes regulating cell survival, proliferation and differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Ongoing development of small-molecule inhibitors targeting Class I PI3K isoforms (&#x003b1;, &#x003b2;, &#x003b3; and &#x003b4;) aims to provide enhanced therapeutic options in cancer, inflammation and autoimmunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The PI3K&#x003b1; and PI3K&#x003b2; isoforms are ubiquitously expressed, whereas the PI3K&#x003b3; and PI3K&#x003b4; isoforms are expressed predominantly in leukocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Pan-Class I, PI3K&#x003b1;-specific and PI3K&#x003b2;-specific inhibition has been the focus of anti-tumour research, but targeted inhibition of PI3K&#x003b3; and PI3K&#x003b4; has been prioritised for the treatment of immune-inflammatory diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. PI3K isoform-specific inhibition has the potential to improve clinical responses not only where targeting multiple isoforms with a combination of isoform-specific compounds is beneficial (e.g. solid tumours, functional redundancy between PI3K isoforms) but also where it may not be (e.g. chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, autoimmune inflammatory disease) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>Studies in mice with a catalytically inactive knock-in of the p110&#x003b4; gene (D910A) have demonstrated the pivotal role of PI3K&#x003b4; in the development and function of T, B and mast cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Pharmacologic inhibition of PI3K&#x003b4; suppresses B cell response to antigen stimulation and to cytokines, suggesting that inhibition of this pathway is likely to suppress B cell activity in autoimmune diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of PI3K&#x003b4; has inhibitory effects on human T cells ex vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>Seletalisib is an orally bioavailable small-molecule with preclinical evidence supporting selective inhibition of PI3K&#x003b4; at both the biochemical and cellular level, and no apparent potential liabilities due to off-target activity (UCB data on file), thereby supporting the rationale to initiate an early clinical development program in immune and inflammatory diseases such as psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis and primary Sjogren syndrome. This paper presents results from two clinical studies investigating the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of single and multiple doses of seletalisib and the pharmacodynamic (PD) effects on markers of inflammation.</p><p>Study-1 was the first-in-human study in healthy adults and subjects with mild-to-moderate psoriasis (NCT02303509), whereas Study-2 (NCT02207595) further evaluated seletalisib at higher doses in healthy adults. The primary objective of each study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of seletalisib administered as single oral doses and as ascending multiple oral doses in healthy adults and in subjects with psoriasis (Study-1 only). A secondary objective in each study was to evaluate the PK profile of single and multiple doses of seletalisib (including preliminary assessment of the effect of food in Study-1 only) and to investigate the PD effect of seletalisib as indicated by changes in ex vivo basophil degranulation. In Study-1, exploratory objectives in one cohort of subjects with mild-to-moderate psoriasis included investigation of the effects of seletalisib on measures of cellular responses in situ (including effects on numbers of T cells, dermal dendritic cells, Langerhans cells and neutrophils) and evaluation of the effect of multiple doses of seletalisib on clinical features of plaque psoriasis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study populations</title><p>Healthy subjects (both studies) and subjects with mild-to-moderate psoriasis (Study-1 only), age 18&#x02013;55&#x000a0;years, were enrolled by the Principal Investigators.

</p><p>Study-1 (Part-A), comprised single doses of seletalisib (1, 5, 10 and 15&#x000a0;mg) administered to healthy subjects using an alternating panel approach (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Panel 1 consisted of 17 subjects and panel 2 of 18 subjects. In each panel subjects were randomised to one of three sequences and received different ascending doses of seletalisib or placebo over three (panel 1) or two (panel 2) periods (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

Size and appearance of the psoriatic lesion of interest (selected at screening) were assessed by lesion severity score and lesion area. Total affected area (percentage of BSA) and Physician&#x02019;s Global Assessment were assessed to evaluate overall disease severity. Histological assessments of skin biopsies (6&#x000a0;mm) were performed by immunofluorescent microscopy of frozen sections of lesional skin, except for haematoxylin and eosin staining and IL-17 staining which were performed on formalin fixed paraffin embedded sections.

The potential for seletalisib to cause gastrointestinal (GI) tract adverse effects was assessed by careful monitoring of subject reports of AEs such as abdominal pain, bloating, nausea, vomiting and alteration of bowel function (e.g. diarrhoea, constipation or bleeding). A formal safety review was conducted before each dose escalation. In Study-1 (Part-B), the potential for seletalisib to interfere with insulin signalling was assessed by monitoring blood glucose and C-peptide levels as part of the standard laboratory tests and by performance of oral glucose tolerance tests, measuring glucose and C-peptide levels, pre-dose and during exposure in all cohorts.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>In each study, the primary population for analysis was the full analysis set (FAS), which comprised all subjects who had received &#x02265;1 dose of seletalisib or placebo. PK analysis was performed on the PK per-protocol set (PK-PPS), which was a subset of the FAS consisting of subjects with no important protocol deviations likely to affect PK variables who received seletalisib; subjects who received placebo were excluded from this analysis. In Study-1 and Study-2, sample sizes of 57 and 36 subjects, respectively, were considered sufficient to permit assessment of the safety and tolerability of seletalisib and were not based on statistical considerations of power and sample size.

The majority of screen failures were due to subject ineligibility (133 subjects [53.6%]); failed basophil degranulation tests were the most common reason for ineligibility (68 subjects [27.4%]). Overall, 35 subjects were randomised in Part-A of Study-1 and 27 were randomised in Part-B. Most subjects completed the study (30 [85.7%] in Part-A and 26 [96.3%] in Part-B); the most common reason for failing to complete the study was withdrawn consent.

Furthermore, only half of the seletalisib 15-mg cohort samples (Part-A) were analysed due to a technical problem. Therefore, Study-1 basophil degranulation data should be interpreted with caution. In Part-A of Study-1, inhibition of basophil degranulation was observed in all seletalisib-treated groups compared with placebo (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;35) (Online Resource <xref rid="MOESM9" ref-type="media">S2</xref> Fig. 4A).

In the seletalisib 15-mg group, improvements in these parameters were seen in some of the six subjects with psoriasis. Due to the low number of subjects assessed and exploratory nature of this objective, no formal statistical testing was performed on the immunohistochemistry assessments. However, the descriptive summaries demonstrated some evidence of target engagement. This included a trend towards reduced numbers of dermal inflammatory cells (i.e. CD3+, CD11c+ and MPO+ cells) and a return of the resident Langerhans cells (observed as CD1a+ cells) in the six subjects with psoriasis treated with seletalisib 15&#x000a0;mg relative to the three placebo-treated subjects with psoriasis (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Cellular responses in lesional biopsies.

There were no deaths in either study.</p><p>The absence of dose-limiting toxicities in Study-1 supported exploration of higher doses of seletalisib in Study-2. The most commonly reported AEs were headache (both studies), back pain (Study-1) and rash (Study-2). In Study-2, rash and headache were also the most commonly reported treatment-related AEs. A higher overall incidence of AEs was observed in higher-dose seletalisib groups compared with lower-dose seletalisib and placebo groups. Apart from the events of rash and headache, the majority of AEs were of mild or moderate intensity, transient and self-limiting, and showed no relationship to seletalisib dose. Modest reductions in neutrophils were detected in both studies but no dose relationship was identified, and these changes were not of clinical concern. No clinically significant abnormalities in vital signs, laboratory tests or ECGs were detected in either study.</p><p>PK results demonstrated mean plasma concentration-time profiles that increased with increasing doses of seletalisib after single and multiple dosing, and indicated a short-to-intermediate time to peak concentration and a shallow biphasic disposition. No major deviations from dose-proportionality were noted up to the maximum tested dose of seletalisib (90&#x000a0;mg QD). In Study-1, no food effect was observed except for the expected slight increase in time to peak plasma concentration due to delayed gastric emptying with food intake. There was no unexpected accumulation or loss of exposure indicating that the seletalisib PK profile was time independent. Only a small proportion of the total dose was recovered as unchanged drug in urine. Preclinical animal studies demonstrate that seletalisib is primarily eliminated by combined hepatic metabolism and biliary excretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. It remains to be determined whether seletalisib disposition could differ in special populations (e.g. patients with hepatic impairment) or as a result of drug-drug interactions. Overall, the PK profiles from these studies are supportive of a once-daily administration.</p><p>Study-1 PD results provided preliminary evidence of target engagement in psoriatic skin tissue together with changes in other markers of psoriatic cell biology. Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease, consisting of erythematous scaly plaques in a localised (scalp, elbows, knees) or generalised (scalp/face, trunk, limbs) distribution, resulting from immune infiltrate consisting primarily of dendritic cells (antigen presenting cells), T cells and neutrophils in affected skin. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] Although basophils are absent from psoriatic lesions, degranulation of basophils following crosslinking of Fc&#x003b5;R1 is dependent on PI3K&#x003b4; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The ex vivo stimulation of basophil degranulation inhibition demonstrated in Study-1 suggested that PI3K&#x003b4; inhibition was achieved at all tested doses of seletalisib. However, while a drug effect was observed, high inter-subject variability was noted, which could limit the quantitative value of this assay, particularly in terms of dose selection or prediction. This appeared to align with a reduction in basophil numbers in all subjects during the transition from the UK pollen season through to autumn. There have been previous reports of atopic and non-atopic individuals demonstrating a reduction in total basophil numbers following the end of a pollen season [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. It also appears that the basophil degranulation assay was not as sensitive as required and more susceptible to variation when only low levels of inhibitor were tested in Study 1.</p><p>Study-2 data confirmed the basophil degranulation inhibitory effects observed in Study-1; however, the magnitude of this effect appeared lower at multiple dose-day 14 than multiple dose-day 1. Notably, Study-2 basophil degranulation data variability was lower compared with Study-1 and is believed to be attributable to improved assay design via stimulation with anti-Fc&#x003b5;R1 (instead of anti-IgE), which in-house data show is less sensitive to seasonal variation. Furthermore, the use of higher-dose seletalisib provides a clearer and less variable assay signal.</p><p>Studies of psoriasis have shown it to be a complex disease involving both Th1 and Th17 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], as well as a substantial role for the innate immune system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Some evidence of reduced dermal infiltration of immune cells, including T cells, neutrophils and dendritic cells, was observed in the seletalisib-treated group compared with the placebo group, although the effects were not statistically significant. The seletalisib group also showed some evidence of restoration of Langerhans cells in the epidermis compared with the placebo group, which is consistent with previous reports of clinical responses to other treatments in psoriasis patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. A more thorough analysis of PD responses to seletalisib in the immune compartment was not undertaken due to the small number of subjects in the present study, along with the inherent variability of the required ex vivo assays. The recent identification of activating mutations in PI3K&#x003b4; associated with the primary immunodeficiency disease, activated PI3K&#x003b4; syndrome (APDS), indicates that characterisation of the effects on immunity are warranted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p>PI3K&#x003b4;-specific inhibition has demonstrated potential in the treatment of inflammatory diseases including asthma, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Furthermore, PI3K isoform-specific inhibition is associated with a reduced toxicity risk compared with inhibition of multiple PI3K isoforms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. PI3K&#x003b4; knock-in mice, which lack functional PI3K&#x003b4;, are largely protected from imiquimod-induced dermatitis, correlating with reduced interleukin (IL)-17 in the lesion and serum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. PI3K&#x003b4; inhibition also inhibits IL-17 production by T cells from healthy individuals and patients with psoriasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Compared to skin from healthy individuals, high levels of expression of pAKT, a downstream marker of PI3K activity, have been reported in psoriasis indicating an active PI3K pathway in this disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p>Patients with psoriasis were included in Study-1 (one cohort only) to enable target engagement assessment on skin biopsies. Most currently available treatments for psoriasis lead to improvements in disease severity over the course of several weeks or months; consequently, it was not expected that a 2-week exposure to seletalisib would lead to clearance of skin lesions in Study-1. Despite this, some improvements in the clinical features of plaque psoriasis were seen in some of the subjects treated with seletalisib 15&#x000a0;mg compared with those treated with placebo. In addition, the lower numbers of immune cells, including T cells (CD3+) and neutrophils (MPO+), in the skin biopsies from subjects who received seletalisib compared with those who received placebo suggest that seletalisib may have the potential to reduce key components of the inflammatory infiltration relevant to psoriasis. Return of the resident Langerhans cells in some seletalisib-treated subjects was also encouraging. These results are particularly promising, given that the selective PI3K&#x003b4;/&#x003b3; inhibitor, duvelisib, failed to meet its phase II study primary endpoint (American College of Rheumatology 20% response rate [ACR20] at week 12) in patients with moderate-to-severe RA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p>In conclusion, results from these studies in healthy adults and subjects with mild-to-moderate psoriasis suggest that seletalisib has an acceptable safety profile at doses of &#x02264;45&#x000a0;mg QD for 14&#x000a0;days, with a PK profile supportive of once-daily dosing and preliminary evidence for demonstration of target engagement. Collectively, these findings support the continued clinical development of seletalisib in immune-inflammatory disorders.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec17"><p>
