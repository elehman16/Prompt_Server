Most centers possess standard adult FOBs, some, particularly in developing countries might not have access to the pediatric-sized devices.

For years, the blind technique was used for their placement and position was further confirmed clinically by auscultation.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] It was later established that most preferred method for placement of these devices was a real-time visualization of airway anatomy using the of pediatric fiberoptic bronchoscope (FOB) (Klein, 1998 #3). This, owing to cost, is not available in many developing nations; however, most centers in the developing world do have an adult FOB. Furthermore, all patients posted for lung surgeries undergo bronchoscopy as a part of their workup before surgery. The study objective was to assess if preintubation assessment of airway with adult FOB would improve the precision of double-lumen tubes (DLETT) and BB placement and also decrease the number of attempts and manipulations required for placement of these devices. Preoperative airway assessment using an adult FOB may also help in identifying patients, in whom placement of DLETT/BB may be difficult due to anatomical problems.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>The study was carried out after approval from the institutional review board. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients over 18 years of age who were undergoing thoracic surgery requiring lung isolation. Patients who consented for the study were included and randomized into two groups: The control group (in whom the isolation device was placed blindly) or the study group (in whom the preintubation adult FOB assessment was performed). Demographic data, age, sex, height, and weight were recorded. All patients were administered general anesthesia with or without epidural catheterization. The choice of isolation device (either DLETT or BB) and size and side of DLETT were left to the discretion of the anesthesiologist conducting the case. The DLETT used was Portex<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Blue Line<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> endobronchial tubes (Smiths Medical) and the BBs were Coopdech&#x02122; endo BBs (Daiken Medical Company, Ltd.). The experience of the person inserting the device was also noted and categorized as &#x0003c;5 insertions, 5&#x02013;20 insertions, and &#x0003e;20 insertions.</p><p>After patients were anesthetized, patients in the study group underwent a FOB with a 5.3 mm adult FOB performed by a thoracic surgeon. During this preintubation bronchoscopy, the following parameters were noted: Any existing airway abnormality, distances from incisor to carina and primary carina to secondary carina on the left side, and from carina to opening of the right upper bronchus on the right side. Following this, the isolation device was inserted in both groups; however, in the study group, distances measured were used to determine the depth of insertion of the lung isolating device.</p><table-wrap id="d36e216" position="float"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Isolation device</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Depth fixed</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Left side DLETT</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">A + C</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Right side DLETT</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">B cm + 0.5 cm</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Bronchial blocker</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">A cm + 2 cm</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>A: Distance from the incisors to the carina which will be measured on FOB, B: The distance from incisors to the take off of the right upper lobe bronchus, C: Distance from tracheal to bronchial opening.

When the DLETT was used, first the tracheal cuff was inflated, and bilateral lung expansion was confirmed by inspection of chest wall movement and by auscultation. Now the tracheal limb of the catheter mount was clamped, and the lung was ventilated through the bronchial lumen. The bronchial cuff was inflated until there was no leak of air from the tracheal limb, and there was no air entry heard in the nonventilated lung.</p><p>For the right-sided DLETT, air entry was heard at the apex while ventilating through the bronchial lumen.

The most important step in achieving lung isolation is accurate positioning of the lung isolation device.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] It is an accepted practice that all DLETTs and BBs should be placed under FOB guidance; however, with pediatric FOB being unavailable in many centers in the developing world, our goal was to assess whether pre intubation assessment of the airway with adult FOB would aid in achieving lung isolation. Furthermore, pre intubation airway assessment could help in detecting airway abnormalities such as narrow subglottis which in turn could help in choosing the appropriate lung isolation device (BB or smaller size DLT). We did not detect any airway abnormalities in the intervention group. However, in the control group, there was 1 patient in whom the DLT could not be inserted due to narrow subglottis. In this patient, a BB was inserted. If pre intubation assessment would have been done, excessive airway handling could have been avoided for the patient.</p><p>FOB assessment performed after the placement of the lung isolation device showed that 50% of DLETTs in the FOB group (study group) were optimally placed as compared to only 25% optimally placed DLETTs in the control group; however, malposition rate was not found to be significantly different in both groups. de Bellis <italic>et al</italic>. showed that 48% of patients required repositioning in spite of satisfactory findings on auscultatory examination.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] In our study, even though the clinical assessment showed satisfactory results, 70% of patients in the control group and 56.7% of patients in the study group needed FOB-guided manipulations to ensure optimal placement.</p><p>In addition, the percentage of patients in whom optimal position of DLETT was achieved by blind insertion was only 25% as compared to other studies where it was 73.3% and 63% in studies by Cheong and Koh, respectively.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] In our study, a large proportion of patients were found to have DLETTs and BBs in suboptimal position, and we did not find any association between the experience of the anesthesiologist inserting the lung isolation device and success rate of placement. Our center, however, does not have dedicated thoracic anesthesiologists, and the relatively infrequent assignments in the thoracic operation rooms may have resulted in a lower success rate of optimal positioning of DLETT by blind insertion.</p><p>Regarding limitations-all measurements were made before insertion of lung isolation device. The measurements were made with the FOB inserted orally in the sniffing position. There may have been small differences in measurements due to variation in the path taken by the FOB in the pharynx and also by the variable position of patient's head and neck.</p><p>In addition, the clinical impact of the suboptimal position could not be studied as all suboptimal positions were also corrected by repositioning the lung isolation device.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>This study showed that preintubation assessment of the airway in patients for thoracic surgery using the adult FOB improved the success rate of optimal positioning of the lung isolation device. We feel this has important implications for hospitals and centers without access to pediatric bronchoscopes. In addition, our study, although small, suggests that using an appropriate preintubation strategy using commonly available adult bronchoscopes which may decrease the necessity of pediatric FOB in operation theaters and facilitate smaller centers to improve their accuracy with lung isolation devices.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec
