This study highlights some key challenges for communicating about this issue. It is important to clarify that overdetection differs from false positives in terms of its more serious consequences (overtreatment and associated harms). Screening decision aids also must clearly explain their purpose of facilitating informed choice. A staged approach to development and piloting of decision aids is recommended to further improve understanding of overdetection and support informed decision-making about screening.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>PUBLIC HEALTH</kwd><kwd>QUALITATIVE RESEARCH</kwd><kwd>PREVENTIVE MEDICINE</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Strengths and limitations of this study</title></caption><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The strengths of this project include the staged, mixed-methods approach to developing and evaluating the decision aid, combining both qualitative and quantitative data.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The iterative pilot-testing process enabled us to explore women's responses to successive drafts, identify problematic aspects, and revise the materials to clarify misconceptions.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Decisions about initial design and subsequent modifications were undertaken by an experienced multidisciplinary team with input from laypersons and independent experts.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Some participants in stage 1 pilot interviews already had breast screening experience, thus differing from our ultimate intended audience, and this may have affected their responses.

<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Supporting informed choice about screening requires clear, balanced information on benefits and harms,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> as reflected in new approaches to screening information provision.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> One way to facilitate informed decision-making is through the use of decision aids&#x02014;resources designed for patients or citizens facing specific decisions about treatment or screening. Decision aids provide evidence-based information about the benefits and harms of healthcare options, and their capacity to improve users&#x02019; knowledge about the options has been demonstrated via randomised trials in a variety of healthcare settings.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p><p>One of the main harms of mammography screening is overdetection (or overdiagnosis) leading to treatment of breast cancers that would not otherwise present clinically or cause problems in a woman's life. Overdetection results in harm to emotional and physical health, both in the short and long terms. <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> However, information about overdetection has been lacking from materials distributed by breast screening programmes worldwide.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12&#x02013;14</xref> Furthermore, there is little evidence regarding how best to convey this novel information to the public.</p><p>In a qualitative study,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> we examined how women aged 40&#x02013;79 responded to information about overdetection, exploring its potential influence on decision-making about breast cancer screening and treatment. The study also highlighted challenges in explaining this new and counterintuitive concept, and confirmed that women were participating in screening (or not) without knowing about the risk of overdetection. After our face-to-face explanation, focus group discussions and clarification of queries, most participants demonstrated a reasonable understanding of the issue. Although surprised, women valued the information and felt that it ought to be provided when screening is offered<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02014;findings echoed in a similar UK study.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> This suggests that informed decision-making should be possible for potential screening participants, when they are provided with good information. The challenge remaining was to convert a meaningful explanation of overdetection into a written format and test whether it could convey the information successfully in a real-life decision-making setting. This is particularly important because in Australia, among other countries, women interact directly with a screening service, often bypassing any discussion with a healthcare provider.</p><p>In the present study, we developed a decision aid for women facing their initial decision about participation in mammography screening. The information presented includes the main benefit and harms of screening (breast cancer mortality reduction, false positives and overdetection). The goal was to produce materials that we could then use in a randomised trial to assess whether information on overdetection makes a difference to women's views and decisions about screening,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> with the potential for future adaptation into a resource suitable for distribution within organised screening programmes. This paper describes the development and preliminary evaluation of the decision aid.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Overview of decision aid development and evaluation</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2014006016F1">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref> depicts the stages of this project.

The semistructured interviews focused on a set of purpose-designed questions to assess comprehension of key content and preferences regarding presentation.

The first review emphasised the importance of being &#x02018;upfront&#x02019; about uncertainty in the quantitative information. We had included this acknowledgement at the end of the booklet but subsequently moved it to the introduction: &#x02018;The numbers presented are the best available estimates based on the latest research. They may need to be reviewed in the future when new information becomes available.&#x02019; The second review highlighted that some icon arrays presented outcome categories that were subsets of others (eg, false positives leading to biopsies vs all false positives) and this was not always clear. We revised the diagrams to improve clarity and balance. For example, where we had already presented (i) the total number of breast cancers diagnosed and (ii) the number within that total which represented overdetection, we then added to the text (iii) the complementary number of cases that were not instances of overdetection.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Intervention and control versions of decision aid</title><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2014006016TB2">Table&#x000a0;2</xref> shows the content of the final decision aids (at the end of stage 2).

As this issue had arisen with previous screening decision aids,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> our initial draft tried to address it by posing a question in the title (&#x02018;Should I&#x02026;?&#x02019;) and stating in the opening paragraph that the &#x02018;booklet is designed to help you make an informed choice about whether you would prefer to have screening or not.&#x02019; However, findings from the first few interviews led us to strengthen this by adding &#x02018;there is no right or wrong answer about whether to have breast screening. It is a matter of what you believe is the right choice for you.&#x02019; We also renamed the booklet &#x02018;Breast cancer screening: It's your choice&#x02019; and modified the subtitle to include &#x02018;information to help women make a decision&#x02019; rather than &#x02018;information to consider&#x02019;. These aspects were identical for the control version.</p></sec><sec id="s3a2"><title>Overdetection not understood as a harm</title><p>An obvious factor contributing to women's confusion about why the booklet presents screening as an intervention with pros and cons was their lack of prior awareness of overdetection. Learning about what one woman described as &#x0201c;quite a complicated idea&#x0201d; for the first time, it appeared difficult for some women to grasp whether and why overdetection may be considered a negative outcome. A stage 1 interviewee said, &#x0201c;I just don't know if overdetection is seen as being a problem&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;I don't understand the anxiety about overdetection, and why it's being flagged as an issue&#x0201d;. Another stated that &#x0201c;overdetection is not necessarily a harm or a bad thing&#x0201d;, while a third said, &#x0201c;the overdetection part didn't really make me feel that uncomfortable because I'm the sort of person, I think, that would rather know and have it treated&#x0201d;. Although the initial draft had mentioned various breast cancer treatment modalities and acknowledged that these involve side effects, we expanded this into a new section providing a short description of the mechanism of each treatment and several common side effects. This aimed to help women better understand the implications of being overdiagnosed and the likely course of treatment that may follow a diagnosis.</p></sec><sec id="s3a3"><title>Confusion about distinction between overdetection and false positive screening results</title><p>In the stages 1 and 2 interviews, some women showed confusion regarding the concepts of overdetection and false positives&#x02014;for example, &#x0201c;What's the difference between&#x02014;so, the overdetection is the false positive? Is it the same thing? &#x02026;That's the confusion that I've had&#x02026; I didn't quite understand that from reading that&#x02026; I think I was just assuming it was all the same thing<italic>.</italic>&#x0201d; Although the initial draft already had these two outcomes presented under separate headings and listed on separate lines in the summary table, we revised the decision aid within stage 1 to try and clarify this point by explicitly numbering the outcomes in the section headings and summary table. We also added a statement to the introduction&#x02014;&#x0201c;There are 3 important things to know: &#x02026;&#x0201d;&#x02014;briefly listing as 1, 2 and 3 the outcomes to be covered in the booklet (ie, breast cancer mortality benefit, false positives and overdetection).</p><p>Despite these efforts, the stage 2 interviews demonstrated the persistence of some confusion between the concepts, leading us to take several additional steps to further clarify our presentation of this information. First, to draw attention to the aforementioned &#x02018;3 important things&#x02019; statement, we put a box around it. Second, we tried to encourage attention to the overdetection content by flagging it as &#x02018;new&#x02019; information. Third, we moved this section to an earlier position in the booklet, ahead of the false positives section. Fourth, we made minor modifications to the text explaining the two concepts, including slight wording changes and use of bold font to emphasise key phrases (eg, in false positives &#x02018;there is <italic>no cancer&#x02019;</italic>). Finally, we added a new item to the question and answer section to explicitly address this point: &#x02018;How is overdetection different from false positives?&#x02019;</p></sec><sec id="s3a4"><title>Relationship between risk of overdetection and chance of benefit not well understood</title><p>The stage 2 interviews included questions to assess whether women had understood the key facts. One such point related to which outcome would affect more women&#x02014;overdetection or avoidance of a breast cancer death. This was asked in a &#x02018;true or false&#x02019; format, which a majority of respondents answered incorrectly. In the light of this, we added a new box following a presentation of the benefit and overdetection information, entitled &#x02018;Putting it together&#x02019;. Here we restated for both outcomes the absolute numbers per 1000 women screened over 20&#x02005;years, noting explicitly &#x02018;that means more women experience overdetection than avoid dying from breast cancer.&#x02019;</p></sec><sec id="s3a5"><title>Communication of new and complex material</title><p>The piloting process highlighted the challenge readers faced to absorb what one woman called &#x0201c;quite complicated information&#x0201d;.

But initially it was quite overwhelming.&#x0201d; To improve overall ease of reading, in the final revision we increased the font size and spaced out the intervention content over 11 pages rather than the original 8.

The piloting process described here enabled us to explore responses to successive drafts of the materials among our intended audience. User testing with women approaching the age of invitation to screening showed that the decision aid could be read in a reasonable time (10&#x02013;15&#x02005;min) and was generally received positively. Most of the qualitatively interviewed women liked the graphical presentation style used for the numerical information, and considered it helpful to be able to &#x0201c;visually scan the information&#x0201d;. As overdetection was the most novel element of the content, our particular interest in this study was examining whether women could comprehend this information and exploring how they reacted to the presentation of screening downsides. The purpose of undertaking the two stages of piloting prior to more formal evaluation<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> was to identify where there was room for improvement and to modify our materials accordingly.</p><p>We found that the main conceptual point of confusion around overdetection related to understanding how it is distinct from false positive screening results. While both outcomes represent harms of screening, overdetection has more serious implications for those affected. By adding an item to the question and answer section (&#x02018;How is overdetection different from false positives?&#x02019;), we have acknowledged that there is potential for confusion and provided a concise statement underscoring where the contrast lies. This leads to a question about how breast cancer is treated (also an addition after initial piloting), aiming to draw the reader's attention to the consequences of overdetection by highlighting some of the common side effects of the main treatment modalities. As in our focus group study,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> for some qualitative interview participants it was not clear why overdetection would be considered a negative outcome of screening, whereas others who had more experience with cancer treatment (albeit indirectly) grasped this more readily. This reinforces the importance of decision aids including some description of what it may be like to experience the consequences of choosing particular options, which may help a reader clarify her values.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></p><p>In terms of the magnitude of overdetection, we consider it important for readers to understand the &#x02018;bottom line&#x02019; that overdetection occurs more frequently than prevention of death from breast cancer. However, a &#x02018;true or false&#x02019; knowledge item about this was answered poorly in stage 2. As the different outcomes were shown on separate icon arrays, it may have been difficult for readers to connect and compare the benefit and overdetection figures. In the revised intervention, we tried to make this relationship clearer by reinforcing the visual depictions with an added short text box, thus giving the reader key information in two complementary ways. The final version also has the icon arrays for benefit and overdetection on facing pages, which may make the comparison more salient.</p><p>It was also evident from the qualitative interviews that the decision aids&#x02014;with their neutral presentation of benefit and harm information and framing of a choice between screening and not screening&#x02014;did not match readers&#x02019; expectations for screening messages, which are typically persuasive in tone and intent. Similar issues have been reported in previous research on informed choice in screening.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>

<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>
<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> This underscores the need for screening decision aids to start by clearly explaining their purpose and why there is a decision to make, as ours did.</p><p>The strengths of this project include the rigorous staged approach to developing and evaluating the intervention. Our initial design built on a comprehensive qualitative study that explored responses to overdetection in 50 women<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> together with our previous experience in producing and trialling cancer screening decision aids.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>
<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> We used an iterative process of pilot-testing, combining both qualitative and quantitative data, and revised our materials successively according to the findings. Such an approach is recommended<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>

<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> as it facilitates a thorough exploration of problematic aspects and careful testing of potential solutions. Decisions about initial design and subsequent revisions were undertaken in consultation with an experienced multidisciplinary research team, incorporating input from laypersons as well as independent experts. Possible limitations are the inclusion of some women recruited via convenience sampling (n=6) and the fact that stage 1 participants were somewhat varied in age and screening history compared with the specific target population for our decision aids. However, for the further evaluation in stage 2 (n=34), we recruited directly from our target population, and these women read our booklets within a real-life decision-making setting.</p><p>We have produced these decision aids for the purposes of a population-based randomised controlled trial (stage 3) examining how information about overdetection affects women's decision-making about breast screening.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Trial participants will receive one of our decision aids in addition to other information materials in current use locally.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> As such, we have not included practical information such as the procedural aspects of having a mammogram, which would need to be added in order to produce a stand-alone resource. Although our current focus is on introducing to women the novel concept of overdetection and overtreatment, as public understanding increases over time, future decision aid developers might consider also trying to address the difficult issues of how screening may affect the extent of treatment women receive and the risk of dying from all causes. Our decision aids have been designed to be accessible to people with an average level of reading ability, and further work would be required to adapt the materials to ensure that they are suitable for lower-literacy groups and culturally diverse populations. Ultimately, this work will help address the increasingly recognised responsibility for cancer screening services to provide evidence-based benefit and harm information to people in a clear, transparent way.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5&#x02013;7</xref>

In our efforts to communicate with women about overdetection in breast screening, we have found it important to make clear why overdetection may be considered a concern by explaining the associated consequences in terms of unnecessary treatments that can cause harm. Related to this is the need to differentiate very clearly between overdetection and false positives, which we have identified as a common source of confusion. Encountering balanced information about screening rather than a persuasive message is contrary to people's expectations.
