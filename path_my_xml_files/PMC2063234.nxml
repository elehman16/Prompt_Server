We have examined eight radiotherapy regimens from data taken from four randomized phase III studies carried out in the UK (1264 patients): 10 Gy single fraction; 17 Gy in two fractions over 8 days; 30 Gy in ten fractions over 14 days; 22.5 Gy in five fractions in 5 days; 27 Gy in six fractions over 11 days; 30 Gy in six fractions over 11 days; 36 Gy in 12 fractions over 16 days; and 39 Gy in 13 fractions over 17 days. We compared the clinical results in palliation, toxicity and survival with four regimens taken from one randomized study from the USA (365 patients): 40 Gy in 20 fractions over 4 weeks; 40 Gy 'split course' in ten fractions in 4 weeks; 50 Gy in 25 fractions over 5 weeks; and 60 Gy in 30 fractions over 6 weeks. Using the linear-quadratic (LQ) radiobiological model, we have calculated the radiobiological equivalent dose (BED) for acute-reacting tissues (BED10), late-reacting tissues (BED1.7) and tumour (BED25), and related the predicted response to the observed response in each tissue. There was a good correlation between the predicted response and the reported response in the case of late-reacting tissue toxicity and tumour response. The model confirmed that, in good performance status patients, a higher value for BED25 correlated with a higher degree of local control and survival and that radiotherapy regimens with a higher value for BED1.7 were associated with five cases of cord myelopathy, if the spinal cord was not shielded. In poor performance status patients the model suggested that the optimal regimen was a single fraction of 10 Gy because this resulted in an equivalent degree of symptom control as other regimens, needed only one hospital visit and was less likely to result in cord damage, thus, allowing for the possibility of retreatment at a later date.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00016-0093.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1629" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00016-0094.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1630" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00016-0095.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1631" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00016-0096.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1632" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00016-0097.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1633" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
