mass index (BMI) and gait in obese women. [Subjects and Methods] Twenty-four obese women
residing in Seoul and Gyeonggi-do were randomly divided into a horseback riding group and
a walking group and conducted their respective exercises 3 times a week for 8 weeks.
[Results] Step length increased significantly and BMI and width of the base of support
significantly decreased in both groups. A comparison of BMI and width of the base of
support after the intervention between the two groups revealed that the horseback riding
group showed larger decreases than the walking group. [Conclusion] The result of this
study indicated that the horseback riding may improve gait ability and obesity.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Obesity</kwd><kwd>Body mass index</kwd><kwd>Horseback riding</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Obesity, an intermediate risk factor, increases the risk of coronary artery disease,
hypertension, type II diabetes mellitus, obstructive lung disease, osteoarthritis, and
cancer. It is a serious health problem that reduces average life expectancy<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. As the obese population has increased, it
has become important to resolve obesity in individuals from a social-health point of
view<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Evaluation of body composition is an important factor that decides nutritional condition
towards health and diseases. Regular aerobic exercise provides good results on body
composition. If it is done continuously for a long term, obese people can reduce their body
fat and weight and their risk of cardiovascular diseases. It also improves liver function,
strengthens skeletal muscles, and improves the effect of insulin on fatty tissues, improving
the body&#x02019;s ability to use blood sugar<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Body mass index (BMI) and waist measurement are considered important factors in measuring
obesity in China, both for males and females<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Compared with use of expensive and complicated facilities, BMI and
waist measurement have been confirmed to be more accurate methods in estimating disabilities
caused by obesity<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is reported that
increased body fat, BMI, and waist measurement, as well as activities of daily living, are
highly related to physical disability<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>As a treatment for obesity, which has become a social and economic problem, walking
exercise appears to be the most effective exercise from a physiological point of view, and
it is desirable to perform it for long periods at low intensity<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The chance of getting gonarthritis for an obese or overweight person is considerably
high<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Incorrect gait habits and posture
caused by weight gain increases the load on the lower limb joints and cause injuries in the
lower limb joints and arthritis<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Horseback riding is a whole body exercise that uses muscles and joints. It stimulates
nerves in various parts of the body, improving function recovery, balancing ability,
adaptability to speed changes, and flexibility. In addition, the higher body temperature of
the horses reduces the rider&#x02019;s tension and anxiety and stimulates blood circulation<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>This study investigated the effect of aerobic exercise and gravity-eliminated
active-assistive pelvis exercise using horses on BMI and blood lipids when the exercises
were applied to various functional problems caused by obesity such as decreased balancing
ability and the secondary lower limb diseases caused by incorrect gait. It also observed the
changes in balancing ability and gait ability between before and after horseback riding.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The experiments were conducted 3 times a week for 8 weeks in Seoul and the Gyeonggi-do
area. The study subjects were 24 obese women who were willing to participate in the study
and had a BMI of 25&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup> or over. They were randomly divided into a horseback
riding group of 12 subjects and a walking group of 12 subjects. The experiment group, the
horseback riding group, and the control group, the walking group, performed appropriate
exercise programs suitable for the purpose of this study.</p><p>The study subjects satisfied the following conditions: 1) obese woman between the ages of
30 and 45, 2) no history of central nervous system diseases such as stroke, Parkinson&#x02019;s
disease, or spinal cord injury, 3) no orthopedic diseases in the spine or lower limb within
the last 6 months, 4) able to walk independently without any assisting equipment or help, 5)
no history of vision or vestibular system diseases, 6) no abnormality in blood pressure
(systolic blood pressure over 160 mmHg or diastolic pressure less than 110 mmHg) when
stable, 7) does not have diabetes, 8) 10 or fewer previous experiences of horseback riding
before participating in this study, 9) no psychological fear or resistance towards horseback
riding, 10) no metal inserted into the lower back or thighs, and 11) not taking
obesity-related medications such as an appetite suppressant. All the subjects understood the
purpose of this study and provided written informed consent prior to participation in the
study in accordance with the ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>General characteristics of subjects</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">HRG</th><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">WG</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (years)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">36.3&#x000b1;6.2</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">37.7&#x000b1;4.3</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Height (cm)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">161.5&#x000b1;4.9</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">162.2&#x000b1;5.4</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weight (kg)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">72.3&#x000b1;6.8</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">71.4&#x000b1;4.7</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Mean&#x000b1;SD.

individual&#x02019;s ability and physical condition. Considering the length of the study, horseback
riding was performed at a walk and at a trot. The specific composition of the horseback
riding program was as follows; warm-up (5&#x02005;min) and cool down (5&#x02005;min) consisting of leg
stretching, neck and trunk stretching, and shoulder stretching and horseback riding
consisting of riding at a walk (5&#x02005;min), at a trot (10&#x02005;min), and then again at a walk
(5&#x02005;min). The walking program included a warm-up (5&#x02005;min) and cooldown (5&#x02005;min) consisting of
leg stretching, neck and trunk stretching, and shoulder stretching and walking exercise
(30&#x02005;min) consisting of normal walking and fast walking.</p><p>BMI is an obesity measurement that estimates the amount of fat using height and weight. It
is calculated by dividing weight by the square of height. In general,
18.5&#x02013;24.9&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup> indicates normal weight, 25&#x02013;29.9&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup> indicates
overweight, 30.0&#x02013;34.9&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup> indicates moderate obesity, and 35&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup>
or higher indicates severe obesity. According to this classification, this study classified
subjects with a BMI of less than 25&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup> as normal and those with a BMI over 25
as obese, as 25&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup> is the standard that divides normal weight and

exercise focusing on the pelvis, and a walking program for obese women for 8 weeks and
examined their effects on BMI, blood lipids, static balancing ability, and gait ability.
Then, it compared the active-assistive horseback riding program, which provided exercise
focusing on the pelvis, and the active walking program to see their effects on the level of
obesity and physical functions.</p><p>Generally, it is more effective to apply mid-to low-intensity exercise than high-intensity
exercise for weight loss and to decrease the percentage of body fat, as exercise stimulates
sympathetic nerves and increases the catecholamine concentration and glucagon, as well as
the rate of blood flow into active muscles, following exercise, which cause a high fat
oxygenation rate<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>He et al.<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup> conducted an intervention
consisting of aerobic exercise in obese women for 16 weeks and reported weight loss and a
reduced percentage of body fat. This is in agreement with the results of the walking
program, which consisted of aerobic exercise.</p><p>Since the horseback riding program also generated positive results, both groups experienced
aerobic exercise effects. The reason for the more positive results in the horseback riding
group after 8 weeks is that the subjects needed time to adjust to the motion of the horse
during horseback riding. It is considered that the group had better exercise results after
the adjustment period.</p><p>Encheft<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that the horseback
riding exercise treatment results in functional improvement of the four limbs, as it
improves the posture controlling ability of the stomach muscules.</p><p>The common features of walking and horseback riding are that they both require pelvis
movement and they both allow the trunk to be kept straight during movement. The differences
between them include that walking allows the arms to move freely, while horseback riding
requires more stability in the shoulders, as the hands should hold the reins. From this
point of view, the walking program and the horseback riding program might have influenced
the distance between the feet generated by exterior rotation of the hip joint after 8 weeks
of the programs.</p><p>As time went on, the horseback riding group and the walking group both showed improved gait
ability. The horseback riding group showed a more positive result than the walking
group.</p><p>It is difficult to generalize the results of this study to all obese women because the
number of study subjects was small and the intervention period was not long enough. In
addition, this study could not examine periods of time in which the interventions were not
being performed. Moreover, the individual subjects could not demonstrate their horseback
riding ability, as there was a time limit in the program. Furthermore, this study did not
utilize a concrete and dynamic approach in applying the horseback riding program. With
respect to level of ability, the subjects were skilled at walking, while they were
inexperienced at horseback riding. Therefore, hypothesis the testing of the effects is a bit
questionable. Future studies should be performed without these limitations.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Al Snih</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Graham</surname><given-names>JE</given-names></name><name><surname>Kuo</surname><given-names>YF</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Obesity and disability: relation among older adults living
