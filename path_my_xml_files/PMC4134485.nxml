While changes in bone mineral density (BMD) are one measure of response, BMD changes often require a minimum of one year to observe measureable changes. Biochemical markers of bone turnover change within 1 to 3&#x000a0;months of initiating osteoporosis therapy. Monitoring with a marker such as procollagen type I N propeptide (PINP), an osteoblast-derived protein, during teriparatide treatment may provide clinically useful information for managing patients with osteoporosis. Clinical trials have shown consistent increases in PINP within 3&#x000a0;months of initiating teriparatide, increases that are significantly greater than placebo and significantly different from baseline. Increases in PINP concentrations during teriparatide treatment correlate well with increases in skeletal activity assessed by radioisotope bone scans and quantitative bone histomorphometry parameters. Individuals treated with teriparatide in clinical trials usually experienced an increase in PINP &#x0003e; 10&#x000a0;mcg/L from baseline, while those given placebo usually did not. In the clinical setting, patients experiencing a significant increase in PINP &#x0003e; 10&#x000a0;mcg/L after initiating teriparatide therapy may receive an earlier confirmation of anabolic effect, while those who do not may be assessed for adherence, proper injection technique, or undetected secondary conditions that might mitigate an anabolic response. PINP monitoring may provide information supplemental to BMD monitoring and be a useful aid in managing patients receiving anabolic osteoporosis treatment in the same way that biochemical markers of bone resorption are useful in monitoring antiresorptive therapy. This review examines PINP as a biological response marker during teriparatide treatment for osteoporosis.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Anabolics</kwd><kwd>Biochemical markers of bone turnover</kwd><kwd>Osteoporosis</kwd><kwd>PINP</kwd><kwd>Teriparatide</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; International Osteoporosis Foundation and National Osteoporosis Foundation 2014</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Patients with osteoporotic fractures may be asymptomatic and yet have significant skeletal deterioration and high risk for future fractures. In such patients, teriparatide has the potential to increase bone formation on bone surfaces, increase bone mineral density (BMD), increase bone strength, and reduce the risk of vertebral and nonvertebral fractures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>After a patient is prescribed teriparatide, initiating and continuing treatment to obtain a biological response requires several steps: (1) the patient must acquire the medication and supplies for subcutaneous (SC) injections; (2) the patient must refrigerate the medication at 2&#x02013;8&#x000b0;C to retain its stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]; (3) the patient must self-administer teriparatide properly by daily SC injection or make arrangements for a trained caregiver to administer the injection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]; (4) the patient must not have medical conditions that preclude an anabolic response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]; and (5) the patient must persist with treatment to achieve the desired response. Assessing all these steps through a detailed patient interview might be difficult to accomplish. In addition, prescribers may overestimate their patients&#x02019; adherence to treatment. For example, Curtis and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] reported physicians estimated 67.2&#x000a0;% of their osteoporosis patients to be adherent, while only 40&#x000a0;% of patients were actually adherent based on pharmacy data.</p><p>Concurrent monitoring for a biological response to teriparatide may provide useful clinical information for the prescriber and for the patient with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture. However, BMD testing is typically not obtained until after 1 to 2&#x000a0;years of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. This delay in assessing for biological response may be problematic in light of a need for bone formation in patients at high risk for fracture and a 2-year lifetime exposure limitation to teriparatide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Accordingly, a biological response marker measureable earlier than BMD may be useful to more proactively manage patients treated with teriparatide.</p><p>Biochemical markers of bone turnover have the potential to provide early feedback to patients and prescribers during osteoporosis treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. For example, patients treated with teriparatide exhibiting a positive biochemical marker response can receive confirmation of an anabolic biologic response in the bone. This may be especially important since overall patient compliance with osteoporosis treatments is inadequate and could be enhanced by the assurance of a positive biological response to the medication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In fact, the International Osteoporosis Foundation (IOF) determined the most common factor women cite for persisting with their osteoporosis treatment: &#x0201c;knowing I&#x02019;m doing something to help&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. On the other hand, patients without a significant change in biochemical marker concentration during teriparatide treatment can be assessed for difficulties with injection technique, medication storage, adherence, or for conditions that might impair response to therapy. If problems are identified, addressed, and corrected, this type of early assessment has the potential to improve patient outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>Several biochemical markers of bone formation may be measured in the serum: osteocalcin, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (bone ALP), procollagen type I N propeptide (PINP), and procollagen type I C propeptide (PICP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Because type I collagen is the most prevalent protein in bone, measuring byproducts of collagen synthesis is an appealing approach. Following the synthesis of new type I collagen within the osteoblast, PINP is cleaved from type I procollagen by proteases outside the osteoblast (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Serum PINP concentrations reflect the integrated amount of skeletal new bone formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Thus, diseases involving high bone turnover would be expected to be associated with high serum concentrations of PINP; examples are metabolic bone diseases including osteomalacia and Paget&#x02019;s disease, endocrine disorders including thyrotoxicosis and primary hyperparathyroidism, and malignant bone disease such as multiple myeloma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Importantly, the label warns against the use of teriparatide in patients with these diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Type 1 collagen formation and procollagen type I N propeptide (<italic>PINP</italic>). Type 1 procollagen is made in the osteoblast and secreted into new bone matrix. In the bone matrix, procollagen peptidases cleave PINP from the amino (N) terminal end and procollagen type I C propeptide (<italic>PICP</italic>) from the carboxy (C)-terminal end of type 1 procollagen, resulting in mature type 1 collagen. Mature type 1 collagen is the most common protein in bone; a triple helical structure composed of two alpha-1 chains and one alpha-2 chain. PINP and PICP make their way into the circulation. Within the circulation, PINP exists as different linear forms including the original intact trimeric PINP and the monomeric or dimeric degradation products. Available PINP assays measure either intact triple helical PINP or total PINP, which includes intact PINP as well as the other forms of PINP. With permission from Bauer et al.

For example, the acute fibroproliferative reaction in a healing wound is associated with increased concentrations of PINP in the extra-cellular fluid of the wound [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>Serum PINP monitoring may be particularly clinically useful because this marker is relatively insensitive to food and circadian rhythm effects, and in clinical trials, this marker has been shown to increase dynamically in response to teriparatide treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The IOF and the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC) have recently published an extensive review of bone turnover markers and recommend PINP as the reference biochemical marker of bone formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Likewise, the National Bone Health Alliance has also recommended PINP as the reference marker for bone formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>The purpose of this review is to evaluate PINP as a biological response marker during teriparatide treatment for osteoporosis. A useful classification of biomarkers developed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is shown in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. While some data suggest bone turnover markers might be used in the future as a component of surrogate end points for bone strength improvements achieved by pharmacotherapeutics, more data are needed before this practice gains wide acceptance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In particular, designating PINP as a surrogate end point for fracture risk reduction is not possible since data proving a definitive link between changes in PINP during teriparatide treatment to fracture risk reduction are not yet available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. This review will focus on PINP as a pharmacodynamic marker and will subsequently refer to PINP as a biological response marker of bone formation.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Categorization of biomarkers by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Biomarker category</th><th>Characteristics</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Prognostic biomarker</td><td>Categorizes patients by probability for disease occurrence or progression in the absence of intervention</td></tr><tr><td>Predictive biomarker</td><td>Categorizes patients by their probability for a positive or negative response to a treatment</td></tr><tr><td>Pharmacodynamic biomarker</td><td>Demonstrates biological response has occurred in a patient after having received a therapeutic intervention</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="3">Surrogate end point biomarker</td><td>A subset of pharmacodynamic biomarkers</td></tr><tr><td>Substitutes for a clinical efficacy end point and is expected to predict clinical benefit or harm</td></tr><tr><td>Requires robust scientific evidence to justify qualification as a surrogate end point</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Based on a review of the literature, studies involving individuals treated with teriparatide 20&#x000a0;mcg/day by SC injection with a measured assessment of PINP during treatment were included for this review. This review summarizes published findings and new and previously unpublished data, which are noted as such.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Sample collection and logistics</title><p>Commercially available PINP assays differ by the form of PINP they measure. The intact PINP assay measures the intact aminoterminal propeptide form of type 1 collagen (triple helical or trimeric), while the total PINP assay measures the intact propeptide form (trimeric) as well as smaller monomeric byproducts of PINP degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Assays for measuring intact PINP include a radioimmunoassay (RIA) for intact PINP (UniQ&#x02122;, Orion Diagnostica, Espoo, Finland) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and the IDS-iSYS&#x02122; Intact PINP assay, an automated chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA; Immunodiagnostics Systems, Scottsdale, AZ, USA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Options for measuring total PINP include an automated electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA) for total PINP (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN, USA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for total PINP (USCN Life Science, Inc., Houston, TX, USA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. For healthy individuals, there appears to be little difference between the results obtained for intact and total PINP measurements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. However, in the presence of reduced renal function, the clearances of intact and total PINP may differ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Intact PINP relies on the liver for clearance, while the monomeric form of PINP, a component of total PINP, relies on kidney function for clearance, thereby making the interpretation of the total PINP assays potentially difficult in the setting of kidney disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p>In the USA, the Orion UniQ&#x02122; PINP assay is currently the only FDA-approved intact PINP assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].

In many geographies, the Roche total PINP assay is approved for clinical use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. This review includes data demonstrating the effect of teriparatide treatment on PINP measured by the Roche total PINP assay and by the UniQ&#x02122; intact PINP assay. In general, the results appear to be similar.</p><p>According to the UniQ&#x02122; kit insert, no special preparation of the patient, such as fasting, prior to sample collection is needed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The test may be run on serum from a venous blood sample collected by standard venipuncture technique. After specimen collection, the blood is allowed to clot and the serum is separated by centrifugation. Serum samples may be stored prior to PINP analysis for up to 5&#x000a0;days at 2 to 8&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C and stored for longer periods at &#x02212;20&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C or lower [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Repeated freezing and thawing of samples should be avoided [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. However, different patient preparation and sample-handling directions have also been discussed. For example, using plasma samples may be preferable to serum for PINP analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Evidence supporting PINP as a biological response marker during teriparatide treatment</title><p>The teriparatide Phase 3 Fracture Prevention Trial (NCT00670501) was a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis and vertebral fractures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The prospectively collected biological markers of bone formation included carboxy-terminal extension peptide of procollagen type 1 (PICP) and serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (bone ALP). In the teriparatide group, PICP increased dynamically at 1&#x000a0;month but returned toward baseline by 3&#x000a0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The transience of PICP elevation during teriparatide treatment suggests it is not an optimal biological response marker. In contrast, bone ALP gradually increased between baseline and 12&#x000a0;months in the teriparatide group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Yet, because bone ALP does not show dynamic increases early during teriparatide treatment, it also may not be optimal as an early biological response marker in clinical practice.</p><p>Following completion of this trial, intact PINP was used to measure serum PINP concentrations from samples collected in a subset of patients at baseline and after 3&#x000a0;months on study drug [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. These samples had been stored for at least 4&#x000a0;years and previously thawed at least twice prior to PINP assessment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In a subsequent analysis of these trial results, the PINP response to teriparatide (signal) was found to be large compared to the variability (noise, or fluctuation, with placebo) of the test, as shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. A relatively high signal-to-noise ratio of PINP relative to other prospectively defined markers of bone turnover was observed in the trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].

As expected, baseline PINP was significantly lower in the previous antiresorptive groups than the treatment-naive group. PINP increased from baseline in all treatment groups, with significantly greater increases noted in the treatment-naive group than the previous antiresorptive groups at 1&#x000a0;month. However, there were no significant differences in PINP concentrations between the treatment-naive and the previous antiresorptive groups at 6&#x000a0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Overall, teriparatide increased biochemical markers of bone formation in postmenopausal women with established osteoporosis, regardless of previous long-term exposure to antiresorptive therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].</p><p>PINP was also evaluated in a prospective, open-label, nonrandomized study of 59 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis previously treated with raloxifene or with alendronate for at least 18&#x000a0;months, and then switched to teriparatide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Intact PINP assessments were prospectively collected at baseline, 1, 3, 6, and 12&#x000a0;months of teriparatide treatment. Consistent with alendronate being a more potent inhibitor of bone turnover than raloxifene, baseline PINP concentrations were lower in the alendronate group compared with the raloxifene group. During the treatment with teriparatide, statistically significant increases in PINP concentration from baseline occurred in both groups, but with a significantly smaller increase in the first month observed in the alendronate group than in the raloxifene group. No statistically significant difference between treatment groups occurred at subsequent time points [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. This study included serial osteocalcin assessments. During teriparatide treatment, this marker shows changes similar to those of PINP.</p><p>In another study of patients with prior bisphosphonate exposure (alendronate, risedronate, etidronate, or pamidronate), total PINP was lower at baseline (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.010), at 3&#x000a0;months, and at 6&#x000a0;months during teriparatide treatment in 38 patients with prior bisphosphonate exposure compared with 14 patients without prior bisphosphonate exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. These findings suggest that previous treatment with the potent antiresorptive drug alendronate appears to delay the PINP response to teriparatide, but with continued teriparatide treatment, PINP increases are observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p><p>PINP response to teriparatide may be impacted differently by different bisphosphonates. For example, in the OPTAMIZE study, patients treated with alendronate or risedronate for at least 24&#x000a0;months were switched to teriparatide for 12&#x000a0;months of treatment. In the prior risedronate group, the PINP increase was significantly greater after 3&#x000a0;months of teriparatide than in the prior alendronate group (NCT00130403) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>].</p><p>An open-label study of 137 osteoporosis drug-naive postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, randomized to treatment with either teriparatide alone or to teriparatide plus raloxifene, evaluated intact PINP at baseline, 1, 3, and 6&#x000a0;months of treatment to determine the effect of the concomitant use of teriparatide with raloxifene on serum PINP concentration (NCT00046137) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. PINP significantly increased in both treatment groups similarly, demonstrating concomitant use of teriparatide with raloxifene resulted in a typical anabolic PINP response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].</p><p>In regard to concomitant use of teriparatide with alendronate or with raloxifene, a prospective, open-label study of 198 postmenopausal women, with osteoporosis who were previously treated with raloxifene or alendronate for at least 18&#x000a0;months, randomized patients to add teriparatide and continue their antiresorptive drugs or to switch to teriparatide alone (&#x0201c;add&#x0201d; vs. &#x0201c;switch&#x0201d;) (NCT00079924) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Total PINP assessments were prospectively collected at baseline, 1, 3, 6, 12, and 18&#x000a0;months of treatment. In all groups, PINP increased significantly from baseline during teriparatide treatment. However, the increases were smaller in the groups that added teriparatide to ongoing antiresorptive therapy compared with the groups that switched to teriparatide. In the alendronate stratum at 6&#x000a0;months, median PINP increases from baseline were 64&#x000a0;% <italic>vs</italic>. 401&#x000a0;% (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001) in the add <italic>vs</italic>. switch groups, respectively.

For patients treated with chronic systemic glucocorticoids, the skeletal defect at the tissue level is impaired bone formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. In a randomized, double-blind, active comparator trial of 428 men and women with glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (prednisone equivalent 5&#x000a0;mg/day or more for at least 3&#x000a0;months and BMD T-score at spine or hip of &#x02212;2 or less, or &#x02212;1 plus a history of a fragility fracture), intact PINP assessments were prospectively collected at baseline, 1, 6, and 18&#x000a0;months of treatment with teriparatide or alendronate (NCT00051558) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>].

However, this 21&#x000a0;% definition of LSC for PINP during teriparatide treatment is problematic because many patients treated with teriparatide have been previously treated with potent antiresorptive drugs such as alendronate, and as noted above, these patients often have a relatively low baseline PINP concentration. For example, a typical patient treated with alendronate might have a baseline intact serum PINP concentration of 19&#x000a0;mcg/L. In such a patient, use of the 21&#x000a0;% cut point (LSC) would lead to the conclusion that an increase in PINP to 23&#x000a0;mcg/L (a 21&#x000a0;% increase from baseline) represents a significant increase in PINP even though this is obviously a small increment and below what would be considered a meaningful change. To overcome this difficulty, Eastell and colleagues established an absolute change cut point by using the typical mean PINP concentration of 48&#x000a0;mcg/L in untreated postmenopausal women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and multiplying the value by 0.21 (LSC) to arrive at a LSC of &#x0003e;10&#x000a0;mcg/L [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].

With this treatment combination, intact PINP does not appear to increase, but rather PINP shows a significant decrease from baseline. This study suggests that an increase in PINP should not be anticipated to occur with combination teriparatide plus denosumab treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>].</p><p>PINP response to teriparatide in patients with other chronic medical illnesses has been evaluated. PINP was collected in a randomized, double-blind trial of men and women with glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (NCT00051558) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>].

In these medically complex individuals treated with teriparatide, glucocorticoids, and a variety of other concomitant medications, the proportion of individuals with increases in intact PINP &#x0003e; 10&#x000a0;mcg/L at 1 or 6&#x000a0;months was 88&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>As highlighted in this review, PINP may be most useful as a biological response marker. In clinical trials, PINP testing usually detects a biological response to teriparatide treatment and a lack of biological response to placebo. While the data provided in this review are, in general, supportive that an increase in PINP during teriparatide treatment is associated with increases in BMD and bone strength, increases in PINP during teriparatide treatment have not been directly validated to predict fracture risk reduction. This proof is not yet available because PINP monitoring was only performed on stored samples from a subset of patients enrolled in the Phase 3 teriparatide fracture trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>Using PINP as a biological response marker during teriparatide treatment for osteoporosis has some limitations. Results of the PINP assay should be used in conjunction with other pertinent clinical information to make diagnostic and therapeutic decisions. Most importantly, PINP testing does not replace BMD testing. Rather, as highlighted in this review, the results of PINP monitoring may be complementary to those of BMD testing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. The PINP assay is not recommended for use as a screening procedure to detect the presence of osteoporosis in the general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. And, as yet, the evidence base that biochemical markers of bone turnover can be used in the assessment of fracture risk in individual patients is limited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. There is a chance for both false-positive and false-negative results with all laboratory tests, and this is a potential limitation with PINP testing. The clinical trials reviewed herein have demonstrated that a majority of, but not all, patients taking teriparatide will have an increase in PINP concentration from baseline, and PINP may increase in some patients taking placebo. This problem might be more of an issue in clinical practice than in the setting of clinical trials. To reduce variability of PINP assessments in clinical practice, it might be possible to store the baseline sample at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and to run the baseline and follow-up serum sample as a batch.</p><p>As yet, the evidence for use of biochemical markers as a tool to improve adherence with treatment is weak. For example, a study of 596 patients treated with monthly ibandronate examined the impact of serum C-terminal cross-linking telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX-1, a biochemical marker of bone resorption) monitoring and feedback on patient adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. The results were similar among the groups whether they received biochemical marker feedback or not, with adherence documented in 92.6&#x000a0;% of patients given feedback and 96&#x000a0;% of patients not given feedback [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. However, as noted in this particular trial, participants in clinical trials tend to have such high adherence that improvements may be difficult to document. Also, while this study showed no difference in adherence, patients provided with information about their biochemical markers of bone turnover felt more informed about their osteoporosis (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001) and more satisfied (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.010) than those patients not provided with information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. Whether testing of biochemical markers of bone turnover may improve adherence outside of the setting of clinical studies is not yet known.</p><p>In the clinical setting, biochemical markers of bone turnover may be elevated for some months after a fracture event and during the fracture healing process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. Some of the studies in this review included many patients with previous fracture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>] and demonstrated correlations between early increases in PINP and later increases in BMD. Accordingly, it is possible that a recent fracture does not preclude a typical PINP response to teriparatide treatment. The question of the effect of recent fracture on the PINP response to teriparatide could potentially be addressed through post hoc analyses of appropriate clinical trials.</p><p>The IOF, the IFCC, and the National Bone and Health Alliance recommend a number of measures for optimizing the clinical use of PINP monitoring in the day-to-day care of patients with osteoporosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. In addition to the importance of harmonization for future research of bone turnover markers, these groups recommend the standardization of bone marker sample collection procedures, reference ranges, and bone turnover marker assays in clinical laboratories [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. Toward this end, preliminary data from an external quality assurance scheme suggest that the three major serum PINP assays provide harmonized results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. However, as previously discussed, total PINP provides higher values than intact PINP in the setting of impaired renal function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p>In summary, PINP is a product of the processing of type I procollagen to mature type I collagen, the most prevalent protein in the bone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Quantifying PINP measures anabolic activity in the bone. Depending on geography, serum assays for measuring PINP concentration are available and approved to aid in the management of patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis. Based on advantages of PINP monitoring and extensive literature regarding the effects of various therapeutic agents on concentrations of PINP, the PINP test is recommended as the reference biochemical marker of bone formation by the IOF, IFCC, and the National Bone Health Alliance. Substantial evidence from clinical trials demonstrates PINP is a biological response marker that increases rapidly and dynamically in most teriparatide-treated patients and does not increase in most placebo-treated patients. A biological response to anabolic osteoporosis therapy may be defined as an increase in PINP concentration &#x0003e; 10&#x000a0;mcg/L from baseline. PINP monitoring may be useful for clinicians prescribing teriparatide for osteoporosis patients at high risk for fracture. Data validating the use of PINP for predicting fracture risk reduction during teriparatide treatment are not available.</p><p>PINP testing has the potential to support patients taking teriparatide as prescribed, and thereby maximize their chances for clinical benefit and positive treatment outcome.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to acknowledge Julie Sherman, an employee of Eli Lilly and Company, for assistance in preparing the manuscript figures.
