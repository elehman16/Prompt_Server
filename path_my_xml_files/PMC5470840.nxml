TB is responsible for a quarter of deaths among PLHIV <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. HIV infection greatly increases the risk of developing TB, which may result from reactivation of latent TB infection, or rapid progression to disease after recent infection <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Provision of isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) reduces TB incidence among PLHIV by 35% <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, and when provided in combination with ART results in a greater reduction in TB risk <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> and severe illness <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> than does ART alone.

Ten health centers (the clusters) were randomized to deliver a combination intervention package (CIP) or standard of care (SOC), with stratification by size of the HIV patient population (i.e., &#x02264;80 or &#x0003e;80 patients enrolled in care).</p><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>Study setting</title><p id="p0040">The study was conducted in Dire Dawa and Harari regions of Ethiopia, a low-income sub-Saharan African country of 97.0 million people <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. These regions are the smallest in the country, both in terms of population and land mass, and their inhabitants reside mainly in urban areas <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. The majority of PLHIV in Ethiopia receive HIV care and treatment in health centers staffed by one or two nurses, one or two pharmacy personnel, and a peer educator (PE); most health centers have a data clerk and at some, a health officer is also present. TB services including intensified TB case finding and provision of IPT are well-integrated with HIV services. Isoniazid and ART are dispensed in the on-site pharmacy.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><label>2.2</label><title>Policy context and collaboration with the government of Ethiopia</title><p id="p0045">The Regional Health Bureaus of Dire Dawa Administration and Harari, as well as executive authorities at each health center were initially engaged during the study conception and design stage, when applying for funding. This participatory approach <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> was employed to ensure that the study aims were aligned with regional priorities for controlling the TB/HIV epidemic. By engaging these key stakeholders in the planning and implementation of the study, we aimed to foster local ownership and maximize the impact of the study's findings on policy and programming.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><label>2.3</label><title>Health center selection</title><p id="p0050">Ten of 11 public health centers supported by the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) in Dire Dawa and Harari regions were selected for participation. The remaining health center was excluded from the sampling frame because patient volume was very low (on average, &#x0003c;10 patients newly-enrolled in HIV care annually). Hospitals were excluded to enhance generalizability, as increasingly, HIV care has been decentralized to health centers, both in Ethiopia and in sub-Saharan Africa more broadly. Two proximate regions were chosen to improve internal validity by ensuring comparability of health centers randomized to either study arm, and to maximize cost efficiency. <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1</xref> summarizes characteristics of participating health centers.<table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><label>Table&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Baseline characteristics of health centers participating in the ENRICH study, July 2013.</p></caption><alt-text id="alttext0015">Table&#x000a0;1</alt-text><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Characteristic<xref rid="tbl1fna" ref-type="table-fn">a</xref></th><th>Total (N&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;10)</th><th>Combination Intervention Package (N&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;5)</th><th>Standard of Care (N&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;5)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Urban setting, N (%)</td><td>10 (100)</td><td>5 (100)</td><td>5 (100)</td></tr><tr><td>Mean HIV program duration (SD), y</td><td>4.6 (1.6)</td><td>5.0 (2.7)</td><td>4.1 (2.3)</td></tr><tr><td>Median number of patients currently enrolled in HIV care (IQR)</td><td>230 (71&#x02013;525)</td><td>120 (102&#x02013;525)</td><td>340 (67&#x02013;378)</td></tr><tr><td>On-site CD4<sup>+</sup> count testing, N (%)</td><td>1 (10)</td><td>1 (20)</td><td>0 (0)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">ART prescribed by, N (%)</td></tr><tr><td>&#x000a0;Nurse</td><td>10 (100)</td><td>5 (100)</td><td>5 (100)</td></tr><tr><td>&#x000a0;Health officer</td><td>2 (20)</td><td>1 (20)</td><td>1 (20)</td></tr><tr><td>Peer educator program, N (%)</td><td>9 (90)</td><td>4 (80)</td><td>5 (100)</td></tr><tr><td>Patient support group, N (%)</td><td>1 (10)</td><td>1 (20)</td><td>0 (0)</td></tr><tr><td>Outreach program tracking patients who miss appointments, N (%)</td><td>10 (100)</td><td>5 (100)</td><td>5 (100)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="tbl1fna"><label>a</label><p id="ntpara0010">SD&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;standard deviation; IQR&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;interquartile range.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p></sec><sec id="sec2.4"><label>2.4</label><title>Assignment to study arm</title><p id="p0055">Assignment to study arm was done at the health center level as opposed to the individual participant level. Health centers were stratified by HIV patient population size (current enrolled in HIV care), and then numbered sequentially within each stratum. Intervention status was randomly assigned within each stratum by an investigator using SAS v. 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). All HIV-positive patients at health centers assigned to the SOC arm received standard of care according to national guidelines, while all those enrolled in health centers assigned to the CIP arm received the standard of care plus the intervention package. Given the nature of the interventions, patients, health care providers and study staff were not blinded to the assigned study arm.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.5"><label>2.5</label><title>Standard of care</title><p id="p0060">At health centers randomly assigned to SOC, usual procedures for IPT provision were followed. As per national guidelines, patients are screened for TB at enrollment in HIV care and at each routine clinic visit using a simple symptom questionnaire <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Patients with a negative screen are assessed for IPT eligibility; and in the absence of contraindications (active hepatitis, regular and heavy alcohol consumption, or symptoms of peripheral neuropathy), are counseled by a nurse on IPT benefits, potential side effects, and adherence. After IPT initiation, patients are asked to return to the clinic monthly for monitoring of side effects, TB symptoms, and self-reported 30-day adherence, and to receive a 30-day supply of isoniazid. If adherence problems are noted, the nurse counsels the patient, and the patient is advised to regularly take the medication.</p><p id="p0065">There is no standardized treatment literacy curriculum for IPT. Although PE are present at many health centers, their role is limited to supporting adherence to ART. On a biweekly basis, PEs attempt to contact patients who missed their appointment, however many patients do not provide phone numbers and outreach activities are often limited to those residing proximate to the health center due to limited human and financial resources.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.6"><label>2.6</label><title>Combination intervention package</title><p id="p0070">At health centers randomly assigned to CIP, the intervention was to be delivered during regular clinic visits as part of routine care to all patients who enrolled in HIV care on or after January 1, 2013 and were eligible for IPT. All nurses working at the HIV clinic were trained to implement the CIP. The CIP contained programmatic, structural and psychosocial components, including: 1) nurse training and mentorship on IPT using a clinical algorithm; 2) use of a Family Care Enrollment Form to identify family members eligible for IPT; 3) support for health care providers to review monitoring data on IPT initiation and adherence during monthly multidisciplinary meetings; 4) reimbursement of patients' transportation costs to monthly clinic visits; and 5) real-time adherence support using trained PE and interactive voice response (IVR) messages. <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;2</xref> shows a comparison of study arms.<table-wrap id="tbl2" position="float"><label>Table&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Comparison of study arms.</p></caption><alt-text id="alttext0020">Table&#x000a0;2</alt-text><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th>Standard of Care (SOC)</th><th>Combination Intervention Package (CIP)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>TB symptom screening at enrollment in HIV care and at each routine clinic visit</td><td>X</td><td>X</td></tr><tr><td>For patients with negative screen, nurse assessment for IPT eligibility and, if eligible, counseling on IPT benefits, potential side effects, and adherence</td><td>X</td><td>X</td></tr><tr><td>Monthly clinic visits for IPT refills and monitoring of side effects, TB symptoms and self-reported adherence</td><td>X</td><td>X</td></tr><tr><td>Nurse training and mentorship in IPT using a clinical algorithm</td><td/><td>X</td></tr><tr><td>Family enrollment form to identify family members eligible for IPT</td><td/><td>X</td></tr><tr><td>Support to review monitoring data on IPT initiation and adherence during monthly multidisciplinary team meetings</td><td/><td>X</td></tr><tr><td>Reimbursement of patient transportation costs to monthly clinic visits</td><td/><td>X</td></tr><tr><td>Real-time adherence support using peer educators and automated interactive voice response messages</td><td/><td>X</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p id="p0075"><italic>Programmatic components of CIP.</italic> All nurses working in the HIV clinic at CIP health centers participated in a two-day training on the scientific evidence and guidelines regarding IPT, the importance of integrating IPT into HIV care and treatment programs, and use of an IPT clinical algorithm and Family Care Enrollment Form during regular clinic visits. Refresher training was provided six months later. Job aids, including laminated desk charts and posters depicting the algorithm, were provided for each consultation room to support intervention delivery. Nurses used the algorithm to assess HIV-positive patients for IPT initiation as well as to monitor for and manage problems with adherence, TB symptoms and side effects. Nurses explained to HIV-positive patients that IPT can prevent TB in PLHIV, encouraged IPT initiation, and referred patients to the PE for further education. Nurses also delivered specific adherence messages and assessed IPT adherence at follow-up visits, referring patients to the PE for additional adherence counseling.</p><p id="p0080">A Family Care Enrollment Form, consisting of a family tree, was placed in each patient chart for nurses to complete at enrollment, so that they could ensure that all family members were tested for HIV, and if HIV-positive, were linked to care, screened for TB, and initiated on IPT if eligible.</p><p id="p0085">A doctor was hired as a part-time program monitor to visit each CIP heath center on a weekly basis to provide ongoing mentorship to the nurses on IPT provision. A tool was developed so that the program monitor could compile monthly data on IPT initiation, follow-up and completion for each CIP site, so that at multidisciplinary team meetings, HIV clinic staff could review the data, identify programmatic challenges, and develop solutions to improve quality of care.</p><p id="p0090"><italic>Structural component of CIP.</italic> Patients were reimbursed for transportation costs in the amount of 35 Birr (approximately 1.8 USD) after each clinic visit while they were receiving IPT.</p><p id="p0095"><italic>Psychosocial components of CIP.</italic> Psychosocial components of CIP were delivered by PE, HIV-positive individuals who completed IPT and were receiving HIV care at a CIP health center. The PE role encompassed social support, system navigation, referrals and advocacy. PE responsibilities included providing health information; communicating with patients; encouraging IPT initiation and adherence; offering support and empathy; providing referrals; and advocating for patients. Each health center had two PE. PE received a monthly stipend of 800 Birr (approximately 41.1 USD). All PE completed a seven-day training that included both didactic learning and interactive techniques including case studies and role-playing to develop skills; refresher training was provided six months later.</p><p id="p0100">PE were assigned to patients when they initiated IPT, so that they could provide adherence support and answer questions about medications, side effects, and other issues that might arise during the patients' course of IPT. PE used an IPT treatment literacy curriculum to provide health education to patients in the HIV clinic. They also met individually with patients to provide IPT preparation and adherence counseling for the duration of IPT. A scripted, illustrated treatment literacy flipchart was developed for PE. It provides information on the natural history of TB, importance of preventing TB among PLHIV, use of IPT, common side effects and the importance of adherence.</p><p id="p0105">To enable weekly communication with patients, PE were provided with airtime vouchers (100 Birr, approximately 5.1 USD) each month. PE discussed adherence and side effects and provided psychosocial support. In addition, PE were responsible for reviewing the appointment register on a daily basis, and contacting any patients on IPT who missed a clinic appointment. They escorted patients to other services at the health center when needed. PE also participated in monthly multidisciplinary meetings at the HIV clinic to discuss patient challenges.</p><p id="p0110"><underline>IVR system</underline>. The IVR system was developed and managed by Grameen Foundation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.grameenfoundation.org" id="intref0010">http://www.grameenfoundation.org</ext-link>) using an open-source MOTECH Suite application. Calls were recorded by local radio personnel in four languages (Amharic, Oromiffa, Harari, Somali) and sent via the Ethio Telecom mobile phone network (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ethiotelecom.et" id="intref0015">www.ethiotelecom.et</ext-link>). Research assistants (RA) utilized a tablet application developed by Dimagi using Commcare (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.commcarehq.org" id="intref0020">http://www.commcarehq.org</ext-link>) to register patients initiating IPT to receive calls; this information was transmitted to MOTECH via the 2G cellular network.</p><p id="p0115">The IVR system sent four types of automated messages, including: 1) medication reminders; 2) appointment reminders; 3) three-day adherence assessments; and 4) side effects assessments. Medication reminders were sent daily during the first month of IPT, then on a patient-specified schedule (daily or weekly) for the remainder of the IPT course. Appointment reminders were sent two and one days prior to each clinic visit. Adherence and side effect assessments were conducted once a month on separate days. The time of day for medication reminders was chosen by the patient.</p><p id="p0120">To protect their confidentiality, patients entered a self-selected four-digit personal identification number (PIN) in order to access all IVR messages, until which time a popular melody was heard. Patients were asked to key a response to all IVR messages. All IVR calls ended by asking patients if they had questions or concerns and wanted to be contacted by clinic staff. Unanswered IVR calls were automatically re-sent 30&#x000a0;min later and if they were unanswered again, they were recorded as incomplete. The IVR system generated lists of patients who did not respond to the automated messages, experienced PIN failures, reported non-adherence or side effects, or requested to be contacted. Patients reporting non-adherence or side effects and those requesting to speak with clinic staff were to be contacted by the nurse or PE within 24&#x000a0;h.</p><p id="p0125">As many patients receiving HIV care at study sites did not have a mobile phone, RA provided all adult HIV patients initiating IPT with a mobile phone and SIM card. RA described mobile phone use, PIN selection, and IVR call algorithms to patients in detail and practiced receiving and responding to IVR messages with patients until they felt comfortable with the technology. This training was enhanced after the first year of implementation based on patient feedback on barriers to IVR use <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Training was repeated a week after IPT initiation, and RA and PE provided additional troubleshooting for patients who consistently did not respond to the automated messages or repeatedly experienced PIN failures. Patients were able to use the phone for personal use and to call the clinic directly. RA dispensed airtime vouchers (35 Birr, approximately 1.8 USD) to patients at their monthly clinic visits, so that they were able to communicate with their PE or nurse in case of difficulties.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.7"><label>2.7</label><title>Study participants</title><p id="p0130">The different groups of study participants are shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>.<fig id="fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Study Participants. <italic>All newly-enrolled HIV patients eligible for IPT</italic> at study sites in both conditions are represented by the large circle; those who initiated IPT (IPT initiators) are depicted in blue, while those who did not initiate IPT (IPT non-initiators) are depicted in green.

The study utilizes an implementation science framework to not only assess the effectiveness of the intervention package, but also to evaluate the acceptability of the interventions from the perspectives of both patients and health care providers, and provide pragmatic information on the implementation process. The study interventions target programmatic, structural and psychosocial barriers to IPT implementation that have been identified in resource-limited settings, and were selected for their promise and feasibility of implementation and scale-up in HIV programs in diverse contexts. The goal of this study is to improve TB prevention among PLHIV in Ethiopia, and generate generalizable knowledge that can be applied to similar settings.</p><p id="p0280">We chose a cluster randomized design for several reasons. First, intervention delivery at the health center level contributes to the study's implementation science approach as it mimics the way in which the CIP would be delivered outside of a study setting. In addition, given the small size of the health centers and their lack of prior experience with research studies, it was deemed more feasible for health center staff to provide all patients at the site with the same intervention package, rather than deliver the CIP to some patients and not others, as is done in an individual randomized design. Furthermore, although there was no evidence to endorse that the CIP would be superior to the SOC, individual randomization may have resulted in some patients randomized to SOC feeling that they were receiving substandard care, which might have influenced their engagement in care and thus key study outcomes, namely IPT initiation and completion.</p><p id="p0285">Our study has several strengths. First, randomization allows causal attribution of observed outcomes to the CIP by comparing them to the counterfactual scenario, while reducing selection bias <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Second, use of mixed methods <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, whereby utilization of qualitative research tools in a sequential explanatory phase follows collection and analysis of quantitative data, will allow us to evaluate acceptability and utilization of intervention components, and assess reasons for IPT non-initiation. Third, the participatory approach, with stakeholder engagement in both the design and implementation phases, has fostered Regional Health Bureau ownership, and will help to ensure successful integration of study findings in policy and programmatic contexts. In addition we are testing an innovative combination intervention that builds on the evidence base of prior scientific work, while addressing the diverse barriers to IPT initiation and completion among PLHIV.</p><p id="p0290">Limitations of the study design include the potential for unanticipated health system inefficiencies to impact CIP implementation, including interruptions in drug supply and laboratory commodities as well as health care worker shortages. However changes in any of these factors are likely to be comparable across study arms and reflect system dynamics captured in implementation science. In addition, the dependence on routinely collected programmatic data for some study outcomes means that data may be incomplete for some participants. Standardized data quality assurance procedures were implemented at all study sites to minimize the amount of missing data. Furthermore as the study is limited to two regions, there is the potential for contamination and migration, which would diminish our power to detect a difference between study arms. However given the goal of assessing CIP effectiveness in a programmatic context, it is essential to evaluate impact in realistic scenarios, while aiming to understand the findings by monitoring spillover and crossover through process documentation. Lastly, the study design precludes assessment of the effectiveness of individual components of the CIP, which would necessitate a substantially larger sample size. However, qualitative data will highlight patient and health care provider perspectives on the utility of individual intervention components, and process data will demonstrate utilization of each study intervention.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><label>5</label><title>Conclusions</title><p id="p0295">The ENRICH Study aims to improve IPT initiation, adherence and completion among patients enrolled in HIV care. Achieving this goal will result in improved health outcomes among PLHIV. With one of the world's most severe epidemics of TB, Ethiopia would greatly benefit from the identification of an effective strategy to integrate this evidence-based preventative therapy into HIV service delivery programs. If this study demonstrates that the CIP is effective and acceptable, these findings can be used to advocate for its adoption as standard of care to prevent TB among HIV-positive patients in other resource-limited countries in sub-Saharan Africa.</p></sec><sec id="sec6"><title>Author's contributions</title><p id="p0300">AAH conceived the study design, developed the protocol, led study implementation and drafted the manuscript.
