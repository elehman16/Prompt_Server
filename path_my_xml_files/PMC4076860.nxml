Two months after intervention, HOMA-IR, HOMA-B and Matsuda indexes did not change in participants with vitamin D injection (group A) in comparison to those who did not take vitamin D (group C) [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>]. There was no significant difference in the area under the curve of plasma glucose and insulin between these two groups [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>]. In group A, before and after of vitamin D administration, Matsuda index decreased, however, HOMA-IR and HOMA-B did not change.</p><p>In those receiving intramuscular injection of vitamin D and oral calcium (group B), before and two months after intervention, HOMA-IR and HOMA-B increased and Matsuda index decreased, significantly [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>]. The increase in insulin resistance may not be the results of increased body weight, because it was constant during of study. In group B, the plasma glucose concentration of 30 min during OGTT increased. It can be explained by increased in insulin resistance, beta cell function and decrease in insulin sensitivity. However, the plasma glucose of 120 min during OGTT decreased in this group. It showed that early insulin secretion defect, probably, has a major role in increased plasma glucose level in 30 min. It seems that the combination of intramuscular vitamin D and oral calcium, led to the more decrease in insulin sensitivity and increase insulin resistance indexes than what has been observed by vitamin D injection alone.</p><p>Vitamin D decreases production of cytokines such as IL2, IL6 and TNF and exposure of &#x003b2; cells to this cytokines, leading to apoptosis.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] On other hand, vitamin D has an important role for the homeostasis of glucose with direct effect on &#x003b2; cell function. So that in vitamin D deficiency state, impaired insulin secretion and glucose intolerance occurs. Several study showed that these two defects have been corrected by vitamin D supplementation.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>In the Nurses&#x02019; Health Study, which has been done on 1557 women over a period of 20 years, those who had taking of 1200 mg calcium and more than 800 IU vitamin D<sub>3</sub> daily, had 33% decrease in the risk of T2DM in comparison to those who received less than 400IU vitamin D per day.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>In Finish Mobile Clinic Study, similar to previous study, high vitamin D status protected again T2DM.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>On the other hand, some studies show no effect of vitamin D supplementation in glucose homeostasis and there are, rarely, some studies the negative effect of vitamin D on the insulin resistance. For example, in the Women's Health Initiative Study, intakes of 400 IU of vitamin D per day did not show any protection against diabetes.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] In Nagpal <italic>et al</italic>., study on 100 men with central obesity, three oral doses of vitamin D during six, could not make any change in insulin secretion.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] In Nilasl <italic>et al</italic>., study, treatment with vitamin D did not show any significant change in body weight or plasma glucose level in post menopausal women.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] In the Taylor <italic>et al</italic>. study, vitamin D replacement with 300,000 IU of intramuscular injection in Asian people, increased insulin resistance, significantly.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] This study was similar to our study from two aspects; one of them is the route of vitamin D administration and the second one the increased insulin resistance by vitamin D injection.</p><p>In order to explain our findings some points should be considered. The population of this study was selected from the first degree relatives of T2DM. They have a strong component of insulin resistance and &#x003b2; cell dysfunction, genetically. As mentioned above, most of other studies showed that insulin resistance decreased with vitamin D administration with or without oral calcium. However, in our study, insulin resistance increased. It may reflect the strong genetically, determined insulin resistance predisposition in our patients which could not overcome with vitamin D administration.</p><p>The route of vitamin D administration probably has some effects on the insulin resistance. In the most of the previous studies, which reported the decrease in insulin resistance by vitamin D, it had been orally, administered.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>A novelty in our study was that the combination of intramuscular vitamin D and oral calcium showed more deteriorating effect on insulin resistance and insulin sensitivity indexes than intramuscular vitamin D alone. It should be studied more in future with a bigger sample size, to make sure if this finding is a persistent result. At this moment, we do not have any explanation for this finding.</p><p>In the first degree relatives of T2DM, with pre-diabetes and vitamin D insufficiency and or deficiency, after two months of vitamin D injection alone or its combination with oral calcium, insulin resistance and sensitivity indexes did not change, significantly in comparison with placebo. However, in people who received vitamin D and calcium, insulin resistance and &#x003b2; cell function indexes increased and insulin sensitivity index decreased.</p><p>Statistical analysis of the data was performed using SPSS version 15 for windows.
