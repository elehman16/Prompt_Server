It was approved by the Medical Ethical Committee of Beijing ChaoYang Hospital and was conducted at Beijing ChaoYang Hospital from February 2013 to January 2016. Eighty-eight patients with TBI were recruited and randomly assigned to an IIT or CIT group, with a 1:1 allocation ratio. All patients met the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Written informed consent was obtained from each patient's closest family member. TBI severity was assessed by the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II),<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> with higher values indicating more severe illness.<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup></p></sec><sec><label>2.2</label><title>Inclusion and exclusion criteria</title><p>The inclusion criteria included age &#x02265;18 years, a Glasgow Coma Scale score&#x0200a;&#x0003c;&#x0200a;8, and admission to the postoperative neurosurgical ICU. Patients were excluded in case of terminal disease, cachexia, shock lasting 12&#x0200a;hours or more, death in the first 48&#x0200a;hours, pregnancy, or if they declined to participate.</p></sec><sec><label>2.3</label><title>Randomization and blinding</title><p>Randomization was achieved by the stratified block randomization method with a computerized number generator using Software SAS (version 8.1; SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC).

The patients, the outcome assessor, and the data analyst were blinded to the treatment allocation.</p></sec><sec><label>2.4</label><title>Participants and recruitment</title><p>All participants were recruited through the clinic of the Department of Neurosurgery at Beijing ChaoYang Hospital. All subjects were randomized to either the IIT or CIT group only after the clinical evaluation and ultrasound scan. All investigators were trained in administration of the treatments before the study. Eligible patients and their closest family members were informed about the research and given an information sheet.

Then the standardized schedule of parenteral and/or enteral nutrition was initiated. This schedule continued until each patient was discharged from the ICU or on postoperative day 14. In addition, all patients received standard glycemia care at the end of the study to maintain their BGL below 200&#x0200a;mg/dL (11.10&#x0200a;mmol/L).</p></sec><sec><label>2.5.2</label><title>Cerebral edema therapy</title><p>During the stay in ICU, all patients with signs of severe cerebral edema on neuroimaging scans were given betamethasone, 8&#x0200a;mg/day for 2 to 3 days at first, followed by 4&#x0200a;mg/day for an additional 2 to 3 days at the surgeons&#x02019; discretion.</p></sec><sec><label>2.5.3</label><title>IIT intervention</title><p>In the IIT group, an insulin infusion was started if the BGL rose above 6.11&#x0200a;mmol/L, and was then adjusted so as to maintain BGL in a range of 4.4 to 6.1&#x0200a;mmol/L, as recommended by previous studies.<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> The continuous dose of insulin was set at 50&#x0200a;IU/h for both groups.<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> The conventional approach was adopted after patients were discharged from ICU.

When BGL sank below 10&#x0200a;mmol/L, the insulin infusion was stopped.</p></sec></sec><sec><label>2.6</label><title>Outcome measures</title><p>The primary outcomes were infection rate and neurological outcome. Infections included pneumonia, sepsis, and urinary and wound infections, and were defined according to the National Nosocomial Infection Surveillance System.<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> Two assessors independently evaluated the date of onset and the type of infection for any infective disease observed. Neurological outcome was measured by the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS).</p><p>The secondary outcomes included duration of ICU stay and mortality rate. Neurological outcome and mortality rate were evaluated at 6 months follow-up.

On the other hand, this study demonstrated that IIT did not reduce the mortality rate of patients with TBI, neither in hospital nor at the 6-month follow-up.</p><p>This study has several limitations. First, the most important limitation is the lacking blind for insulin intervention in this study. In addition, this study was based at a single-center, and was only conducted at Beijing ChaoYang Hospital of Capital Medical University, which may restrict the generalization of our findings. Third, some differences in clinical severity between the 2 groups may have affected the primary and secondary outcomes, such as duration of ICU stay and infection rate, even though no differences in APACHE II score were found at baseline. Finally, factors relating to the ICU setting in this study, such as the use of sedation and mechanical ventilation may represent a further limitation because such factors might have masked the clinical signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia in patients with TBI.</p><p>This study showed that IIT for patients with TBI not only decreased infection rates and the duration of ICU stay, but also enhanced neurological outcome.
