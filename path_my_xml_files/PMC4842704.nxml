After treatment for 12 weeks, comparison were made in erectile function, serum prolactin level and serum testosterone in two groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Compared with those before treatment, the erectile function after treatment was significantly improved in two groups (P&#x0003c;0.05), serum prolactin level of all patients after treatment declined significantly to the normal range (P&#x0003c;0.05) and serum testosterone after treatment increased significantly. Then the erectile function after treatment in treatment group was significantly better than that in control group (P&#x0003c;0.05). There was no significant difference in serum prolactin level after treatment between two groups (P&#x0003e;0.05). Serum testosterone after treatment in treatment group was significantly higher than that in control group (P&#x0003c;0.05). The effective rate of erectile function in treatment group was significantly higher than that in control group (P&#x0003c;0.05).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Xuanju compound capsule combined with bromocriptine is highly effective in the treatment of erectile dysfunction due to hyperprolactinemia, and the effect was better than bromocriptine.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>Keywords: </title><kwd>Hyperprolactinemia</kwd><kwd>erectile dysfunction</kwd><kwd>bromocriptine</kwd><kwd>compound Xuanjun capsule</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front></article>
