Rural populations, especially women, have considerably higher rates of cardiovascular disease, influenced by poverty, environmental factors, access to health care, and social and cultural attitudes and norms.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p id="Par2">This community-based study will be a two-arm randomized controlled efficacy trial comparing a multi-level, community program (Strong Hearts, Healthy Communities) with a minimal intervention control program (Strong Hearts, Healthy Women). Strong Hearts, Healthy Communities was developed by integrating content from three evidence-based programs and was informed by extensive formative research (e.g. community assessments, focus groups, and key informant interviews). Classes will meet twice weekly for one hour for 24&#x000a0;weeks and focus on individual-level skill building and behavior change; social and civic engagement are also core programmatic elements. Strong Hearts, Healthy Women will meet monthly for hour-long sessions over the 24&#x000a0;weeks covering similar content in a general, condensed format. Overweight, sedentary women 40&#x000a0;years of age and older from rural, medically underserved communities (12 in Montana and 4 in New York) will be recruited; sites, pair-matched based on rurality, will be randomized to full or minimal intervention. Data will be collected at baseline, midpoint, intervention completion, and six-month, one-year, and eighteen months post-intervention. The primary outcome is change in body weight; secondary outcomes include physiologic, anthropometric, behavioral, and psychosocial variables. In the full intervention, engagement of participants&#x02019; friends and family members in partnered activities and community events is an intervention target, hypothesizing that there will be a reciprocal influence of physical activity and diet behavior between participants and their social network. Family members and/or friends will be invited to complete baseline and follow-up questionnaires about their health behaviors and environment, height and weight, and attitudes and beliefs.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">Strong Hearts, Healthy Communities aims to reduce cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality, improve quality of life, and reduce cardiovascular disease-related health care burden in underserved rural communities.

In addition, there is considerable disparity in CVD risk among individuals living in rural settings, particularly medically underserved rural areas and populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The combination of poverty, environmental factors (such as geographical distances and limited access to healthy foods and physical activity resources), as well as social and cultural attitudes and norms are important contributors to these rural health disparities and collectively compound the problem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par41">Another important consideration is gender disparity. Women living in rural areas tend to be uninsured, older, poorer, less educated, and have higher rates of chronic health conditions, and disabilities than their urban counterparts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Rural midlife and older women are often isolated, without access to appropriate physical activity opportunities, affordable healthy food, and healthcare services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Importantly, women are also 20&#x000a0;% more likely than men to die of heart disease; despite this, many women are unaware that they are at risk for CVD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Fortunately, lifestyle modifications can reduce CVD risk among all age groups, including midlife and older women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Women living in medically underserved areas are a critical target population for CVD prevention efforts. These women can act as powerful role models and agents of change for their families, friends, and communities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p id="Par42">There is limited knowledge about how programs and services can move beyond commonly used individual-level approaches, which have limitations in terms of cost, impact, reach, and sustainability, to effectively reduce rural CVD health disparities using an integrated, multi-level, community-engaged approach.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Program background and development</title><p id="Par43">In 2002, the community-based StrongWomen Strength Training (SWST) program was developed, based upon two decades of clinical and community research that demonstrated the benefits of progressive strength training on midlife and older women&#x02019;s health&#x02014;specifically muscular strength and mass, bone health, heart disease, diabetes, frailty, falls, arthritis, depression, and sleep [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. A national dissemination initiative began in 2003 and there are now approximately 3,000 educators in 48 states trained to implement the SWST classes in their communities, with hundreds of classes operating throughout the U.S. and Canada [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. In follow-up program evaluations, SWST participants demonstrated improvements in multiple domains of physical fitness (i.e. lower and upper body strength; lower and upper body flexibility; aerobic fitness; and agility) as well as body image and general physical activity behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p><p id="Par44">Ongoing feedback and collaboration with the educators leading those community-based classes catalyzed the development and testing of the StrongWomen Healthy Hearts (SWHH) physical activity and nutrition program. SWHH was tested in a randomized controlled efficacy trial with overweight and obese midlife and older women in Arkansas and Kansas. Results demonstrated significant reductions in body weight and improvements in diet and physical activity behaviors. The program has also been disseminated nationally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].</p><p id="Par45">The most recent addition to the StrongWomen programs is the StrongWomen Change Club (SWCC), which was developed, implemented, and evaluated in 2010&#x02013;2011. The goal of this program was to promote community-level food and physical activity environment changes in non-urban communities through strategic civic engagement and capacity building activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. One-year follow-up data with eight communities across the U.S. demonstrated the success of residents to identify an issue of concern in their community and work together in a step-wise process to gain broader community support and positively address the issue identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p><p id="Par46">The Strong Hearts, Healthy Communities (SHHC) program, to be tested in this study, incorporates key elements from these three core StrongWomen curricula as the foundation of a new community-based program targeting CVD risk reduction for rural communities, specifically the strength training and aerobic exercise components from SWST and SWHH, respectively; nutrition education components and behavioral strategies from SWHH; and civic and social engagement strategies and activities from SWCC (also known as and referred to herein as the HEART Club, which is the name now used in this study and others).</p><p id="Par47">Furthermore, to ensure a robust, appropriately tailored intervention, the development of the comprehensive SHHC approach incorporates partnerships with local health educators to conduct community assessments, focus groups, and key informant interviews with members of key groups to gather in-depth information about CVD awareness, economic, healthcare, and social/cultural issues, as well as barriers and facilitators to healthy eating, active living, smoking cessation, stress management, and other relevant topics. In addition, engagement of SHHC participants&#x02019; friends and family members in partnered activities and community events is an intervention target, hypothesizing that there will be a reciprocal influence of physical activity and diet behavior between participants and their social network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/Design</title><p id="Par48">To best support sustainability, a CVD program for rural women living in medically underserved areas should be appropriately tailored and incorporate engagement and capacity building. Thus, the overall objectives of SHHC are to address the gap in knowledge and practice of approaches beyond individual-level change by testing a comprehensive program designed to: a) improve diet and physical activity behaviors, b) promote local built environment resources, and c) shift social norms about active living and healthy eating through civic engagement, capacity building, and community-based programming.</p><sec id="Sec4"><title>Specific aims and related approaches</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Aim 1: Facilitate broad community engagement, build capacity, and conduct formative research; and Aim 1.1: Develop and refine the SHHC curriculum</title><p id="Par49">Community assessments provide an in-depth look at area conditions, characteristics, features, and structures, such as housing, other buildings, schools, public spaces, parks, physical activity facilities, culture/entertainment, street use, commercial activity, signage, media, land use, public transportation, traffic, noise, faith services, health care facilities, community services/organizations, supermarkets, grocery stores, restaurants, and other food venues. The purpose of community assessments for this project is two-fold: 1) To provide community members and researchers with a "360 degree" perspective on the community strengths, resources, needs, and issues of concern; and 2) To develop a "Strong Hearts" resource guide for intervention communities. Information and experiences from the assessment are also important program sustainability tools, given that economic barriers often limit development of new community resources (e.g. parks), and seeing the community through a "new lens" helps identify existing resources that can be improved upon or "marketed." The overall goal of the assessment and resource guides is to address CVD risk factors (e.g. healthy eating, physical activity, preventive services, smoking cessation, stress management). The study team members, including the community health educators, will conduct walking and windshield tours of each community site. The windshield and walking tours are needed to provide detailed contextual information essential to development of the SHHC curriculum, and eventually to facilitate engagement and build capacity within the community.</p><p id="Par50">Focus groups will occur in each of the study communities. We expect responses to key topic areas to vary substantially such that separate groups based on age and gender are justified. Groups will be stratified as such: age groups 40&#x02013;64 and 65+; and male and female. Focus group participants (8&#x02013;12 per group) will be recruited and screened by local health educators using a variety of community-based strategies, including press releases, flyers, and website posts. For focus group participants, there are three sources of data: 1) a screening form which will ask about age, BMI, sedentary lifestyle, employment status, and type of health insurance; 2) the focus group discussion, which covers awareness and knowledge about factors related to CVD risk; access to health care services and information; attitudes, perceptions, barriers, and facilitators to physical activity and eating heart-healthy diet; and understanding community in a rural environment; and 3) a short survey to be completed prior to the discussion designed to assess barriers related to attending intervention sessions, medical care seeking behaviors, meal patterns, smoking, and household size and income.</p><p id="Par51">Key informant interviews will occur in study communities, with a total of 30 individuals. The goal is to confirm and extend findings from the community assessments and focus groups, and to provide in-depth perspectives from the communities. Topics will include perceptions of community risk and of environmental, policy, and community social/cultural factors that serve as barriers and facilitators to heart health behaviors. A purposive sample of approximately three key informants per town, representing health educators, practitioners, local leadership, or other stakeholders specific to a community as identified by extension educators will be selected for interviews.</p><p id="Par52">The development of the SHHC and SHHW curricula will be informed by the community assessment, focus group, and key informant interview data and feedback from the local health educator partners along with a systematic content analysis and mapping to fully integrate the three foundational StrongWomen curricula. A national advisory board plus local health educator partners will also provide feedback and input during development of the curricula.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Aim 2: Evaluate the efficacy of the SHHC intervention in a 24-week community-based randomized controlled trial; and Aim 2.1: Evaluate changes in behavior, attitudes, and knowledge among participants&#x02019; social network</title><p id="Par53">We will evaluate the efficacy of the SHHC intervention on anthropometric, physiologic, behavioral, and psychosocial parameters among overweight and obese women aged 40 and older living in medically underserved rural communities.

Potential mediating effects of behavior, psychosocial, and community awareness/participation variables will be examined. In addition to the direct effect of the intervention on the primary outcome, the indirect effects of the intervention on anthropometric and physiologic outcomes through behavior, psychosocial, and community awareness/participation outcomes will be investigated.

As a first step, a cost analysis to identify and measure the direct, tangible costs of the resources used in program administration and implementation will be conducted. Important cost categories are salaries, wages, and benefits; facilities (office space and utilities); equipment, supplies, travel, and staff training. The cost analysis will be conducted from the narrow program perspective and from the broad societal perspective. For the program perspective, the focus will be on costs directly incurred by the agencies that administer and implement the program. These costs will include both direct payments and the value of in-kind contributions, such as the value of contributed office space. The results of the program-perspective cost analysis will provide information to judge whether and where the SHHC can be disseminated. For this purpose, it will be important to distinguish the costs of different components of the SHHC, for example, the costs of SHHC program development as distinct from the costs of the SHHC intervention. The detailed results will allow groups considering dissemination to develop cost predictions tailored to their specific context.</p><p>A preliminary cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) of the SHHC intervention will be conducted. The CEA will build on the cost analysis conducted from the broad societal perspective. From the societal perspective, costs include not only the costs included in the program-perspective cost analysis, but also the opportunity cost of all resources used as a result of the intervention. Costs to participants are an important cost of the opportunity costs included from the societal perspective. Participants give up time that could have been used in other valued ways such as labor market work, household work, or leisure activities. Standard practice of measuring the value of participants&#x02019; time based on the relevant wage rates will be followed. The incremental costs of the SHHC intervention will be compared to the incremental effectiveness estimated from the controlled trial. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) will be calculated by dividing the incremental costs of the intervention by the incremental effectiveness. The calculated ICER in terms of the primary outcome will provide an estimate of the costs per unit change in body weight. This ICER allows the direct comparison of the cost-effectiveness of the SHHC intervention to alternative approaches to reduce body weight. The ICER will also be calculated in terms of standardized health outcomes including life years and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Epidemiologic models will be used to map the effects measured in the controlled trial (body weight, physiologic measures) to predict impact on life years and QALYs. The calculated ICER in terms of QALYS will allow the cost-effectiveness of the SHHC to be compared to a wide range of other health interventions for which QALY-based CEAs have been performed. An important goal of the preliminary CEA is to demonstrate feasibility and identify important issues to be addressed in more complete economic analyses.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec25" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par89">There are notable disparities in risk for obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and CVD for people living in rural settings, particularly underserved rural areas. These disparities are driven by complex factors such as socioeconomic disadvantage, geographical distances/barriers, social and cultural issues, and limited access to healthcare, healthy foods, and/or physical activity opportunities due to environmental constraints, affordability, and availability. Moving beyond individual-level programs toward integrated, multi-level, community-engaged approaches may more effectively reduce rural CVD health disparities.</p><p id="Par90">The novel integration of a multi-level, community-informed program combined with civic engagement and capacity building focused on local resource awareness and enhancement has the potential to effect clinically meaningful improvements among participants, as well as their families, friends, and communities. This innovative approach will also help sustain positive changes by linking behavior, social support, and the community environment. If successful, SHHC could be nationally disseminated, providing a feasible model for underserved rural communities across the nation to improve health, well-being, and quality of life and reduce CVD and other chronic diseases.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ACSM</term><def><p id="Par16">American College of Sports Medicine</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ALB</term><def><p id="Par27">Albumin</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ALT</term><def><p id="Par26">Alanine aminotransferase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AST</term><def><p id="Par28">Aspartate aminotransferase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ASA-24</term><def><p id="Par34">Automated Self-administered 24-hour Recall</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BMI</term><def><p id="Par14">Body mass index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BUN</term><def><p id="Par29">Blood urea nitrogen</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CEA</term><def><p id="Par37">Cost-effectiveness analysis</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CVD</term><def><p id="Par5">Cardiovascular disease</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DASH</term><def><p id="Par17">Dietary approaches to stop hypertension</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EDTA</term><def><p id="Par23">Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GAD-7</term><def><p id="Par20">Generalized anxiety disorder screener</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GGT</term><def><p id="Par30">Gamma-glutamyltransferase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HBEQ</term><def><p id="Par18">Health behavior and environment questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HDL</term><def><p id="Par25">High-density lipoprotein</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IBC</term><def><p id="Par31">Iron binding capacity</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICER</term><def><p id="Par38">Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IRB</term><def><p id="Par13">Internal review board</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LDH</term><def><p id="Par32">Lactate dehydrogenase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LDL</term><def><p id="Par24">Low-density lipoprotein</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MUA</term><def><p id="Par11">Medically underserved area</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MUP</term><def><p id="Par12">Medically underserved population</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PAR</term><def><p id="Par15">Physical activity recall</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PHQ-8</term><def><p id="Par19">Patient health questionnaire depression scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>QALY</term><def><p id="Par39">Quality adjusted life years</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RUCA</term><def><p id="Par35">Rural urban continuum code</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SHHC</term><def><p id="Par9">Strong hearts, healthy communities</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SWCC</term><def><p id="Par8">StrongWomen change club</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SHHW</term><def><p id="Par10">Strong hearts, healthy women</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SWHH</term><def><p id="Par7">StrongWomen healthy hearts</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SPSS</term><def><p id="Par36">Statistical package for the social sciences</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SWST</term><def><p id="Par6">StrongWomen strength training</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TFEQ-R21</term><def><p id="Par21">Three factor eating questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TSH</term><def><p id="Par33">Thyroid stimulating hormone</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WHS</term><def><p id="Par22">Western health screening</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no financial or non-financial interests to declare.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>RAS conceived of and is overseeing all aspects of the study and manuscript development.
