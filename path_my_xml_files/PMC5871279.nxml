However, conclusive results are lacking in order to confirm its usefulness. The purpose of this study was to determine whether a standardized yoga intervention could reduce these adverse symptoms. This was a partially randomized and blinded controlled trial comparing a standardized yoga intervention with standard care. Eligible patients were adults diagnosed with stages I to III breast cancer receiving chemotherapy. Patients randomized to the experimental group participated in an 8-week yoga program. There was no significant difference between the experimental and control groups on chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting after 8 weeks. Results suggest the yoga program is not beneficial in managing these adverse symptoms. However, considering preliminary evidence suggesting yoga&#x02019;s beneficial impact in cancer symptom management, methodological limitations should be explored and additional studies should be conducted.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>breast cancer</kwd><kwd>chemotherapy</kwd><kwd>nausea</kwd><kwd>vomiting</kwd><kwd>yoga</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Worldwide, breast cancer is the second most common cancer diagnosed excluding non-melanoma skin cancer.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-2156587217706617" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> In 2015, it was estimated that 25 500 Canadian women will receive a breast cancer diagnosis.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-2156587217706617" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Chemotherapy is commonly offered to early stage, high recurrent risk, locally advanced, or recurrent breast cancer patients.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-2156587217706617" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Despite improved oncological treatments and survival rates, this diagnosis is still associated with adverse symptoms linked to chemotherapy.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-2156587217706617" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bibr4-2156587217706617" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> In fact, research reveals a plethora of psychological symptoms (emotional distress, impaired quality of life, anxiety, depression) and physical ailments (pain, fatigue, dry mouth, insomnia, nausea, vomiting) occurring at a prevalent rate.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-2156587217706617" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bibr6-2156587217706617" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p><p>Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting remain 2 of the most distressing side effects experienced by cancer patients.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-2156587217706617" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="bibr8-2156587217706617" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> In fact, studies report the prevalence of these adverse symptoms ranges from 13% to 75%.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-2156587217706617" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Consequently, they can lead to poorer chemotherapy adherence, diminished quality of life, increased depression and anxiety, and increased use of public health resources.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-2156587217706617" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="bibr11-2156587217706617" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr12-2156587217706617" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Significant advances have been observed in symptom prevention and management by virtue of improved understanding of the pathophysiology of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.

There is a general consensus in explaining anticipatory nausea and vomiting as a conditioned response to contextual factors (sounds, smells, and sight of the clinic), which become conditional stimuli paired with chemotherapy (unconditional stimulus), thus eliciting an unconditional response (nausea and vomiting).<sup><xref rid="bibr21-2156587217706617" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="bibr22-2156587217706617" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> Additionally, cognitive factors and emotional appraisal such as negative expectations, perceived lack of control, and fear of suffering have also been labelled as chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting contributing factors.<sup><xref rid="bibr23-2156587217706617" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Altogether, additional interventions targeting these contributing factors are necessary due to their effect on these adverse symptoms.</p><p>An increasing number of women diagnosed with breast cancer seek complementary and alternative medicine to cope with their diagnosis.<sup><xref rid="bibr24-2156587217706617" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Yoga practice has seen a significant increase for cancer survivors and patients undergoing treatment.<sup><xref rid="bibr24-2156587217706617" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Yoga seems to yield positive outcomes in chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting management.

A previous study conducted with the Bali yoga program for breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy reported significant decrease in depressive symptoms and improvement in quality of life.<sup><xref rid="bibr28-2156587217706617" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> This program is based on the original method of Madan Bali. Dr Madan Bali&#x02019;s method combines Hatha yoga postures, breathing, and visualization techniques in a unique way in order to promote the body&#x02019;s ability to replenish itself in between frequent relaxation periods. Although this method can be characterized as Hatha yoga, the focus remains on the visualization techniques to increase one&#x02019;s awareness about the psychological and physiological impact of the postures chosen. In the past few years, this method has been tailored to meet the needs of breast cancer patients. Among the distinctive features of this program, we found the psychoeducational content about the psychophysiological aspects related to cancer and the importance of the relaxation response during as well as between yoga poses. The validation of this program is underway.</p><p>The aim of this study is to determine the effects of a standardized yoga program on chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting among breast cancer patients. Primarily, we hypothesize that breast cancer patients enrolled in the 8-week Bali yoga program will show decreased chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting compared with patients on the waiting list. Our secondary objective will be to investigate how anxiety affects chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="section1-2156587217706617"><title>Methods</title><sec id="section2-2156587217706617" sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title><p>Enrollment for the study occurred over a 2-year period from 2011 to 2013 in 3 hospitals in Montreal (Canada). Participants were recruited by nurses through direct contact during initial scheduled clinical visits prior to their first cycle of chemotherapy or just after their first cycle of chemotherapy. Eligibility was defined as follows: ability to understand French, be 18 years or older, have a breast cancer diagnosis (stages I-III), receive chemotherapy, consent from medical team, no regular practice of yoga, no current psychotherapy, no psychiatric diagnosis, and no heart failure. Eligibility was further confirmed by research assistants prior to study enrollment. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. It was clearly stated that their approval or disapproval to participate in the study at any point in time would not interfere with their cancer treatments.</p></sec><sec id="section3-2156587217706617" sec-type="methods"><title>Procedure</title><p>Group assignment was determined by a computer-generated random table in cohorts of 10 with an allocation ratio of 1:1. The hospital staff enrolling participants were blinded to the allocation sequence. Blinding of participants and research assistants to group assignment was not possible due to the nature of the intervention. The treatment group received the Bali yoga program for 8 weeks along with standard care. Concurrently, the waitlist control group only received standard care for 8 weeks followed by the Bali yoga program for an additional 8 weeks.</p><p>The Bali yoga program for breast cancer patients consisted of 8 weekly group sessions of 90 minutes with 5 participants per group, led by one instructor. Participants were also given a DVD of the intervention with a 20- and 40-minute session format. The sessions were conducted in each hospital&#x02019;s cancer department conference room. The 2 instructors available for the study were certified yoga teachers trained by Dr Bali and had extensive experience teaching yoga to cancer patients and survivors. Moreover, they each received an 8-week training that included a standardized manual delineating the program with detailed session guidelines, pilot groups, and discussion of the themes elaborated by 2 psychologists and Dr Bali.</p><p>This program combines Hatha yoga poses, frequent relaxation periods between poses, and breathing techniques as well as meditation and visualization. This combination aims to stimulate the body and mind to better mobilize them against illness. Each session was as follows: introduction of the theme (5 minutes); guided relaxation based on the theme (10 minutes); combination of gentle yoga poses and relaxation with breathing techniques (60 minutes); guided meditation with OM chant (7 minutes); final relaxation (8 minutes). The 8 psychoeducational themes were importance and benefits of relaxation; definition and causes of stress; power of a concentrated mind and positive imagery; immune system function; activation of the healing response; benefits of breathing; acceptance philosophy; and importance of daily yoga practice. During the session, the instructor discussed the physiological and psychological benefits of the gentle poses and emphasized the importance of being aware of one&#x02019;s body sensations. Between each pose, a short relaxation/breathing/visualization sequence was carried out. The poses were added progressively as follows: 12 poses (session 1), 4 poses (session 2), 6 poses (session 3), 1 pose (session 4), and 1 pose (session 5). By the sixth session, 24 poses are practiced. Participants were instructed to practice at home daily with the 20-minute session format the first 4 weeks and the 40-minute session format the 4 remaining weeks.</p><p>All poses were seated, supine, or on all fours. Alternative poses adapted to the participants&#x02019; condition were also proposed. They were supplied with a yoga mat, a blanket, and supportive blocks. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-2156587217706617">Table 1</xref> present the list of poses.

Despite the lack of significant results, it remains worthwhile to explore possible reasons contributing to these findings.</p><p>First, it is possible the yoga intervention did not reduce these adverse symptoms as they were already well managed. Across the 3 time points assessed, participants in both groups rated post-chemotherapy intensity of nausea and vomiting as being mild to moderate. Overall, across both groups, approximately 80% of participants followed the antiemetic regimen and 80% rated them as being very helpful to helpful enough. Also, each participating hospital followed clinical practice guidelines for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting management. Once more, managing these symptoms can be improved by 20% by following these guidelines.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-2156587217706617" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Therefore, it is possible the sample in this study represents that category of patients.</p><p>Several studies have found exercise to improve quality of life and physical and emotional well-being of cancer patients during and after treatment.<sup><xref rid="bibr33-2156587217706617" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="bibr34-2156587217706617" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> It was observed that participants in both groups were physically active and had various coping strategies (shopping, walking, gardening, swimming, gym training, etc) and rated these activities as moderately to very helpful in coping with their illness and its side effects. It is possible the Bali yoga program did not provide an additional beneficial impact over these coping strategies.</p><p>Although no current psychotherapy was an eligibility criterion, once randomized, participants had access to psychological services if needed. There was no significant statistical difference between both groups on seeking psychological services. However, these sessions could have been beneficial in reducing chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting and psychological factors related to said symptoms in both groups. Altogether, the available resources, the participants&#x02019; self-care behaviors, and the effective management of these side effects could also explain the lack of correlations found between digestive toxicity and anxiety. However, we found a decrease of anxiety symptoms in the BYP-BC group but not in the control group. This is in accordance with many studies on yoga and anxiety symptoms during cancer.<sup><xref rid="bibr24-2156587217706617" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup></p><p>It would have been purposeful to measure cognitions pertaining to chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting specifically and investigate locus of control. It would have provided relevant information pertaining to symptom experience. It could be speculated that despite having chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, knowing what to expect and believing in one&#x02019;s ability to manage them would prevent participants to rate these symptoms as debilitating, thus rating them at a lower intensity. It is also possible that a lack of significant results with the Bali yoga program could be due to the measurement methods selected. As previously mentioned, these symptoms are not only highly variable between patients but also within each patient. The MANE was primarily chosen due to its wide use<sup><xref rid="bibr35-2156587217706617" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> and also in attempt to replicate Raghavendra et al.<sup><xref rid="bibr26-2156587217706617" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> However, it is possible that retrospective self-report could have underestimated the intensity and duration of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. In fact, Carnrike et al<sup><xref rid="bibr36-2156587217706617" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> reported moderate concurrent validity of this questionnaire compared to asking directly each time, and Coolbrandt et al<sup><xref rid="bibr37-2156587217706617" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> reported discrepancies between immediate versus delayed self-reporting of side effects during chemotherapy. It would have been better to ask every day and every hour (acute vs delayed) and anticipatory versus post chemotherapy when there was a chemotherapy cycle scheduled. Ideally, it would be after every treatment.</p><p>Finally, the most cited study highlighting beneficial impact of yoga interventions in reducing chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting is Raghavendra et al.<sup><xref rid="bibr26-2156587217706617" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> Several reasons can account for the current study&#x02019;s lack of corroborating results. First, the way in which yoga was administered greatly differed. In his protocol, it was an individualized treatment starting 30 minutes before each treatment. Participants were asked to practice daily for 1 hour, 6 days per week, minimum 3 hours per week, and house visits were scheduled to monitor their home practice and discuss possible doubts, motivation, and education. Also, the authors highlighted the possibility of antiemetic regimen not following the international guidelines for delayed chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. Additionally, he revealed the control group receiving less coping preparation and counselling support than the yoga intervention group that could account for the observed differences. In sum, all these differences can explain why our results did not corroborate his findings. Finally, it is possible no significant results were found due to the variability of adherence to yoga intervention and home practice (5.5 &#x000b1; 2.7 sessions, 1.7 &#x000b1; 0.8 hours per week for home practice). As seen in several studies, yoga interventions&#x02019; beneficial impact on chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting seemed to be found when these interventions were longer in duration and/or several times per week and adherence was highly rated.<sup><xref rid="bibr38-2156587217706617" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> Therefore, it is possible that improving class attendance and home practice could be a starting point to evaluate the potential benefits of the Bali yoga program for breast cancer patients in future studies.</p></sec><sec id="section17-2156587217706617"><title>Strengths and Limitations</title><p>First, the sample was of modest size, which resulted in a low statistical power for certain analyses, thus lowering the probability of having significant results especially with missing data. Furthermore, missing data due to noncompleters and methodological oversights contributed to an important loss of available cases to conduct analyses. Also, the research assistant and participants were not blinded to group assignment. The research design did not control for nonspecific ingredients of the yoga intervention other than the passage of time like therapeutic expectations. Also, the method of assessing chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting and possible confounding variables could have contributed to the lack of significant findings. Despite its limitations, this study has several strengths. The yoga intervention was based on a standardized manual with additional training ensuring feasibility and replication of the intervention. Also, several cofounding variables were included in the analyses procedures. Last, methodological limitations were explored and future studies goals were outlined.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="section18-2156587217706617"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Despite not being able to confirm our main hypothesis, this study will add to the growing body of research pertaining to yoga interventions and chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. As it is becoming increasingly popular among breast cancer patients, a better understanding of their clinical significance in managing distressing symptoms is paramount. Moreover, our study can help future research in conducting improved randomized controlled trials with larger and homogenous sample sizes and improved chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting assessments. Ultimately, such studies are needed to determine to what extent yoga can be a beneficial, safe complementary adjunct in cancer support care.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors thank the patients in all 3 hospital centers in Montreal, Canada, for participating in the study.
