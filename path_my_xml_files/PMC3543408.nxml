<italic>Overcoming Depression: A Five Areas Approach'</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0052735-Williams1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> is a structured self-help treatment for depression. It contains stand alone CBT workbooks covering topics such as Practical Problem Solving, Being Assertive, Using Antidepressant Medication, Overcoming Sleep Problems and others. The content was developed in liaison with primary and secondary health care practitioners <xref rid="pone.0052735-Williams2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Workbooks are designed to be jargon-free and have a low reading age, high accessibility <xref rid="pone.0052735-Martinez1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> and can be used in a modular fashion.

Ethics approval was granted by NHS Glasgow Primary Care &#x02013; Community and Mental Health Research Ethics Committee - 02/24.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Patients</title><p>Patients aged 18 years or over presenting to one of seven National Health Service general practices in Glasgow, Scotland, UK with symptoms of depression, a Beck Depression Inventory&#x02013;II (BDI-II) score of 14 or more, and ability to use the written materials (i.e. no visual or reading problems, learning difficulties or dementia) were offered entry into the study. Any clinical member of the primary care team (general practitioners - GPs - or nurses) could refer to the study. In order to exclude potential participants for whom the intervention might be clinically inappropriate in a consistent way, a simple exclusion algorithm based on the BDI-II scoring was adopted using cut-off points chosen by the authors. Patients with active suicidal intent (scoring 2 or more on the BDI-II suicidal thoughts item) were excluded as such patients need more than GCBT-SH or TAU. Also excluded were those who were unable to use the materials because of impaired concentration and motivation (scoring 7 or more on the combined BDI-II items for energy, concentration difficulty and tiredness &#x02013; items 15, 19 and 20) as they would experience difficulty in using the written materials effectively.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Study Design</title><p>This is a parallel group randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing GSH-CBT plus routine primary care treatment with primary care treatment as usual alone (TAU). Allocation was at an individual level. Any apparently suitable patient with low mood expressing an interest in the study were seen by the research assistant (RA) within a week at their general practice.</p><p>At the initial appointment, the RA checked the inclusion/exclusion criteria and obtained written informed consent from all participants. Baseline assessment measures were completed with the RA (CORE-OM; and Patient Questionnaire &#x02013; PQ <xref rid="pone.0052735-Whitfield1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> addressing mental health literacy. The PQ questionnaire is a non-validated questionnaire asking about the participants previous and current attitudes and use of self-help resources, their knowledge of the causes and treatment options for depression, and self-rated knowledge in identifying and changing problems such as negative thoughts (Mental health literacy). The CORE-OM comprises 34 items and measures four domains (subjective well-being, symptoms, life-functioning, and risk to self and to others). Each item is scored on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (most or all of the time). We report here only CORE total score.</p><p>After baseline measures, patients were randomised using an automated remote telephone system to the GSH-CBT or TAU groups. The referring clinician was informed about whether patients were eligible, whether they entered the study and of their score on the BDI-II suicide screening question.</p><p>If participants were allocated to the GSH-CBT intervention, they were offered their first appointment with the psychology graduate within 7 days at their own general practice. Three face to face support sessions of approximately 40 minutes could be delivered per protocol; with the option of a fourth session if needed with a support/guidance target ranging from 0&#x02013;160 minutes depending on take-up. The first appointment focussed on an introduction to the use of the self-help materials. The patient was given a copy of Workbook 1 (&#x0201c;Understanding depression&#x0201d;) and instructed on how to use it. At session 2, the first workbook was reviewed before a joint decision identified an additional 1&#x02013;2 treatment workbooks to be used between sessions 2 and 3. These were chosen on the basis of the initial self-assessment in the Understanding depression workbook. At session 3, there was a final review of their progress. The relapse prevention workbook and up to one or two additional workbooks were also offered at this final appointment. The workbooks aimed to be accessible with a reading age of around 12 years, and aimed to communicate key CBT principles in a low jargon way. Case examples, illustrations, text and interactive worksheets encouraged users to self-assess, and then choose which topics (workbooks) they would work on. Each workbook included a Putting into Practice (homework) plan to encourage application in the reader's own life. The choice of workbooks followed a core/options approach where the initial workbook (self-assessment) helped identify what problem areas the person wished to work on. In the final support session the focus was on the Planning for the Future (relapse prevention) workbook. At any time during treatment, patients could arrange to see their doctor or other health care practitioner as normal. The intervention by the psychology graduate was only to support the use of the self-help materials using a written support protocol and &#x0201c;advice&#x0201d; separate from the intervention was not offered. The GP was informed that the participant had been seen and discharged at the end of GCBT-SH support.</p><p>The support protocol focused on using and applying one to two workbooks per week. The support worker encouraged the participant to read, answer questions and plan how to put what was being learned into practice. Each session allowed progress or barriers to progress to be reviewed and plans to overcome these barriers to be discussed. The support worker was a non-clinically qualified psychology graduate with a basic honours degree in undergraduate psychology. During the course of the project only one support worker was used at any one time, and three support workers delivered the intervention over the course of the project. Face to face supervision was provided on a weekly or fortnightly basis.</p><p>The study methodology was approved by the local research ethics committee (NHS Glasgow Primary Care &#x02013; Community and Mental Health Research Ethics Committee - 02/24), and the trial registered (ISRCTN13475030). The sponsor was NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Outcome measures</title><p>In both arms, measures were obtained at baseline, and by mail at four and 12 months (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0052735.s003">fig. S1</xref>). The primary outcome was a comparison between the BDI-II scores for the two randomised groups at 4 months. The BDI-II <xref rid="pone.0052735-Beck1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> is a 21 item self-rated questionnaire for depression, with each item rated 0&#x02013;3 (score 0&#x02013;63). A score of 0&#x02013;13 is classified as minimal depression, 14&#x02013;19 mild, 20&#x02013;28 moderate and 29&#x02013;63 severe depression).</p><p>Psychological symptoms and social functioning (using the CORE-OM <xref rid="pone.0052735-Evans1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> scale), and acceptability of the intervention (using the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire- CSQ) <xref rid="pone.0052735-Larsen1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> were compared.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>The sample size in this study is based on a published comparison between cognitive behavioural therapy and usual care using the BDI-II score at 4 months <xref rid="pone.0052735-Ward1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. That study found a between groups effect size of 0.43 for their CBT intervention. This reflects an improvement of 4.5 points on the BDI-II &#x02013; a clinically useful gain which is in the usual range selected by similar studies <xref rid="pone.0052735-deGraaf1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. The study experienced a drop out rate of 10% by the 4 month follow up. We had estimated a drop-out rate of 33% because of the lower level of therapist contact in our design. To achieve 85% power to detect a between-group difference of 0.43 standard deviations requires 99 participants per group, based on standard formulae for a two-sample t-test. To allow for loss to follow-up, we aimed to randomise 300 patients. Given the slightly lower rate of loss to follow-up at 4 months of 28%, recruitment ceased at 281 subjects, and 4-month follow-up was achieved for 203 randomised participants.</p><p>All analyses were performed under the intention to treat principle, i.e. between-group comparisons were in relation to the randomised groups, regardless of participation with study interventions. Continuous outcome measures (BDI-II score, CORE-OM total score at 4 and 12 months, and measures of health literacy at 1 month) were compared between treatment groups at each relevant time point using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), i.e. baseline-adjusted linear regression analysis. Estimates of mean differences between groups are reported with a 95% confidence interval (CI) and p-value. Analyses were initially carried out using only those subjects with available data. Additional analyses of BDI-II and CORE-OM total score were conducted after imputing missing values as equal to the baseline value.</p><p>For BDI-II scores, additional analyses were carried out of whether each individual achieved a 50% reduction in BDI-II score, relative to baseline. For these analyses, those with missing data are assumed not to have changed since baseline. Between-group differences are reported as an odds ratio with 95% CI and p-value.</p><p>Analyses were conducted using S-Plus for Windows v8.1. No adjustments were made for multiple comparisons.

The sample reflected a notable frequency of severe depression on BDI-II scores but the cohort was also well treated with pharmacotherapies for depression. There were significant gains at 4 months in terms of depression (BDI-II), and CORE total score.</p><p>The treatment is highly acceptable to participants and there is clear evidence of reduced clinical deterioration in mood for those receiving GSH-CBT. Importantly there were gains across several key outcome measures rather than in just one or two areas. We also observed significant gains in mental health literacy as well as in the CORE total score.</p><p>At 12 months, the benefits of self-help over TAU were maintained on the BDI-II.</p><p>
<italic>Strengths</italic>: This study is community-based and reflects &#x0201c;real-life&#x0201d; referrals from a range of urban and semi-urban family practices with varying levels of socioeconomic deprivation. The pragmatic approach to recruitment is easily reproducible in clinical practice. We produced the largest RCT to date examining guided CBT written self-help. The recruitment model proved successful &#x02013; overcoming an issue of problematic recruitment in a series of other studies in this field. The intervention is quickly delivered and is clinically effective. Overall 50.4% of people completed 3 or 4 sessions over the month's treatment.</p><p>Data collection, entry and analysis were performed independently to ensure the result was free from the potential bias induced by participation of the author of the materials in the study team. Furthermore the initial training of the guided self-help support workers was delivered by another member of staff. Remote randomisation and collection of data by a worker independent of the person delivering treatment also minimised bias.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Weaknesses</title><p>Our follow-up rate of 72.2% at 4 months is better than we predicted but is poorer at 12 months (41.6%) than we had hoped. We lack data on those participants who proved uncontactable and no data analysis is possible for those people. In the GSH-CBT arm, around 50% of people attended 2 or fewer sessions and 22% failed to take up the treatment.</p><p>Although the study design was analysed blind, because only one research assistant recruited and followed up patients it was not possible for the RA to retain blindness. Our use of self-rated questionnaires will mitigate against bias. Another area we would modify in future research would be the exclusion of people with low energy, concentration difficulty and tiredness. The rationale was to focus on people who could use the materials &#x02013; but this excluded a small number of people with some &#x0201c;core&#x0201d; symptoms of depression. GP access to treatment as usual was available in both arms and could include a wide variety of possible interventions including medication, psychology, counselling and psychiatry referral. We hope that the randomisation process will have equalised out the support needed in participants in the two arms. Our future economic analysis will allow a better description of these additional inputs in each arm.</p><p>The study design did not control for the impact of the relatively low level of human supportive contact in the GSH-CBT arm. The study fulfils criteria for minimal contact self-help with a maximum of 160 minutes of support and mean of 124.3 minutes of support. It is not known whether this provides optimal benefit, and whether improved or equal outcomes could be achieved with either shorter or longer, or fewer or more guided support sessions. We also do not know the relative contributions of the book, the support or a combination of both. Other support options are also available including telephone based support. We chose face to face support delivered in the patient's own general practice in order to build the service into existing ways of working. These issues of type, place, content and extent of support are areas that could be the focus of future studies.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The results provide strong evidence that the GSH-CBT package is effective when offered as a combination of the book plus up to 4 face to face support sessions. This is in line with other research confirming the importance of guidance in improving the impact of bibliotherapy <xref rid="pone.0052735-Gellatly1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. In the current study, at 4 months, showed 42.6% recovered in the GSH-CBT group and 24.5% in the TAU group and an odds ratio for recovery of 2.28. The interaction between factors that predict improvement to GSH-CBT will be explored in a further paper.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Future research</title><p>A replication study in other settings should focus on providing shorter support sessions as the Gellatly et al review suggests that all that is required is supportive monitoring <xref rid="pone.0052735-Gellatly1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. A desirable next step would be to repeat the study comparing GSH-CBT directly with antidepressant medication.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0052735.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>
