women&#x02019;s lives. Fertility loss can cause various mental 
problems such as feeling of loss of control, low self-
esteem, stress, depression, marital distress, and sexual 
dissatisfaction (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). The prevalence of depression ranges 
between 40-50% among women with infertility (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, 
<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Also, sexual dysfunction (SD) is a common problem 
in women with infertility, where the rate is 46.6% in a 
sample of Iranian infertile women (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Moreover, there 
is an association between SD and depression; namely, a 
review of the literature reveals that depression has been 
frequently associated with sexual impairments (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). </p><p>Therefore, depression itself may contribute to SD and 
vice-versa (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). The studies showed that the depression
leads to decreasing in success rate with <italic>in vitro</italic> fertilization 
(IVF). In addition, depression found to have an 
inversely correlation with pregnancy. The higher levels of 
depression is associated with lower rate of pregnancy (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). </p><p>Both cognitive behavioral therapy and drug therapy 
are effective in treating depression in women with infertility 
(<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). A review of the literature revealed that psychosocial 
interventions had a beneficial effect on depression 
and the well-being of women with infertility (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Psychotherapy 
or sex therapy had antidepressant effects and 
improved sexual function (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). For drug therapy, 
bupropion is used to treat depression related to sexual 
dysfunction. It is a norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake 
inhibitor (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), and is effective in the improvement 
of depression (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Bupropion is an effective antidepressant 
and can be used as a supplemental treatment to 
reverse antidepressant-induced SD (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Although one 
study showed that there was not a significant difference 
in depression rating scale between the bupropion users 
with placebo groups (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). </p><p>While behavioral and pharmacological treatments are 
effective in treating depression and SD in infertility, 
few studies have assessed these treatments for depression 
in infertile women with sexual dysfunction. To our 
knowledge, there are no published studies that have 
compared the effect of psychosexual therapy (PST) and 
bupropion, in the extended release (ER) formulation, 
in this population. Hence, the present study aimed to 
compare the effectiveness of bupropion extended-release 
versus psychological intervention on depression 
symptoms in depressed women with infertility and SD 
in Fatemeh Zahra Infertility and Reproductive Health 
Research Center of Babol University of Medical Sciences, 
Iran.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials-methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p> The authors carried out an open-label randomized 
controlled clinical trial between December 2014 to June 
2015 at the Fatemeh Zahra Infertility and Reproductive 
Health Research Center, Babol, Iran. The study design 
was confirmed by the Ethics Committee (4930, 12 Jan 
2014) and then registered in IRCT. Primary objective of 
this project was based on the treatment of SD with subsequent 
improvement of depression symptoms.</p><p>Women with infertility less than 45 years of age 
were eligible for the research under the following criteria: 
a score of =10 in beck depression index (BDI), 
a score of =26.55 on Iranian version of the female 
sexual function index (IV-FSFI), an infertility duration 
of greater than one year, were literate, ability to 
read and write, weren&#x02019;t undergone any fertility treatment 
in the next 2 months and were sexually active 
in the past four weeks. Subjects were excluded from 
the study if they had a history of seizures, were taking 
medications that could lower the seizure threshold or 
were known to effect sexual function, had a history 
of head trauma, had a major change in living conditions, 
or had psychological support. Exclusion criteria 
also included serious medical conditions and mental 
health problems under the treatment of a physician, 
having actively suicidal, having major depressive 
disorder (MDD) in the clinical interview by a female 
psychologist.</p><p>Subjects have been assessed for eligibility by two midwives 
with no clinical involvement in the study. Sample 
size was calculated in accordance with 22 subjects 
in each group, with accuracy=6.6, confidence interval 
(CI)=95%, and approximate SD=6.8 based on previous 
studies (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) and power=90% for each group. 
After consideration of the corrected sample size formula 
(n'=&#x0221a;Kn, k=2) (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), a total of 93 eligible infertile 
women were selected through computer-aid randomization 
in equal 3 groups (31 person in each group). A total 
of 93 depressed women with infertility and SD were 
randomly allotted in a 1:1:1 ratio to three equal groups 
as follows: i. PST, ii. Pharmacotherapy (BUP), and iii. 
Control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig .1</xref>). In this study both the researcher and the 
participants were not blinded. </p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig.1</label><caption><p>Flow diagram of participants through each stage of a randomized clinical trial.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="Int-J-Fertil-Steril-12-6-g01"/></fig><p>The PST interventions focused on educational programs 
that mainly contained eight weeks of two-hour sessions 
including mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT), 
relaxation training, behavior sex therapy (Mixed method) 
based on the Crowe and Ridley model, and also booklet 
of tranquility, mindfulness and medication (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>-<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) in the 
shape of group discussions, questions and answers, lectures, 
booklets, and CD with groups of 9-13 members. 
The pharmacotherapy group was treated with bupropion 
ER at a dose of 150 mg/d (Wellban Extended release, Abidi 
Company, Iran) for up to eight weeks.</p><p>The control group did not receive intervention, but educational 
package was given to them, and were referred to 
a sex therapy clinic after the end of study. Study duration, 
and bupropion dosage were different in previous studies (4-
24 week, and 100-450 mg/day) (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Therefore, 
intervention period, and dosing for bupropion in this 
study was considered 8 week, and 150 mg orally once a day 
in patients with depression symptoms treated for sexual 
dysfunction. Adverse events (AEs), vital sign, and Anthropometric 
measurements (weight, height) were serially conducted 
for each of groups by researcher, were summarized 
at each data collection schedule assessment point. During 
these visits, the previous bag of bupropion was collected 
and new bags of bupropion were given to be used for the 
next two weeks. Participants were also contacted by phone 
biweekly to monitor for any complaint, or any change in 
their health status(for any reason). At the same time the researcher 
could be contacted by phone at any time.</p><p>A total of 90 participants completed the study. At 
first, the research protocol was described for participants, 
and then written informed consent was obtained 
from each subject. A secure and confidential environment 
was considered for collecting data. The researcher 
used a binder for each participant to keep individual 
information.</p><p>Demographic information was collected. All subjects 
completed the BDI at baseline and after treatment at the 
end of the study. The BDI is a self-reported measure consisting 
of 21 questions to assess the severity of depression 
symptoms, Created by Beck in 1961, it has an approved 
validity (0.89); reliability (0.96) during the first decade 
following its introduction. The translated and Persian of 
BDI had Cronbachs alpha 0.87 in the Iranian population.</p><p>The intensity of the item rates on a 4-point scale (0-3) 
and the test is scored by summing the ratings given to 
each of the 21 items. The total score range between 0 and 
63 and the results range as follows: 0-9 as no depression, 
10-18 as mild depression, 19-29 as moderate depression, 
and 30 and greater as severe depression (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>-<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). A score 
=10 in BDI was considered &#x02018;&#x02018;at risk&#x02019;&#x02019; for depression (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). 
The FSFI, used to measure sexual dysfunction. It contains 
19 items in six different subscales of sexual desire, arousal, 
lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction, and pain. A score of 
=26.55 indicates sexual dysfunction. The validity and reliability 
of the Iranian version of FSFI is high (Cronbach&#x02019;s 
alpha 0.70-0.9) (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data analyses were performed using Paired t tests,
Pearson&#x02019;s correlation, &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), 
and Tukey&#x02019;s test (SPSS software, version 21) in 
an ITT analysis, with P&#x0003c;0.05 indicating statistical significance. 
Paired t tests was applied to show significant inter 
individual changes in BDI score within each treatment 
group. The chi-square test was used for comparing categorical 
variables between three groups. The ANCOVA 
was used as a statistical technique to control for variability 
(with baseline BDI scores as a covariate variable).</p><p>Tukey&#x02019;s test was used for pair wise comparisons. Subsequent 
tests included the homogeneity of variances, the 
linear relationship between the dependent variable and the 
covariate, and the normality of distributions (Skewness 
and Kurtosis test). The change of depression level from 
baseline to end of study was calculated for each group. 
Improvement in depression symptoms was defined as a 
pre- to post treatment decrease in BDI depression level 
(severe to moderate, moderate to mild, and mild to no 
depression). Worsening of depression was defined as an 
increase in BDI depression level from baseline to end of 
study (mild to moderate, moderate to severe).</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The demographic characteristics of subjects are 
showed in Table 1. The majority of participants were 
unemployed (78.5%), while the majority of the participants&#x02019; 
spouses were self-employed (44.1%). The mean 
age of participants was 29 &#x000b1; 5.44 years. The economical 
situation in more than one third of participants was poor 
(38.7%). The type of housing for the majority of participants 
was private (65.6%). Nearly two thirds (62.4%) of 
participants had primary infertility. There were no statistically 
significant differences in baseline factors, occupation, 
husband occupation, educational level, economic 
status, type of housing, infertility type, and infertility 
etiology between the three groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>The mean BDI score of participants was 22.35 &#x000b1; 8.70 
at baseline. Mean BDI scores at baseline and at the end 
of study for the three groups are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>. Paired 
t tests showed significant inter individual changes in BDI

P&#x0003c;0.002, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>). Depression symptoms decreased significantly 
in both PST and BUP groups from baseline 
to end of study. The intra-individual changes were not 
significant in control group (P=0.105).</p><p>Changes in depression level (pre to post treatment) 
showed that 79.1% of participants in the treatment 
groups(PST and BUP) improved from their baseline depression 
level, while 8.05% had a worse depression level, 
and 12.9% had no change. In the control group, 38.7% of 
participants improved from their baseline depression level, 
while 16.1% had a worse depression level, and 45.2% had 
no change. The improved depression levels were showed 
more in PST group compared to others groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig .2</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="T1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Distribution

at risk for depression symptoms and had a high average 
of depression scores. This finding suggests that women 
with infertility and SD are more likely to experience 
symptoms of depression. Previous studies by Pasha et 
al. (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>), Pakpour et al. (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) and Peyvandi et al. (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>) show 
similar results, where female SD put women with infertility 
at high risk for depression. Sexual problems are 
severely distressing experiences, and may be important 
factors in the development of depression (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Consistent 
with this, marital dissatisfaction is associated with 
an increase in severe depression (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>).</p><p>We found that BDI scores decreased significantly from 
baseline at the end of study in each treatment group (PST 
and BUP). In both treatment groups combined, more than 
two thirds of participants showed improvement in their 
depressive symptoms levels (pre to post treatment). The 
similar studies showed that both psychosocial and pharmaceutical 
therapeutic strategies, such as psychotherapy 
and antidepressants, are well established in the treatment 
of depression (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). A review of psychological interventions 
by Boivin (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) reported that psychotherapy decreased 
negative affect in infertile people. Psychotherapy 
or sex therapy had a beneficial effect on the management 
of psychological symptoms affecting sexual function in 
women (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p><p>Also bupropion is an effective antidepressant medication, 
which is used to treat remission of depressive 
disorder. The effectiveness of bupropion in improving 
depression found in clinical trials with the drug (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, 
<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Furthermore, this research indicated a statistically 
significant negative relationship between sexual function 
and depression symptoms at patients treated for 
sexual dysfunction. In line with finding, another studies 
found that higher scores of FSFI are correlated with 
lower depression scores (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). There was a negative correlation 
between depression with sexual function and 
marital satisfaction (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). It was associated with lower 
depression, higher marital satisfaction reverse antidepressant-
induced SD (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Therefore, it is important 
to note that the resolution of depression scores 
can be related to relieving sexual problem in depressed 
patients (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). This is because the SD and 
depression are interchangeable, so that the treatment of 
one will change the others. </p><p>After adjusting for baseline values, data showed 
a significant improvement in depression symptoms 
for women exposed to the psychosexual intervention 
compared with women in the BUP and control groups. 
Group PST was better than bupropion treatment in 
improving depression symptoms. PST was not only 
a reliable treatment approach to improving depression 
symptoms, but also it was superior to bupropion 
treatment to alleviate depression symptoms in women 
with infertility and SD. These results suggest that PST 
may be more effective compared with pharmacological 
therapy to treat depression symptoms in women with 
infertility and SD.</p><p>Consistent with this; study conducted by Faramarzi et 
al. (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) reported that group psychotherapy was superior 
to drug therapy in improving the well-being of women 
with infertility suffering from depression. In addition, 
they found that cognitive behavioral therapy was better 
to pharmacotherapy in relieving depression; depression 
symptoms were reduced to a greater extent than 
the control group. A review of literature suggests that 
counseling service is associated with lower depression, 
leading to higher life satisfaction compared to control 
group. Finally, the use of cognitive behavioral model 
can be effective in reducing frustration and depression, 
increasing skills, and improving the marital relationship 
and sexual satisfaction. Psychological model was 
an effective therapy for depression (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>).</p><p>Our findings showed that the decrease in the mean BDI 
score with BUP dosage of 150 mg per day was not statistically 
significant compared to the control group, although 
BUP group showed statistically significant improvement 
in depression symptom from beginning to end of research. 
Many trials showed that bupropion was efficacious in 
treatment MDD (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>).</p><p>It was found as an important antidepressant, and used to 
treat MDD (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). However, a few studies have observed 
no significant differences between bupropion and placebo 
groups on depression scores (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) and bupropion 150 
failed to demonstrate significant difference (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). It would 
be of great important to mention that low dose of bupropion 
was employed in subjects. Therefore, it seems that 
bupropion dosage of 150 mg once a day may have limited 
benefit for detecting difference between BUP and control 
groups in resolution of depression symptom. Furthermore, 
excluding the subjects with diagnosed MDD from 
this study may decrease the response rate to depression. 
Therefore, the different results of present research with 
others may relate to this model, especially in the infertility 
field. It should be noted that psychological placebo effects 
due to communication of the researcher with the patients 
in frequent assessments during the study should not be 
ignored. Further study need to distinguish factors leading 
to the lack of an effect.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Psychosocial therapy was a superior treatment compared 
to bupropion for alleviating depression symptoms 
in women with infertility and SD. Therefore, counseling 
services and social support to recognize and treat depression 
and SD are necessary to establish in fertility centers.</p><p>
There were a few limitations in this study. First, the data 
were collected from a small sample size of Iranian women 
with infertility; therefore, the findings cannot be generalized 
to all women with infertility or other populations and 
would require to be investigated in future research of a 
larger sample size. Another weakness of study was leak 
of follow-up. The strengths of this research include its use 
of a validated, self-reported Iranian version of the BDI. 
Also, for more effective treatment methods suggested that 
future studies consider the PST plus bupropion compared 
to each of them individually.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The present research was funded by Babol University
