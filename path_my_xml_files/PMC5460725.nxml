physiological conditions but also play a pivotal role in tissue catabolism when acutely
elevated as part of an acute stress response (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). In
contrast, chronic pathophysiological GC excess in Cushing syndrome is characterized by a
distinctive centripetal fat mass redistribution, in particular, visceral fat mass
accumulation, and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2, 3</xref>). The body fat mass distribution is an important
determinant of health, and abdominal fat mass accumulation represents a major risk factor
for cardiovascular disease (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). In contrast, a larger
thigh subcutaneous fat mass has been independently associated with favorable cardiovascular
and metabolic profiles (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), and the relative scarcity
of femoral fat might have important implications for cardiometabolic health (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6, 7</xref>). The femoral adipose tissue mass is determined
by the balance between fatty acid uptake and their release, lipolysis, with the latter
regulated <italic>in vivo</italic> in a depot-specific manner via selective adrenoceptor
action (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p><p>Acute hypercortisolemia results in an increase of whole body lipolysis
(<italic>i.e.,</italic> the release of nonesterified fatty acids [NEFAs] from adipose
tissue); however, the exact effects of GCs on depot-specific lipolysis remain unclear
(<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Murine <italic>in vitro</italic> models have
yielded conflicting results, with only some reporting induction of lipolysis by GCs in a
dose-dependent manner [reviewed by Lee <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>)]. In intact human adipocytes isolated from the abdominal subcutaneous
depot, cortisol treatment resulted in inhibition of basal and
<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-adrenergic&#x02013;mediated lipolysis (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). In contrast, lipolysis appeared unaffected by the synthetic GC
dexamethasone (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11, 12</xref>). Early <italic>in
vivo</italic> studies also showed that GCs inhibit sympathetic activity and adrenoceptor
function in humans (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13, 14</xref>), suggesting this
could affect lipolytic responses. However, femoral lipolysis, determined as glycerol
release using the microdialysis technique, has been found to either increase (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) or remain unchanged (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) in the presence of experimental GC excess.</p><p>The aim of our study was to examine lipolysis in response to acute GC excess, using an
integrative <italic>in vivo</italic> physiology approach. In particular, we sought to
investigate the depot-specific contribution of femoral adipose tissue to whole body
lipolysis during hypercortisolemia. Based on previous studies (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17, 18</xref>), we hypothesized that acute elevation of cortisol
concentrations would affect femoral adipose tissue blood flow (ATBF) and NEFA release, in
line with an acute catabolic response. Furthermore, we studied the femoral adipose tissue
postprandial glucose uptake and, in a separate study, abdominal adipose tissue fasting ATBF
and NEFA release as markers of depot-specific adipose tissue function <italic>in
vivo</italic>.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="s1"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2"><title>Subjects</title><p>Healthy male individuals with no medical condition and not receiving any drug therapy

normal liver and kidney function parameters and normal blood counts. No subject had
any relevant medical history, smoked tobacco, or took any regular medications that
could affect the study&#x02019;s outcome measures. All parts of the present study were
conducted at the National Institute for Health Research/Wellcome Trust Clinical
Research Facility of the University of Birmingham/Queen Elizabeth Hospital
Birmingham. The Solihull National Health System Research Ethics Committee approved
the present study (approval no. 12/WM/0327), and all subjects gave informed consent
in writing before participation.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Study design</title><sec id="s4"><title>Anthropometric measurements</title><p>Measurements were taken during the screening visit. The waist circumference was
measured midway between the lower margin of the last palpable rib and the top of
the iliac crest, and the hip circumference was measured at the level of the

visceral fat mass) were measured using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). The blood pressure and heart rate were
measured using a standard oscillometric blood pressure monitor with an upper arm

Institute for Health Research/Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Facility at 5
<sc>pm</sc>, and a cannula for infusion purposes was inserted into an
antecubital fossa vein [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1(a)</xref>]. At 6
<sc>pm</sc>, they were served a standardized calorie-controlled meal (vegetable
lasagna; energy, 2634 kJ; total nutritional content, 14.4 g fat, 93 g
carbohydrates, 25.2 g protein, 11.4 g fiber). They then fasted until study
completion the next day. At 7 <sc>pm</sc>, a constant infusion of either
hydrocortisone (0.2 mg/kg/h, total dose infused equivalent to the doses commonly
used in the setting of adrenal insufficiency and acute illness) or saline (control
study visit) was started and continued for 14 hours until study completion the
next day. The 2 study days were separated by &#x02265;2 weeks, and the
hydrocortisone and saline infusions were administered in a double-blind,
randomized fashion. At 10 <sc>pm</sc>, the lights were switched off for night
rest. At 8:00 <sc>am</sc> the next morning, catheters were placed into veins
draining the femoral (study 1) or abdominal (study 2) subcutaneous adipose tissue
(see later) (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20, 21</xref>). A further cannula
was inserted either retrogradely into a vein of the dorsal hand, which was then
placed in a hot box at 60&#x000b0;C to obtain arterialized blood samples (study 1),
or in a radial artery (study 2). For the ATBF measurement, <sup>133</sup>Xe was
injected into femoral (study 1) or abdominal (study 2) subcutaneous adipose tissue
(<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), and scintillation was measured
continuously using customized cesium detectors (GMS411 System; John Caunt
Scientific, Bury, UK). Subsequently, study participants were left to relax for 45
minutes to allow equilibration of <sup>133</sup>Xe. Before the start of blood
sampling, the blood pressure and heart rate were measured. After study completion,
all catheters were removed, and the subjects were given a full meal.</p><fig id="F1" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>(a) Study design and systemic metabolite concentrations. Healthy male

in the <inline-supplementary-material xlink:href="jc.2016-3600.sd1.docx" id="d35e407" content-type="local-data">Supplemental Methods</inline-supplementary-material> section. The mean of three
consecutive plasma glucose and insulin fasting measurements (time points, 0 to 30
minutes) was used for HOMA calculations. Metabolite uptake and release across
abdominal and femoral adipose tissue were calculated using the arteriovenous
difference technique (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). For NEFA and glycerol
release, the venoarterial concentration difference was multiplied by the ATBF for
each of the abdominal and femoral adipose tissue depots, respectively. For glucose
uptake, the arteriovenous concentration difference was multiplied by the ATBF. A
detailed description of all calculations is given in the
<inline-supplementary-material xlink:href="jc.2016-3600.sd1.docx" id="d35e413" content-type="local-data">Supplemental Methods</inline-supplementary-material> section. For study 1,
comparisons between control and hypercortisolemia were performed for each time point
(pairwise comparisons) or by comparing areas under the curve (AUCs). The AUC was also
used for comparisons between the fasting and postprandial states. The AUC was
calculated using the trapezoid rule and is presented as a time-averaged value (AUC
divided by the relevant time period). For study 2, the mean of three fasting
measurements (time points, 0 to 30 minutes) was used for all calculations and
comparisons. To calculate the ratios and re-esterification rates in studies 1 and 2,
the mean of three measurements (time points, 0 to 30 minutes) was used to calculate
the fasting data. For the femoral adipose tissue, the mean of time points 200 to 240
minutes was used for the postprandial calculations. The data distribution was tested
for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test, and parametric or nonparametric tests were
used, as indicated. Data were analyzed using IBM Statistics for Windows, version 21
(Armonk, NY), and GraphPad Prism for Windows, version 6.05 (San Diego, CA).

the length of exposure (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). In relation to their
effect on <italic>in vivo</italic> fatty acid metabolism, general agreement has been
reached that hypercortisolemia increases the plasma NEFA concentrations (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15, 17, 25, 26</xref>). However, it remains
unresolved which adipose tissue depots contribute to this increase, and whether
differential contribution of specific adipose tissue depots results in the phenotypic
fat mass distribution changes observed with chronic GC excess. The exact source of NEFA
is still debated, with some studies reporting an increase in abdominal lipolysis (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15, 27</xref>), and others finding a reduction (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Given the previously reported differences in
the depot-specific regulation of lipolysis (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), we
studied the effects of acute hypercortisolemia on the femoral and abdominal adipose
tissue depot using an integrative <italic>in vivo</italic> physiology approach. We found
that during hypercortisolemia, the abdominal net NEFA output increased, and femoral NEFA
release remained stable, despite a striking increase in femoral ATBF. We have described
the potential effects of the increased ATBF on local NEFA handling during
hypercortisolemia and suggest that other depots (<italic>e.g.,</italic> visceral adipose
tissue) might play a role in systemic NEFA concentration increases, in addition to the
contribution of abdominal NEFA release.</p><p>Similar to previous studies (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15, 17, 25,
26</xref>), we found a marked increase of systemic NEFA concentrations in the fasting
state during GC infusion. Using isotope tracers, it has been shown that the palmitate
and glycerol rates of appearance increase with hydrocortisone, suggesting induction of
lipolysis at the systemic level (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15, 17</xref>).
Subcutaneous adipose tissue is the major source of NEFA, driven by the activity of
adipocyte-specific lipases, most notably adipose tissue triglyceride lipase and
hormone-sensitive lipase (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). The NEFA rate of
appearance in the systemic circulation is determined by the ATBF and the net lipolytic
rate of the individual adipose tissue depots (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20,
29</xref>). We studied these parameters to measure the individual contribution of the
femoral and abdominal depots to the increased systemic NEFA concentrations in
hypercortisolemia, hypothesizing that femoral adipose tissue is a net contributor.</p><p>We found a steady increase in femoral ATBF in fasting conditions during GC infusion,
with a further major increase in the postprandial phase. This is in stark contrast to
the previously reported finding of a mostly unresponsive femoral ATBF (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). In contrast to our hypothesis, we found no
differences in the femoral lipolytic rate during hydrocortisone infusion. Our data
suggest a strong inhibition of lipolysis at the actual adipocyte level, because the net
femoral lipolytic rate did not change after GC infusion, despite the marked local ATBF
increase. We found a moderate increase in basal abdominal ATBF and a small net increase
in fasting abdominal NEFA release during hypercortisolemia.</p><p>We did not measure the triglyceride concentrations, because we were not expecting any
changes owing to the nature of the experimental meal stimulus (pure glucose); therefore,
we could not calculate the exact transcapillary flux of fatty acids (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Hence, the exact effects of GC excess on
postprandial fatty acid trafficking would need to be studied in future experiments,
ideally involving a lipid-containing meal.</p><p>ATBF is an important determinant of adipose tissue function, because it determines the
influx and efflux of metabolites, systemic hormones, and adipokines (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Basal ATBF is determined largely by nitric
oxide, and the postprandial increase is mediated by <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-adrenergic
stimulation (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Femoral ATBF is much less
responsive to adrenergic stimulation owing to the prevailing inhibitory
<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>2-adrenoceptor activity, underlining the concept of a
depot-specific regulation (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Vascular smooth
muscle cell tone and endothelial nitric oxide synthesis are known to be affected by GC
[reviewed by Yhang and Zhang (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>)]. Although GCs
inhibit endothelial nitric oxide synthase, they also inhibit sympathetic nerve outflow
in humans (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13, 14</xref>). In line with the latter,
studies of humans have indicated that the resting systemic catecholamine rate of
appearance does not change during hydrocortisone infusion and the effects are mediated
at the level of end-organ responsiveness (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>).
However, GC-mediated inhibition of the prevailing
<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>2-adrenoceptor signal in femoral adipose tissue could be a
possible mechanism for the depot-specific effect on femoral ATBF observed in our
studies.</p><p>In our studies of healthy volunteers, hydrocortisone infusion resulted in a substantial
plasma cortisol increase, with abolition of the diurnal cortisol variation.
Hypercortisolemia is known to induce insulin resistance (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>) by affecting postreceptor insulin signaling and decreasing glucose
clearance (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36, 37</xref>). Our systemic metabolite
data suggest that we were able to replicate the effects of GC excess, reflected by our
findings of increased basal glucose and insulin and increased postprandial glucose
concentrations. C-peptide secretion was preserved during hypercortisolemia, suggesting
pancreatic <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-cell function was maintained. In line with this,
the HOMA indexes showed an increase in insulin resistance with unaltered
<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-cell function. Considering the high HOMA insulin
sensitivity values found during control conditions, these data suggest that our study
population consisted of very insulin-sensitive individuals who were rendered insulin
resistant by the hydrocortisone infusion.</p><p>Previous findings have suggested the GC effects on insulin sensitivity are tissue
specific, such that they might induce insulin resistance in muscle but increase insulin
sensitivity in subcutaneous adipose tissue <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Muscle is the main site of postprandial glucose
uptake, and adipose tissue accounts only for a small proportion of glucose clearance
(<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). We found that adipose tissue-specific
glucose uptake rates were not affected by GC-induced whole body insulin resistance,
supporting an adipose tissue-specific insulin-sensitizing GC effect. Furthermore,
insulin is the major inhibitor of adipose tissue lipolysis (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). In our study, glucose-mediated suppression of lipolysis was not
affected by hydrocortisone, underlining the exquisite ability of insulin to maximally
suppress hormone-sensitive lipase activity and providing further support that GCs do not
induce adipose tissue insulin resistance (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>).</p><p>To evaluate the nonmetabolic effects of the induced hypercortisolemia, we measured the
IL-6 concentrations as one of the main inflammatory cytokines (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). The plasma concentrations of IL-6 increase as part of the acute
inflammatory response pathway, and acute hydrocortisone administration is known to
reduce IL-6 concentrations, although it appears that this effect only becomes apparent
after a few days (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Therefore, and because our
study participants were healthy volunteers without any pathophysiological elevations in
IL-6 concentrations, we did not see any effects of the hydrocortisone infusion on the
systemic IL-6 concentrations. Previously, it has been shown that abdominal adipose
tissue is a net producer of IL-6, and femoral adipose tissue is not (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Our results appear to be in line with this,
although they did not reach statistical significance, most likely owing to the small
sample size.</p><p>A particular strength of our study was the integrative <italic>in vivo</italic>
physiology approach chosen. We used arteriovenous differences and ATBF measurements for
the assessment of NEFA release, the direct product of lipolysis, in response to GC
excess under near-normal conditions. Most previous studies investigating adipose tissue
depot-specific GC effects on lipolysis used the microdialysis technique, which relies on
the measurement of interstitial glycerol concentrations as an indirect index of
lipolysis (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Only a few studies to date have
included femoral adipose tissue responses (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15,
16, 27</xref>). Djurhuus <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15, 27</xref>) found an increase in abdominal and femoral adipose tissue
interstitial glycerol after short-term (6-hour) hydrocortisone infusion. When assessing
metabolite fluxes, it is important to consider the depot-specific changes in blood flow.
We showed that the marked femoral-specific ATBF effect in response to hypercortisolemia
was augmented in the postprandial phase, mostly in response to insulin. Although insulin
does not exert direct ATBF effects, it is known to be in important mediator (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). Also, in contrast to previous studies using
acute GC excess as an experimental approach (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15,
27</xref>), we saw a small, but important, increase in the basal plasma insulin
concentrations. In previous studies, femoral ATBF was not measured; instead, abdominal
ATBF was used as a basis for calculating femoral interstitial glycerol release (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15, 16, 27</xref>). In these studies, abdominal
ATBF did not change in response to hypercortisolemia. Because of the previously unknown
marked femoral-specific ATBF effects we have described, it is possible that previous
microdialysis studies overestimated femoral glycerol appearance. Our abdominal depot
findings are in contrast to previous results from the only study using the same
experimental approach we used. They found a substantial decrease in abdominal NEFA
efflux during hydrocortisone infusion (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). This
difference in findings could have resulted from the slightly higher plasma cortisol
concentrations achieved in our study, resulting in an overall increased systemic fatty
acid turnover, or other factors intrinsic to our study population such as differences in
local 11<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-HSD1 activity or ATBF responses.</p><p>Our study had some limitations by design, including the small size of our sample and
that conclusions can be drawn only about men. The hydrocortisone infusion was calculated
to provide approximately 300 mg/24 hours, a dose regularly used in clinical practice.
This resulted in supraphysiological plasma cortisol concentrations, approximately double
that found in acute stress situations (<italic>e.g.,</italic> sepsis) (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). To the best of our knowledge, no reported
studies have examined the exact dose-dependent metabolic response in acute
hypercortisolemia <italic>in vivo.</italic> Although acute dose-dependent GC effects
cannot be excluded, it has been generally accepted that the tissue responses are more
dependent on GR expression and local GC activity modulation by the
11<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-HSD enzymes than absolute plasma concentrations (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). In support of this, our systemic metabolite
data are comparable with those from studies that achieved more physiological
hypercortisolemia (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). The acute nature of the
hypercortisolemia limits the conclusions we can draw regarding depot-specific lipolysis
in conditions of chronic GC excess (<italic>i.e.,</italic> Cushing syndrome). However,
the finding of isolated fasting and postprandial ATBF induction in the femoral adipose
tissue suggests an early signal of GC induced changes in this depot. Our calculations
were performed based on the measurement of nonlabeled NEFA and glycerol only. Also,
because our study protocol did not include any meal containing lipids, exact modeling of
depot-specific fatty acid trafficking, in particular, triglyceride metabolism in the
postprandial state, was not possible. Also, the metabolic flux calculations were based
on the assumption of steady state; however, the stark blood flow effects observed in our
study introduced a nonsteady state situation, which could have affected our results.
Finally, a direct comparison of the depot-specific contribution to systemic lipolysis
between femoral and abdominal adipose tissue was not feasible, because the measurements
were not paired. However, clear differential responses appear to exist between the two
depots in hypercortisolemia.</p><p>In conclusion, we have provided evidence that acute hypercortisolemia increases plasma
NEFA and exerts selective effects on adipose tissue lipolysis and ATBF, supporting the
concept of tissue- and depot-specific GC actions <italic>in vivo</italic>. Femoral
adipose tissue does not appear to be a net contributor of NEFA in hypercortisolemia;
however, marked changes in femoral ATBF could herald effects on femoral fatty acid
trafficking that become evident only with chronic hypercortisolemia. The exact source of
the excess systemic NEFA in hypercortisolemia remains elusive, but it can be speculated
that it might derive from the visceral adipose tissue depot. The increase in abdominal
lipolysis we observed appears insufficient to explain the marked increase in plasma NEFA
during hydrocortisone infusion. Future studies are needed to address whether altered
