Our study indicated vonoprazan was potent for the management of ESD ulcers although lansoprazole was also sufficient and cost-effective.</p><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) for early gastric cancer (EGC) is a significantly less invasive procedure compared with gastrectomy and is a common procedure. The main advantage of ESD is enabling en-bloc resection of the lesion. Consequently, ESD results in precise histopathological assessment and a low local recurrence rate[<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Since en-bloc resection of large lesions is possible with ESD, the iatrogenic ulcers tend to be large and the complications of ESD, including bleeding and perforation, are more frequent than those of endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR)[<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Therefore, the management of ESD-induced ulcers is important to prevent adverse events such as delayed bleeding or perforation.</p><p>Acid inhibitors such as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and H2-blockers have been used for the treatment of acid related diseases, including ESD-induced ulcers. PPIs are mainly used for the treatment of ESD-induced ulcers owing to their superiority to H2 blockers[<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Although PPIs have been useful for the management of ESD-induced ulcers, they have several limitations including short plasma half-life, slow onset of effectiveness, and the problem of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19 polymorphism[<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>-<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>The potassium-competitive acid blocker (P-CAB) is a new class of gastric acid suppressant that inhibits gastric H<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase in a K<sup>+</sup>-competitive and reversible manner[<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Vonoprazan was the first orally bioavailable P-CAB and it was approved in Japan in 2014 for the treatment and prevention of acid-related diseases[<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Vonoprazan exhibits rapid, profound, and sustained suppression of gastric acid secretions and is not affected by CYP2C19 polymorphism[<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. It has been reported that the acid-inhibitory effect of vonoprazan is more potent than that of PPIs[<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], resulting in greater effectiveness for acid-related diseases such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) or <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> (<italic>H. pylori</italic>) eradication. Therefore, vonoprazan could be more effective for the management of ESD-induced ulcers compared to PPIs, which are now the gold standard for the management of ESD-induced ulcers. To the best of our knowledge, there have been no reports comparing the healing effect of vonoprazan and PPIs on ESD-induced ulcers. We conducted a prospective randomized controlled study to compare the healing effect of P-CAB (vonoprazan) and PPI (lansoprazole) on ESD-induced ulcers. The primary aim was to evaluate the shrinking rate of ESD-induced ulcers and the secondary aim was to evaluate the preventive effect of vonoprazan on delayed bleeding.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Patients</title><p>Thirty consecutive patients, who underwent ESD for EGC between August 2015 and March 2016 at Sado General Hospital, were enrolled in this study. Their medical records were checked to verify whether they were administered antiplatelet agents, anticoagulants, and steroids. <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection status was confirmed by urease test, histopathology, serum antibody, stool antigen, or urinary antibody. The existence of atrophic gastritis was investigated with the endoscopic images at ESD and classified as closed or open type according to the Kimura-Takemoto classification[<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Before ESD, a chest and abdominal computed tomography scan was performed on all patients. If metastasis or advanced cancer in other organs was detected, the patient was not included in this study. Furthermore, patients who had undergone gastric surgery before ESD were not included in this study. Those who needed any additional anticancer therapy (surgery and/or chemotherapy) after ESD were excluded. Written informed consent was obtained from the patients before enrollment. The study protocol was approved by the Sado General Hospital Institutional Ethics Committee and carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. This study was enlisted in UMIN clinical Trials Registry (UMIN000022006).</p></sec><sec><title>Study protocol</title><p>Patients were prospectively and randomly assigned into either the vonoprazan or the lansoprazole group using permuted block randomization (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The treatment protocol is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>. Patients were admitted a day before ESD. From the day of ESD, intravenous infusion of PPI (lansoprazole 30 mg) was administered to all patients for 2 d. Two days after ESD, oral intake was initiated and patients in the vonoprazan group were administered vonoprazan (20 mg/d) and patients in the lansoprazole group were administered lansoprazole (30 mg/d) until 28 d after ESD. If the patients were already being administered antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants, these medicines were stopped before ESD and resumed 2 d after ESD. Eight days after the ESD, all patients underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) to evaluate the shrinking rate of ESD ulcers. After EGD on day 8, patients were discharged. Twenty-eight days after ESD, patients underwent follow-up EGD and the shrinking rate of the ulcers on day 28 was evaluated.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Flow chart of the participants in the study. Thirty patients were enrolled and four of them were excluded because they needed additional surgery or violated the protocol. Finally, 14 patients in the vonoprazan group and 12 patients in the lansoprazole group were included in the analysis.

An electrosurgical current was applied using a standard electrosurgical generator (ICC 200; ERBE, T&#x000fc;bingen, Germany). The margin of the lesion was circumferentially dotted using a DualKnife in the forced coagulation mode (30 W). After the application of a 10% glycerin solution containing 0.005 mg/mL of epinephrine into the submucosal layer, a mucosal incision was made using a DualKnife in the endo-cut mode (60 W). Then, the submucosal layer was dissected with a HookKnife in the forced coagulation mode (60 W). Hemostatic forceps (Coagrasper; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) were used to stop or prevent bleeding in the soft coagulation mode (80 W).</p></sec><sec><title>Evaluation of ESD results</title><p>En bloc resection rate, location of the tumors, procedure time, submucosal fibrosis, and histopathology of the tumor were investigated and compared between the two groups. Furthermore, we evaluated the area of ESD ulcer as follows: Endoscopic images were taken just after ESD, on day 8, and on day 28, and image processing software (ImageJ) was used to calculate the area of ESD ulcers (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Since this software calculated the area as pixels, measuring forceps were put on the ulcer base and used for the scale, and the area of ESD-induced ulcers was expressed in cubic millimeter. The shrinking rate on day 8 was defined as [1 - (the area of ESD-induced ulcer on day 8)/(the area of ESD-induced ulcer just after ESD)] &#x000d7; 100 (%) and the shrinking rate on day 28 was defined as [1 - (the area of ESD-induced ulcer on day 28)/(the area of ESD-induced ulcer just after ESD)] &#x000d7; 100 (%). Delayed ulcer healing was declared when the shrinking rate on day 28 was less than 90%. The shrinking rates on days 8 and 28 and the frequency of delayed ulcer healing were compared between the 2 groups. The frequency of delayed bleeding was also investigated and compared between the two groups.</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>A representative case in the lansoprazole group.

This suggests that lansoprazole was sufficient for the management of ESD ulcers although vonoprazan is theoretically more potent with regard to acid suppression.</p><p>PPIs have been widely used for the treatment of acid-related diseases, including ESD ulcers, and the therapeutic effect of PPIs has been satisfactory. However, there are some inadequacies that should be addressed. First, PPIs have a relatively short plasma half-life (60-90 min)[<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Therefore, taking PPIs twice a day could be insufficient for inhibiting gastric acid at night. Second, PPIs are prodrugs and are activated under acid-secretion conditions. Hence, the effect of PPIs could be affected by food intake[<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Third, since the onset of PPI effect is slow and it takes time to achieve maximum efficacy, rapid effects cannot be achieved[<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. These limitations could affect the clinical course after ESD. Furthermore, the problem of CYP 2C19 polymorphism could also inhibit the effectiveness of PPIs. With regard to CYP2C19 polymorphism, there are inter-ethnic differences regarding the frequency of extensive and poor metabolizers. In the Japanese population, the frequency of poor metabolizers is reported to be 18.0%-22.5%[<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Although the frequency of poor metabolizers is relatively high in Japan compared to that in Western countries, the majority of the population still consists of extensive metabolizers. It has been reported that plasma PPI concentrations and intragastric pH are lower in extensive metabolizers compared with those in poor metabolizers, resulting in poor results of acid-suppression therapies in patients with GERD or <italic>H. pylori</italic> eradication[<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Therefore, PPIs could be insufficient for the management of ESD ulcers, especially in extensive metabolizers.</p><p>On the other hand, vonoprazan, which is a novel acid inhibitor and classified as a P-CAB, has a long-lasting and rapid effect on gastric acid inhibition, and it is not affected by the acid secretory state, mealtime, or CYP2C19 polymorphism[<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. It has been reported that vonoprazan is more potent regarding acid inhibition and more efficient for acid-related diseases[<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Vonoprazan could theoretically be more potent for the management of ESD ulcers. However, in our study, vonoprazan did not show superiority to lansoprazole with regard to ulcer healing after ESD. It has been reported that EMR ulcers heal faster than peptic ulcers because of high blood flow at the margin of EMR ulcers[<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>-<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The mechanism of ESD ulcers is similar to that of EMR ulcers and even large ESD ulcers heal within 8 wk after treatment with normal doses of PPIs[<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In this study, the area of the ESD ulcers reduced to less than 10% on day 28 in most of the cases in both groups, faster than peptic ulcer healing. Therefore, we concluded that vonoprazan was potent and lansoprazole was also effective for healing ESD ulcers. With regard to medical expenses, vonoprazan (20 mg daily) and lansoprazole (30 mg daily) cost 240 JPY (almost $2.4) and 140 JPY (almost $1.4), respectively. In our hospital, we usually use acid suppression medicines for at least 2 mo on the basis of a previous study[<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and the difference in the medical expenses between treatment with vonoprazan and lansoprazole for each patient is up to 5600 JPY (almost $56). Therefore, lansoprazole is more cost-effective although both of them are valid for the management of ESD ulcers.</p><p>Our secondary aim was the evaluation of the preventive effect of vonoprazan on delayed bleeding compared to lansoprazole. Clinically, the prevention of delayed bleeding is important after ESD, and the frequency of delayed bleeding has been reported to be approximately 5%[<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>-<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Intragastric pH is an important factor for the coagulation system and platelet aggregation, and the activity of fibrinolysis is impaired at pH values above 6[<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The most delayed bleeding occurs within the first 24 to 48 h[<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Therefore, vonoprazan is theoretically superior for the prevention of delayed bleeding owing to its sustained, rapid, and more potent effect on acid suppression[<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In our study, the delayed bleeding rate was 0% in both groups although our sample size was too small for the precise evaluation of the preventive effect on delayed bleeding. There are several reasons for this result. First, the acid suppression of both vonoprazan and lansoprazole was potent enough to prevent delayed bleeding; second, we carefully coagulated thick blood vessels that might bleed afterward. It has been reported that patients with large lesions or those being administered antithrombotic drugs have a high risk for delayed bleeding or perforation[<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>-<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. PPIs are occasionally not adequate to prevent complications in such patients. Vonoprazan is expected to reduce the incident rates of delayed bleeding because of its potent acid suppression.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report comparing the healing effects of vonoprazan and lansoprazole on ESD ulcers. However, there are some limitations of this study. First, the sample size was not large enough to obtain conclusive results. However, both vonoprazan and lansoprazole seemed potent enough for the management of ESD ulcers; second, our protocol might not be appropriate because we used intravenous lansoprazole for both groups in the first 2 day after ESD, resulting in underestimation of the healing and preventive effect of vonoprazan; third, we did not investigate the polymorphism of CYP2C19 in this study. This is important for making definitive conclusions. In extensive metabolizers, vonoprazan might prove to be superior to PPIs; fourth, anticoagulant, antiplatelet agent, and steroid users should have been removed from the study to prevent their associated complications from affecting the comparison. However, they were included in the present study.</p><p>In summary, our study indicated vonoprazan was potent for the management of ESD ulcers although lansoprazole was also sufficient and cost-effective. Since vonoprazan theoretically has more potent acid-suppression and is not affected by CYP2C19 polymorphism, it could be more effective in the high risk groups or extensive metabolizers. A further prospective study with these patients is needed to make a definitive conclusion.</p></sec><sec><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>We would like to thank Editage (<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.editage.jp">http://www.editage.jp</uri>) for English language editing.</p></sec><sec><title>COMMENTS</title><sec><title>Background</title><p>Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) have been used for the management of ulcers induced by endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD). Vonoprazan, an orally bioavailable potassium-competitive acid blocker, is a new class of gastric acid suppressant that inhibits gastric H<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase in a K<sup>+</sup>-competitive and reversible manner. It was approved in Japan in 2014 for the treatment and prevention of acid-related diseases including ESD-induced ulcers. The aim of this study was to compare the healing effects of vonoprazan and lansoprazole on ESD-induced ulcers.</p></sec><sec><title>Research frontiers</title><p>Vonoprazan exhibits rapid, profound, and sustained suppression of gastric acid secretions and is not affected by CYP2C19 polymorphism. It has been reported that the acid-inhibitory effect of vonoprazan is more potent than that of PPIs, resulting in greater effectiveness for acid-related diseases such as gastroesophageal reflux disease or <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> eradication. Therefore, vonoprazan could be more effective for the management of ESD-induced ulcers compared to PPIs.
