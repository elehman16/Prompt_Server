stretching and shoulder strengthening with an elastic band on balance and maximal shoulder
muscle strength in young adults with rounded shoulder posture. [Subjects and Methods]
Nineteen subjects with rounded shoulder posture were randomly divided into 2 groups: a
shoulder stabilization exercise group and a stretching exercise group. The groups
performed each exercise for 40 minutes, 3 times a week, for 4 weeks. Static balance (eyes
open and closed), dynamic balance (the limits of stability in 4 directions) and shoulder
muscle strength in 5 directions were measure before and after the exercises. [Results] The
stretching exercise demonstrated a significant difference between the pre- and
post-exercise in the static balance with eyes closed and extension and horizontal
abduction strength while the stabilization exercise demonstrated significant difference in
the left and right directions between the pre- and post-exercise of the dynamic balance
and flexion strength. The stabilization exercise demonstrated significant differences
shown in the flexion between the pre- and post-test. [Conclusion] The shoulder
stabilization and stretching exercises improved the static balance, dynamic balance, and
muscle strength.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Balance</kwd><kwd>Round shoulder posture</kwd><kwd>Stabilization exercise</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The function and stability of many joints that make up the shoulder joint are crucial to
daily life<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Having the greatest range of
movement out of all the joints in the human body, the complicated nature and wide range of
mobility of the shoulder makes this joint vulnerable to injury of the bone, muscle, tendon,
ligament, and bursa from excessive movement<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. In modern society, musculoskeletal
abnormality and pain are increasing due to repetitive work and bad work posture.</p><p>The rounded shoulder posture (RSP) appears to be one of the most common structural
anomalies of the shoulder complex and involves the increased anterior tilt of the cervical
vertebra and the posterior tilt of the upper thoracic vertebra, which causes the shoulder to
protrude, turn downwards, and tilt anteriorly<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Exercise impairment syndrome, which results from RSP, causes pain in certain areas,
increases or decreases the joint&#x02019;s range of motion, and encourages movements to be made in
the easiest direction, even if they are outside of the normal range, which applies stress to
certain areas or causes muscle atrophy due to the compensatory movement<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Failure of the head alignment with longitudinal axis<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup> can lead to further malaligments such as
rounded shoulders and thoracic kyphosis<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>
for compensation<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Forward head posture, RSP, and increased thoracic kyphosis could
be in any combination<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. When the thoracic
kyphosis is increased, anterior longitudinal ligament and upper abdominal muscles are
shortened and the anterior part of vertebral bodies is compressed, leading to increases in
intradiscal pressures<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. This condition could cause poor respiratory function<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>
and poor balance<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Balance involves maintaining the center of gravity within the
supporting surface, and it requires muscle strength and activity<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Pain that evolves from structural change affects joint
sensory, influencing abnormalities in the proprioceptive senses and postural balance<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Posture is defined by the relative positioning of the body parts within a space<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>,
and it is an essential element of normal balance<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,
<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>One of the various causes of RSP is the shortening of the pectoralis minor<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. The pectoralis minor originates from the
three to five ribs near the sternocostal junction and inserts into the coracoid process of
the scapula. The muscle elongates during the extension of the arm and aids in the upward
rotation, external rotation, and posterior tilting of the scapula<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. The pectoralis minor shortens due to adaptation and
through the restriction of the full scapular motion, exhibiting less total excursion,
relative to the longer muscles<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. The treatment of a protracted shoulder commonly involves the
strengthening of the rotator cuff and scapular stabilizers, as well as the stretching of the
anterior musculature, such as the pectoralis minor<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Shoulder stabilization exercises are the most widely used form of treatment to correct
RSP<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. These exercises are designed to
fix the shoulder to the chest cavity in a neutral position through interaction of the
muscles that construct the shoulder. The interaction of the muscles around the shoulder
joint, which connects the upper extremities to the torso<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup>, allows the shoulder bones to be situated between ribs two through
seven<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><sup>)</sup>. Stabilization exercises include an elastic band exercises and
stretching exercises are performed in cases in which there is a shortening of the muscles,
and they are effective in repositioning the shoulder and lengthening the pectoralis
minor<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref><sup>)</sup>. Elastic band exercises are performed when
there is muscular weakness, and they are effective in enhancing the function of postural
control<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref><sup>)</sup>. In previous studies, it was
reported that elastic band exercises were effective in improving shoulder strength,
endurance, flexibility, and range of motion in patients who had suffered shoulder
injuries<xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>If improper posture is sustained for a prolonged period, it may cause upper crossed
syndrome, simultaneously weakening the rhomboid, serratus anterior, and lower trapezius
muscles, which are all deep, cervical flexors. Furthermore, the pectoralis major, pectoralis
minor, and upper trapezius muscles may shorten; due to muscular shortening and weakening,
pain may result in the head, temporo-mandibular joint, cervical vertebra, thoracic vertebra,
shoulder, and arm<xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref><sup>)</sup>. There are many studies that have investigated the structural
deformation of the upper extremities, including abnormalities such as RSP and forward head
posture, and many of these studies comparatively analyze the individual effects of each
exercise or pain. Also, there are more studies pertaining to the balance of the lower limbs
than to the upper limbs. The purpose of this study was to investigate the combined effect of
stretching exercises on the shortened pectoralis major and stabilization exercises utilizing
an elastic band on the balance and maximal shoulder muscle strength of the upper trapezius,
pectoralis major, and posterior deltoid muscles in individuals with RSP.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Originally, the subjects of this study were 20 students with RSP, currently enrolled in &#x0201c;N&#x0201d;

The subjects were confirmed to have RSP through an examination in which they
were instructed to lie supine, resulting in a measurement that exceeded 2.5&#x02005;cm between the
table&#x02019;s surface and their shoulder peaks<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref><sup>)</sup>. Before participating in this study, the
subjects were thoroughly briefed on the nature of the study and were confirmed to have fully
understood all aspects of the study. In addition, a voluntary written consent was obtained
from each subject. Individuals who, in the past year, had received medical attention for
their neck, shoulder, or lower back, suffered from a structural disorder related to the
spine, had any neurological deficits, osteoarthritis, or rheumatoid arthritis, and who had
performed any muscle strengthening exercises for the neck, shoulder, or arm in the last six
months were excluded from this study.</p><p>In order to identify the general characteristics of the subjects, a body composition
analyzer (InBody 720, Biospace Co., Ltd., Seoul, Republic of Korea) was used. In order to
measure the subjects&#x02019; shoulder height, the standard type of vernier calipers (Vernier
calipers, Coms, China) were used. In addition, a computerized balance platform (BT4, HUR
Labs Oy, Tampere, Finland) was used. In order to measure isometric strength, a functional
rehab system (PRIMUS RS, BTE Tech., Hanover, MD, USA) was used. The TheraBand colored blue
(HYSNAL Synthetic Rubber Sheeting, Hygenic, Akron, Ohio, USA) were used for shoulder
stabilization exercise.</p><p>Prior to the study, in order to confirm the presence of RSP, the subjects&#x02019; shoulder height
was measured. The subjects were asked to lie down in a supine position, after which the
distance between the table surface and the posterior surface of their shoulder peak was
measured. The standard, vernier caliper tool used had 1&#x02005;mm increments, with 20 total
increments and the smallest possible measurement being 1/20&#x02005;mm. For the evaluation of RSP
with or without symptoms, and solely based on shoulder placement, this device has a high
degree of reliability (ICC<sub>3, 1</sub>= 0.88&#x02013;0.93)<xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref><sup>)</sup>. Both pre- and
post-exercise, the data was collected three times, and the average was calculated. The same
examiner performed all the evaluations.</p><p>The subjects were randomly divided into two groups, the shoulder stabilization exercise
group and the stretching exercise only group, with 10 subjects in each group. Both groups
performed their respective exercises 3 times a week, with each session lasting 40 minutes,
for a total of 4 weeks. Each exercise program consisted of a 5-minute warm-up exercise, a

With respect to the stabilization exercise group, the warm-up and concluding
exercises consisted of stretching, and the main exercise consisted of 15 minutes of shoulder
strengthening exercises and 15 minutes of shoulder stretching exercises on pectoralis minor
muscle. With respect to the stretching only group, all aspects of the exercise program
consisted of stretching exercises<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
main exercise was repeated 10 times in a set of 10 seconds and the rest time was 2-minutes
between the sets<xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The one-leg stance test, with eyes both open and closed, was used to measure the subjects&#x02019;
static balance. The subjects were barefoot and stood on one leg on the computerized balance
platform<xref rid="r42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref><sup>)</sup> for 30 seconds<xref rid="r43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref><sup>)</sup>. During the measurement, the subjects were
instructed to flex their lifted leg 30&#x000b0; and to maintain their stability as much as
possible<xref rid="r44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref><sup>)</sup>. The measured static balance
parameter was C90 area; area (mm<sup>2</sup>) of the smallest ellipse containing 90% of the
center of pressure point<xref rid="r45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref><sup>)</sup>. In order to
measure the subjects&#x02019; dynamic balance, the limits of stability (LOS) was used. The subjects
were instructed to stay aligned with the primary axis of motion and to use their ankle joint
in order to keep their body within the straight line, without moving their feet. Also, the
subjects were instructed to shift their body weight as quickly and directly as possible,
following the appearance of the target on the monitor. The direction of each target was
randomly displayed once for a total of eight seconds<xref rid="r46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref><sup>)</sup>. The target placement took into consideration the conversion of the
angular motion of leaning toward the linear movement of the center of gravity that appeared
on the screen<xref rid="r47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref><sup>)</sup>. The measured directions
included forward, backward, left, and right.</p><p>A functional rehab system was used in order to measure the subjects&#x02019; shoulder flexion,
extension, abduction, horizontal abduction, and horizontal adduction strength. The
horizontal abduction and horizontal adduction strength was measured with the humerus in an
adducted state<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. During the measurement
process, in order to ensure the exertion of the subjects&#x02019; maximal muscle strength, verbal
encouragement was given to them.</p><p>The SPSS Version 20.0 for Windows was used to complete the statistical analysis of the data
collected in this study. In order to confirm normal distribution, the Kolmogorov&#x02013;Smirnov
test was used. In addition, Levene&#x02019;s F-test was used in order to verify homogeneity. In
order to compare the change in balance and maximal shoulder muscle strength between the
groups, an independent t-test was conducted. In order to compare the change in balance and
maximal shoulder muscle strength within each group, a paired t-test was conducted. The
statistical significance was set as &#x003b1;=0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Comparison of balance between the groups showed no significant changes within all the

combined shoulder strengthening and shoulder stretching exercises for young adults with RSP
in order to observe the effects of shoulder stabilization exercises on balance and muscle
strength.</p><p>Upon comparison of the change in balance between the two groups, there appeared no
significant differences. Regarding the internal comparison of balance within the shoulder
stabilization exercise group, a significant increase in the left and right directions of the
LOS was observed. In the stretching exercise group, the C90 area with the eyes closed was
significantly reduced, and the forward direction of the LOS increased significantly. In a
previous study, cervical changes such as forward head posture might be associated with
changes in balance, the study found that there was a negative relationship between a forward
head posture and a more anterior center of gravity had balance scores<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. The young participants with RSP performed scapular
posterior tilt exercise, pectoralis minor stretching, and shoulder brace. The study
concluded that pectoralis minor stretching exercise and a shoulder brace might help correct
RSP and restore the pectoralis minor length<xref rid="r48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref><sup>)</sup>. The adolescents with forward head and protracted shoulder posture
were instructed to perform resistance and stretching exercises for 16 weeks. The results of
this study showed that, in the intervention group, the subjects&#x02019; cervical and shoulder
angles increased significantly. It was reported that the shoulder angle was often involved
with protraction, anterior tilting, and the internal rotation of the scapula, as well as
tightness of the pectoralis minor muscle<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. The shortening of the pectoralis minor has similar altered
scapular kinematics, often resulting in subacromial impingement. This association may
enhance scapular kinematics through the stretching of the pectoralis minor, and it may also
aid the maintenance of shoulder impingement<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. In a study that included individuals both with and without
shoulder pain, a 6-week pectoralis minor stretching protocol was conducted, and, for the
group experiencing shoulder pain, it was reported that the function of their upper limbs
increased significantly. For the healthy group, the scapular anterior tilt at 90&#x000b0; of flexion
also increased significantly. The length of the pectoralis minor for both groups did not
demonstrate any significant changes<xref rid="r49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref><sup>)</sup>. A
previous study reported that there is a significant decrease in RSP through the application
of pectoralis minor stretching exercises and scapular, posterior tilting exercises for
individuals with RSP<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. In swimming
athletes with forward shoulder posture, a 6-week stretching and strengthening exercise
program group, using the elastic band, showed a significantly decreased distance between the
wall and acromion in the subjects&#x02019; resting posture than what was observed in the normal swim
training activity<xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref><sup>)</sup>. Upon examination of
the effect that fatigue has on the sensory input of the levator scapula muscles in healthy
adults, it was found that, without vision, cervical muscular fatigue increased the center of
the foot pressure displacement. This effect became more pronounced when the somatosensation
was reduced by the use of a foam surface. As a result, it was reported that the availability
of vision inhibited the effects of instability for some subjects<xref rid="r50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref><sup>)</sup>. In a study conducted with healthy male adults, isometric
contractions were applied to the subjects&#x02019; cervical extensors. This study reported that the
subjects&#x02019; balance was influenced by the increase of maximal isometric contractions of the
cervical extensors<xref rid="r51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In the current study, the shoulder stabilization group experienced a significant increase
in the left and right directions of the LOS. In the stretching exercise group, there was a
significant decrease when the eyes were closed; also, there was a significant increase in
the LOS of the forward direction in this group. These results are thought to have been
caused by improved muscle strength and reduced the RSP symptom, which resulted from the
performance of the stabilization exercise and the stretching exercise. The shoulder
stabilization exercise and pectoralis minor stretching exercises are thought to have
enhanced the shoulder and scapular movement, as well as to have improved the scapular
kinematics. There was an association between forward head posture, RSP, and increased
thoracic kyphosis<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. So, the stabilization
exercise and the stretching exercise also improved thoracic alignment by decreasing RSP and
changing positively the scapular kinematic mechanism. As such, improved body alignment and
changed center of gravity would have aided in improving the postural control ability and,
consequentially, their balance. However, in the current study, the shoulder stabilization
group significantly improved dynamic balance although the stretching group significantly
improved both static and dynamic balance. These results showed that the stretching exercise
had more effect on the RSP than stabilization exercise because the RSP is more responsible
for the shortening of the anterior muscle, the pectoralis minor muscle, than the weakening
of the posterior muscle of shoulder. Thus, the stretching exercise had which was performed
longer and alone had more positive effect on the RSP than the shoulder stabilization
exercise which was combined with the strengthening and stretching exercise.</p><p>In this study, comparison of the changes in the maximal shoulder muscle strength between
the two groups showed no significant differences. However, comparison within the groups
revealed that there was a significant increase in flexion within the stabilization exercise
group. In the stretching exercise group, there was a significant increase in both extension
and horizontal abduction.</p><p>In a previous study that was conducted on individuals with forward head posture, stretching
exercises for the pectoralis muscle and resistance strengthening exercises for the scapular
retractors and elevators, glenohumeral abductors, and external rotators were performed three
times a week for six weeks. This study&#x02019;s post-intervention analysis revealed no changes in
the subjects&#x02019; resting scapular posture. However, the muscle strength of the subjects&#x02019;
horizontal abductors, internal rotators, and external rotators showed significant
increases<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. In a study conducted with
healthy adults, the subjects were divided into a pectoralis minor soft tissue and
self-stretching experimental group and a placebo touch and pectoralis major self-stretching
control group. The experimental and control groups both displayed reduced RSP during the
post-intervention analysis. It was also reported that there was an increase in the lower
trapezius muscle strength<xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref><sup>)</sup>. Individuals
with both forward head posture and RSP symptoms were instructed to perform strengthening
exercises for their deep cervical flexors and shoulder retractors, as well as stretching
exercises for their cervical extensors and pectoral muscles, using the elastic band for 10
weeks. The results of this study revealed that there were significant differences in the
range of motion and postural measurement of the exercise group and the control group.
Furthermore, in the exercise group, it was reported that there was a significant difference
between the pre- and post-intervention measurements<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Also, the application of rubber band strength training exercises to
athletes displayed an increase in the external rotator peak torque, which implies that
strength training improves the muscle strength and balance of the external rotator<xref rid="r52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Comparison of the maximal shoulder muscle strength in this study revealed that the flexion
of the stabilization exercise group and the extension and horizontal abduction of the
stretching exercise group experienced significant increases. These results may be attributed
to the enhancement of muscle strength and balance of the flexor, extensor, and horizontal
abductor muscles through the performance of stabilization and stretching exercises.
Consequently, the improved muscular strength and balance would have reduced the subjects&#x02019;
RSP.</p><p>One limitation of this study is that it is difficult to generalize the results of this
study that involved only 19 subjects. Also, only adults with no other disorders, aside from
RSP, were selected for this study. Future studies should involve an increased number of
subjects, as well as a more varied selection of disorders.</p><p>This study examined the effects of a 4-week shoulder stabilization exercise program that
combined a pectoralis minor stretching exercise and a stabilization exercise that used an
elastic band to improve the balance and maximal shoulder muscle strength in individuals with
RSP. The comparison of balance within the groups, based on exercise, demonstrated that, in
the stabilization exercise group, a more positive impact was made on the subjects&#x02019; dynamic
balance, while in the stretching exercise group, both the patients&#x02019; static and dynamic
balance were positively affected. The comparison of maximal shoulder muscle strength within
the groups, based on exercise, revealed that both the stabilization and stretching exercise
groups experienced significant increases in maximal shoulder muscle strength. The
stabilization and stretching exercises are not only thought to improve RSP, but to improve
balance and maximal shoulder muscle strength as well. This study will be useful for future
research on RSP or other cervical disorders.</p><sec><title>Funding</title><p>No funding was provided for this paper.</p></sec><sec><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>The authors declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the authorship
