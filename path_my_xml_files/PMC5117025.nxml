<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Key risk factors for falls include impaired physiological function, such as impaired balance.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Exercise can effectively reduce falls.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Specifically, New Zealand researchers designed a progressive home-based strength and balance training programme tailored for seniors.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12&#x02013;16</xref> This intervention&#x02014;the Otago Exercise Programme (OEP)&#x02014;has demonstrated benefit in four controlled or randomised controlled trials of community-dwelling seniors selected based on age alone (ie, <underline>&#x0003e;</underline>75&#x02005;years old).<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12&#x02013;15</xref> It is most effective and is cost-saving for those aged <underline>&#x0003e;</underline>80&#x02005;years.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Hence, the OEP qualifies as <italic>primary falls prevention</italic> (ie, preventing falls among those <italic>without</italic> a history of falls).

There may also be potential issues of compliance to OEP if there is not the same level of home visit and telephone support as in the original trials, as evidenced by a reduced efficacy of the OEP exercises when compliance is poor with home exercise booklets.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p><p>There is a need to consider and identify alternative methods of delivering effective falls prevention strategies, such as the OEP, to older adults because: (1) the population of older adults is projected to grow significantly;<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> (2) there is already a considerable burden of falls;<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> and (3) there are limited healthcare resources&#x02014;especially in rural communities.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></p><p>Thus, we conducted a study to assess the feasibility of delivering the OEP via an interactive DVD (ie, OEP-DVD) in combination with monthly physical therapist phone calls to older adults in the rural community of Sechelt, British Columbia (BC), Canada.

Of note, we chose to utilise DVD technology because DVDs are a viable option for delivering health and lifestyle interventions.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Data demonstrate that exercise DVDs experienced an annual growth of 11.2% from 2008 to 2012.

Progressive adjustments to the exercises are made in the three subsequent visits (ie, 2, 4 and 8&#x02005;weeks after initial visit). The last visit occurs at 6&#x02005;months after programme initiation. During this visit, the physical therapist ensures that the exercises are being done correctly to ensure maximum benefit.</p><p>In this study, we deliver the OEP in an adapted form (ie, we developed an OEP-DVD). We developed an OEP-DVD that could be used as a &#x02018;follow me&#x02019; (step-by-step animated instructions) video by older people at home, with the ability to choose specific exercises or to watch and follow all the way through. At the beginning of the 6-month pre-post study, all individuals enrolled in the study received one visit by a physical therapist. After a thorough assessment, the physical therapist prescribed a set of suitable exercises from the OEP-DVD and educated the participant on how to progress each exercise and how to ensure safety while exercising. The standard OEP manual was also provided as back-up reference material. Participants were instructed to do the exercises three times a week <italic>after</italic> their initial home physical therapist visit. To promote compliance as well as providing ongoing support, the physical therapist telephoned the participants once a month to discuss progress, concerns and answer any questions.

Bivariate correlations of baseline variables collected were computed to determine the strength of association with the key dependent variables (PPA score at 6&#x02005;months, SPPB score at 6&#x02005;months, separately). For the main analyses, a multiple linear regression model was constructed using the STATA V.13.0 regress procedure. The two dependent variables were PPA and SPPB score at 6&#x02005;months.

Of these, one individual was a withdrawal from participating in the OEP-DVD and declined follow-up assessment, but this individual continued to return the monthly calendars.

Although the OEP-DVD resulted in significant improvements in falls risk among community-dwelling older adults, there was a notable loss to follow-up potentially limiting the feasibility of this approach.</p><p>The compliance data must be interpreted cautiously as 16 (26%) intervention participants did not provide compliance data. If we were to assume that these individuals were not compliant to the programme, the compliance rates drop as follows: 16 (26%) individuals demonstrate at least 100% compliance performing the OEP-DVD exercises at least twice per week, 33 (54%) individuals demonstrate at least 100% walking compliance and (49%) individuals demonstrate at least 100% overall compliance (walking and OEP combined). Similarly, the analyses of the SPPB and PPA outcomes must be interpreted cautiously as 30% of participants did not provide 6-month data. It is conceivable that the lack of engagement observed from the compliance and missing compliance data throughout the study may have contributed to the greater loss to follow-up compared with studies that have continual face-to-face interaction. These findings and the results of our qualitative study suggest further refinements in the OEP-DVD are recommended.</p><p>Specifically, we found that participants in the OEP-DVD group reported feedback classified by three summary themes: (1) individuals would be more motivated to use the DVD if the instructor were more dynamic or higher energy in their delivery of the exercises; (2) individuals experiencing pain or fatigue were less likely to comply with using the DVD to exercise; and (3) individuals reported the opportunity for social engagement would be a positive factor to participating in the exercises if the DVD were offered in a community setting.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> Despite the barriers informed by the qualitative work, we still found a significant beneficial effect of the OEP-DVD on falls risk demonstrating noteworthy potential for falls prevention at a population level.</p><p>The use of digital media to deliver interventions like the OEP is becoming an increasingly important consideration from a rural and resource perspective. Specifically related to the OEP, in some parts of the world, the demand for physical therapists surpasses the supply.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> In addition to the general shortage of physical therapists, it is even more difficult to recruit and retain physical therapists to rural communities.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Falls prevention is of particular importance in rural communities. First, most rural communities have large populations of older adults (and children). Second, according to the WHO,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> older adults who live in rural areas face an increased risk of falls. In rural communities, there is an underdevelopment of health promotion programmes, a lack of diagnostic services, poor access to emergency and acute care services, a lack of non-acute healthcare services, and underservicing of special-needs groups&#x02014;such as older adults.<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> These factors likely exacerbate the risk of falling. Hence, examining alternative forms of delivery of effective falls prevention interventions should be an essential public health priority.</p><p>Interactive DVDs are an attractive strategy that are used by older adults for delivering health and lifestyle interventions such as the OEP. It should be noted that our qualitative interviews with 32 OEP-DVD participants found the DVD provided the necessary guidance at the programme onset, while allowing the flexibility for individuals to integrate their exercises in their daily life.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> Ultimately, this may contribute to better adherence to an active lifestyle in the long term. Our current results will facilitate future efforts to deliver the OEP&#x02014;an effective primary falls prevention strategy<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02014;to older adults using digital media. DVDs may also increase compliance to the OEP without regular home visits, as this has been an issue in previous research.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p><p>This study has several strengths. The OEP-DVD is very practical. The exercise programme requires minimal equipment, the physical therapist or healthcare professional expertise is widely (although not universally) available, and seniors internationally have adopted the programme and complied with it. The innovation of this study is applying the OEP intervention to a hard to access (ie, rural) population, aiming to provide the best value for money.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></p><p>We note the following limitations. The loss to follow-up may limit the internal validity of this study. It has been suggested that greater than 20% missing data may pose a threat to the internal validity of a study.<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> For example, we do not have specific information on 12 of the 16 participants who did not provide a reason for not returning their compliance reports for the intervention. The study excludes older adults who do not own a DVD player and a television. Hence, we may be excluding older adults with minimal or no disposable income (ie, low socioeconomic status). Yet, older adults with low socioeconomic status are at greater risk for poor health outcomes&#x02014;including falls. We cannot expand on the external validity of this study. For example, participants were classified as low risk on the PPA, so the feasibility of this approach for people in the high-risk category is not yet established. Participants were not randomised to the intervention and control groups. In addition, the two groups are from different locations (urban vs rural). Also the control group did not receive telephone calls, so it is possible any effect in the intervention group was in whole or in part due to the telephone calls with researchers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The burden of falls is significant. The challenge is to make a difference&#x02014;to discover effective, ideally cost-effective, interventions that prevent injurious falls and are readily translated to the population. This study provides an initial platform example of an implementation strategy that may positively improve physical outcomes for older adults at risk of sustaining future falls and provides suggestion for future implementation of the OEP.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank the study participants.
