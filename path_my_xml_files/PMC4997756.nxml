Previous studies have demonstrated that Meratrim is effective for weight management in obese individuals. The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy and tolerability of Meratrim in managing body weight in healthy overweight subjects.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Sixty participants with a mean BMI of 28.3&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> were randomized into two groups receiving either 400&#x000a0;mg of Meratrim twice daily or two identical placebo capsules for a period of 16&#x000a0;weeks. Subjects were asked to consume about 2,000&#x000a0;kcal/day throughout the study period and walk 5&#x000a0;days a week for 30&#x000a0;min daily. The primary endpoint was defined as the change in body weight from baseline to end of week 16 for the Meratrim group versus placebo. Fifty seven subjects completed the trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>At study conclusion, statistically significant reductions in body weight (5.09 vs. 1.1&#x000a0;kg; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001), BMI (1.91 vs. 0.43&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001), waist (9.97 vs. 3.71&#x000a0;cm; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001) and hip size (10.38 vs. 5.11&#x000a0;cm; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001) were observed in the Meratrim versus the placebo group.

The worldwide socioeconomic impact of this disease is estimated at approximately $2 trillion dollars, equivalent in size to the socioeconomic cost linked to cigarette smoking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In light of this estimate, there continues to be a strong need for systematic interventions (e.g., education, changes in food choices and eating habits, exercise, dietary supplements, and pharmaceuticals) aimed at slowing this disease&#x02019;s unabated growth.</p><p>Earlier studies reported that an herbal formulation (Meratrim) consisting of extracts of the flower heads from <italic>Sphaeranthus indicus</italic> and the fruit rinds of <italic>Garcinia mangostana</italic> demonstrated significant weight loss outcomes in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies on obese subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. An 800&#x000a0;mg daily dose of this supplement resulted in statistically significant reductions in body weight, BMI, waist and hip circumference that exceed those achieved via diet and exercise alone. The blend&#x02019;s significant effect on body weight and anthropomorphic parameters occurred as early as 2&#x000a0;weeks and continued to increase during the 8-week trial. Additionally, consuming the herbal blend also yielded significant improvements in lipid and glycemic serum profiles.</p><p>To evaluate the weight loss efficacy of Meratrim supplement on healthy overweight subjects, we conducted a 16-week randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial in healthy overweight individuals with an average BMI of 28.3&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>. The primary objective of our study was to assess the weight loss efficacy and tolerability of Meratrim in reducing body weight. We report herein that consuming Meratrim increases weight loss that is statistically significant versus the weight loss due to diet and exercise alone, and that this ingredient is well tolerated. In addition, we also describe the possible molecular basis of anti-obesity efficacy of Meratrim in cellular models in vitro.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study material</title><p>Meratrim consisted of extracts from the flower heads of <italic>Sphaeranthus indicus</italic> (<italic>S. indicus</italic>) and the fruit rinds of <italic>Garcinia mangostana</italic> (<italic>G. mangostana</italic>).

Briefly, <italic>S. indicus</italic> flower heads were pulverized and extracted first with methanol then with ethyl acetate to form a thick paste. Separately, <italic>G. mangostana</italic> fruit rinds were pulverized and extracted with 80:20 ratio of methanol to water. The solvent was removed under vacuum, and the resulting flakes were milled. The <italic>S. indicus</italic> paste and <italic>G. mangostana</italic> powdered extract were blended together in 3:1 ratio then combined with excipients (55&#x000a0;% w/w) to produce Meratrim.

Ahmedabad, India), in a batch type capsule filling equipment (MF-30, ACG PAM Pharma Technologies Pvt. Ltd, Mumbai, India). Identical placebo capsules contained only excipients were prepared in the same facility. Both Meratrim and placebo capsules were packaged in white, 100&#x000a0;cc HDPE screw cap bottles and submitted to Clinical Quality Assurance (QA) team. Study supplement bottles were stored at room temperature, in a secure cabinet with access limited to the clinical QA team members until distributed. Coded labels, prepared as per randomization code by QA personnel, were affixed to the study bottles. Meratrim and placebo bottles were mixed, arranged in sequential order and submitted to the study site. Study product labels conformed to all local and international clinical trial requirements and guidelines. The study site investigator, or his designate, maintained an inventory of all investigational products received, dispensed, and returned to the site by study participants during each site visit.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Cell based studies</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Cell culture and treatments</title><p>3T3-L1 mouse embryo fibroblasts and HepG2 human hepatocellular carcinoma cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and cultivated in DMEM supplemented with 10&#x000a0;% fetal bovine serum (FBS) 100 U/ml penicillin, 100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml streptomycin, 1&#x000a0;mM sodium pyruvate and 4.5&#x000a0;g/L D-glucose. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were differentiated to mature adipocytes as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].

The study was performed at a single clinical center (Srinivasa Clinic &#x00026; Diabetic Care Centre) in Southern India under the management of the clinical research organization D2L Clinical Solutions (Bangalore, India). The clinical trial registration number is CTRI/2014/07/004727. The study protocol was evaluated and approved by the Bangalore Ethics Committee (Bangalore, India) on 13 May 2014. The clinical center complied with all relevant ICH-GCP, the Declaration of Helsinki (1996), plus all applicable local government and institutional research policies, procedures, and guidelines. The study was conducted according to US and international standards of Good Clinical Practice (FDA Title 21 CFR part 312 and ICH guidelines).</p><p>Efficacy outcome measures, including weight, waist, and hip circumference were recorded at all visits. Lean body mass was assessed via Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) at randomization and at the final study visit (week 16). Both assessments were conducted after overnight fasting. Medical monitoring included a physical examination and vital signs measurements at all visits. Subject diaries and compliance cards were provided beginning at randomization through the final visit, and collected at all follow up visits. Study product was dispensed starting at the randomization visit through week 12. Study supplement bottles were collected at all follow up visits and unused capsules counted. Blood and urine sample collections were obtained at screening, weeks 4 and 8, and at study conclusion. Pregnancy testing was done at screening and all follow-up visits starting at visit 4 (week 4). Adverse events (AEs) were recorded using the subject&#x02019;s diary inputs plus a site visit questionnaire administered by the study personnel at all visits.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Clinical endpoints</title><p>The primary endpoint for this clinical study was the reduction in body weight from baseline to the end of the treatment period.

DEXA measurements were carried out using the enCORE&#x000ae; based X-ray Bone Densitometer; Lunar Prodigy Series (GE Medical Systems, Chakan, Pune, India). Leptin, adiponectin and insulin were quantitatively estimated in the serum samples using specific EIA based methods. Leptin (EZHL-80SK), Adiponectin (442307) and Insulin (IS130D) ELISA kits were procured from EMD Millipore Corporation (Billerica, MA), BioLegend Inc. (San Diego, CA) and Calbiotech Inc.

Power calculations, using previously published efficacy data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], allowed us to conclude that 20 completers per cohort was sufficient to achieve 80&#x000a0;% power to detect outcome differences in weight loss between the groups, assuming a two-sided significance level of 0.05. Thirty subjects per treatment group were calculated to provide more than 90&#x000a0;% power under identical analytical conditions. Based on these estimates, and assuming a 40&#x000a0;% screen failure rate, we anticipated that we would need to screen 100 individuals to obtain 60 volunteers (30 subjects per group), the targeted sample size for this study. In practice, we screened a total of 82 subjects to achieve the targeted number of randomized volunteers required. Subjects without a baseline efficacy assessment were excluded from the analysis of that efficacy variable. Safety analyses were done on an ITT basis. Statistical analyses were generated using SAS version 9.2.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec20"><title>Demographics and baseline characteristics</title><p>Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> summarizes the demographics of the 60 subjects that were eligible for efficacy and safety analyses.

The results presented herein demonstrate that individuals consuming Meratrim experienced greater weight loss and reductions in waist and hip size compared to individuals consuming placebo. The Meratrim supplemented group got benefit by losing an average body weight of 5.09&#x000a0;kg at the end of the study, which equals to 6.7&#x000a0;% of their mean body weight at the baseline. As all participants in this study were counseled on diet control and exercise, and the subject diaries and pedometer data showed similar levels of compliance, we conclude that the weight loss attributable to Meratrim consumption is incremental to the weight loss obtained via diet and exercise alone.</p><p>In this study we tested whether Meratrim consumption by overweight individuals might impact their blood glucose and lipid levels similar to what we previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. We found that Meratrim reduced blood levels of triglyceride and total cholesterol in a statistically significant and a clinically relevant manner. However, unlike our previous results we did not observe an impact on blood glucose levels despite an increase in adiponectin levels, which has been shown to inversely correlate with reductions in blood glucose levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. This was not a surprising outcome. In prior work, the obese population we employed presented with fasting blood glucose levels that ranged from 107&#x000a0;mg/dL to 109&#x000a0;mg/dL, clearly above the normal range for this marker and indicative of prediabetes. Meratrim supplementation reduced fasting glucose levels from 109&#x000a0;mg/dL to 96&#x000a0;mg/dL after usage for two months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In the present study, the fasting glucose levels were only in the high end of the normal range and declined similarly for both cohorts by study conclusion. In our previous work, Meratrim supplementation also led to a statistically significant improvement in serum adiponectin levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. However, while we did observe an increase in adiponectin levels, it was not significantly different when compared with the placebo group. We strongly believe that these differences in outcome are due to tangible, biochemical differences that exist between the previously studied population, and the one we report on herein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. These differences may also account for the lack of statistically significant changes in ghrelin and leptin levels. Although, the improvements are not statistically different, the trends suggest that Meratrim helps to control hunger and satiety signaling. Interestingly, we also observed that Meratrim supplementation increased serum insulin level by 2.7&#x003bc;IU/ml (over placebo). This indicates that Meratrim might increase beta cell function and helps in lowering the risk of diabetes.</p><p>In line with the significant reduction in body weight noted for the Meratrim cohort, we also observed a statistically significant change in this group&#x02019;s waist and hip sizes. By study conclusion, the net reductions in hip and waist size were 4.9 % and 6.2&#x000a0;% of baseline values, respectively. However, these changes did not impact the waist-to-hip ratio sufficiently at study conclusion to achieve statistical significance.</p><p>Both emotional well-being and psychosocial functioning are greatly affected by obesity, and weight reduction has been shown to improve both of these mental states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Consistent with these findings, we found that quality of life parameters, as measured by the Profile of Moods Short Form, improved significantly (47&#x000a0;%) for subjects consuming the herbal supplement. Interestingly, at the end of the study the VAS appetite level in Meratrim group was significantly lowered in comparison with the placebo group. These observations are strongly in line with the leptin and ghrelin levels in serum, which showed they were lower for the Meratrim cohort as compared to the placebo group. These observations together strengthen the fact that Meratrim improves emotional well-being and provides better control in hunger/satiety balance in healthy overweight individuals.</p><p>At study conclusion we were unable to obtain sufficient DEXA data to determine whether the ingestion of Meratrim resulted in a loss of lean or fat body mass. This protocol deviation was deemed as minor as this was not a primary outcome of this study. It was reported to the IEC as required by their bylaws. Root cause analyses determined that some subjects during baseline evaluation experienced DEXA as a tedious process and were reluctant to undergo the same process at 16&#x000a0;week DEXA scan.</p><p>In vitro experiments in cellular models demonstrate that Meratrim inhibits adipogenic differentiation and boosts lipid breakdown in mature fat cells. Earlier studies demonstrate that nutrients and hormones control lipogenesis in adipocytes through directly regulating the key enzymes of the lipogenic pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Acetyl CoA Carboxylase (ACC) and Fatty acid synthase (FAS) are the crucial enzymes in de novo lipogenesis, catalyzing the sequential enzymatic steps in the conversion of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA to palmitate, respectively. After a series of reactions, palmitate is further converted into complex fatty acids. However, Fatty acid synthase (FAS) is the key rate-limiting enzyme for de novo lipogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Our experiments demonstrate that Meratrim has significant potential to down regulate FAS synthesis and to phosphorylate ACC at Ser79. ACC is deactivated upon its phosphorylation at Ser79 by activated AMPK (phosphorylated at Thr172) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Interestingly, immunoblot experiment demonstrates that Meratrim phosphorylates AMPK at Thr172 in hepatocytes; this clearly indicates that Meratrim activates AMPK. AMPK activation is associated with the stimulation of fatty acid oxidation, glucose uptake by muscle cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], inhibition of cholesterol and triglyceride synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. AMPK activating potential of Meratrim might be the basis of significant reduction in serum triglyceride and cholesterol of the active group in the present study. In summary, our observations together strongly suggest that Meratrim inhibits de novo lipogenesis process and increases fat burning through beta oxidation. These evidences provide strong support in favor of the possible molecular mechanism underlying the anti-obesity effect of Meratrim. In addition, our observations also suggest that Meratrim helps in maintaining healthy lipid profile in overweight individuals.</p></sec><sec id="Sec34"><title>Conclusion</title><p> We previously showed that Meratrim did not impact any clinical chemistry biomarkers which assessed the physiological health and functionality of the liver, the kidneys, the heart, or blood. These observations have been confirmed in the current trial. These results add to the growing body of evidence which suggests that Meratrim is well tolerated and has a broad-spectrum safety based on a battery of toxicological studies. In conclusion, the results presented herein validate that Meratrim is a well-tolerated and effective ingredient for weight management in healthy overweight individuals over a 16-week study period.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The Authors thank Sri.
