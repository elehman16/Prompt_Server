aerobic exercise on cartilage oligomeric matrix protein and oxidative DNA damage in obese,
elderly females. [Subjects and Methods] Sixteen class I obese, elderly females, according
to World Health Organization criteria, were randomly and equally assigned to a control
group (n=8) or an exercise group (n=8). The exercise group participated in exercise
sessions of 60 minutes per day, 3 days per week, for a period of 8 weeks. [Results] After
aerobic exercise intervention, weight, body mass index, body fat, waist circumference, and
DNA damage (Tail moment) were significantly decreased, compared with baseline values. In
contrast, serum cartilage oligomeric matrix protein levels were not significantly
different among any groups or time-points. [Conclusion] Regular aerobic exercise may be
effective for reducing obesity-induced high DNA damage levels in obese females, without
causing the deformation or degradation of lower extremity articular cartilage.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Aerobic exercise</kwd><kwd>Articular cartilage</kwd><kwd>DNA damage</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The rapid global increase in obesity prevalence has resulted in an obesity epidemic.
Obesity is a serious health threat not only for metabolic diseases, but also for several
types of cancers<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Oxidative stress has been reported as one of the chief causes of
the onset of various obesity-related diseases<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. In brief, obesity is accompanied by increased levels of free fatty
acids (FFA) and hyperglycemia; which, in turn, leads to increased reactive oxygen species
(ROS) production and oxidative stress<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Increased oxidative stress could initiate cancer not only by damaging DNA directly, but also
by inducing error-prone DNA repair<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>It has been reported that physical activities such as regular exercise can reduce the
oxidative stress level in the body that is elevated by obesity<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Konopka et al. suggested that exercise could reduce DNA oxidative
damage in obese females by significantly decreasing exercise-induced 8-oxo-2&#x02019;deoxyguanosine
(8-oxo-dG)<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup> formation. However, there
has been limited research investigating the effects of obesity and exercise on DNA damage by
using the Comet assay<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>, which enables
rapid and sensitive measurement of DNA damage. It has been reported that, although regular
aerobic exercise could be effective for obesity prevention and alleviation<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>,
walking and running, the representative modes of aerobic exercise, could cause temporary
cartilage deformation and degradation by increasing the load on the lower extremity joints
(e.g., knee joint), as reflected by elevated serum cartilage oligomeric matrix protein
(COMP) levels<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Therefore, two aspects should be considered for obese subjects who exercise regularly:
while it is effective for maintenance and promotion of health by reducing DNA damage, it can
induce cartilage deformation by repetitively increasing the load on the lower extremity
joints. However, no research has yet been reported in this regard. Accordingly, the present
research aims to identify the effect of aerobic exercise on lymphocyte DNA damage in obese
subjects by using the Comet assay, as well as the stress level of the lower extremity
articular cartilage by analyzing serum COMP levels.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Sixteen obese, elderly females volunteered as subjects for this research. All subjects had
a body mass index (BMI) above 25&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and waist circumference above 80&#x02005;cm.
Minimum acceptable values for BMI and waist circumference were based on the criteria for
class I obesity for adult Asians, established by the World Health Organization (WHO).
Subjects also had to be free from any orthopedic or cardiovascular problems that would limit
exercise. The research conformed to the standards set by the latest revision of the
Declaration of Helsinki. All subjects read and signed a written informed consent statement
consistent with the guidelines set by the Department of Physical Education at Yonsei
University.</p><p>Anthropometric measurements included height, body composition, and waist circumference,
measured using a stadiometer (SECA 213; SECA, Hamburg, Germany), a bioimpedance analysis
(BIA) device (Inbody 720; Biospace, Seoul, Korea), and a circumference measuring tape (SECA
200; SECA, Hamburg, Germany), respectively.</p><p>After the anthropometric measurements, subjects were randomly and equally assigned to
either an 8-member control (CON) group (age: 62.3 &#x000b1; 4.8&#x02005;years, height: 159.0 &#x000b1; 5.0&#x02005;cm,
weight: 71.0 &#x000b1; 3.6&#x02005;kg, BMI: 28.1 &#x000b1; 2.2&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup>, percent body fat: 35.9 &#x000b1; 2.7%,
waist circumference: 86.7 &#x000b1; 3.8&#x02005;cm) or an 8-member exercise (EX) group (age: 63.8 &#x000b1;
4.0&#x02005;years, height: 158.3 &#x000b1; 5.4&#x02005;cm, weight: 69.9 &#x000b1; 6.6&#x02005;kg, BMI: 27.9 &#x000b1; 1.9&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup>,
percent body fat: 35.0 &#x000b1; 3.0%, waist circumference: 87.6 &#x000b1; 4.6&#x02005;cm). The EX group
participated in sessions of 60&#x02005;min per day, 3 days per week, for a period of 8 weeks. Each
session began with a 10-min warm-up, continued with a main set of 40-min treadmill running
at their individual target heart rate zone (70% of heart rate reserve), and finished with a
10-min cool-down period. The individual target heart-rate zone was determined according to
the Guidelines for Exercise Testing and Prescription of the American College of Sport
Medicines<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Before and after the 8 weeks of intervention, 8&#x02005;ml of blood was collected from the
antecubital vein of each subject with a 22-gauge needle and SST tubes. The serum COMP levels
were determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using a commercially
available Human COMP<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> ELISA kit (AnaMar AB, Lund, Sweden). The absorbance was
measured at 450&#x02005;nm with a microplate reader (Molecular Device, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). The
lymphocyte DNA damage was determined by using a Comet assay as described by Singh et al.,
which showed single- or double-strand DNA breaks<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. DNA in tail, Tail length, and Tail moment were also
determined.</p><p>Statistical analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences
software, version 21.0 (SPSS Inc., USA). Experimental analysis was performed with a 2 &#x000d7; 2
repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) model to determine differences within and
between groups over time. The level of significance was set at &#x003b1;&#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The changes of anthropometric and biochemical characteristics for the two groups before and

Tail length were not significantly different among any groups or time points (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Measuring DNA damage in cells has been suggested as a method not only for detecting the
occurrence of genotoxicity caused by toxic materials that are harmful to the human body, but
also for the early prediction of the presence of severe diseases such as cancer<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. The research described herein used the
Comet assay to investigate the effect of a regular aerobic exercise intervention on
lymphocyte DNA damage in obese, elderly females. The result showed that after intervention,
the EX group showed a significant decrease in Tail moment, a reflection DNA damage. This
result supports preceding research that showed reduced DNA damage, based on the Comet assay,
after aerobic exercise training <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Another result of the present research
was a significant decrease in obesity-related indexes (weight, BMI, body fat, and waist
circumference) in the EX group after intervention. Taken together, the results of the
present research indicate that obesity reduction, due to exercise, alleviates DNA damage.
Our results are supported by Luperini et al., who reported obesity as a cause of DNA damage,
based on significantly high levels of DNA strand breaks and oxidized purines and pyrimidines
in morbidly obese females compared with that in eutrophic females<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. Additionally, Karaman et al., suggested that comet-tail
length had positive correlations with waist circumference and BMI<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In contrast, it has been reported that COMP, a protein component of cartilage, was released
into the blood when cartilage was damaged, because of repetitive training or physical stress
on a joint; and that joint diseases, such as osteoarthritis, also led to elevated blood COMP
levels<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. The present research
analyzed serum COMP to examine the change in the level of stress on lower extremity
articular cartilage in obese, elderly females, according to regular aerobic exercise
intervention. The result showed no significant difference in serum COMP levels before or
after intervention. Therefore, it is considered that the aerobic exercise regimen of the
present research did not exert deleterious stress on the lower extremity articular
cartilages of the subjects. However, it is known that serum COMP levels, elevated by walking
or running, return to baseline levels within 30 minutes after exercise<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. For this
reason, follow-up research for investigating change in circulating COMP levels would need to
employ an acute exercise protocol for stimulating articular cartilage before and after
intervention.</p><p>In conclusion, it is suggested that the regular aerobic exercise involved in this research,
may be effective for reducing obesity-induced high DNA damage levels in obese, elderly
female subjects, without causing deformation or degradation of lower extremity articular
cartilage.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by the Dong-A University research fund.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Lim</surname><given-names>W</given-names></name><name><surname>So</surname><given-names>WY</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Lifestyle-related factors and their association with
