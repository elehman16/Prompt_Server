Patients with <bold>i</bold>nitial IVIG-refractory KD, aged 1&#x02013;10 years, received a single dose of IV infliximab 5&#x02009;mg/kg or IV polyethylene glycol-treated human immunoglobulin (VGIH) 2&#x02009;g/kg on day 0. Primary outcome was defervescence rate within 48&#x02009;h after the start of treatment. Safety was evaluated through day 56. Overall, 31 patients were randomized (infliximab, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;16; VGIH, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;15); 31.3% and 60.0% patients discontinued due to worsening KD. Defervescence rate within 48&#x02009;h was greater with infliximab (76.7%) than VGIH (37.0%) (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.023), and defervescence was achieved earlier with infliximab (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0072). Coronary artery lesions occurred in 1 (6.3%) and 3 (20.0%) patients receiving infliximab and VGIH, respectively, up to day 21. Adverse events occurred in 15 (93.8%) and 15 (100.0%) patients in the infliximab and VGIH groups, respectively. No serious adverse events in the infliximab group and one in the VGIH group were observed. Infliximab improved the defervescence rate within 48&#x02009;h and time to defervescence versus standard therapy, and was well tolerated in patients with IVIG-refractory KD.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Kawasaki disease (KD) is an acute febrile disorder predominantly affecting young children, especially those aged 0&#x02013;5 years<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. KD frequently causes coronary artery abnormalities and acquired heart disease in children<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Therefore, the most important goal of treatment is to prevent coronary artery lesions (CALs) by suppressing acute inflammation within 10 days of the onset of illness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is the initial therapy for KD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> and leads to rapid defervescence and improvement of inflammatory conditions in most patients, resulting in a lower incidence of CALs; however, approximately one-fifth of patients respond inadequately to initial IVIG therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Patients with KD refractory to IVIG therapy, defined as a persistent or recrudescent fever&#x02009;&#x02265;24&#x02009;h or&#x02009;&#x02265;36&#x02009;h after an initial IVIG therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, are at increased risk of CALs. Treatment options for initial IVIG-refractory KD include additional IVIG, prednisolone, methylprednisolone pulse, ulinastatin, cyclosporine, methotrexate, and plasma exchange; at present, an additional dose of IVIG is the most common<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> and recommended<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> therapy. However, approximately half of patients are unresponsive to IVIG retreatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, leading to the investigation of several alternative treatments, including immunomodulatory agents, cytotoxic agents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, and interleukin (IL)-1 blockade<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Serum tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; (TNF), which is a pro-inflammatory cytokine, is higher in patients with KD than in healthy children and adults and is higher in patients with than without CALs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. These results suggest that TNF is an important cause of severe complications in KD. Infliximab is a monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to TNF and inhibits its pro-inflammatory effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Several cases of infliximab-treated IVIG-refractory KD have been reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. A phase 1, randomized, multicenter clinical trial of infliximab in initial IVIG-refractory patients with KD treated with IVIG on or before day 14 of fever reported that infliximab was well tolerated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. However, there have been few randomized trials in this setting and none in Japan, which has the highest incidence of KD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, and the usefulness of infliximab in IVIG-refractory KD is unclear. Therefore, we conducted a phase 3, randomized, open-label, active-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter trial to compare the efficacy and safety of infliximab treatment within 8 days of illness onset with an additional dose of IVIG in Japanese patients with initial IVIG-refractory KD.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="Par5">This study started on May 2012 and ended on September 2014, but the recruitment target was not reached, owing to the very small number of patients who met the eligibility criteria.

CALs occurred in one patient receiving infliximab (6.3%) and in three patients receiving VGIH (20.0%) up to day 21. No patient had a new CAL after day 21. Infliximab showed good tolerability.</p><p id="Par12">Burns <italic>et al</italic>. reported that 11/12 (91.7%) patients who received infliximab had fever cessation within 24&#x02009;h compared with 8/12 (66.7%) patients who received a second IVIG<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. One reason why defervescence rates within 48&#x02009;h in our trial were low compared with the Burns study might be that we defined the initial IVIG-refractory KD not only by duration of fever after initial IVIG infusion but also by the increase in inflammatory markers. Infliximab has been reported to achieve faster defervescence than an additional IVIG for patients with KD who were resistant to initial IVIG in the Korean randomized, controlled trial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Also in the present trial, the earlier defervescence of infliximab compared with that of VGIH was shown by post-hoc analysis. The greater and earlier effect of infliximab on defervescence supports the potential usefulness of infliximab in patients with IVIG-refractory KD. The acute inflammatory markers reduced by infliximab treatment were similar to IVIG, even when patients were stratified by baseline levels of inflammatory markers (data not shown).</p><p id="Par13">Prevention of CALs is one of the most important goals in KD treatment. Anti-TNF therapy directly improves endothelial cell function and also reduces inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> and may, therefore, contribute to preventing the development of coronary artery abnormalities. A statistical difference in the incidence of CALs between infliximab and an additional IVIG was not observed in the Korean trial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Our results were similar to that trial, however, we did not analyze the difference between two groups in consideration of sample size. In addition, our trial may be underpowered to detect the difference in CALs development, as patients with abnormal coronary arteries before enrollment were excluded. Incidences of CALs in the Korean trial and our trial were relatively low in the infliximab group (9.1% and 6.3%, respectively) versus the additional IVIG group (12.5% and 20.0%, respectively). Therefore, a large trial is necessary to conclude whether anti-TNF therapy may be more effective than additional IVIG for preventing the development of coronary artery abnormalities.</p><p id="Par14">In a large phase 3 trial, Tremoulet <italic>et al</italic>. reported that infliximab treatment for IVIG-na&#x000ef;ve patients with KD did not reduce treatment resistance, a primary endpoint; however, it reduced the number of days of fever<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Infliximab therapy was reported to decrease serum soluble TNF receptor 1 and IL-6 levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> and to regulate the signaling pathways related to KD inflammation as well as IVIG resistance factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Therefore, infliximab may be more useful in IVIG-refractory KD via these mechanisms than in IVIG-na&#x000ef;ve KD.</p><p id="Par15">In our trial, infliximab was well tolerated, and no new safety concerns were observed. In the Tremoulet trial, infliximab was also reported as well tolerated and not associated with infusion reactions or infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Other studies also reported favorable safety profiles (no infusion reactions) for infliximab in patients with KD with persistent arthritis after IVIG or with IVIG-refractory KD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par16">In the present trial, the increase in anti-dsDNA antibodies was observed in patients treated with infliximab similar to previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Although a link between these autoantibodies and lupus-like syndrome has been previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, changes of anti-dsDNA antibodies in our trial were relatively transient and mostly anti-dsDNA IgM isotype, and lupus-like syndrome was not observed in any patient, as in previous reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, physicians should be aware of the risk of this complication.

Larger and longer studies may help confirm the present results and longer-term outcomes (e.g. growth and development, the course of an aneurysm) with infliximab. In addition, the enrolled patients had &#x0201c;typical&#x0201d; KD with a uniform clinical presentation, but corticosteroid use was restricted, which may have affected the efficacy evaluation. Therefore, future studies should include younger patients and patients with atypical or incomplete KD.</p><p id="Par19">Infliximab was associated with a higher defervescence rate within 48&#x02009;h and more rapid resolution of fever after starting infusion compared with VGIH in patients with IVIG-refractory KD; this was potentially related to attenuated inflammation. Infliximab was well tolerated, and the rates of most AEs related to investigations or infections were similar in both groups. The results of this trial led to the approval of infliximab for the treatment of IVIG refractory KD in Japan in December 2015. As the infusion period for infliximab is much shorter than that of VGIH, this may reduce the amount of healthcare resources required during treatment. Infliximab, rather than a second dose of IVIG, may become a viable therapeutic option for patients with IVIG-refractory KD.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Study design and patients</title><p id="Par20">This was a randomized, open-label, active-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter trial conducted at 10 medical institutions in Japan from May 2012 to September 2014 (NCT01596335; Trial registration date: May 9, 2012).
