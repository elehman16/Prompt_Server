screening rates, but the cost consequences of this intervention
are unclear. We examined the cost differences between home-based
and clinic-based testing and the cost-effectiveness of home
testing based on the DAISY study, a randomized controlled trial.
Direct and indirect costs were estimated for home and clinic
testing, and cost-effectiveness was calculated as cost per
additional test performed. In the clinic testing group, direct
costs were 49/test and indirect costs (the costs of seeking
or receiving care) were 62/test. Home testing cost was
25/test. We found that home testing was cost saving when all
testing for all patients was considered. However cost savings were
not seen when only asymptomatic tests or when patient subgroups
were considered. A home testing program could be cost saving,
depending on whether changes in clinic testing frequency occur
when home testing is available.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>1. INTRODUCTION</title><p>Home
testing for chlamydia and gonorrhea has high sensitivity (about 90%) and
specificity (<inline-formula><mml:math id="M1"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>&#x0003e;</mml:mo><mml:mn>99</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>%), and is well accepted in adolescent and young adult
populations [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Studies in the US and in Denmark demonstrate that
home testing significantly increases the likelihood that tests will occur [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. It is well established that office-based screening
for chlamydia is a cost-effective intervention for sexually active young women [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], as is screening
for gonorrhea in women with individual or population risk factors [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], however
screening in clinical settings is not performed as often as is recommended [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Home
screening, while increasing test frequency, might decrease screening costs, by
avoiding clinical facility and clinician fees [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The indirect costs of clinic-based screening,
such as time off work or school, childcare, transportation, and other costs resulting
from a clinic visit, could also be averted.
In this analysis, we use test frequency and cost data from a randomized
trial of home testing for chlamydia and gonorrhea in high-risk young women to
examine cost differences between home-based and clinic-based testing and the
cost-effectiveness of a home testing intervention.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2. MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>The data source for this analysis was the Detection Acceptability Intervention for
STD&#x02019;s in Young women (DAISY) study, a randomized controlled trial. Trial recruitment and results are detailed elsewhere [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Briefly, 398 young women aged 15&#x02013;24 at high
risk for STD were recruited from clinics and surrounding communities,
representing a group where frequent testing is recommended. Recruitment occurred between November 2000-April
2003. Women were randomized to an
intervention group, who received home testing kits for chlamydia and gonorrhea by
mail at 6, 12, and 18 months, or a control group, who received a postcard at 6,
12, and 18 months inviting them to attend one of the participating study
clinics for a routine test for women&#x02019;s health infections at no cost. Participants were urged to maintain their
usual health patterns, including evaluation for genital symptoms or STD&#x02019;s. Women with positive home tests were notified,
counseled about partner notification, and referred to a participating clinic
for treatment at no cost. Significantly
more screening tests were performed in the home screening intervention group,
and no differences in STD incidence rates were seen between intervention and
control groups over the study period.</p><p>All participants
completed a questionnaire at enrollment, which included questions about out-of-pocket
costs for seeking or receiving care at the clinic, time off work or school due
to clinic visits, and time donated by others to allow the participant to attend
clinic. These questions and the number of tests performed in clinic and at home
in the trial are the focus of this analysis.</p><p>The
direct and indirect costs of receiving screening tests were calculated for
women randomized to the intervention (testing at home) and for those in the
control group (clinic testing). Direct
costs of clinic-based testing were the costs for clinician time and for the
test kit (nucleic acid amplification for chlamydia and gonorrhea), along with
required supplies. The Panel on
Cost-Effectiveness in Health and Medicine recommends including the following as
indirect costs of care: payments made by the patient in the course of seeking
or receiving care, and time required by the patient and others to allow care to
be received [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In this analysis, indirect costs for the clinic
visits included costs of parking or transportation and of babysitting or childcare. Indirect costs for time missed from school or
work to receive care and for time donated by others (e.g., for rides or
babysitting) to allow care to occur were quantified based on patient responses,
then valued based on the average hourly wage in 2005 for nonfarm workers in the
US [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] to avoid bias against intervention in this
young population [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]; the effects of
other time costs were examined in sensitivity analyses. Direct costs for home screening were the cost
of the test, packaging costs, and postage to and from the patient, costing a
total of 25. Testing cost alone (including
materials and technician time) in either setting was 21. These costs were then applied to clinic-based
and home-based tests as quantified in the DAISY study, and costs compared
between intervention and control groups.
Alternative values for all cost components, varied individually and
collectively over plausible ranges, were examined in one-way and multiway
sensitivity analyses.</p><p>Direct costs per subject for the intervention group and the control group were
calculated as follows: Direct cost (clinic test) * clinic test frequency + Direct cost (Home test) * home test frequency divided by the number of subjects in each group. Indirect costs were calculated similarly.</p><p>Cost-effectiveness
calculations were performed to estimate the cost per additional test performed
per subject, using the formula <disp-formula id="eq1"><label>(1)</label><mml:math id="M2"><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>Total cost per subject (intervention)</mml:mtext><mml:mo>&#x02212;</mml:mo><mml:mtext>Total cost per subject (control)</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>Tests per subject (intervention)</mml:mtext><mml:mo>&#x02212;</mml:mo><mml:mtext>Tests per subject (control)</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mn>.</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula> The model assumes equal STD
incidence and diagnosis with home- and clinic-based testing, as seen in the
DAISY trial, and hence the advantage of home testing from a cost-effectiveness
standpoint (if any) is that, compared to the clinic testing group, more tests are
performed overall due to testing at home (at a relatively low cost) while fewer
tests are performed in clinic (at higher cost).</p><p>One-way and
probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. Cost and time parameters were varied
individually to examine effects on model results. In the probabilistic sensitivity analysis,
these parameters were varied simultaneously, along with testing frequencies from
the DAISY study, through their 95% confidence intervals, with values for each
parameter randomly chosen from distributions 10,000 times and cost-effectiveness
ratios calculated for each parameter set chosen. Parameter distributions were selected based
on the characteristics of each parameter.
Uniform distributions, where all values in the range were equally likely
to be chosen, were used for time cost per hour, nonclinician direct costs for
clinic-based testing, and home-based testing costs. Gamma distributions, based on DAISY study mean
and standard deviation (SD) data, were used for indirect monetary costs, time
required to receive care, and for clinician costs. Normal distributions were used for test
frequencies.</p></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title><p>Questionnaire results are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>. Responses
to these questions were similar regardless of randomization group, therefore
results are reported for 388 subjects (10 of the original 398 subjects had no
questionnaire data available). Slightly
more than one-fifth of subjects had no insurance, took more than 2 hours off school or work to attend
clinic, or traveled more that 30 minutes to attend clinic; more than a third
paid for parking/transportation or had another person donate time so that care
could be obtained.</p><p>Costs
per test received are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab2">Table 2</xref>.
Direct costs for clinic-based testing, including clinician and test
costs, were estimated at 49 per test received.
On average, subjects paid 2.97 for parking/transportation and
childcare, and 3.7 hours were spent by the subject and others to allow care to be received per clinic visit. Combined direct and indirect costs per clinic visit totaled 111.</p><p>
<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab3">Table 3</xref> displays tests performed, testing costs, and cost-effectiveness results for
all study subjects and for subgroups based on recruitment site. More tests and more asymptomatic tests were
performed among the home screening group (<inline-formula><mml:math id="M3"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mo>&#x0003c;</mml:mo><mml:mn>.0001</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>), with greater differences
in testing rates seen in women recruited from neighborhoods. Women recruited from clinics had high testing
rates and a smaller differential between home and clinic-based testing. No difference in STD incidence was noted
between intervention groups (20.4 [home testing] versus 24.1 [clinic testing] per
100 woman-years, <inline-formula><mml:math id="M4"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>.28</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>).</p><p>Considering total costs
for all subjects and all testing, and assuming equal STD detection between
groups, the home testing intervention was cost saving, because fewer
clinic-based tests were performed and the resulting cost savings were not
completely offset by the costs of increased home testing (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab3">Table 3</xref>). Total testing costs per infection found were
estimated at 702 in the intervention group and 717 in the control group. However, cost savings were not noted for the neighborhood
recruitment subgroup, where each additional test obtained by the intervention
group compared to the control group cost about 24.50, due to more frequent home-based
testing and no decrease in clinic testing with the intervention. When only asymptomatic testing was considered
in all subjects, the intervention cost was 12.51 per additional test performed, since
the costs of increased home testing were not offset by the relativity small
decreases in clinic-based testing in the intervention group.</p><p>In one-way
sensitivity analyses, four parameter values varied individually through their
listed ranges (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab2">Table 2</xref>) made the total cost per subject of all testing in the
intervention group greater than the total cost per subject in the control group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab4">Table 4</xref>). The model was most sensitive to changes in home testing costs, with increases in this cost of <inline-formula><mml:math id="M5"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>&#x02265;</mml:mo><mml:mn>5</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> making the home testing intervention more expensive than clinic testing; to have similar effects, time spent
seeking/receiving care, the cost of that time, or clinic testing cost would
need to decrease by about a third. Most
importantly, if infection detection frequency is not equal between groups, unlike
the equal detection seen in the DAISY trial and assumed in this analysis, between-group differences
in infection costs and complication effects would need to be explicitly
accounted for in the analysis.</p><p>In the
probabilistic sensitivity analysis, where all cost and testing parameters were
varied simultaneously, the intervention was cost saving in 52% of model
iterations when all testing was considered.
When considering only asymptomatic testing, there was a 22% likelihood that
the intervention would be cost saving.</p><p>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>
illustrates the relationship of changes in testing rates to cost savings with a
home testing program if infection detection rates are equal between groups. If per-patient clinic testing rates decrease
by more than 22.5% of the increase seen in home testing rates due to program
adoption, a home testing program will be cost saving. For example, if a home
testing intervention increases home testing in a population by 1 test per
patient per year and decreases yearly clinic testing by 0.4 tests per patient
(denoted by the &#x0201c;X&#x0201d; in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), then the intervention would be cost
saving. However, with the same increase
in home testing, if the clinic testing rate only decreases by 0.1 test per
patient (denoted by the open square), then a home testing program is not cost
saving.</p><p>In
this analysis of a program encouraging home testing for chlamydia and gonorrhea
in a high-risk group of young women, we found that, when all costs and all
tests were considered, a home testing program was cost saving in the DAISY study,
a randomized, controlled trial, while, at the same time, significant increases
in all tests and in asymptomatic tests were seen. However, whether cost savings occurred with
home testing depended on the patient group and clinical situation studied,
based on changes in clinic-based testing resulting from the intervention when STD
detection is the same with either testing program. Cost savings were seen in clinic-recruited subjects,
a group that utilized clinic services more frequently, due to decreases in
clinic-based testing resulting from the availability of home testing. In subjects recruited from neighborhoods
surrounding the clinics, home testing was not cost saving, because of increased
home testing without proportionate clinic testing reductions or STD detection improvements. When only asymptomatic tests were considered,
home testing was again not cost saving. Finally,
the indirect costs of seeking or receiving care, that is, monetary costs for
childcare, parking, and other expenses; time costs from missed work or school;
and time donated by others were considerable and could present barriers to
receiving recommended testing and care.</p><p>As suggested by
this analysis and by the DAISY study itself, the decision to implement a home
testing intervention for chlamydia and gonorrhea is more complex than merely
seeking to maximize tests performed or to minimize costs. Home testing programs have been well
demonstrated to increase testing volume [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], by decreasing some barriers to STD testing
through the use of a relatively expensive test.
Unless direct costs incurred by individual clinics could be decreased as
a result of a home testing intervention, in times of budgetary limitations clinics
would have no incentive or means to implement such an intervention. Indirect cost savings (when the intervention
is considered from the broader, societal standpoint) and the public health
benefits of increased testing suggest that financial support for home testing
would need to come from higher levels for these societal benefits to be
obtained. For individual clinics with a
high proportion of frequently utilizing patients, a home testing intervention could
decrease the visit frequency by this patient group, increasing capacity for
other needed services and patient groups.
In different populations where care-related indirect costs might be
higher, for example, due to clinic inaccessibility or unavailability, home
testing might prove more useful from clinical and economic standpoints by
increasing testing rates through decreasing individual disincentives for testing. Concerns about home testing decreasing
necessary clinic visits appear to be unfounded [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>Cost savings were not
seen when only asymptomatic tests are considered, implying that home testing
for screening purposes may not be economically favorable. However, the distinction of symptomatic and
asymptomatic testing might be somewhat artificial when a population is
considered, since the availability of home tests could have benefits beyond
those of screening. For example, delays
in seeking care when symptomatic are common, and the availability of home
testing may allow infections to be diagnosed sooner, potentially decreasing
untreated illness burden and PID risk. No
differences in infection detection were seen between randomization groups in
the DAISY study, where an urban population with relatively easy and frequent
access to care was investigated; populations with less access could benefit
more from home screening. Finally, few
screening interventions are cost saving, with some cost per health benefit
gained absorbed by society or payers based on the magnitude of screening costs
and benefits gained [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. For example, Hu
et al. [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] found that annual chlamydia screening cost 2350 per quality adjusted life year gained compared to no screening and thus
would be considered very cost-effective compared to other health care
interventions. In our analysis, where equal
infection rates are seen between intervention groups, the cost per health
benefit gained depends on the benefits of greater testing frequency for infected
women and their partners. Unfortunately,
these benefits cannot be estimated based on present data, a limitation of our
analysis.</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>4. CONCLUSIONS</title><p>A home testing
intervention for chlamydia and gonorrhea, while increasing testing rates, has
the potential to be cost saving when the direct and indirect costs of avoided
clinic visits are considered. The cost
equation depends in large part on whether changes in clinic testing frequency and
STD detection occur as a result. Home
testing effects on clinic testing frequency in other populations and on
individual and population health in localities with more limited health
services require further research.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Cook</surname><given-names>RL</given-names></name><name><surname>Ostergaard</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Hillier</surname><given-names>SL</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Home screening for sexually transmitted diseases in high-risk young women: randomised controlled trial</article-title><source><italic>Sexually Transmitted Infections</italic></source><year>2007</year><volume>83</volume><issue>4</issue><fpage>286</fpage><lpage>291</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">17301105</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ostergaard</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Andersen</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Olesen</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Moller</surname><given-names>JK</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Efficacy of home sampling for screening of <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic> randomised study</article-title><source><italic>British Medical Journal</italic></source><year>1998</year><volume>317</volume><issue>7150</issue><fpage>26</fpage><lpage>27</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">9651263</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ostergaard</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Andersen</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Moller</surname><given-names>JK</given-names></name><name><surname>Olesen</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Home sampling versus conventional swab sampling for screening of

testing frequency occurring due to a home testing program that fall in the area
below the line (e.g., the &#x0201c;X&#x0201d;) indicate that cost savings would occur with that program. Points above the line (e.g., the open square)
