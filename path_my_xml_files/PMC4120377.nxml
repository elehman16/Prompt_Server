<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> The majority of skin cancers are treated by surgical excision<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> which is increasingly being performed in outpatient and primary care settings.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> As the majority of skin cancer surgery takes place in general practice in Australia,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> it is important to study infection rates in this setting. Skin lesion excisions form a large proportion of a typical Australian general practitioner's (GPs) workload, and this proportion is even greater for Queensland GPs, given that this State has the highest incidence of skin cancer.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> General practice dermatological surgery may differ from a hospital setting, with most procedures taking place in treatment rooms rather than in formal operating theatres.</p><p>Surgical site infection (SSI) is one of the few complications of this relatively minor surgery. These infections often require antibiotics and repeat consultations to assess wound healing. They can potentially lead to significant bacteraemic complications and impair cosmetic outcome.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> The acceptable rate of infection following clean minor surgery (class 1) is less than 5%.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8&#x02013;12</xref> This is reflected in skin lesion excisions, with a rate of between 1% and 3% in most studies.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13&#x02013;18</xref> The exceptions are studies conducted by the present authors in 2005 and 2009 which reported infection rates of 8.6% and 11.7%.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> The reason for this higher infection rate remains unclear, but might be related to tropical humidity. Even within cohorts with a low overall incidence of infection, some procedures may be at higher risk because of the body site, pathology or patient factors and infection rates may be greater than 5% in these high-risk groups. Previously identified risk factors include excisions from the region of the lower leg, ear and nose,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>

<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02014;have suggested that a single oral dose of perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis may be indicated in certain &#x02018;high risk&#x02019; situations such as excisions from the lower limb. If effective, this may be a low-cost and easily implemented method of reducing the incidence of SSI in selected situations. Recommendations such as these are however yet to be tested in clinical trials.</p><p>This trial sought to determine the efficacy of a 2&#x02005;g dose of cephalexin given 30&#x02013;60&#x02005;min prior to skin lesion excision from the lower limb in preventing the subsequent development of an SSI.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methodology</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Trial design</title><p>We carried out a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial involving patients presenting for minor skin excisions from the lower limb.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Setting and participants</title><p>The study was conducted in two private general practices in Mackay, Queensland (latitude 21E8S; inhabitants 77&#x02005;293<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) between September 2011 and May 2012. One of the participating practices was an open access designated skin cancer clinic which was run by two GPs specialising in skin cancer management. The other centre offered a full range of primary care services and all doctors working at the practice were involved in the study.</p><p>Consecutive patients presenting at either practice for a skin lesion excision from the lower limb were invited to participate. Exclusion criteria are shown in <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="bx1">box 1</xref>.

A body site map was used to record the excision site. At the end of the study, practice nurses were asked to re-examine computer records to fill in any missing data. The principal researcher visited participating GPs and practice nurses prior to the start of and regularly during the trial to ensure that data collection was standardised.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Intervention and control</title><p>The intervention arm of the trial consisted of a 2&#x02005;g dose of cephalexin administered 30&#x02013;60&#x02005;min before an excision. The cephalexin (Keflex 500&#x02005;mg capsules)was compounded into generic gel capsules (SurgiPack Empty Gelatine Capsules, Size &#x02018;00&#x02019;, 0.95&#x02005;mL capacity). Rice flour was used to fill the placebo capsules as it had an identical appearance to the cephalexin powder and no foreseeable adverse effects. Each dose consisted of four capsules filled with either cephalexin or rice flour.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Randomisation and blinding</title><p>A computer-generated random number table was used to randomise a consecutive sequence of numbers into two groups&#x02014;intervention and control&#x02014;in permuted blocks of 20 with a 1:1 ratio.

The content of the individual jar was known only to the principal researcher who had no direct involvement with participants or in data collection. All others involved in the trial were blinded to the capsule identity.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Participant recruitment and trial protocol</title><p>Eligible participants were identified by a practice nurse or doctor at the time of their pre-excision appointment.

The excision was performed using an aseptic technique and skin preparation with 2% chlorhexidine solution. Wounds were dressed with non-waterproof adhesive fabric dressings. Patients were provided with verbal and written instructions regarding wound care, including the need for wounds to be kept dry and covered for the first 2&#x02005;days and for topical antiseptics or antibiotics not to be used. Time to removal of sutures (ROS) was 12&#x02013;16&#x02005;days at the treating doctor's discretion.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Outcome measures</title><p>Wounds were assessed for infection by the practice nurse or doctor at the time of ROS, or sooner if patients re-presented earlier with a perceived infection.

Based on these findings, the NNT with prophylactic cephalexin was 4.31 in order to prevent one infection following excision from the lower limb.

Furthermore, a slower than predicted recruitment rate, and time constraints of the honours research project, resulted in the trial being terminated well before the calculated sample size was achieved. As such, this trial was unable to address the proposed hypothesis and no definitive conclusions can be drawn from it on the actual efficacy of antibiotic prophylaxis.</p><p>Various characteristics influence SSI and although information on as many variables as possible was recorded, it is difficult to ensure that all baseline data are comparable. Several characteristics did vary notably between the prophylaxis and placebo groups in this study. Given that the study was underpowered and did not achieve statistical significance, it was decided not to pursue adjustment for these imbalances using multiple logistic regression. Future studies, appropriately powered to address this hypothesis, will need to adjust for such baseline difference as well as consider cluster analysis based on individual GPs to limit the confounding effect on variable training, experience and outcomes among practitioners.</p><p>Even when using guidelines, the diagnosis of infection is still subjective and there may be interobserver and intraobserver variation.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> The 1992 CDC definition of SSI that we chose to use has limitations. However, it is the most widely implemented standard definition of wound infection<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> and is the closest to a gold standard available. We have no evidence to support intrapractice and interpractice reproducibility of measurement and recording procedures.

<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> The underlying reason for this is uncertain, but may be related to the majority of the excisions being from below the knee, a site that has previously been identified as being at an even higher risk of infection. Furthermore, the infection rate in studies conducted in Mackay has consistently been higher than that reported in other centres. This further adds to the argument that climate/environmental factors may be important determinants of SSI following skin lesion excision. Owing to the higher than expected infection rate, there may be limitations to extrapolating these results to other centres, where the baseline infection is lower. However, similar relative reductions have been produced with prophylactic regimens, including single dose parenteral antibiotics, in settings with lower baseline infection rates (<xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2014005270TB4">table 4</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="BMJOPEN2014005270TB4" position="float"><label>Table&#x000a0;4</label><caption><p>Studies of systemic antibiotic prophylaxis for skin lesion excision</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/></colgroup><thead valign="bottom"><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Study, country</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Setting and sample size</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Intervention and control</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Wound type</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Infection rate (relative reduction)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Amland <italic>et al</italic>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Norway</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Plastic surgery unit, 60 patients</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control: placebo<break/>Intervention: single dose 1000&#x02005;mg orally azithromycin the night before surgery</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Skin cancer surgery</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control: 16.0%<break/>Azithromycin: 5.7% (0.36)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Bencini <italic>et al</italic>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Italy</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Outpatient dermatologic surgery unit,<break/>527 patients</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">A: no prophylaxis<break/>B: 1&#x02005;g intramuscular cefazolin 12 hourly for 48&#x02005;h before and after surgery<break/>C: 1&#x02005;g intramuscular cefazolin 12 hourly from 2&#x02005;h before surgery to 24&#x02005;h after<break/>D: single 1&#x02005;g intramuscular dose cefazolin 2&#x02005;h before surgery</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Excisions from contamination- prone areas (groin, axillae, interdigital spaces of feet)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">A: 12%<break/>B: 4.6% (0.38)*<break/>C: 0.77% (0.064)*<break/>D: 2% (0.17)*</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Czarnecki <italic>et al</italic>,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Australia</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Outpatient dermatology clinic,<break/>97 lesions</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Intervention 1: 500&#x02005;mg orally cephalexin three times a day, starting 2&#x02005;days before and continuing 24&#x02005;h postoperatively<break/>Intervention 2: topical mupirocin three times a day from 2&#x02005;days before and continuing 24&#x02005;h postoperatively<break/>Control: cetrimide-chlorhexidine cream 2&#x02005;days before and continuing 24&#x02005;h postoperatively</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Ulcerated skin cancers which cultured positive for <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> or Gram-negative bacteria</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control: 21.7%<break/>Intervention 1: 2.7% (0.12)*<break/>Intervention 2: 0% (0)*</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Bencini <italic>et al</italic>,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Italy</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Outpatient dermatologic surgery unit,<break/>2165 patients</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">A: no antibiotic<break/>B: 1&#x02005;g intramuscular cefazolin 12 hourly immediately after surgery continuing for 3&#x02005;days<break/>C: 250&#x02005;mg cefazolin powder applied locally during surgery<break/>D: 1&#x02005;g cefazolin intramuscular 12 hourly starting 2&#x02005;days before and continuing 2&#x02005;days after surgery</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Excision of skin lesions</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">A: 4.3%<break/>B: 1.5% (0.35)*<break/>C: 0.9% (0.21)*<break/>D: 0.2% (0.047)*</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>*Statistically significant reduction compared to control.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>Antibiotic prophylaxis is probably prescribed excessively or inappropriately for dermatological surgery and is thought to be best reserved for high-risk patients such as excisions from the lower limb.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
