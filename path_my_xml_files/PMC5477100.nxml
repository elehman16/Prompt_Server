These children are also at risk of significant morbidity, with acute and chronic impact on the family and the health and social care systems. The current recommended first-choice, second-line treatment in children aged 6&#x000a0;months and above is intravenous phenytoin (fosphenytoin in the USA), although there is a lack of evidence for its use and it is associated with significant side effects. Emerging evidence suggests that intravenous levetiracetam may be effective as a second-line agent for CSE, and fewer adverse effects have been described. This trial therefore aims to determine whether intravenous phenytoin or levetiracetam is more effective, and safer, in treating childhood CSE.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>This is a phase IV, multi-centre, parallel group, randomised controlled, open-label trial. Following treatment for CSE with first-line treatment, children with ongoing seizures are randomised to receive either phenytoin (20&#x000a0;mg/kg, maximum 2&#x000a0;g) or levetiracetam (40&#x000a0;mg/kg, maximum 2.5&#x000a0;g) intravenously. The primary outcome measure is the cessation of all visible signs of CSE as determined by the treating clinician. Secondary outcome measures include the need for further anti-seizure medications or rapid sequence induction for ongoing CSE, admission to critical care areas, and serious adverse reactions. Patients are recruited without prior consent, with deferred consent sought at an appropriate time for the family. The primary analysis will be by intention-to-treat. The primary outcome is a time to event outcome and a sample size of 140 participants in each group will have 80% power to detect an increase in CSE cessation rates from 60% to 75%. Our total sample size of 308 randomised and treated participants will allow for 10% loss to follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This clinical trial will determine whether phenytoin or levetiracetam is more effective as an intravenous second-line agent for CSE, and provide evidence for management recommendations. In addition, this trial will also provide data on which of these therapies is safer in this setting.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ISRCTN identifier, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN22567894">ISRCTN22567894</ext-link>.

It is the second most common reason for unplanned admission to paediatric intensive care units (PICUs) in the UK, accounting for 5.6% of all PICU admissions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. These children are also at increased risk of irreversible morbidity including chronic drug-resistant epilepsy, neurodisability, and learning difficulties, which result in major long-term demands on acute and chronic health and social care resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>The current UK emergency care pathway for the management of childhood CSE is the step-wise algorithm advocated in advanced paediatric life support (APLS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. First-line treatment is two doses of a benzodiazepine given 10&#x000a0;min apart; if the child continues to fit 10&#x000a0;min after the second dose of benzodiazepine, a second-line anticonvulsant is administered. APLS recommends phenytoin as the first-choice second-line anticonvulsant; if the child is allergic to phenytoin, has previously not responded to it, or has experienced a serious adverse event (SAE), phenobarbital is recommended. Failure to stop CSE necessitates rapid sequence induction (RSI), intubation, and admission to the PICU, with consequent potential for iatrogenic consequences including pneumonia, hospital-acquired infections, and prolonged admission.</p><p>There is an absence of randomised evidence to support the use of phenytoin as the second-line anticonvulsant despite its use as a standard intravenous (IV) anticonvulsant for the treatment of CSE since the 1940s. A retrospective case note review in which 87% (331/381) children administered a second-line anticonvulsant received phenytoin reported seizure cessation in 190 cases (50%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. There is considerably more literature on phenytoin&#x02019;s potential adverse effects, including potentially fatal cardiac arrhythmias and Stevens-Johnson syndrome (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The risk of a cardiac arrhythmia is related to the rate of infusion and phenytoin is therefore infused over at least 20&#x000a0;min.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Comparison of phenytoin and levetiracetam</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th>Phenytoin</th><th>Levetiracetam</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Easy to administer<sup>a</sup>

</p><p>Levetiracetam is a broad-spectrum anticonvulsant which effectively treats focal and generalised tonic-clonic and myoclonic seizures. A growing body of evidence, predominantly but not exclusively anecdotal, suggests that IV levetiracetam is safe and effective in the treatment of acute repetitive seizures and both convulsive and non-convulsive status epilepticus, with reported seizure cessation rates between 76 and 100% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Both levetiracetam and lorazepam seem to be equally effective in terminating CSE (relative risk 0.97, 95% confidence interval 0.44 to 2.13) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. A systematic review published in 2012 indicated that efficacy ranged from 44 to 94% with reported higher rates in retrospective studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Reported IV levetiracetam doses range from 20 to 60&#x000a0;mg/kg with infrequent and mild adverse effects even at the upper extreme of the dose range [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. These include dizziness, somnolence, headache, and transient agitation, but there have been no reports of arrhythmias, hypotension, tissue extravasation reactions, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, or hepatotoxicity (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Levetiracetam can be infused over 5&#x02013;7&#x000a0;min, which suggests that, theoretically, CSE may be terminated more rapidly than with phenytoin. Consequently, a reasonable hypothesis is that levetiracetam may be more effective and safer than intravenous phenytoin in terminating CSE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p>CSE management has been identified as a key priority area for research by a number of sources including the national paediatric emergency medicine research network (Paediatric Emergency Research in the United Kingdom &#x00026; Ireland; PERUKI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] in their inaugural prioritisation exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in their update of their national epilepsy guideline published in January 2012 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. A high-quality randomised controlled trial (RCT) is therefore essential to determine whether phenytoin or levetiracetam is the ideal drug in CSE, as highlighted in the recent systematic review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>The EcLiPSE study (Emergency treatment with Levetiracetam or Phenytoin in Status Epilepticus in children) is a phase IV, multi-centre, parallel group, randomised controlled, open-label trial comparing IV levetiracetam with IV phenytoin. The study objectives are to determine which treatment is: 1) more effective as a second-line anticonvulsant for the management of childhood CSE; 2) associated with fewer adverse effects.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p>The protocol for this study has been written in accordance with the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) checklist (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study setting</title><p>Thirty Emergency Departments (ED) throughout all regions of the UK are participating, selected from the membership of PERUKI, a collaborative paediatric emergency medicine research network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].

Reporting procedures are determined by the nature of the event and investigators are provided with explanatory algorithms. All adverse events (AEs) up to 24&#x000a0;h after allocated treatment administration are recorded. Local investigators assign the severity of AEs as mild, moderate, or severe in line with definitions provided. A distinction is drawn between serious and severe AEs, and a severe AE need not necessarily be a serious AE (SAE). An AE whose causal relationship to the study drug is assessed as &#x0201c;possible&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;probable&#x0201d;, or &#x0201c;definite&#x0201d; is an adverse reaction (AR). Although ARs are not expected to occur more than 24&#x000a0;h following randomised treatment, investigators will report any AEs they feel are related, regardless of timing. Local investigators assign causality, though if there is doubt the Chief Investigator (CI) is notified.</p><p>On receipt of an SAE form, an assessment of expectedness is made by the CI. Serious unexpected events judged to be possibly, probably, or almost certainly related to the IMP are reported as suspected unexpected SARs (SUSARs). SARs, SAEs, and SUSARs are reported within 24&#x000a0;h of the local site becoming aware of the event, with additional information within 5&#x000a0;days if it is unresolved at the time of the initial report. Regulatory agencies, research ethics committees (RECs), PIs, and trial committees are notified of all SUSARs occurring during the study. All AEs are followed-up until the local PI deems there to be satisfactory resolution, the event is chronic, or the participant is stable.</p><p>Incorrect administration or overdose of IMP (20% or more above the recommended dose) is recorded. If this results in an AE or SAE, reporting occurs as previously described. Deaths during the reporting period are recorded as SAEs. The event or condition that caused or contributed to death is recorded, though if it is unknown it is recorded as &#x0201c;unexplained death&#x0201d;. If the cause of death subsequently becomes known, this is recorded.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Trial monitoring</title><p>Quality control and quality assurance measures are in place to ensure that all elements of the EcLiPSE study are performed in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. These are undertaken by the Trial Management Group (TMG), TSC, and IDSMC. An investigators&#x02019; meeting was hosted by the TMG, attended by PIs and site research nurses, to provide an overview of the EcLiPSE study. Site initiation visits are performed to deliver trial-specific training to key clinical and research personnel, which is subsequently cascaded to all relevant staff. Training and delegation logs are monitored for completeness, and appropriate approvals must be in place prior to site initiation. Screening, randomisation, and consent rates are monitored, and data are checked for consistency and missing or unusual values, with suspect data returned to the site as data queries to ensure their reliability and validity. The sponsor may also undertake site audits throughout the trial.</p><p>Independent oversight is provided by the IDSMC and independent members of the TSC. The IDSMC reviews and assesses recruitment, interim analysis of safety and effectiveness, trial conduct, and external data, and provides recommendations to the TSC concerning study continuation. The Haybittle-Peto approach will be employed for interim analyses with 99.9% confidence intervals but decisions around trial continuation will not be based on <italic>p</italic> values alone.

It is an example of paediatric research in an emergency situation and consequently has to involve either waived or deferred consent; waived consent is ethically unacceptable in this setting and research without prior consent will be a new concept to many participating centres. However, deferred consent was not an issue in a previous paediatric emergency research study, the results of which led to a change in national policy and practice in the management of paediatric CSE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Early input and advice was obtained through patient and public involvement and all site training includes a video scenario of a professional mock interview in which the study is discussed and deferred consent is explained, processes designed to maximise recruitment into EcLiPSE. Early engagement with PERUKI optimised success through collaboration with clinicians and researchers in the development and delivery of the study, together with the selection of the most appropriate sites in which to recruit patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Trial status</title><p>Recruitment to this study commenced in July 2015, and to date 160 patients have been enrolled.

</p><p>Consent for participation is therefore by deferred consent (research without prior consent) in line with applicable regulatory requirements, ethical principles, and guidance on consent in critical care settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].

Legal representatives/parents/patients (hereafter called &#x0201c;participants&#x0201d;) are asked to agree to the use of data and blood sample analysis that have been collected, and to continue participation in the trial. Participants are approached as soon as is reasonable after randomisation; ideally within 24&#x000a0;h, but longer if the family is felt to need more time (for example, if the patient&#x02019;s condition remains critical or unstable). Research staff and clinical staff work together to identify the most appropriate time point at which to approach the family on a case-by-case basis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p><p>The participants are provided with the appropriate Participant Information and Consent/Assent forms, which includes general information (including why deferred consent is used in critical care research, that participation in the trial is voluntary, and that the participant may withdraw from the trial at any time and for any reason) and study-specific information (including the objectives, risks and inconveniences, and conditions under which the study is conducted). All participants are asked to read and review the document and are provided with the opportunity to ask questions, discuss the study, and have time to consider the information prior to giving consent.</p><p>If consent is not sought prior to hospital discharge the family is contacted by telephone within 5 working days of randomisation to inform them of their child&#x02019;s involvement and provide study details. They are posted further study information and a covering letter which confirms that if no response is received within 4&#x000a0;weeks the participant will automatically be included in the trial. If consent is not obtained prior to transfer to another hospital (for example, for PICU care) and the receiving hospital is an EcLiPSE site, then consent will be sought at the receiving site wherever possible.</p><p>On the very rare occasion where the patient dies before consent is sought the local clinical, bereavement, and research teams work together to develop a bespoke approach for the family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].

Options include approaching the family before they leave hospital or sending information by post 4&#x000a0;weeks later. Where postal communication is used, unless the family notify the team that they wish to withdraw, data already collected are used in the study.
