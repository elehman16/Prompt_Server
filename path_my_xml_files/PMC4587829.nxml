Care home residents in the United Kingdom are especially vulnerable, with an estimated 30 to 42&#x000a0;% at risk. Evidence for nutritional interventions to address PEM in the care home setting is lacking. Widely used techniques include food-based intervention and/or the use of prescribed oral nutritional supplements. To define outcomes and optimise the design for an adequately powered definitive trial to compare the efficacy of established nutritional interventions in this setting, a cluster randomised feasibility trial with a 6-month intervention was undertaken.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Care home residents with or at risk of malnutrition were identified across six UK care home sites from September to December 2013. Homes were cluster randomised to standard care (SC), food-based intervention (FB) or oral nutritional supplement intervention (ONS), for 6&#x000a0;months. Key outcomes were trial feasibility and the acceptability of design, allocated interventions and outcome assessments. Anthropometry, dietary intake, healthcare resource usage and participant-reported outcome measures were assessed at baseline and at 3 and 6&#x000a0;months.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>All six care homes approached were recruited and retained. Of the 110 residents at risk of malnutrition, 85&#x000a0;% entered the trial, and 68&#x000a0;% completed the 6-month intervention. Pre-specified success criteria for feasibility were met for recruitment and retention, intervention acceptability (resident compliance &#x02265;60&#x000a0;%) and measurement of weight, body mass index (BMI), mid-upper arm circumference and dietary intake (data completeness &#x0003e;80&#x000a0;%). Measurement of handgrip strength and triceps skinfold thickness was not found to be feasible in this population. The 95&#x000a0;% confidence interval (CI) data suggested sensitivity to change in dietary intake for weight, BMI and energy intake between baseline and 3&#x000a0;months when each intervention (FB and ONS) was compared with SC.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>A definitive trial comparing the efficacy of nutritional support interventions in increasing weight and BMI in malnourished care home residents can be conducted. However, whilst the design was feasible, this trial has highlighted the lack of clinically and patient-relevant outcome measures that are appropriate for use in this setting for both research and clinical practice. In particular, this trial identified a need for a more simple measure of functional status, which considers the limitations of functional tests in the care home population.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Current Controlled Trials <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN38047922">ISRCTN38047922</ext-link>, Date assigned: 22 April 2014.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13063-015-0952-2) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>malnutrition</kwd><kwd>nutrition support</kwd><kwd>oral nutritional supplements</kwd><kwd>sip feeds</kwd><kwd>care homes</kwd><kwd>Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool (MUST)</kwd><kwd>elderly</kwd><kwd>nutritional intervention</kwd><kwd>nutritional risk</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Often under-recognised and under-treated, protein energy malnutrition (PEM) develops when energy intake and/or protein intake chronically fail to meet the body&#x02019;s nutritional requirements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. It can affect virtually every function and organ system of the human body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], predisposing individuals to disease and delaying recovery from illness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In the UK, more than 1 million people over the age of 65 are malnourished or at risk of PEM, and the vast majority (93&#x000a0;%) are residents in a community setting. In 2007, the health and social care costs associated with malnutrition were estimated to exceed &#x000a3;13 billion annually, more than 10&#x000a0;% of the public expenditure on health care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>Care homes are arguably home to one of the UK&#x02019;s most vulnerable populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], 30&#x000a0;% to 42&#x000a0;% of whom are estimated to be at risk of malnutrition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. PEM significantly impacts the physical and emotional well-being of care home residents and has been linked to increased vulnerability to infection and pressure ulcers, clinical complications, depression and decreased quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Evidence for nutritional strategies to address malnutrition in the care home setting is lacking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Widely used dietetic techniques to enhance oral dietary intakes in care homes include food-based intervention (recipe enrichment or fortification of conventional food to increase energy and/or protein density, provision of nourishing snacks and/or fortified drinks) and/or the use of prescribed oral nutritional supplements (ONS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], considered to be &#x02018;dietary foods for special medical purposes&#x02019; (FSMPs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The British Dietetic Association (BDA) and The National Prescribing Centre (NPC) advocate improving dietary intake first using fortification of conventional food and secondly by prescribed means [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] However, few trials have evaluated the food-based approach, and whether this type of intervention is able to improve clinical outcomes for malnourished individuals remains unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>The use of conventional food-based intervention is considered more economical to the National Health Service (NHS) in England than prescribed ONS. In 2011, ONS incurred an annual cost of &#x000a3;105 million, a 10&#x000a0;% increase from 2010. Many General Practitioner (GP) practices identified the significant and increasing costs of ONS at this time, often accompanied by prolonged and inappropriate prescribing. Medicines Management teams subsequently imposed stricter prescribing guidance and encouraged greater use of conventional food-based intervention before or in place of prescribed intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. However, the development of initiatives to reduce ONS usage prompted concerns about delayed appropriate prescribing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. A number of individual components make up complex healthcare interventions such as nutritional support in the care home setting, making it difficult to specify the &#x02018;active ingredient&#x02019; of the intervention and to compare intervention variations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] Whilst there may be potential to improve oral dietary intake in a variety of ways and by using interventions in combination, it is important to establish the effectiveness of both conventional food-based and prescribed ONS interventions to ensure that the most appropriate nutrition support is initiated promptly for vulnerable individuals to minimise further deterioration in nutritional status.</p><p>Existing Systematic reviews of nutritional interventions for PEM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] have tended to focus on the effectiveness of ONS compared with placebo or standard care and have been predominantly conducted within the acute setting. A Cochrane meta-analysis, which evaluated the effectiveness of ONS in malnourished older adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] reported a small but consistent weight gain with ONS, but the inclusion of primary outcomes of relevance to patients, such as functional measures and quality of life, were lacking, whilst severely malnourished individuals were frequently excluded for ethical reasons. A Cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis was the first to evaluate the impact of dietary advice and/or food-based intervention on PEM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The evidence from the review suggests that dietary advice and intervention for PEM may improve weight and indicators of muscle mass, with or without ONS, but the findings are not specific to the older adult population. Whereas most of the included trials provided information on the duration of the intervention, there was almost no information on the nature, intensity and content of the food-based interventions. The review also highlighted a complete lack of evidence for the effects of food-based intervention on patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), which are an important determinant of intervention effectiveness.</p><p>No systematic review to date has made any specific conclusions regarding nutritional interventions for the treatment of PEM in the care home setting. There is a tendency to avoid research in care homes because of the methodological issues involved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], and the majority of epidemiological studies either exclude care home residents at the outset or fail to follow up participants when they move into institutional care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The challenges inherent in care home research has led to nutritional intervention trials in this setting that have excluded those with advanced dementia or immobility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], despite these being well-established risk factors for malnutrition. As a result, knowledge of the actual effectiveness of the dietetic interventions for malnutrition that are currently used with this vulnerable population is limited and the clinical applicability of findings to those residents most at risk is often questionable. The lack of evidence to support best practice provides an opportunity to bring new ideas to the field.</p><p>To enable the efficacy of these widely used dietetic interventions to be compared within the care home population, an adequately powered randomised controlled trial (RCT) is required. In light of the lack of adequately powered trials with a low risk of bias that have evaluated nutrition support interventions within the care home setting, a feasibility trial was proposed prior to the initiation of a definitive RCT. In this feasibility trial, the research aim was to explore trial design, staff and resident acceptability of the interventions and outcome measures and to provide data to estimate the parameters required to design a definitive RCT.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><p>This feasibility trial has been reported with reference to the CONSORT guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] [Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Trial design</title><p>The trial was conducted in 2013&#x02013;2014 as a prospective cluster randomised feasibility trial.

The REC approved the consent, randomisation and intervention taking place at the care home level. However, the committee felt that the inclusion of residents lacking capacity in the collection of PROMs could not be justified in accordance with the Mental Capacity Act [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. They requested that those residents having capacity to complete PROMs, provide individual consent for this part. A joint Data Monitoring Committee/Trial Steering Committee, which included three independent members (a statistician; a dietitian and a member of a patient and public involvement panel), was established prior to trial commencement (August 2013). The DMC/TSC met in January, April and July 2014 to review AEs, mortality and intervention changes. A final meeting was held in November 2014 to discuss the trial findings and inform the evaluation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Study settings</title><p>The feasibility trial was conducted within the borough of Solihull, West Midlands, in England. Prior to trial commencement, the care and catering staff in 17 care homes providing accommodation for older adults (over 65&#x000a0;years) were receiving regular dietetic input to improve the first-line management of malnutrition. Six, privately owned care homes, selected by purposive sampling to obtain a diverse sample based on type of care provided (residential or nursing/nursing and residential) were invited to take part in the trial. None of the care homes had previously been involved in any research.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Participants</title><p>Recruitment began in September 2013 and concluded in December 2013.<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Care homes (clusters)</p></list-item></list></p><p>Prospective participating care homes were provided with an information sheet and a full explanation of the trial by the Primary Researcher, a registered dietitian with a history of clinical input in all six homes.

The ICC can be used to determine the increase in variance due to clustering, referred to as the Design Effect (DE), which varies for each outcome measure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. Further searching of the existing literature and further piloting within the older adult care home population is required first so as to identify the most appropriate primary outcome measure for a definitive trial and to estimate the population variance of the outcome. The desired power and significance level can be used alongside the anticipated difference between means (effect size), estimated from the literature and pilot work, to calculate the size of the sample that would be required if no clustering was present. The calculated DE can then be used to estimate the necessary inflation of the sample size (compared to that calculated for an individually randomised trial) to take account of the similarities in the clustered data:</p></sec><sec id="Sec35"><title>Change in outcomes</title><p>To inform which outcome measures are most appropriate to take forwards to a definitive trial, the sensitivity of the outcome measures to the change in oral dietary intake on the introduction of nutritional interventions was assessed by comparing the mean change in outcomes between the intervention arms at 3 and 6&#x000a0;months.

As with T1, this was not observed when the FB and ONS intervention arms were compared. The mean change in kcal from baseline to 6&#x000a0;months is less than the added intervention for both of the dietetic-led intervention arms, suggesting that not all of the residents were compliant with the interventions, and some may have reduced their intake of other foods and drinks. The mean change in weight and in BMI over the full 6-month intervention was negative in the SC arm, compared with positive change in each of the dietetic-led intervention arms.

With commitment from staff and management, it was possible to obtain consent from six care homes and to identify 93 residents who were eligible to receive the allocated interventions, meeting the recruitment targets for homes and residents. The success criteria for the retention of care homes and residents throughout the trial were also met; however, resident mortality was high, particularly during the initial 3&#x000a0;months. The three nutritional interventions were considered acceptable to care home residents and staff on the basis of low crossover rates, satisfaction of the success criteria for resident compliance and high staff adherence to the intervention schedules. Of the outcome measures piloted, weight, BMI, MAC and nutritional intake were found to be feasible and acceptable measurements to undertake in this population, meeting the success criteria for data completeness and consideration for use within a definitive trial. Although the trial was not powered to examine intervention outcomes, the direction of effect for weight, BMI and energy intake was in favour of the FB and ONS interventions, highlighting sensitivity to a change in oral dietary intake for these outcome measures.</p><p>The following discussion reviews the key findings of the trial in terms of the feasibility and acceptability objectives.</p><sec id="Sec38"><title>Recruitment and retention</title><p>All six care homes provided written consent and remained in the trial until completion. Prior to trial commencement, the Primary Researcher had established good working relationships with the care home managers and staff within a clinical role. This existing rapport may have been central to successful recruitment and in enabling specific roles to be allocated to staff during the trial process. In a definitive trial, it may be necessary to build in time for researcher visits to potential care homes to establish trust and good communication prior to starting recruitment.</p><p>MUST&#x02019; screening across the six care homes identified 110 residents (39&#x000a0;%) at risk of malnutrition, a similar percentage to that reported within another care home nutritional intervention trial conducted in Hampshire (37&#x000a0;%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. A total of 84.5&#x000a0;% of those at risk met the eligibility criteria to enter the trial, enabling the recruitment target to be met and supporting the case for a definitive trial in this setting. A large proportion (75&#x000a0;%) of the eligible population presented with a primary diagnosis of dementia. The decision was made to include residents with dementia in order to assess feasibility and acceptability of the trial design with a representative care home population. Assessment of resident characteristics at baseline highlighted imbalances between the intervention arms and indicates a need to recruit a large number of care homes within a definitive trial to increase the likelihood of producing balance across cluster-level covariates. The minimum number of clusters recommended per arm to ensure statistical validity is at least 4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>].</p><p>Despite the fragility of the participating population, it was possible to complete follow-up on 68&#x000a0;% of the residents, thereby achieving the retention target at 6&#x000a0;months. Mortality was the primary reason for residents leaving the trial (23 of 93 in 6&#x000a0;months, 25&#x000a0;%) and appeared to be associated with &#x02018;MUST&#x02019; risk category (17 of 23 were high risk, 74&#x000a0;%). Of the 23 residents that passed away, 20 (87&#x000a0;%) had died by month 3, suggesting that at least a proportion may have been nearing end-of-life at recruitment. Although being on an end-of-life care pathway was defined as an exclusion criteria, the restrictions imposed by the approving REC required care home staff to assess resident eligibility and those responsible may have found it challenging to distinguish between residents that may benefit from nutritional intervention and those that were end-stage palliative. In a definitive trial, not subject to the same ethical restrictions, dietetic assessment using a validated method, such as, The Subjective Global Assessment (SGA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>] could be considered following &#x02018;MUST&#x02019; screening to identify where malnutrition is an indication of end-stage disease, as opposed to an indication of inadequate nutritional intake that may respond to intervention.</p></sec><sec id="Sec39"><title>Acceptability of the interventions</title><p>The small percentage of crossover and adverse events overall (&#x0003c;10&#x000a0;%), suggests that all three interventions were largely acceptable to residents and to staff monitoring nutritional status. The feasibility success criteria for compliance were met, with over 60&#x000a0;% of the residents assigned to FB and to ONS compliant with 450 to 600&#x000a0;kcal/day and over 80&#x000a0;% compliant with at least 300 to 450&#x000a0;kcal/day. Compliance with FB was higher than ONS at 3 and 6&#x000a0;months, perhaps due to the greater variety and flexibility offered by this intervention.</p><p>A systematic review conducted in 2012 identified 46 studies of ONS intervention (nine in the care home setting), which included compliance data. Greater compliance was noted with reduced volume, energy-dense ONS (1.5 to 2&#x000a0;kcal/ml) and when a variety of flavours was offered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>], both of which are reported in clinical practice. In this feasibility trial, the ONS were supplied free of charge by two medical nutrition companies, and the bottle size and flavours delivered were dictated by availability. In a fully funded definitive trial, ONS compliance may be improved by specifying use of the 1.5&#x000a0;kcal/ml ONS bottles and by offering residents a choice of flavours. Further qualitative work being undertaken aims to explore the influence of resident and care staff attitudes to FB and ONS intervention on compliance.</p></sec><sec id="Sec40"><title>Acceptability and feasibility of the outcome measures and data collection methods</title><p>In order to ensure clinical applicability, it was decided that as much data as possible should be collected using methods consistent with usual procedures. Height was collected from &#x02018;MUST&#x02019; records for 100&#x000a0;% of residents at baseline. The measurement techniques used had been clearly documented. The majority had been measured using a freestanding stadiometer (66&#x000a0;%), but where this was not possible, estimation by ulna length was the most frequently used alternative measure (31&#x000a0;%). Surrogate methods of height estimation are required for those who are bedridden, confined to a wheelchair or unable to stand straight. The documented use of the technique highlights the importance of training on nutritional assessment prior to research or within clinical practice to increase the efficiency and completeness of documentation.</p><p>Measured body weight and calculated BMI were collected from &#x02018;MUST&#x02019; documentation at the three data collection intervals. Just one resident had not been weighed at baseline, following a decline in clinical condition and a decision by staff that weighing would be an unnecessary burden. It was possible to retrieve the required information for the remaining 92 residents at baseline and 100&#x000a0;% of the residents remaining at 3 and 6&#x000a0;months. Throughout the trial, only one resident was weighed using different types of scale, justified by the staff, in terms of reduced mobility at the 3-month interval. The success criteria for weight and BMI were achieved, indicating that assessment is acceptable to the majority of residents and is feasible for staff to undertake.</p><p>The most widely used method of estimating resident food intake was already being used in all six homes; the assessment of mealtime servings as a whole, following which a proportion consumed is assigned. The majority of FRCs and FCs were available and complete, meeting the success criteria for data completeness. However, limitations relating to the usefulness of the data were observed. Studies that have evaluated the accuracy of care home staff documentation of dietary intake have shown it to be erroneous when compared to independent assessments made by research staff [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. In this trial, the Primary Researcher did not have capacity to observe resident food and fluid intake and in a definitive trial, intake assessment by research staff would risk losing an important element of testing interventions in the &#x02018;real world&#x02019; setting. Improvements in the accuracy of recording could be made by taking photographs of the plate before and after mealtimes. A validation study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>] found this method to be reliable and time-efficient and a possible solution for increasing the accuracy of estimation.</p><p>MUAC is included in the &#x02018;MUST&#x02019; as an alternative measure for BMI. The MUAC assessment was found to be acceptable to the majority of residents (88&#x000a0;%), enabling the success criteria to be met. A recent cross-sectional care home study, which compared two observers independently assessing MUAC on three occasions over an 8-day period found no systematic differences between observers and concluded that MUAC is acceptable for clinical use in a care home setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. Training and use of a standardised protocol would, however, be essential to ensure accurate and appropriate measurements are undertaken by different observers in a definitive trial.</p><p>An average of 76&#x000a0;% of residents in the trial had TSF measured, narrowly missing the success criteria for data completeness. A number of challenges were encountered during measuring, including difficulties encouraging residents to be still, inappropriate positioning of bedridden residents and anxiety in relation to the visual perception of the calliper. This experience suggests that it may prove challenging to accurately perform the measurement in a population with fluctuating capacity and challenging behaviours. Primary problems associated with the TSF measurement include measurement error due to poor technique and substantial differences when measurements are made on the same individual by different observers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. These sources of error are likely to be emphasised in the care home population, limiting potential use in a definitive trial.</p><p>Handgrip strength is the technique most often recommended for measurement of muscle strength and assessment of muscle function in clinical practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. Only 54&#x000a0;% of residents in this trial were able to undertake the test, and therefore, the success criterion for data completeness was not met. Cognitive impairments made it difficult for residents to understand and follow the instructions, and physical limitations meant some residents were unable to attempt the measure. This is a similar outcome to that noted within other trials conducted in the care home setting where no residents were excluded on the basis of cognitive or physical impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. These findings suggest that handgrip strength, in its current form, does not enable assessment of muscle strength in the general care home population. There is a requirement for new measurement outcomes for use in a UK care home setting for elderly with functional impairments.</p><p>In the absence of any nutrition-specific measures of quality-of-life or health state, this trial assessed the feasibility and acceptability of existing generic tools (EQ5D and COOP), alongside piloting of a VAS to assess appetite and dietary satisfaction. The low numbers recruited significantly reduced the data available to assess feasibility and acceptability, and because the tools were not evaluated with those lacking capacity, the proportion of residents that may be able to respond in a definitive trial remains unknown. The perceived importance and burden of taking part in PROMs, alongside the opinions of staff and residents in relation to whether others could have taken part, have been explored within the qualitative phase of the trial and will be reported on elsewhere.</p></sec><sec id="Sec41"><title>Healthcare resource usage</title><p>In the absence of a standardised HCRU questionnaire for malnutrition, the questionnaire piloted in this trial was designed to collect information on healthcare professional visits and hospital admissions. Care home staff completed 100&#x000a0;% of the questionnaires at 3 and 6&#x000a0;months, obtaining all of the required data from resident care records and GP visit logs. The questionnaire was able to collect useful data on hospital admissions and professional visits not delivered in-house (dietitian, speech and language therapist), but the data on district nurse and GP visits was likely influenced by the type of care being funded. To enable the questionnaire to be used to inform an economic evaluation of the interventions in a definitive trial, thorough staff training would be required regarding the need to document GP call-outs only. The limitations with the collection of data on nursing visits could be addressed by focusing instead on the reasons for residents requiring nursing care.</p><p>The majority of hospital admissions were due to falls, a high proportion of GP call-outs were for assessment or treatment of suspected infections, and the majority of district nurse visits were related to pressure sore care. Neither the care home staff nor the GP attributed any admissions or visits to a resident&#x02019;s malnourished status, perhaps indicating that awareness of the wide-ranging consequences of malnutrition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] is limited. It is proposed that the average cost of treating an infection (chest or UTI) or a pressure sore could be used alongside the frequency of occurrence to inform the economic evaluation of the interventions, reducing the reliance on GP or district nurse visit data. Further piloting would be required initially to establish the accessibility and reliability of the necessary data in the care home setting.</p></sec><sec id="Sec42"><title>Change in outcomes</title><p>For estimated energy (kcal) intake, positive changes favouring the dietetic-led intervention arms were observed at 3 and 6&#x000a0;months, but there was no difference noted between the FB and ONS intervention arms. Increase in total energy intake has been demonstrated in a number of care home malnutrition intervention trials using both FB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>] and ONS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>] intervention, which suggests that residents increase their overall energy intake when specific calorie-dense interventions are provided to them on a daily basis. Improved nutritional intake is understood to be a key component in the causal pathway leading to improved clinical outcomes. Change in energy and protein intake should be included within a definitive trial as secondary outcome measures, to examine this relationship further. More accurate means of reporting intake would enable use alongside compliance data, to determine whether habitual intake changes to compensate for the introduction of an intervention.</p><p>For recorded weight and BMI, positive changes favouring the dietetic-led interventions were observed when each intervention was compared with SC at 3 and 6&#x000a0;months. Again, there was no observed difference between the FB and ONS arms. An increase in weight and BMI has been reported in a number of care home malnutrition intervention trials using both FB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>] and ONS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>] intervention. Whilst such findings suggest these outcomes are sensitive to positive changes in dietary intake, the composition of weight gain is unknown. In terms of delivering functional benefit, a gain of fat mass will not result in improved muscle strength [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The limitations associated with weight and BMI as outcomes of clinical relevance has led to calls for more focus on improvement in functional status or quality of life as primary trial outcomes. However, weight and BMI continue to be used in clinical practice as the primary outcome measures for nutrition support interventions.</p><p>Negative change was observed for MUAC and MAMC over the 6-month intervention in all three arms, whilst positive change was observed for TSF. Whilst this suggests that weight gain may have been primarily due to an increase in fat mass, observed trends should not be overemphasised due to the feasibility nature of the trial and the lack of complete data for these outcomes. In older adults, low MAMC, a measure of arm muscle area, has been shown to have greater association with mortality than low BMI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>]. Unfortunately, determining MAMC requires TSF measurement and additional calculation, which can hamper practical implementation. The challenges faced within this feasibility trial when attempting to accurately measure TSF suggests that skinfold measurement and therefore, also MAMC, are not appropriate for monitoring short-term changes in body composition, particularly with a population where accurate measurement may be hampered.</p></sec><sec id="Sec43"><title>Limitations</title><p>The care homes recruited into this trial do not necessarily represent the national care home population. All six had received long-term, regular input from the local dietetic team and were enrolled in a rolling program of staff training. The Primary Researcher had an excellent rapport established with the managers and staff, which may have made it easier to recruit all of the approached sites, to conduct the trial within the required timeframes and to encourage staff to adhere to the protocol. Evaluation of feasibility was undertaken in interested and motivated care homes; thus the transferability of the findings would be dependent upon tailoring to the local context.</p><p>Limitations relating to the usefulness of the data from the collected FRCs and FCs were observed, but whilst this may have reduced the accuracy of the estimation of food intake in this trial, it was useful in highlighting that this commonly used method of intake recording may reduce the accuracy of estimated nutritional intake in usual clinical practice. Photographs taken before and after a meal could enable comparisons within a definitive trial to be made in a more accurate manner that does not rely on staff memory. In routine care, the introduction of mealtime photographs alongside staff training and role delegation could be used to estimate nutritional intake and to form important evidence during a CQC inspection.</p><p>The restrictions imposed by the approving REC led to limitations in the conduct of the trial. The absence of clinical dietetic assessment following &#x02018;MUST&#x02019; screening may have resulted in a number of end-stage palliative care home residents entering the trial and receiving interventions, which were unlikely to deliver nutritional benefit. This lack of expert assessment may have contributed to the high mortality rate during the first 3&#x000a0;months of the trial, reducing the observed effectiveness of the interventions and increasing the risk of attrition bias. Limitations in the design of the trial also increased the risk of performance and detection bias through a lack of double blinding. Whilst the nature of the nutritional interventions under investigation makes it impossible to blind the care home staff to treatment allocation, it should be possible in a fully-funded definitive trial for research staff measuring outcomes and collecting data to be blinded to the allocated intervention.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec44" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The data presented enable several conclusions to be drawn that address the research question and trial objectives. The trial design was feasible to undertake in the care home setting. The established relationships between the Primary Researcher and each of the care home sites may have improved the willingness of staff to follow the trial protocol. Whilst this was explored further during the qualitative phase of the trial (to be reported separately), it is likely that researcher visits to establish trust and to deliver training will need to be accounted for in the timeframe of a definitive trial to aid with successful recruitment of care homes and residents and to culture good relationships with staff teams. This trial demonstrated that a definitive trial comparing the efficacy of FB, ONS and SC interventions in increasing weight and BMI in malnourished care home residents is both feasible and acceptable to undertake. Such a trial could provide useful information as to whether continued NHS expenditure on prescribed ONS is warranted in this setting.</p><p>Whilst the design was feasible to undertake, this trial has highlighted a lack of clinically relevant outcome measures, appropriate to this setting, for both research and clinical practice. Many older adults consider functional independence to be more important than the prevention of disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>], which supports the use of a measure of functional effects as a primary outcome for a future malnutrition intervention trial. This trial identified a need for a more simple measure of functional status, which considers the impediments of functional tests in the care home population. Further qualitative research may be required to explore the nutritional and clinical priorities of those working and residing in the care home setting, alongside the perceived value of nutritional interventions. The results could be interpreted alongside the feasibility outcomes to provide an enhanced understanding of the nutritional care complexities within care homes and to further inform the design of a definitive trial and choice of primary outcome measure.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec45"><title>Additional files</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="13063_2015_952_MOESM1_ESM.doc" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>
