The aims of this paper were, first, to develop a model for a comprehensive quantitative implementation evaluation and, second, to operationalize it in the process evaluation of the stepped-wedge cluster randomized controlled trial: &#x0201c;Prevention of low back pain and its consequences among nurses&#x02019; aides in elderly care&#x0201d; to investigate if implementation differed across intervention components, steps, and settings (workplaces).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Operationalization of a quantifiable measure of implementation requires three steps: (1) development of a program logic and intervention protocol, (2) description of a complete and acceptable delivery of the intervention, and (3) description of what determines the receipt of the intervention. Program logic from a previously developed multifaceted stepped-wedge intervention was used. The optimal delivery of the intervention was defined as the deliverers&#x02019; full understanding and following of the intervention protocol and that they performed their best and contributed to the participants&#x02019; attention and motivation (fidelity). The optimal receipt of the intervention was defined as participants being fully present at all intervention activities (participation), being motivated and satisfied, and having a good social support (responsiveness). Measurements of the fidelity, participation, and responsiveness were obtained from logbooks and questionnaires. Fidelity was multiplied by participation to measure exposure of the intervention to the individual. The implementation was determined from optimal delivery and optimal receipt on a scale from 0 (no implementation) to 100 (full implementation) on individual and organizational level.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Out of 753 sessions, 95% were delivered.

These characteristics challenge the interpretation of classic rigid evaluations in randomized controlled trial designs since a mere effect evaluation only explains a fraction of the causal assumptions in the program theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Furthermore, the effect evaluation itself risks rejecting the hypothesis underlying the program theory, due to implementation failure (type III error) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">Therefore, process evaluations have been increasingly developed, debated, and used. Previously, process evaluations were mostly anecdotal and were mainly used as formative analyses rather than summative [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. However, in recent years, a number of useful frameworks have been developed to guide researchers&#x02019; evaluation plans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. For example, Sanchez et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] offered a comprehensive guide to develop a process evaluation plan that covered both formative and summative applications of different process measures (fidelity (implemented as planned), dose, reach, recruitment, and context) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Furthermore, they illustrate its use in a proposed school-based case study. However, only the process evaluation plan is presented&#x02013;&#x02013;not the operationalized process evaluation in actual values or results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Linnan and Steckler [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] proposed similar process measures and had concrete suggestions as to how to quantify implementation. Nevertheless, still only few process evaluations offer the opportunity to compare process outcomes between studies or to use process outcomes in mediation and/or moderation analyses to understand which of the intervention components affect the intervention outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. For the latter, particularly level of implementation of the intervention is useful to evaluate in a quantifiable manner. Multiple determinants like the program characteristics (size, coverage, and complexity), setting characteristics, facilitation strategies, reach of participants (fraction of all eligible), and the participants&#x02019; motivation are potential predictors of the implementation and are therefore also important factors to measure and include in process evaluations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, most central to the studies&#x02019; effectiveness evaluation is whether or not the intervention was implemented as planned; and therefore, the quantifiable assessment of implementation deserves specific attention.</p><p id="Par7">Implementation has been suggested to be the sum of the dose and quality of delivery of the intervention (fidelity) and the receipt of the intervention in a number of frameworks and checklists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The receipt is often measured merely as participation; however, responsiveness is also a factor in receipt of the intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. It explicitly measures factors that impede or hamper the manifestation of the intervention effect within the individual and may therefore be important to consider as a mediator, highly proximal to the intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Implementation is however complex to assess when the intervention consists of multiple key effective components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Furthermore, balancing fidelity against the opportunity for adaptability of the intervention content to the receivers can be challenging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Furthermore, no one has to our knowledge provided a meaningful step by step operationalized guide of how to quantify implementation in multicomponent interventions. Therefore, we developed a model with a step-by-step operationalized guide to conduct a comprehensive quantitative implementation evaluation and operationalized it in a multifaceted stepped-wedge intervention delivered to four workplaces in Denmark. The model and the step-by-step operationalized guide are highly inspired by the methods suggested by Linnan and Steckler [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], Caroll et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and Saunders et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] but offer specific values for implementation that will be comparable between studies and useful to detect the most effective components in the intervention. Also, the model addresses the challenge of how to quantify the variable participation of individuals over learning sessions across sites and clusters in which the intervention is implemented. Furthermore, the model offers opportunity to deal with the implementation issues particularly evident in stepped-wedge designs, where the intervention is implemented to randomized groups in a phased manner, and there is a risk that implementation changes over time (i.e., with increased experience among intervention deliverers) which challenges the interpretation of the effect analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Thus, the quantification of implementation may be vital in building an evidence base that informs policy and practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Therefore, the aim of this paper was, first, to develop a model for a comprehensive quantitative implementation evaluation and, second, to give a step-by-step guide by operationalizing it in a multifaceted stepped-wedge intervention implemented in four workplaces and to investigate if implementation differed across intervention components, delivery timings (trial steps), and the workplaces (settings) involved.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par8">In the development of a model for a comprehensive quantitative implementation evaluation, we have carefully reviewed existing theories and process evaluation frameworks and models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Hence, the current model is not a new theory in itself or a new view on implementation, but a quantitative operationalization of previous theories.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Development of the model of how to quantify implementation in multicomponent interventions</title><p id="Par9">Previous theories and frameworks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] suggest that implementation consist of two overall aspects: (1) <italic>delivery of the intervention</italic> (dose, content (the amount and proportion), and quality of the intervention that are delivered as planned) and (2) <italic>receipt of the intervention</italic> (the amount received and perceived by the participants as intended). To be able to develop a quantifiable implementation measure, it is important to be particularly specific regarding these aspects. Thus, the following three steps aim to guide which aspects need to be particularly carefully considered for the implementation model to work: (1) development of a program logic and an intervention protocol, (2) define what determines an optimal delivery of the intervention, and (3) define what is an optimal receipt of the intervention.<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par10">Development of program logic and intervention protocol</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par11">First, a program logic must be developed describing the purpose of the program, the objectives, the change process, the expected impact, and outcome of the intervention.

With the clear definition of the success criteria, also opportunities for adaptability of the intervention content to the receivers must be clarified. Finally, the success criteria should be measurable (i.e., so that questions for measuring the pre-specified success criteria can be developed).<list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>3)</label><p id="Par16">Description of what determines receipt of the intervention</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par17">Particularly for the receipt of the intervention, it is highly up to the developers of the program logic to define what are the key components that determine when an individual has received an intervention. For example, an intervention may happen at a higher organizational level, i.e., at team level. Then, what determines how much the individual is exposed to the intervention? A very simple measurement of receipt of the intervention, often used in previous implementation evaluations, is participation or attendance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. However, it must be pre-defined by the researchers which degree of participation is needed and whether for example co-worker/peer participation contaminate others? However, apart from the mere presence of a participant, also responsiveness to an intervention, may determine how much of the intervention is taken up by the individual. Factors previously suggested to impact responsiveness may be motivation for the intervention, satisfaction, engagement, pre-intervention expectations, knowledge, and social support during the intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In some instances, such factors may have a very small and perhaps negligible role (for example, in case of a merely structural intervention) and in some cases, it may have a highly determining role (for example, in case of a choice-based intervention). The role of the responsiveness must be considered and made measurable before the implementation can be quantified.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>The complex multifaceted stepped-wedge intervention</title><p id="Par18">For the current example study, the program logic has been reported in a research protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. We designed a multifaceted intervention for the prevention of low back pain (LBP) among nurses&#x02019; aides in elderly care in Denmark evaluated in a stepped-wedge randomized controlled trial. The intervention was built on a comprehensive theoretical framework of both effectiveness and implementation in the development and planning of the intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and used a participatory approach that involved all levels of the organization (management, supervisor, workers). In short, the intervention lasted 3&#x000a0;months and consisted of a combination of participatory ergonomics (PE), physical training (PT), and cognitive behavioral training (CBT) and was conducted in the teams at the workplace. PE consisted of a kick-off meeting for all participants where an ergonomic working group was formed that participated in two workshops and two evaluation meetings. The PE was conducted as an organizational intervention meaning that only a subgroup of the participants was to participate in the workshops and evaluation meetings and that contamination to the rest of the team was expected. CBT consisted of two workshops of 3-h duration for all participants. PT consisted of 12 weekly 1-h sessions for all participants. In total, the intervention consisted of 19 sessions/27&#x000a0;h (PT (12 sessions/12&#x000a0;h), CBT (2 sessions/6&#x000a0;h), and PE (5 sessions/9&#x000a0;h)). The intervention was conducted during paid working hours and delivered by six local trained physiotherapists and occupational therapists (deliverers). The optimal delivery of the intervention required that the deliverers fully understood and followed the intervention protocol that they performed their best and that they contributed to the workers&#x02019; attention and motivation. An optimal receipt of the intervention required that the participants were present at all PT sessions, and all CBT sessions and that their work team was present at all PE sessions and that they were motivated, satisfied with the interventions, and had a perception of high support during the sessions. The multifaceted intervention was conducted in 2013/2014 and is described in detail in Rasmussen et al. 2013 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], and the effect on LBP is reported in Rasmussen et al. 2015 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par19">The workplaces, which were recruited to participate in the trial (adoption), and the employees, who were chosen to be enrolled in the trial (reach) have been described previously. In short, 9 workplaces (districts) in a municipality were offered participation. Four of the nine workplaces in the elderly care administration of the municipality adopted the project corresponding to 44%. There were 1074 eligible employees from 58 teams and of those 594 wanted to participate and were randomized to the intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The participants were randomized to 4 groups beginning the intervention at 4 different time points, with 126 participants in group 1, 146 participants in group 2, 158 participants in group 3, and 164 participants in group 4. The intervention components were to be delivered equally to all teams in the four workplaces.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Measures</title><p id="Par20">The data were gathered from questionnaires for the participants and from deliverer logbooks (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

It was explained to the deliverers that the logbooks were for analyses purposes only and possible poor ratings of one&#x02019;s own performance as a deliverer would not be criticized or used against them. All in all, 55 questions were included in the logbooks over the course of all sessions. The questions were &#x0201c;Have you implemented the following according to the manual: (success criteria)?&#x0201d; with (success criteria) substituted with the specific success criteria for each part of the session (i.e., &#x0201c;generated ergonomics working groups?&#x0201d;).

This was also done for the kick-off meeting, where all were invited to participate. However, in the four sessions of PE, where only a subgroup was participating, the participation was calculated on team level based on supervisor affiliation, and the participation for each team were assigned to each worker of the specific team. This was to allow that all workers were given participation since the PE was anticipated to affect all workers within a team (contamination). The participation for the PE was calculated as a combined participation score and continuity score. The participation score was the percentage of participants, according to a required number of representatives weighted according to the duration of the session. A supervisor with less than five workers were required to have two representatives participating in the sessions, a supervisor with 5&#x02013;9 workers was required to have three representatives in the sessions, a supervisor with 10&#x02013;14 workers was required to have four representatives in the sessions, a supervisor with 15&#x02013;19 workers was required to have five representatives in the sessions, and a supervisor with 20 or more workers was required to have 6 representatives in the sessions. The continuity score was calculated as the team participation score with an exception that the score was dependent of whether it was the same representatives participating in all the sessions since it was anticipated that continuation would improve implementation. The total percentage for the PE were calculated by summing the team participation score and the continuity score and divide it by 2, and the value was assigned to each worker of the respective team. Finally, the overall participation of all the sessions was calculated by summing the PE participation with the PT and CBT participation weighted according to the overall duration of the sessions (27&#x000a0;h).</p></sec><sec id="FPar6"><title>Responsiveness</title><p id="Par26">Participants&#x02019; responsiveness was measured by satisfaction, social support, and motivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].

Organization level implementation can be used to give an estimate of how well the organization implements the intervention. The individual level implementation gives a number to each individual participant indicating their specific level of implementation according to the protocol and can be used to analyze the association to individual outcomes. Individual level implementation is highly dependent on the organizational level implementation since, for example, the individual participant cannot gain a session, if it is canceled by the organization.

It shows that implementation can be measured at both organizational level and at individual level, in a manner, that offers analyses across settings, timings, and components of interventions. The specific evaluation of the multifaceted intervention at hand shows that this effective intervention was delivered with a 91% success. Adding both fidelity and responsiveness to the participation measure reduces the impression of a highly implemented intervention and underlines the importance of more comprehensive implementation measures than just participation to understand the implementation. Finally, this study shows to which degree a stepped-wedge, multifaceted, multicenter intervention can be delivered with uniformity across timings but not workplaces and intervention components. First, the steps of the trial did not seem to introduce biasing learning effects in the intervention delivery. Second, the intervention components were delivered with varying success. Third, the delivery was dependent on workplaces. The different results of this study are discussed in relation to previous literature in the following.</p><sec id="Sec15"><title>The operationalization of the quantifiable implementation evaluation</title><p id="Par76">The operationalization presents a doable solution to quantifying implementation in a way that offers comparison with the intervention across components, timing of delivery, and settings. More in depth analyses can also be conducted, for example, to evaluate learning across sessions, differences in fidelity across deliverers, or to study the contribution of fidelity at the first sessions for participation in later sessions. However, most importantly, the quantifiable implementation measures can be used for analyzing the impact of implementation on the effectiveness of the study. For example, linear regressions can be performed between implementation and the primary outcome and perhaps even reveal if there are different impacts of different components of the intervention on the primary outcome. Previously, dose-response analyses have been performed in interventions, showing that higher dosage of an intervention was associated with higher effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. However, the study did not allow for the comparison between intervention components and implementation was based on participation only. It is increasingly recognized that to obtain effectiveness in implementation studies, multiple effective components may be necessary and multiple implementation considerations are paramount. However, the more complex the intervention, the bigger the &#x0201c;black box&#x0201d; in the evaluation. Thus, by pre-defining and measuring each of the effective and implementation components, the content of the black box is revealed and the analyses of them may even offer knowledge that will change our understanding of effective and implementation components in multicomponent interventions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>The evaluation of the implementation across delivery timing, intervention components, and workplaces</title><p id="Par77">This study showed that using the stepped-wedge design was not a threat to the delivery and implementation of the intervention. Previous papers have discussed pros and cons for the stepped-wedge design and the risk of changed implementation of the intervention from step to step [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Factors typically mentioned as threats to the uniform implementation are learning effects among the deliverers, organizational changes across time, or secular trends. However, these did not seem to impact the implementation of the current study.</p><p id="Par78">The study showed some difference in the implementation of the three components; the CBT and PE were most highly implemented, whereas PT was least implemented as planned. This may indicate, that in a workplace setting, CBT and PE are easier to implement than PT. The reasons for this may be that participation is easier in CBT and PE sessions, which were delivered over a longer time slots of 3&#x000a0;h and thus required that the workplace logistic manager organized the logistics and called in substitute employees during the sessions leaving the participants with true &#x0201c;time off&#x0201d; from daily tasks. PT was conducted every week for 1&#x000a0;h and required ongoing continuous participation of the workers. Thus, for future implementation of such an intervention, consideration of how the PT should be delivered ought to be considered. However, to fully understand why PT was less well implemented, qualitative process evaluation methods could provide valuable knowledge.</p><p id="Par79">There were some differences in the implementation across workplaces. Studying the different implementation measures reveals that both fidelity, exposure, participation, and responsiveness were different, but the overall implementation did not differ across workplaces. This finding again underlines the importance of separating components of implementation measures to gain insight into what hampers the implementation. The differences observed in implementation components across workplaces indicate that the contexts are of greater importance for the implementation than the actual intervention itself.</p><p id="Par80">Limitations of this study include a tendency towards a general overestimation from the deliverers compared to the observer as found in the inter-rater reliability of the logbooks. The questions that we used may be influenced by intentional false reporting, inattentive responding, or memory limitations that introduce a bias. Therefore, data collection procedures should be considered when collecting data of fidelity. Furthermore, this study is explorative, and more trials of the quantifiable implementation evaluation will improve our understanding of the model for our understanding of implementation. For instance, the current model relies on a thorough preparation of a protocol by the main researchers, as given in the three steps in the methods section. That protocol is what for this model has determined the &#x0201c;optimal&#x0201d; implementation. However, whether the anticipation of the optimal implementation was correct and how the different implementation measures may interact needs further studies of these data. Moreover, operationalizing constructs is only one aspect of making a model testable. It also requires information about construct validity and knowledge about the generalizability of the model and which contexts or factors might limit its applicability. This warrants for further testing of the model.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par81">This study developed an operationalization of a quantifiable implementation evaluation measuring participation, fidelity, exposure, and responsiveness. The evaluation is suitable for interventions implemented at multiple organizational levels, where implementation can be measured at both organizational level and at individual level. The implementation evaluation was applied to a multifaceted intervention and showed that the intervention sessions were delivered with a 91% success (fidelity). The implementation of the interventions was uniform across steps, intervention components, and workplaces. However, participation, fidelity, exposure, and responsiveness varied between workplaces and intervention components. The quantifiable implementation evaluation can be applied in analyzing the impact of implementation on the effectiveness of complex interventions.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank all research team members and workplaces and employees who contributed to the study.</p><sec id="FPar7"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par82">The implementation of the intervention was externally funded by The Danish Working Environment Research Fund (journal number 201100813) and the National Prevention Fund (journal number 11-2-1a-113).
