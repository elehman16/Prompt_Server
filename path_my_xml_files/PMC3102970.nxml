These risk factors are potentially amenable by podiatric intervention, although this is yet to be evaluated in a clinical trial. This presentation reports on the first randomised controlled trial of a multifaceted podiatry intervention designed to improve balance and prevent falls in older people.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>We randomly allocated 305 community-dwelling people aged over 65 years with foot pain and an increased risk of falling to a control or intervention group. Both groups received routine podiatry care. The intervention group also received a multifaceted podiatry intervention consisting of: (i) prefabricated insoles customised to accommodate plantar lesions; (ii) footwear advice and assistance with the purchase of new footwear if current footwear was inappropriate; (iii) a home-based exercise program to strengthen foot and ankle muscles; and (iv) a falls prevention education booklet. Primary outcome measures were the number of fallers/multiple fallers and the falls rate, recorded by a falls diary over a 12 month period. Secondary outcome measures assessed six months after baseline included the Short Form 12 (SF-12), the Manchester Foot Pain and Disability Index (MFDPI), the Falls Efficacy Scale International, foot and ankle strength and range of motion (ROM), and balance and functional tests.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There was a significant reduction in falls rate in the intervention group compared to the control group (incidence rate ratio=0.64, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.91, p=0.01) but no significant differences between the groups in the proportion of fallers/multiple fallers. There were also significant improvements in secondary outcome measures of the SF-12 physical subscale, the MFPDI function subscale, and several measures of foot and ankle strength and ROM, balance and functional ability in the intervention group compared to the control group.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In older people with foot pain and an elevated risk of falling, a multifaceted podiatry intervention reduces the rate of falls by 36% and improves several aspects of foot and ankle strength, ROM, balance and functional ability suggesting that podiatry has a valuable role to play in preventing falls in older people.</p></sec></body></article>
