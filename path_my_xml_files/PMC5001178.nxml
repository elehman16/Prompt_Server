Inappropriately elevated endogenous glucose production (EGP) is the main source of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes. Because activation of central ATP-sensitive potassium (K<sub>ATP</sub>) channels suppresses EGP in nondiabetic rodents and humans, this study examined whether type 2 diabetic humans and rodents retain central regulation of EGP. The K<sub>ATP</sub> channel activator diazoxide was administered in a randomized, placebo-controlled crossover design to eight type 2 diabetic subjects and seven age- and BMI-matched healthy control subjects. Comprehensive measures of glucose turnover and insulin sensitivity were performed during euglycemic pancreatic clamp studies following diazoxide and placebo administration. Complementary rodent clamp studies were performed in Zucker Diabetic Fatty rats. In type 2 diabetic subjects, extrapancreatic K<sub>ATP</sub> channel activation with diazoxide under fixed hormonal conditions failed to suppress EGP, whereas matched control subjects demonstrated a 27% reduction in EGP (<italic>P</italic> = 0.002) with diazoxide. Diazoxide also failed to suppress EGP in diabetic rats. These results suggest that suppression of EGP by central K<sub>ATP</sub> channel activation may be lost in type 2 diabetes. Restoration of central regulation of glucose metabolism could be a promising therapeutic target to reduce hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes.</p></abstract><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="3"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="50"/><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Substantial evidence indicates that optimal glycemic control is associated with better clinical outcomes in type 2 diabetes (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). However, despite a sizeable therapeutic armamentarium that targets pathways in liver, muscle, and pancreas, 50% of patients with type 2 diabetes are unable to achieve adequate glycemic control (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Therefore, new approaches to improve glucose homeostasis are urgently needed. Increased endogenous glucose production (EGP) is the major source of both fasting and postabsorptive hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Although EGP is suppressed by both insulin and glucose in nondiabetic humans, this effect is considerably impaired in individuals with type 2 diabetes (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Therefore, this inappropriately elevated EGP is an important target for intervention in type 2 diabetes.</p><p>Importantly, evidence for regulation of glucose homeostasis by the central nervous system (CNS) has been accumulating in both rodents and humans. Several rodent studies have demonstrated that the CNS is involved in the regulation of glucose metabolism through its detection of nutrients and hormones, subsequent signaling through hypothalamic ATP-sensitive potassium (K<sub>ATP</sub>) channels, and transduction of those signals to the liver via vagal efferent fibers (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). We recently reported that oral administration of diazoxide, a K<sub>ATP</sub> channel activator, significantly reduces EGP in nondiabetic humans under fixed hormonal conditions (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Additionally, we presented supporting evidence in rats that diazoxide&#x02019;s suppressive effects on EGP are abolished with central administration of the K<sub>ATP</sub> channel blocker glibenclamide, suggesting that these effects are centrally mediated (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Furthermore, intranasal administration of insulin at doses previously shown to increase cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) insulin concentrations approximately twofold suppressed glucose production to a similar extent and over a similar time course, likely through activation of central K<sub>ATP</sub> channels (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Collectively, these studies in rodents and humans suggest a role for hypothalamic K<sub>ATP</sub> channels in regulation of glucose metabolism.</p><p>Of note, a number of studies in obese or diabetic rodents have indicated that central sensing mechanisms are ineffective at maintaining glucose homeostasis in these models (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). In fact, it has been hypothesized that dysregulated CNS circuits may contribute to impaired glucose homeostasis in type 2 diabetes (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Therefore, it is essential to establish whether central regulation of glucose homeostasis remains intact in humans with type 2 diabetes. If so, hypothalamic K<sub>ATP</sub> channels represent a potential therapeutic target to counteract excessive EGP and improve hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes. Conversely, if central regulation of EGP is lost in type 2 diabetes, future therapies could be directed at restoring these pathways.</p><p>Given the evidence supporting regulation of EGP by a brain&#x02013;liver pathway in humans without diabetes (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), the current randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study was designed to determine whether activation of central K<sub>ATP</sub> channels would suppress EGP in individuals with type 2 diabetes. Importantly, we conducted parallel studies in a group of specifically recruited age- and BMI-matched control subjects without diabetes. To exclude any effects of diazoxide on insulin secretion, these studies were performed under euglycemic pancreatic clamp conditions. Complementary studies in Zucker Diabetic Fatty (ZDF) rats were also performed to assess diazoxide&#x02019;s ability to cross the blood brain barrier and to suppress EGP in this animal model of type 2 diabetes.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Research Design and Methods</title><sec id="s3"><title>Human Studies</title><p>Eight subjects with moderately to poorly controlled type 2 diabetes were studied (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).

The purpose, nature, risks, and benefits of the study were explained to all subjects in the Clinical Research Center (CRC) prior to their enrollment in the study, and their voluntary, informed, written consent was obtained. All subjects had an initial screening visit to allow for a clinical evaluation that included history, physical examination, hematologic, lipid, and chemistry screening (including fasting glucose levels), baseline electrocardiogram, and consent procedures. A 2-h oral glucose tolerance test was performed to ensure normal glucose tolerance in control subjects without diabetes.

From <italic>t</italic> = &#x02212;120 to <italic>t</italic> = 0 min, insulin infusion rates were adjusted every 20&#x02013;25 min to determine optimal insulin infusion rates to maintain euglycemia. Finer calibration of insulin infusion rates were performed from <italic>t</italic> = 0 to <italic>t</italic> = 120 min to establish individualized basal insulin infusion rates by 120 min (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). In 8 of the 30 studies (<italic>n</italic> = 1 nondiabetic placebo, <italic>n</italic> = 2 nondiabetic diazoxide, <italic>n</italic> = 2 diabetic placebo, and <italic>n</italic> = 3 diabetic diazoxide), minor changes to the insulin infusion rates were made from <italic>t</italic> = 120 to <italic>t</italic> = 170 min to prevent hypoglycemia. There were no significant changes in either insulin infusion rates or plasma insulin concentrations between 0 and 240 min, emphasizing the fact that any changes were minor. This careful approach to attaining individualized, basal insulin infusion rates, avoiding the need for virtually any exogenous glucose infusion, permits highly sensitive measures of glucose production without overinsulinization (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Plasma glucose concentrations were measured at 5-min intervals during the 240 min of the study and maintained at normal fasting concentrations (&#x0223c;90 mg/dL), using low infusion rates of dextrose 20% if needed. All infusions were stopped at <italic>t</italic> = 240 min, and subjects received a standard meal with subsequent plasma glucose monitoring for 60 min after the completion of the study before being discharged from the CRC.

After an overnight fast, subjects without diabetes were admitted to the CRC on the morning of the study. Subjects with type 2 diabetes were admitted to the CRC the night prior to the clamp study for gradual lowering of plasma glucose levels with intravenous insulin infusions (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) and were also fasted overnight prior to the study. Because an algorithm was used for insulin infusion rates, subjects received progressively lower rates of insulin infusion as their glucose levels dropped. Sulfonylurea agents and metformin were discontinued for 72 h prior to all admissions, and thiazolidinediones were held for 8 days prior to admission. Long- or intermediate-acting preparations of insulin were discontinued prior to admission such that subjects received no long-acting insulin for 24 h prior to the study and no intermediate-acting insulin for at least 12 h. An 18-gauge catheter was inserted in an antecubital vein for infusions, and a contralateral hand vein was cannulated in a retrograde fashion for arterialized venous blood sampling. To obtain arterialized venous blood, the hand was kept in a warming pad maintained at 55&#x000b0;C.

Therefore, the significance or nonsignificance of each parametric test result was confirmed with the alternative nonparametric test (Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank sum test for comparison of medians of paired data, Mann&#x02013;Whitney tests for comparison of medians of two independent groups, and Kruskal-Wallis test for comparison of medians of three or more independent groups).

Furthermore, because study recruitment aimed to be representative of the ethnic composition of the Bronx, NY, both groups were racially/ethnically heterogeneous, although there were more Hispanic subjects in the group with diabetes versus the group without diabetes (4 vs. 1, respectively).

Given that activation of extrapancreatic K<sub>ATP</sub> channels is able to suppress EGP in both animal models and healthy humans (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), the current study examined the ability of the K<sub>ATP</sub> channel activator diazoxide to regulate EGP in ZDF rats and humans with moderately to poorly controlled diabetes under fixed hormonal conditions. Our results indicate that central regulation of EGP is impaired in both rats and humans with type 2 diabetes.</p><p>Given the potential that age and obesity might impact central regulation of glucose metabolism (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>), we specifically recruited a group of age- and BMI-matched subjects without diabetes as a comparison group for this study. Of note, the EGP response to diazoxide in these overweight, middle-aged subjects was consistent with our previous observations in younger, leaner subjects (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). An additional methodologic point pertains to diazoxide&#x02019;s ability to activate K<sub>ATP</sub> channels in the plasma membrane of pancreatic &#x003b2;-cells, thereby inhibiting insulin secretion (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Therefore, the current study used somatostatin, known to suppress insulin secretion via G-protein&#x02013;coupled somatostatin receptors and inhibit intracellular calcium ion translocation (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). The absence of any differences in plasma hormone levels confirms the adequacy of the pancreatic clamp technique to allow us to isolate diazoxide&#x02019;s extrapancreatic effects.</p><p>Furthermore, because hyperglycemia would be expected to suppress EGP in the subjects with diabetes, it was important to correct hyperglycemia prior to the onset of the clamp studies. Indeed, the overnight insulin infusions in the group with diabetes were designed to attain comparable basal rates of EGP and plasma glucose levels in the two groups. Additionally, insulin requirements progressively fell with correction of glucose toxicity overnight, such that insulin infusion rates averaged 0.24 &#x000b1; 0.07 mU/kg/min by the final hour prior to the clamp studies (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/db15-1465/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. 1</ext-link>), and rates of EGP were similarly unsuppressed at the onset of the studies in both groups. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that some suppression of basal EGP by overnight insulin might have attenuated the effect of diazoxide on EGP in the diabetic rats and humans with diabetes, because hepatic hyperinsulinemia may mask CNS effects on the liver (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>), it is important to note that insulin infusion rates were no greater than basal for &#x0003e;6 h prior to the study interval when EGP was calculated. Future studies using an SGLT2 inhibitor to lower glucose levels prior to the clamp could further address this question.</p><p>Furthermore, activation and deactivation of K<sub>ATP</sub> channels are very rapid phenomena (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>), making residual activating effects of insulin on K<sub>ATP</sub> channels unlikely.</p><p>Of note, plasma insulin infusion rates were approximately doubled in the subjects with diabetes versus the subjects without diabetes in the placebo studies. This reflected mild insulin resistance despite correction of glucose toxicity in the subjects with diabetes. The comparable rates of EGP in both subject groups demonstrated that we were successful in selecting appropriate insulin infusion rates to study both groups under basal EGP conditions. Furthermore, attaining individualized, basal insulin infusion rates during the clamp studies avoided the need for virtually any exogenous glucose infusion and permitted highly sensitive measures of glucose production without overinsulinization (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>).</p><p>The results of these studies in humans and rats are consistent with prior literature in rodents, suggesting that metabolic disturbances including those present in obesity and type 2 diabetes disrupt central regulation of glucose homeostasis. Inhibiting insulin action in the arcuate nucleus by a number of experimental approaches including insulin antibodies and inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase results in a diminished ability of insulin to suppress EGP (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Furthermore, insulin is unable to activate central K<sub>ATP</sub> channels in obese rats (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), consistent with our findings in ZDF rats. Indeed, high-fat feeding of even short duration activates hypothalamic S6 kinase, a putative mediator of insulin resistance, which in turn impairs the ability of circulating insulin to suppress EGP (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Additionally, hypothalamic signaling via the insulin receptor substrate&#x02013;phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway, an important mediator of insulin action, is impaired in rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Of note, it is likely that poor metabolic control contributes to the lack of EGP response in our subjects with diabetes, because subjects with diabetes in comparably poor control showed a lack of suppression of EGP by hyperglycemia (likely mediated at least in part by central K<sub>ATP</sub> channels), whereas subjects with diabetes in good control showed normal suppression of EGP (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). This is also consistent with the observation that centrally administered diazoxide was able to modulate EGP in high-fat&#x02013;fed yet normoglycemic rats (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Furthermore, although intranasal insulin (presumably via central mechanisms) increased hepatic energy metabolism and reduced lipid storage in healthy humans, this effect was absent in patients with type 2 diabetes (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>).</p><p>Collectively, these findings highlight the need for interventions to restore central signaling mechanisms. Various molecular targets have been proposed that could restore the brain&#x02019;s sensitivity to nutrients in type 2 diabetes. These targets include regulators of insulin and leptin action (such as protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B, c-Jun-N terminal kinase, and SRC homology 2B) as well as peripheral modulators of glucose metabolism (such as glucagon-like peptide-1) (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). A critical challenge lies in developing medications that specifically target the brain without acting peripherally. One potential model is the established treatment for Parkinson disease, L-dopa, which is delivered with a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor to prevent it from being metabolized prior to passing through the blood&#x02013;brain barrier (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). In fact, even short-term improvement in an individual&#x02019;s metabolic state may restore the integrity of the brain&#x02013;liver pathway in type 2 diabetes (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). It will also be important to identify the critical stage(s) at which therapies targeting restoration of the brain&#x02013;liver pathway would be most beneficial. Although delineating whether central or hepatic mechanisms are responsible for the lack of response in diabetes was not the goal of the current studies, we hope to perform future studies specifically designed to delineate the central and/or peripheral site(s) at which the response is altered.</p><p>Although it has long been accepted that type 2 diabetes is associated with malfunctions of the &#x003b2;-cell, muscle, and liver, growing evidence suggests that the brain also plays a key role in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. The results of the current study are also relevant to recent work demonstrating that neurologic disorders such as Alzheimer disease, major depressive disorder, Parkinson disease, Huntington disease, and vascular dementia are all associated with metabolic derangements. Specifically, these diseases feature impaired systemic glucose metabolism and insulin resistance, as well as poor cerebral glucose utilization, cerebral insulin resistance, cerebral insulin deficiency, and abnormal expression of genes that are typically regulated by insulin (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). Indeed, a great deal of evidence supports a role for the brain in metabolic disease and, conversely, for metabolic derangements in the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders. This work also highlights a potential concern with the use of sulfonylurea agents in the long-term treatment of type 2 diabetes, especially in patients with waning &#x003b2;-cell reserve. Inhibition of central K<sub>ATP</sub> channels by these agents could increase EGP and hence contribute to deterioration of glycemic control in these individuals (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>).</p><p>Thus, we present the first study in humans to show that regulation of EGP through activation of extrapancreatic K<sub>ATP</sub> channels is impaired in type 2 diabetes, providing further insight into the CNS basis for the pathogenesis of metabolic disorders. Complementary rodent studies in a rat model of type 2 diabetes support our findings in humans. Given that unrestrained EGP is the chief source of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes, restoring the brain&#x02019;s sensitivity to nutrient signals would be a promising therapeutic target.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1" fn-type="supplementary-material"><p>This article contains Supplementary Data online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/db15-1465/-/DC1">http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/db15-1465/-/DC1</ext-link>.</p></fn><fn id="fn2"><p>See accompanying article, p. <related-article id="d35e1388" related-article-type="companion" ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.2337/dbi16-0032" vol="65" page="2467">2467</related-article>.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Article Information</title><p><bold>Acknowledgments.</bold> The authors thank Kevin Jordan, Amelia Starr, Sarah Reda, Laura Clintoc, Stephen Marsh, Karen Gambina, and the staff of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine CRC and Hormone Assay Core of the Einstein-Mount Sinai Diabetes Research Center (P60-DK20541), Dr. Gary Schwartz of the Diabetes Research Center&#x02019;s Animal Physiology Core, and Drs.
