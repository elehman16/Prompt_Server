proprioceptive training accompanied by motor imagery training and general proprioceptive
training on the balance of stroke patients. [Subjects and Methods] Thirty-six stroke
patients were randomly assigned to either an experimental group of 18 patients or a
control group of 18 patients. The experimental group was given motor imagery training for
5 minutes and proprioceptive training for 25 minutes, while the control group was given
proprioceptive training for 30 minutes. Each session and training program was implemented
5 times a week for 8 weeks. The Korean version of the Berg Balance Scale (K-BBS), Timed Up
and Go test (TUG), weight bearing ratio (AFA-50, Alfoots, Republic of Korea), and joint
position sense error (Dualer IQ Inclinometer, JTECH Medical, USA) were measured. [Results]
Both groups showed improvements in K-BBS, TUG, weight bearing ratio, and joint position
sense error. The measures of the experimental group showed greater improvement than the
control group. [Conclusion] Motor imagery training, which is not subject to time
restrictions, is not very risky and can be used as an effective treatment method for
improving the balance ability of stroke patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Motor imagery</kwd><kwd>Proprioception</kwd><kwd>Stroke</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Stroke is the result of bleeding in brain tissues or the blockade of blood flow supplied to
the brain, due to cerebrovascular disease, cardiac disorder, or diabetes, etc. Most stroke
patients show symptoms of motor abnormality and sensory disturbance as well as disturbance
of consciousness, language, and cognition, and paralysis or paresis<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. The control ability of central nervous system on the
affected side of hemiplegic patients is impaired, and imbalance of protagonist and
antagonistic muscle and excessive muscle tone, spasticity, are shown. The reasons for the
lowering of balance ability are often proprioceptive injury and reduction of muscle tone.
About 65% of patients with stroke usually experience the loss of tactile sense, protective
reaction and proprioception<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In particular, left-right imbalance and asymmetric posture due to decline in mobility are
characteristics of stoke. These characteristics bias the center of gravity to the unaffected
side lower limb and weaken subjects&#x02019; ability to maintain the body center within the base of
support, resulting in a serious problem with postural control due to difficulty in
controlling balance in the standing position, and also affects the righting and equilibrium
reactions<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In static standing, the center of plantar pressure prominently exhibits the anteriolateral
sway. In order to maintain balance, a compensatory ankle strategy is used to allow the
ground reaction force to effectively act on the unaffected side foot, which also causes
muscular weakness and asymmetric postures. The reasons for this condition are explained by
the lack of weight bearing ability or muscular control disorder on the affected side lower
limb<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>, and modification of the muscle recruitment pattern and the delayed
contraction of paretic muscles are shown<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Stroke patients&#x02019; ability to properly react to various environments and tasks is decreased
because of decline in left/right weight transfer ability, time of affected side lower limb
support, and limit of stability. Also, their physical disturbance in standing is increased
as much as two times, compared with normal persons of the same age<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In exercise imagery training, movement is imagined in the mind without any physical
actions<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. The imagery induces
information processing activity similar to performance of the real task, promoting the
learning of motor function<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. The results of Functional Magnetic Response Imaging
(FMRI), which was used to examine the validity of exercise imagery training, suggest that
both the primary motor cortex and the sensory fields of brain<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>, as well as the dorsal premotor cortex, superior parietal lobe and
intra-parietal sulcus are activated by exercise imagery training<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In exercise imagery training, stroke patients with limited mobility can activate the brain
circuits by imagining movements, and active participation can be induced through the
training<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. In stroke patients who performed exercise imagery training,
symmetry of the gait pattern improved in the stance phase on the affected side,<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup> and the training can also be used to
improve the relearning of daily tasks after acute stroke<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. Weight shifting interventions for hemiplegic patients suggest the
possibility of exercise imagery training<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. Stroke patients who were asked to imagine normal gait to train the
normal movement of feet, showed improved gait functions<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Although research regarding exercise imagery for stroke patients has been variously
implemented, the enhancement of exercise performance with respect to the improvement of
upper limbs function, gait function, and change of brain activation has been frequently
studied.</p><p>Thus, this study examined the effects of exercise imagery on the balance ability of stroke
patients in proprioception training.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects of this study were 36 patients hospitalized for the treatment of stroke in a
hospital located in the Republic of Korea. This study complied with the ethical principles
of the Declaration of Helsinki. All the subjects and their guardians voluntarily agreed to
participate in the study after receiving explanations regarding the purpose and procedures
of the experiment, and signed an informed consent statement before its start. The criteria
for selecting the subjects were as follows: more than 6 months since the onset of
non-traumatic and unilateral stroke, a score of more than 24 in the Korean version of the
Mini Mental State Examination, a score of less than 2.26 in the Vividness of Movement
Imagery Questions, the ability to stand independently for more than three minutes, the
ability to walk farther than 10 m, and no orthopedic diseases that would have affected
standing balance.</p><p>The proprioception training program of the 18 patients who met the inclusion criteria was
conducted in two phases for 30 minutes a session, 5 days a week, for 8 weeks. The program
used in this study was implemented by correcting and supplementing the suggestions of the
aged examined<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. For the initial 4 weeks, training was conducted on a balance pad
(Balance pad, Airex, Swiss) and consisted of 5 tasks. Patients were allowed to take a break
of 10 seconds after performing each task, and 5 trials were regarded as 1 set, and a total
of 5 sets were performed in 30 minutes. From 5 weeks to 8 weeks, the training was conducted
on a balance board (Dynair ballkissen, Togu, Germany) and consisted of 5 tasks. It was
conducted in the same way as the initial 4 weeks, and the details of the training items are

The training was conducted under the instruction and support of therapists,
given the difficulty of the training, to ensure the safety of subjects.</p><p>After the proprioception training, the 18 patients performed motor imagery training in the
cognitive rehabilitation room at a proper temperature, with no noise, in order to enhance
concentration on the motor imagery training. To lower the stress and anxiety of the
subjects, and relax the body and mind, armchairs with a backrest were used so that subjects
could comfortably lean on them, and close their eyes<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. The motor imagery training was divided into mobility imagery and
visual imagery. The objective of mobility imagery is to imagine the inner sensory
information during actual movements of body from the first person view, and the purpose of
visual imagery is to imagine one&#x02019;s own movements of the body from a third person view. For
the exact performance of motor imagery, cognitive functions and imagery of the movements
were tested through the Mini Mental State Examination-Korea version and the Vividness of
Movement Imagery Questions<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In this study, the mobility imagery training was conducted to encourage the subjects to
feel the position senses of the ankle, knee and hip joints, the peripheral muscles, and
sole. The subjects actively participated in the proprioception training program. In the
motor imagery training, therapists asked the patients to imagine the contents of the
proprioception program for 5 minutes, by directly reading aloud to them while reading, the
subjects were asked some questions in order to ensure they were adequately performing the
imagery training. The proprioception program was consisted of 4 sets performed in 25 minutes
before the motor imagery training. The statistical analysis of this study was performed
using PASW 18.0. The outcome measures of pre-intervention and 4 and 8 weeks were compared
using repeated measures ANOVA.

reported that the joint scope of lower limbs and the static and dynamic balance index

and the other that the gait velocity significantly increased after training to enhance
balance ability<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Since the ability to
maintain balance in the standing position is a fundamental factor of stable independent gait
and sensitively affects gait velocity<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup>,
we think that the gait velocity increased and the TUG time was decreased in the present
study, due to the rise of the K-BBS scores.</p><p>Increased weight bearing on the unaffected lower limb of stroke patients largely affects
the movement of the whole body. Therefore, the asymmetry of weight bearing on the lower
limbs should be evaluated and weight bearing on the affected side needs to be corrected.
This study evaluated the affected/unaffected side weight bearing ratios and the affected and
unaffected sides anterior/posterior weight bearing ratios. Our results show that the
affected and unaffected sides weight bearing ratios and the affected and unaffected sides
anterior/posterior weight bearing ratios of both groups significantly decreased after the
training, and the motor imagery training group showed more significant changes than those of
the conventional proprioception training group. These results are in agreement with those of
two previous studies. One reported that when motor imagery training was added to
conventional movement training, the symmetry of muscle activity and its timing improved in
stroke patients<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup>, and the other reported
that by preliminarily practicing daily activities through motor imagery, postural symmetry
and postural control in the standing position were enhanced<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, these results show that it helps to enhance the symmetry of
hemiplegic patients&#x02019; affected and unaffected sides weight bearing and improve their affected
and unaffected sides anterior/posterior weight bearing ratios of hemiplegic patients.</p><p>The joint position sense test is a method of evaluating the position of body segments
without visual support, and this study conducted position sense tests of the ankle joint.
Our results show that in both groups, the errors of position sense was decreased
significantly after the training, and that the motor imagery training group showed more
significant changes than the conventional proprioception training group. These results are
consistent with the findings of two previous studies. One compared motor imagery and actual
movement using brain scanning, and reported that both tasks resulted in the formation of the
same neural networks in the premotor cortex, parietal lobe and cerebellum<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><sup>)</sup>, and the other that motor imagery
increased dynamic balance ability by activating the neural system<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><sup>)</sup>. These results suggest that in the motor imagery training
with proprioception program, activation of the cerebrum and cerebellum affected
proprioception, and the visual and vestibular organs responsible for balance ability, in
particular, that the activation of the proprioception sensing the position and movements of
joints affects the balance ability.</p><p>In the present study proprioception with motor imagery training showed greater improvement
than conventional proprioception training of the weight bearing ratio of the unaffected
affected sides, indicating that the balance ability, postural symmetry and proprioception of
the subjects were enhanced. These results suggest that proprioception with motor imagery can
be used as a treatment option to improve the balance ability of stroke patients. Motor
imagery can be conducted anywhere and at any time without treatment tools, and can be used
together with a variety of long-term rehabilitation approaches for the treatment of patients
with severe disabilities<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition,
motor imagery requires little energy consumption and motor skills can be learned effectively
in motor imagery training without fear of injury.</p><p>Limitations of this study were the small number of participants, making it difficult to
generalize the results, the activities of the subjects were not controlled except during the
training time, the joint position sense error used to measure proprioception ability through
posture reproduction were not controlled for age, and joint position sense was measured only
on the affected side, not both the affected and unaffected sides. Thus, further studies of
motor imagery training for the enhancement of stroke patients&#x02019; function addressing these
issues are required.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><person-group><name><surname>Susan</surname><given-names>BO</given-names></name><name><surname>Thomas</surname><given-names>JS</given-names></name></person-group>: Physical Rehabilitation: Assessment and treatment, 5th ed.
