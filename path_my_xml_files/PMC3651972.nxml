<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref> continued access to information after discharge is recommended.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></p><p>In the current study, an education and support package for patients and carers that expanded upon the previously evaluated &#x02018;What you need to know about stroke&#x02019; tailored booklet and provided opportunities for clarification and reinforcement of information both prior to, and following, discharge was developed. Research into patients&#x02019; and carers&#x02019; information needs and format preferences<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref> was also used to inform the intervention design, as was the Health Belief Model<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref> and adult learning principles. The Health Belief Model has previously been used in the area of stroke as a basis to explore patient beliefs regarding risk-related behaviour change.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref> The model assumes that in order for behaviour change to occur, a person must believe: that they are at risk of a particular illness (perceived susceptibility); that the consequence of that illness is serious (perceived severity); that making the behaviour change can produce a positive outcome (perceived benefit) and that the perceived benefit of behaviour change outweighs any perceived barriers to behaviour change.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref> Another component of the model is the person's self-efficacy (confidence in their ability) to perform a behaviour.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref> As the intervention was targeted at adults, the principles of adult learning were also incorporated in the education package.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref> These principles include consideration of a person's: need to know, self-concept, prior experiences, readiness to learn, orientation to learning and motivation to learn.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></p><p>The research question addressed by this study was &#x02018;What are the effects of an education and support package on the knowledge, health, psychosocial and satisfaction outcomes of stroke patients and carers?&#x02019; The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of this education package on the knowledge of stroke patients and carers, with a secondary aim of evaluating its effect on participants&#x02019; self-efficacy, mood, feelings of being informed and the importance of information, satisfaction and patient quality of life/carer burden.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Participants and study design</title><p>Eligible patients consecutively identified as nearing discharge from the acute stroke unit of two public, tertiary hospitals in Brisbane, Australia and their carers were invited to participate in this randomised trial. Eligibility criteria included: (1) having, or being a carer for someone with, a current diagnosis of stroke (first or subsequent) or transient ischaemic attack; (2) not living in residential care prior to admission to hospital, or having residential care as the planned discharge destination; (3) contactable by telephone and (4) adequate English, cognition and communication, vision and hearing to participate in an interview and complete the questionnaire. Members of the treating interdisciplinary team assisted in identifying eligible patients and available and eligible carers. For example, the treating speech pathologist advised on the patient&#x02019;s communication ability, and the treating doctor or occupational therapist advised on the patient&#x02019;s cognitive ability. If the patient was ineligible, available carers were still approached.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Procedure</title><p>The lead author obtained written informed consent and completed the initial interviews. Concealed random allocation was achieved via sequentially numbered envelopes containing computer-generated random numbers prepared by a person not involved in the study. Paired patient and carer dyads were allocated to the same group. Participants then received standard care (control group) or standard care and the intervention (intervention group) until 3&#x02005;months following discharge.</p><p>Outcome measures were administered face-to-face prior to acute stroke unit discharge (mean 12.8, SD 9.3&#x02005;days since stroke). They were re-administered via telephone 3&#x02005;months after discharge (mean 112.1, SD 14.1&#x02005;days since stroke) by a different researcher who was blind to group allocation. Once completed, this assessor opened a sealed section of the form to determine group allocation and asked intervention group participants additional questions regarding the intervention. A comparison of telephone and face-to-face administration of these measures found no significant differences between the two methods.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></p><p>Demographic and clinical characteristics were collected at baseline from participant interviews and from the patient&#x02019;s medical chart. The Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine (REALM)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref> was also administered at baseline as an estimate of the participant&#x02019;s reading ability. REALM is a reading recognition test with good test&#x02013;retest reliability and concurrent validity with standardised reading tests.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref> Ethical clearance was obtained from relevant hospital and university ethics committees and the trial was registered with the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTR Number: ACTRN12608000469314).</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Intervention</title><p>Control group participants received standard stroke unit care (medical, nursing and allied-health assessment and treatment, which included the provision of unstructured informal verbal education and advice from various members of the treating team). Structured stroke education or support groups were not offered at either site during the time of this study, and nor were written materials routinely provided. Participants in the intervention group received the education and support package in addition to standard care.</p><p>The design of the education and support package was informed by recommendations from the literature,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref> and previous research by the author team which explored current practice gaps,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref> patient and carer preferences for receiving information<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref> and potential barriers to information provision.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref> The health professional providing the package was the lead author, who is an occupational therapist with clinical experience in stroke rehabilitation; however, the intervention was designed so that it could be provided by any health professional who has knowledge and experience in stroke management.</p><p>The package consisted of: a previously evaluated and described computer-generated, tailored written information booklet (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.uq.edu.au/tru/strokebook">http://www.uq.edu.au/tru/strokebook</ext-link>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>; verbal reinforcement of information up to three times predischarge; telephone contact up to three times postdischarge and a telephone number that participants could call with questions. Participants could tailor the written information by choosing topics from a list of 34 topics and the level of information detail (detailed or brief)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref> (please see online supplementary appendix A for this checklist) and the verbal sessions by nominating the topics for discussion. Intervention group participants received the written information and face-to-face sessions prior to the discharge interview (please see online supplementary appendices B and C for the Intervention Protocol and Intervention Template). Following discharge, telephone contact with participants was provided by three health professional-initiated telephone calls at intervals of approximately 1&#x02005;month, over a 3-month period (please see online supplementary appendices B and C). As the Health Belief Model<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref> and adult learning principles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref> were used to inform the development of the intervention, the health professional providing the intervention incorporated the following strategies where possible: assessing knowledge, exploring barriers and ways to overcome them; correcting misinformation; providing specific and personalised information about the risks and seriousness of unhealthy behaviour, and specific details of the benefits of healthy behaviour; providing reassurance and encouraging the use of support networks; using persuasion and training in breaking tasks into smaller steps and encouraging the use of stress management strategies.</p><p>The health professional providing the intervention was not a member of the interdisciplinary team at either stroke unit and approached participants independent of the standard treating team. Face-to-face sessions were conducted at the patient&#x02019;s bedside or in a quiet interview room nearby. In the case of participating dyads (both the patient and their carer allocated to the intervention group), participants were offered the choice of combined or separate education sessions. The information needs checklist, intervention protocol and the intervention tracking template are provided as online <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bmjopen.bmj.com/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2012-002538/-/DC1">supplementary materials</ext-link>. Further details of the intervention are available from the author on request.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Outcome measures</title><p>The primary outcome was stroke knowledge which was assessed using the 25-item Knowledge of Stroke Questionnaire,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref> which has a true/false/do not know response format with good test&#x02013;retest reliability,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref> with higher scores indicating better stroke knowledge. Secondary outcomes were self-efficacy, anxiety and depression, quality of life (patients) and caregiver burden (carers) and ratings of: being informed; importance of information and satisfaction with information received.

The strengths of this study include: its randomised controlled design; an intervention whose design was informed by a series of previous studies with the intended population and the inclusion of both patients and carers, which enhances the applicability to health professionals working in this clinical area. It is noted that this combined analysis does not allow separation of patient and carer outcomes, which may be of interest to clinicians and researchers (please see online supplementary appendix D which details separate patient and carer scores at baseline and follow-up). Both patients and carers were recruited as participants for this study as the intervention was designed to meet the needs of both patients and carers and this also allowed maximisation of the power of the study.</p><p>A limitation of this study is that these results may not be generalisable to patients with more severe cognitive impairment or aphasia or to patients who require high-level residential care and their carers. These populations are commonly excluded from studies of educational interventions. Identifying effective educational resources for, and methods by which to conduct research into, these populations is a current research gap. Underpowering and the possibility of a type II error should also be considered. Finally, a 3-month follow-up period may also not have been sufficient to see the full influence of the intervention.</p><p>Our study used a 25-item stroke knowledge test which allowed comparison with the previous randomised controlled trial of the tailored written booklet used as part of the current study's intervention.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref> Hoffmann <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref> found a non-significant between-group difference of 0.1, while for this study it was 0.9, yet also non-significant. A significant improvement in knowledge in the intervention group had been found by Lowe <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref> The content of Lowe's booklets contained both general and patient-specific stroke information, while the content of our booklets was entirely tailored by the participant&#x02019;s choice of content and level of information. This more complete tailoring may make it difficult to accurately assess the knowledge of all participants using a uniform measure as not all participants will have been exposed to the same content. Use of a knowledge-outcome measure, that is, more sensitivity to differing content exposure or variations to the intervention (such as greater intensity) may be required to detect differences achieved from a tailored intervention.</p><p>Insufficient intensity of the intervention may have also contributed to the lack of significant differences between the groups for the other outcomes, along with an underpowering of the study. Although a total of up to six contacts with the health professional providing the intervention were offered, some participants declined some of these. This may have diluted the effect of the intervention. Possible explanations for the amount of postdischarge contact being considerably less than the amount of predischarge contact include: reduced tolerance for long-telephone conversations due to stroke-related or carer-related fatigue; difficulty in engaging some participants in discussion over the telephone or needs other than information taking a higher priority once a patient has left the acute ward. Additionally, although care was taken to ensure that the telephone contacts occurred at times suitable to the participant, the participants may have felt that they did not have &#x02018;time to talk&#x02019; or were not as prepared for the discussion as they could have been. This emphasises the need to complete a regular, formal review of information needs.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref> Formalising the information provision by scheduling an outpatient appointment may overcome some barriers of telephone communication, but may create other difficulties for patients and carers such as community mobility. The use of alternative communications such as computer-based videoconferencing may be more resource efficient and time efficient and more convenient for patients and/or carers who experience difficulties with community mobility and transport poststroke. Alternative solutions should be explored, depending on the resources and infrastructure available to stroke patients, their carers, and the health facility in which the health professionals work. Information needs persist and change beyond hospital discharge<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref> and health professionals need to find ways to continually meet these changing needs.</p><p>In the current study, participants in the intervention group had a significantly better self-efficacy for accessing stroke information. Several components of the intervention may have directly contributed to this, including: the written information booklet contained a detailed &#x02018;Where to get help&#x02019; section, and the health professional providing the intervention modelled strategies which encouraged the use of support networks and explored barriers to accessing them and ways of overcome them. Several health-education theories describe self-efficacy as an important precursor to performance of a task.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref> This has important implications for the abilities of patients with stroke and their carers to meet ongoing information needs, as it suggests that the intervention may empower them to independently access stroke information even after the cessation of the intervention period. Facilitating self-efficacy has been found to improve longer-term health outcomes in patients with chronic health conditions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></p><p>In the current study, participants in the intervention group also demonstrated better satisfaction than control group participants. Higher satisfaction was also found by Hoffmann <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref> The intervention group participants rated all four intervention components highly, including the postdischarge options of talking to someone over the telephone and having a telephone support person available if needed. A Cochrane review of a health professional-initiated telephone contact with patients following hospital discharge concluded that the effect of this medium on patient outcomes is currently inconclusive.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref> While this review included studies which involved patients from various diagnostic groups, it did not include any studies specifically with stroke patients. The needs of stroke patients and their carers postdischarge differ quite substantially from those of other patient groups and stroke-specific studies evaluating this are needed. Stroke patients and carers have reported satisfaction with receiving telephone support when provided in combination with a face-to-face provision<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref> and a desire to receive telephone support as a follow-up to face-to-face provision.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></p><p>The high ranking of the usefulness of having someone to call with questions was surprising, given that this option was utilised by only one participant. It may be that participants did not use this option because the health professional who provided the intervention appropriately elicited and addressed the information needs during the health professional-initiated contacts, or that the intervention group participants accessed other sources of information to ask additional questions. Nevertheless, it appears that participants in this study were satisfied to know that there was someone to call, even if they did not utilise the service. Whether this &#x02018;call in&#x02019; component of the intervention would have been better utilised had the follow-up period been longer is also unknown. The need to provide contact details for any questions that may arise following discharge is acknowledged in national and international stroke care guidelines.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>

This enhancement may come from combining its provision with other active informational interventions.
