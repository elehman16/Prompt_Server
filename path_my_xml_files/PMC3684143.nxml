Participants were randomized to an intervention group or to a control group using balanced blockwise randomization stratified by center. Participants and field researchers could not be blinded to group allocation. However, a statistician not involved in the trial (ie, &#x0201c;blinded&#x0201d;) conducted the final statistical analysis and only pseudonymized data were analyzed. We stored personal data on all participants (including name and address) separately from the trial data (both in lockable cabinets in lockable rooms). All personal data were treated confidentially. The ethics committees of the universities of Halle and Leipzig approved the study protocol. Research was carried out in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All subjects gave their written informed consent for participation in the study. The study is registered in the ClinicalTrials.gov registry (NCT00644826). The study design and methods have been described in detail elsewhere.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-cia-8-697">14</xref></p></sec><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Recruitment of participants</title><p>We recruited participants from health care settings (general practice, general hospitals) and via mail (general population, with addresses provided by local registration). Patients from general medical practices and general hospitals were screened for eligibility by general practice personnel or liaison nurses on site and subjects of the general population by study personnel via telephone. Participation was dependent on living at home, being aged 80 years or older, and having functional impairment in at least three activities of daily living. The latter criteria were chosen to identify a sample with increased risk for institutionalization and in possible need of preventive home visits. Subjects with insufficient knowledge of the German language, cognitive impairment, an inability to give informed consent, or a level of care higher than 1 (according to German long-term care insurance, see below)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-cia-8-697">15</xref> at the time of recruitment were excluded. Eligible subjects who consented to participation in the trial were asked to attend an appointment for baseline assessment by the study personnel.</p></sec><sec><title>Primary outcome</title><p>The primary outcome of our trial was the incidence of institutionalization over the study period of 18 months. Institutionalization was defined as permanent admission to a nursing home.

Standardized interviews were conducted by trained study personnel (psychologist, sociologist, or nurse scientist) with all participants in their homes. We assessed falls in all participants in the intervention and control groups by asking two questions: &#x0201c;Did you fall in the last 12 months?&#x0201d; (yes/no); and if yes, &#x0201c;How often did you fall in the last 12 months?&#x0201d;</p><p>Participants in the intervention and control groups were also asked if they were categorized into a level of care according to the German long-term care insurance policy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-cia-8-697">15</xref> A higher level of care indicates a higher need of care (level 1, considerable need; 2, severe need; 3, extreme need).

Interventions were carried out through guidance, verbal information, and/or handing out informative materials. Relatives were involved in the counseling process whenever possible.

All analyses employed an alpha level of 0.05 for statistical significance (two-tailed). We analyzed group differences using the Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test and &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test as appropriate. Random-effects Poisson regression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-cia-8-697">20</xref> estimating incidence rate ratios and 95% confidence intervals was used to evaluate the effect of preventive home visits on the number of falls, controlling for covariates. We used this method because the dependent variable (number of falls) is a count variable and the interindividual (between) differences are modeled by the random part. Moreover, we used the Hausman test to check the random-effects Poisson regression model against a random-effects negative binomial model that can also be applied to model counts.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-cia-8-697">21</xref> The Hausman test did not show a significant difference between the models (&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> = 6.91, <italic>P</italic> = 0.734), so we only showed the results of the Poisson regression model.

The findings corroborate results from a previous randomized controlled trial that was also conducted in Germany,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-cia-8-697">22</xref> which reported 31% fewer falls after one year in an intervention group that received comprehensive geriatric assessment followed by a diagnostic home visit and home intervention compared with a control group that received comprehensive geriatric assessment with recommendations but usual care at home (incidence rate ratio 0.69). Moreover, our results are consistent with the findings of a Cochrane review reporting overall evidence for the effectiveness of multifactorial interventions in reducing the rate of falls in community-dwelling older people (incidence rate ratio 0.75, 95% confidence interval 0.65&#x02013;0.86).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-cia-8-697">9</xref></p><p>However, a significant number of studies have failed to demonstrate the effectiveness of preventive home visits in reducing the risk of falls.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-cia-8-697">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-cia-8-697">13</xref> As stated above, the systematic review reported by van Haastregt et al identified two trials showing a significant reduction in the number of falls in an intervention group with preventive home visits and also four trials not showing any effect of intervention.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-cia-8-697">11</xref> The main disadvantage of the preventive home visiting strategies identified by van Haastregt et al and by other researchers is the difficulty in distinguishing the effective components of such a complex and multidimensional intervention from the total set of components.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-cia-8-697">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-cia-8-697">12</xref> Even though we also could not make such a distinction, we suggest that the effectiveness of preventive home visits in our study might be attributed to a combination of factors:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>multidimensional geriatric assessments in participants&#x02019; homes enabled identification of a broad range of possible internal and external risk factors for falling</p></list-item><list-item><p>multidisciplinary case reviews enabled comprehensive evaluation of the risk factors identified and development of interventions tailored to the individual&#x02019;s situation</p></list-item><list-item><p>a combination of individualized interventions and recommendations for participants at risk (secondary prevention) and provision of general information to the participants in the intervention group independent of the risk of falling (primary prevention)</p></list-item><list-item><p>a final preventive home visit to emphasize recommendations, remove obstacles, and provide further assistance, and thereby increase compliance.</p></list-item></list><p>Our study may be of particular interest because its findings confirm the effectiveness of preventive home visits in a sample of community-dwelling people who were quite elderly (aged 80 years or older, mean age 85.1 years), and so had a considerably increased risk of falling as well as institutionalization.</p><p>However, our study is not without limitations. First, the sample size was not calculated according to the outcome of falls, although it had sufficient power to detect a significant effect of preventive home visits on this outcome. Second, falls were assessed retrospectively by asking only two questions. A number of falls studies alternatively or additionally used prospective calendar self-reports to assess occurrence of falling and the number of falls.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-cia-8-697">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-cia-8-697">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-cia-8-697">23</xref> With regard to the findings of a validation study by Mackenzie et al, a retrospective self-report such as that used in our study was found to be less sensitive (56%) and less specific (94.7%) than the prospective calendar method for assessment of falls over a six-month period.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-cia-8-697">23</xref> Therefore, our data may be afflicted with some degree of inaccuracy. Third, participants and field researchers could not be blinded to group allocation. Fourth, only 21.3% of the participants in the intervention group completely followed the individualized recommendations for fall prevention (7.4% followed partially, 2.8% reduced their risk of falling using other strategies, and 25.9% refused to follow the individualized recommendations). Another 38.0% of participants stated that they felt well informed and intended to follow the individualized recommendations when it became necessary (ie, higher perceived risk of falling) in their own view (data on acceptance/refusal of recommendations for the remaining 4.6% of the participants could not be collected). However, fall prevention in the trial not only included individualized interventions and recommendations, but also provision of general information, eg, on causes of falls or on strategies to reduce the risk of falling and consequent injury. Even if participants did not follow the specific recommendations, the risk of falling might also have been reduced by the general information provided, eg, a change in behavior because of raised awareness about the underlying causes of falls. Finally, although the preventive home visits seemed to be effective in reducing falls, they were time-consuming and resource-consuming, so might not be cost-effective.</p><p>To improve the cost-effectiveness and outcomes of preventive home visits in reducing falls, further research should focus on identification and facilitation of the components of a preventive home visit program in the target group that could benefit most.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-cia-8-697">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr"
