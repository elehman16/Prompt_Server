Five major contributors of respiratory diseases, namely chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, lung cancer, acute respiratory infections, and tuberculosis (TB), have tremendously increased the morbidity and mortality rates at a global level (<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). In 2002, COPD was the fifth leading cause of death, and if the same trend continues, it will become the third leading cause of mortality in 2030 (<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). World Health Organization (WHO) has reported that 65 million people suffer from moderate-to-severe COPD, with 90% of COPD deaths occurring in low- and middle-income countries (<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). The Global Asthma Report 2014 estimated that 334 million people are suffering from asthma (<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) and 80% of asthma deaths occur in low-income and lower-middle-income countries (<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).</p><sec id="S0002"><title>Burden of COPD and asthma in Pakistan</title><p>Pakistan, a lower-middle-income country, with a population of 182.1 million (<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), is facing a high burden of chronic respiratory diseases, including COPD and asthma. Age-standardized mortality rate due to chronic respiratory diseases is estimated to be 138.2 per 100,000 in males and 41.3 per 100,000 among females in Pakistan (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). A large epidemiological survey in the Middle East and North Africa region (BREATHE) conducted in 11 countries reported the prevalence of COPD to be 2.1% among Pakistani adults aged more than 40 years (<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). It is expected that the COPD morbidity and mortality rates will increase, in concurrence with the increasing trend of smoking, one of its major risk factors. In Pakistan, prevalence of smoking is 15.2%: 28.6% among men and 3.4% among women (<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Clinical asthma has been estimated to be 4.3% (<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), with as high as 10.7% among children aged between 13 and 14 years (<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S0003"><title>COPD and asthma control in Pakistan</title><p>The National Action Plan for prevention and control of non-communicable diseases (NAP&#x02013;NCDs) was developed in Pakistan in 2003 (<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). NAP&#x02013;NCD highlighted the importance of strengthening the health system in Pakistan to deliver health care for prevention and control of NCDs in the country (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Despite this, the NCD service delivery model is non-existent. After the Global Alliance against Chronic Respiratory Diseases (GARD) action plan 2008&#x02013;2013 by the WHO (<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), a task force was created and a national coordinator was designated for controlling asthma and allergy conditions. However, progress so far has been suboptimal because of the dissolution of the ministry, lack of funding to GARD, and lack of support from development and technical partners. Spirometry as a standard test for the detection of air flow obstruction is not usually performed in routine care due to which many cases of COPD and asthma remain undiagnosed. A study conducted on 3,696 patients in Karachi showed that 5.7% of the study population had air flow obstruction when spirometry was performed at routine health visits in a primary care setting (<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Another study in Lahore reported that 37.9% of the smokers having ischemic heart disease had undiagnosed COPD (<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Those diagnosed received inadequate treatment because of lack of resources. A cross-sectional study conducted on the availability of essential medicines for the treatment of NCDs showed that inhalers for the treatment of asthma were available only at 0.82% of the 20 public and 60 private outlets surveyed (<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).</p><p>Pakistan has a health-care infrastructure consisting of basic health units and rural health centers (RHCs) as the first-level care facilities for provision of primary health care (PHC) through the public sector. District headquarter (DHQ) hospitals and tehsil headquarter hospitals are secondary level, and the teaching hospitals in urban areas are the tertiary-level health-care facilities. Though a well-developed public health-care system exists, referral systems are weak or negligible. There is unavailability of diagnostic equipment and lack of specialized training for doctors to detect and treat chronic respiratory diseases (<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Access to the secondary and tertiary hospitals is challenging for those dwelling in the rural areas.</p><p>So far, lung health care and prevention has not been effectively integrated into the core PHC package, although a very well-functioning TB program exists at the PHC level. National tuberculosis control program (NTP) in Pakistan has implemented TB control activities in the country with the support of provincial TB control programs in the four provinces. Since 2001, NTP has provided free treatment to 1.5 million TB patients through 5,800 diagnostic and treatment centers that are governed by the public health sector (<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S0004"><title>Rationale of the study</title><p>The proposed research and development project will develop a set of operational guidelines, training packages, and education materials for delivering quality lung health care (especially for asthma and COPD patients) through a district health system built into a functioning TB program. The intervention will then be implemented in selected facilities and evaluated prospectively for effectiveness and feasibility. This randomized controlled trial will address the following gaps in the management of asthma and COPD in Pakistan:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>
<italic>Detection rate for asthma and COPD</italic>: Currently, only about 20% of the estimated prevalent asthma and COPD cases are being identified and reported through the respective PHC network (in health management information system reports). Inclusion of these diseases in the already existent TB program is expected to increase detection rates for asthma and COPD. This will be done by improving the diagnostic practices in the RHCs by proper training of doctors through standardized training manuals and ensuring availability of the diagnostic tools and equipment.</p></list-item><list-item><p>
<italic>Prescription practices</italic>: Routine care public health systems offer varied prescription practices by doctors for the management of asthma and COPD. Standardized prescription practices will be implemented in the intervention arm of this trial.</p></list-item><list-item><p>
<italic>Patient education</italic>: There is no systematic patient education available to make patients aware of their chronic respiratory disease in routine care. Patient education tools and behavioral change communication material will be developed and implemented in the RHCs in the intervention arm.</p></list-item><list-item><p>
<italic>Patient follow-up</italic>: The current practice of follow-up is passive, that is, patients approach the health facility as and when required in routine care. This trial will implement the practice of active follow-up, for example, by text messaging the patient for follow-up visits at regular intervals in the intervention arm.</p></list-item><list-item><p>
<italic>Recording and reporting system</italic>: The system for recording and reporting chronic respiratory diseases is inadequate at the RHCs. A standardized recording and reporting system will be implemented in the RHCs for asthma and COPD as in the case of the TB control program.</p></list-item><list-item><p>
<italic>Referral linkages</italic>: As mentioned above, although health-care infrastructure exists in the public health sector in Pakistan, the referral systems are inadequate in routine care. This randomized controlled trial will develop and apply a proper referral linkage system in the intervention arm.</p></list-item><list-item><p>
<italic>Monitoring and evaluation</italic>: At present, monitoring and evaluation (M&#x00026;E) for detection and management of asthma and COPD is inadequate. M&#x00026;E system will be developed and executed through this trial to provide quality care for asthma and COPD patients in Pakistan.</p></list-item></list>
</p></sec><sec id="S0005"><title>Objectives</title><p>The primary objective of this study is to establish the clusters successfully and thereafter compare the control of asthma and COPD in the patients receiving quality lung health care in the intervention clusters with those receiving routine care in PHC setting in the control arm clusters in Pakistan.</p><p>Secondary objectives are:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>to achieve 50% or more quit rates among cigarette-smoking asthma and COPD patients;</p></list-item><list-item><p>to understand and document the care delivery experiences of patients, care providers, and managers;</p></list-item><list-item><p>to conduct incremental cost-effectiveness analysis of managing asthma and COPD at PHC facilities in Pakistan; and</p></list-item><list-item><p>to inform the country plans for scaling-up quality lung health care in Pakistan and elsewhere.</p></list-item></list>

An RHC and subdistrict hospital is a facility that serves a population of 160,000 or more. The facility staff includes a) three or more doctors, b) a range of paramedics including lady health visitors, nurses, dispensers, laboratory technicians, and c) support staff such as record clerks, store keepers, cleaners, and so on. The facility offers diagnostic and treatment services for communicable diseases (TB, malaria, acute respiratory infection, diarrhea, etc.); basic emergency obstetric and neonatal care; and NCDs such as malnutrition, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, asthma, and COPD. The currently available lung health services include a) clinical services &#x02013; clinical consultation and drugs and b) support services &#x02013; investigation, education, and so on.</p><p>All newly diagnosed asthma/COPD patients, elaborated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Fig. 2</xref>, based on the guidelines of Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Diseases (<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), Global Initiative for Asthma (<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) (<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), and WHO (<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), aged 18 years or more, and currently residing (and expected to continue residing for the next 12 months) in the catchment area of the respective health facility (i.e. RHC or subdistrict hospital), are eligible for inclusion in the trial. The reason for including asthma and COPD patients aged more than 18 years is that airflow obstruction was found even at a young age in primary care settings in Pakistan (<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>); COPD was also found in patients aged less than 40 years in tertiary care hospitals in Karachi (<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>).

Asthma treatment approach includes the use of &#x02018;Reliever&#x02019; for quick relief of symptoms such as the use of salbutamol inhaler 100 &#x000b5;g/puff at a dose of two puffs twice or thrice daily up to a maximum of two puffs four times a day, use of &#x02018;Controller&#x02019; for regular symptom control like beclomethasone inhaler 250 &#x000b5;g/puff at a dose of two puffs twice a day up to a maximum of two puffs four times a day, or long-acting &#x003b2;-2 agonist salmeterol inhaler 250 &#x000b5;g/puff at a dose of two puffs twice a day up to a maximum of four puffs twice a day; if symptoms are not controlled, for example, occur &#x0003e;3 times a week, step-up treatment will be considered, and if control is maintained for &#x02265;3 months, step-down regimen will be considered.</p><p>Control of COPD will be monitored by trained facility staff by measuring BODE (Body mass index, airway Obstruction, Dyspnea and Exercise capacity) index (<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) before and after 6 months of the intervention.

NICE guidelines for COPD, introduced in 2004, had a positive impact on the diagnosis and management of COPD patients (<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Pont et al. (<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>) have reported that asthma patients in whom standard guidelines were followed had better health-related quality of life as compared with those receiving non-guideline treatments. Hence, it is expected that this trial will not only lead to better asthma and COPD control in the intervention arm as compared with the control arm (routine care) but also to a better quality of life in patients in the intervention arm. It is also expected that smoking quit rate will be more in the intervention arm as compared with the control, as found in a study by Hilberink et al. (<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>), in which smoking cessation counseling with intensified minimal intervention strategy was provided to COPD patients in general practice, as is being provided in the intervention arm of this trial.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>As part of the Communicable Diseases: Health Service Delivery (COMDIS-HSD) research program consortium, Department for International Development (DFID) is funding the Association for Social Development for this research project, which aims to enhance strengthening the delivery of asthma and COPD care at primary health-care facilities in Pakistan.</p><p>The COMDIS-HSD research program consortium is a DFID-funded, 6-year international program led by the Nuffield Centre for International Health and Development.
