Postgraduate medical education governing bodies including the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education and the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada mandate residency programs to teach and assess trainees in core competencies that encompass cognitive, psychomotor and affective domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Traditionally, postgraduate medical learning has occurred through the clinical apprenticeship model; this model is likely to change to competency-based training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] in which as core competency levels, also known as &#x0201c;milestones,&#x0201d; must be achieved and demonstrated by medical trainees before they progress as experts in their respective specialties. Restrictions in resident work hours, limitations in operative resources, and growing demands to improve the quality and safety of patient care are rapidly changing the surgical training environment. Given these limitations, it is becoming increasingly challenging to ensure that residents achieve the core competencies of establishing a clinical knowledge base, diagnosing medical disorders, and developing surgical technical skills.</p><p>Residency programs are recognizing that it is necessary to supplement the training of neurosurgical residents so that they can achieve required competencies. Simulation-based training and assessment is a valuable platform for teaching and evaluating procedural skill competence in many clinical disciplines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Training in a simulated environment provides a safe and risk-free setting for experiential learning and knowledge acquisition. Simulation-based tools are an effective means for learning and demonstrating competency in a variety of clinical skills [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>Neurosurgical simulators complement traditional medical training. A recent review assessing simulation based technologies in neurosurgical resident education [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] found that sophisticated virtual reality (VR) simulators with haptic feedback and innovative 3D printing technology are popular methods of training in general, vascular and skull base neurosurgery. Validated simulators in spinal neurosurgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] include the ImmersiveTouch&#x000ae; (Immersive Touch, Inc., Chicago, Illinois) for percutaneous lumbar puncture, thoracic and lumbar pedicle screw placement, percutaneous spinal fixation, and vertebroplasty and the Dextroscope&#x000ae; (Volume Interactions Pte, Ltd., Singapore) for neuroanatomical instruction and preoperative planning.</p><p>PeriopSim&#x02122; has been developed by Conquer Mobile in close collaboration with clinical surgeons and perioperative clinicians as an iPad application to provide a convenient user-friendly platform to facilitate learning about surgical procedures, instruments and techniques. It is a novel technology for surgery training, which in neurosurgery has two current modules: PeriopSim&#x02122; Instrument Trainer and PeriopSim&#x02122; for Burr Hole Surgery (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). PeriopSim&#x02122; Instrument Trainer teaches general neurosurgical instruments using voice prompts and a simulated tool tray to guide the participant to select the correct tool. To create a realistic training environment, instruments displayed in the Instrument trainer are HD simulations of real surgery instruments. PeriopSim&#x02122; for Burr Hole Surgery teaches basic neurosurgical instrument usage for a burr hole surgical procedure. The burr hole surgery app is developed using a video clips of a real surgery. Using voice prompts, the interactive video of the burr hole procedure focuses on the use and appearance of instruments. Gamification techniques such as scoring and timed challenges motivate users to practice, sharpen skills and compete with colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>PeriopSim platform with burr hole instrumentation training and final score user screens</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12909_2016_669_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p>The PeriopSim&#x02122; platform was tested in a preliminary development study for residents at the Canadian Neurosurgery Rookie Camp. Rookie Camp provides an educational forum that emphasizes cognitive, behavioral and technical skills for all postgraduate year 1 (PGY-1) residents from various centers at the start of their training. This is national effort, in collaboration with the Neurosurgery Specialty Committee of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada and with support from the Canadian Neurosurgical Society (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.neurosurgeryrookie.ca">http://www.neurosurgeryrookie.ca</ext-link>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>The objective of this study was to evaluate whether PeriopSim&#x02122; Instrument Trainer and PeriopSim&#x02122; for Burr Hole Surgery improve the recognition of neurosurgical instruments.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participants</title><p>The study involved a convenience sample of 18 PGY-1 neurosurgery trainees, drawn from 12 training programs participating in the 2014 Canadian Neurosurgery Rookie Camp in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. Each study participant was provided with a unique QR barcode with an ID number to scan and enter the simulation applications.

Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> shows the experimental design for Group assignment across PeriopSim&#x02122; Instrument Trainer and PeriopSim&#x02122; for Burr Hole Surgery. Trainee randomization was performed to assess the effect of PeriopSim&#x02122; Instrument prior to participating in PeriopSim&#x02122; for Burr Hole Surgery. Trainees in Group A and Group B performed simulation tasks three times. Faculty experts at the Rookie Camp provided average recorded scores for PeriopSim&#x02122; Instrument Trainer and the PeriopSim&#x02122; for Burr Hole Surgery in order to establish expert-level performance baselines. Due to time constraints, experts (Group C) performed simulation tasks only twice. After each session, participants were presented with a dashboard displaying the performance outcomes and proficiency within the task (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Research design methodology.

The algorithm for <italic>total score</italic> was gamification-based and was dependent upon the number of correct responses in the first attempt and time saved. To determine the total score, the system used a multiplication factor of 200 per second of time saved and a multiplication factor of 100 for the number of correctly identified instruments on the first attempt. The algorithm for total score was created by the simulation development team and the formula was weighted towards time saved to encourage users to anticipate correct instruments.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Performance measures (total score, number of errors and time saved) were reported as mean and standard error of the mean (SEM) for all groups.

Trainees from Group A, who performed PeriopSim&#x02122; Instrument Trainer, showed a significant increase in total score and time saved and a decrease in the number of errors over three testing sessions. Trainees with and without prior training on the instrument trainer displayed total score and time saved improvement over repeated sessions on PeriopSim&#x02122; for Burr Hole Surgery. Furthermore, there was a tendency to have fewer errors in performing the Burr Hole Surgery if there was prior training on the Instrument Trainer, but this was not statistically significant.</p><p>Residents demonstrated an improvement in overall performance using the PeriopSim&#x02122; Instrument Trainer, yet their performance on burr hole surgery simulation was not better than residents in Group B, who had no prior instrument training. This finding suggests that experience with the Instrument Trainer does not translate into a simulated operating room (OR) experience; however, the instruments used in the simulated burr hole surgery are quite basic and the residents may have had familiarity with them based on previous neurosurgical OR experience (something we did not assess).</p><p>Previous studies have established that simulation-based training can be effectively implemented in neurosurgical residency programs to complement the traditional apprenticeship model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Operational definitions of performance metrics of simulation training are ambiguous; however, there is consensus that metric units should capture accuracy, errors and efficiency of procedural steps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. This study evaluated the PeriopSim&#x02122; platform as a method of simulation-based training of surgical instruments in a controlled environment. Performance metrics of trainees showed progressive improvement over time, indicating that the learning curve for instrument recognition during a simulated burr hole surgery may be shortened with this approach.</p><p>Limitations of this study include a small sample size and lack of construct validity; however, the findings provide a useful baseline for assessing the differences in instrument recognition that may be found between postgraduate trainees who perform various simulation tasks. Larger studies are required to validate the effect of iPad-based simulation training of neurosurgical instruments. Our results may be influenced by confounding factors such as prior neurosurgical experience of postgraduate trainees; this was not assessed in the present study and may be a source of potential bias. Other factors such as age, gender, and handedness may also potentially influence outcomes, but were not assessed. Importantly, this study did not measure whether trainees were able to retain knowledge learned from simulation-based training after the completion of Rookie Camp, another key area of further investigation.</p><p>Postgraduate medical educational programs are increasingly examining the potential role of simulation-based training as a cost-effective and efficient tool in surgical education. Surgical simulation offers residents opportunities to practice and become competent in procedural skills without exposing patients to unnecessary risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The use of interactive game-based learning is an emerging technology, which can improve residents&#x02019; motivation and engagement in simulation-based learning. Future work will involve evaluating the transference of skills from simulation training to the real environment of the neurosurgical operating room.</p><p>Simulation training is becoming increasingly popular in many surgical disciplines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and is rapidly emerging as an alternate modality to augment traditional surgical training. Findings from this study demonstrate that recognition for burr hole surgery instruments can be improved with repetitive simulation training using the PeriopSim platform. Although not examined in this study, this simple yet effective technology can be deployed internationally and would prove beneficial for novice surgeons and other surgical team members in any healthcare system.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Conclusion</title><p>PeriopSim&#x02122; is a computer-based simulation that can effectively improve performance of surgical instrument recognition. Future work and further simulation development are required to evaluate this type of novel technology as an effective educational tool for the members of the surgical team.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>OR</term><def><p>operating room</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PGY</term><def><p>postgraduate year</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SEM</term><def><p>standard error of mean</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to acknowledge the technical support provided by Aaron Hilton and Angela Robert of Conquer Mobile for the simulation platforms used in this study.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p>Data used in this study may be available by request.
