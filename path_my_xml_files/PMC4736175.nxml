While weight reduction is the most commonly practiced treatment strategy, this is difficult to both achieve and/or maintain in the majority. Furthermore evidence-based dietary recommendations to guide the nutritional management of these patients are lacking. Using a randomised controlled trial design, this study compares the effectiveness of the Mediterranean diet to a standard low fat diet in terms of differences in insulin sensitivity, hepatic steatosis and metabolic outcomes in participants with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Ninety four eligible patients who have non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and who are insulin resistant, will be randomised into either a Mediterranean or low fat diet group for a 3&#x000a0;month intervention period. Insulin sensitivity will be measured on peripheral blood using Homeostatic Model Assessment and liver fat content quantified using Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy. Both arms will consist of three face to face and three telephone call follow up consultations delivered by an Accredited Practicing Dietitian. The intervention arm focuses on recommendations from the traditional Mediterranean diet which have been tailored for use in the Australian population The standard arm uses the Australian Guide to Healthy Eating and the Australian National Heart Foundation dietary guidelines. Study recruitment will take place at four major metropolitan hospitals in Melbourne, Australia. Data collection will occur at all face to face reviews including baseline, 6, and&#x000a0;12&#x000a0;weeks. A follow up assessment to measure sustainability will take place at 6 and 12&#x000a0;months. The primary end point is improved insulin sensitivity scores at the 12&#x000a0;week time point.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This trial aims to demonstrate in a large cohort of participants with NALFD that a Mediterranean diet independent of weight loss can result in significant benefits in liver fat and insulin sensitivity and that these changes are sustained at 12&#x000a0;months. These metabolic changes would potentially lead to reductions in the risk of chronic liver disease, heart disease, type 2 diabetes and liver cancer.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Australia and New Zealand Clinical Trials Register ACTRN: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?id=369214&#x00026;isReview=true">ACTRN12615001010583</ext-link>.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease</kwd><kwd>Mediterranean diet</kwd><kwd>Fatty liver</kwd><kwd>Insulin resistance</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001215</institution-id><institution>La Trobe University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and its progressive form, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are among the most prevalent of liver diseases worldwide. Approximately 20 to 30&#x000a0;% of the adult population has NAFLD, making it the most common liver disease in developed countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The incidence is as high as 50&#x02013;85&#x000a0;% in people with pre-diabetes and diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], with diabetic patients having a two to threefold higher risk of dying of chronic liver disease, primarily attributable to NAFLD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In addition, NAFLD has been associated with the occurrence of cardiovascular disease (CVD), independent of the classical risk factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. CVD is the leading cause of death in Australia and globally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. An estimated 30&#x000a0;% of patients with NAFLD have NASH, which leads to cirrhosis and its complications including, portal hypertensive bleeding, hepatocellular carcinoma and hepatic decompensation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Insulin resistance is strongly implicated in the development of steatosis (fatty liver) and its progression to NASH. The clinically relevant lesion progresses to cirrhosis in 20&#x02013;30&#x000a0;% of cases and leads to liver cancer in 2&#x02013;5&#x000a0;% of cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Currently no proven, safe, effective therapy exists for NAFLD and NASH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Given the increasing prevalence of these conditions and high incidence of associated metabolic comorbidities, the global burden is expected to steadily increase.</p><p>Diet is a modifiable risk factor that can potentially be targeted in both the prevention and treatment of NAFLD. Currently no firm dietary recommendations can be formulated in the management of NAFLD because of the paucity of high quality evidence-based data associated with metabolic outcomes. However current data suggests that patients should aim to achieve a 5&#x02013;10&#x000a0;% weight reduction, reduce saturated and trans fat, limit fructose, limit intake of simple carbohydrates and substitute with complex carbohydrates such as whole grains, fibre and fruits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. However, weight loss is neither easy to achieve or maintain and weight loss achieved in research trials is not easily replicated in the clinic or real world settings. As such, there is an urgent need for therapies independent of weight loss.</p><p>The health benefits of the Mediterranean Diet (MedDiet) have gained popularity in the scientific literature and lay world with respect to being one of the healthiest diets in the world. Its effects are well researched in high quality studies such as PREDIMED and benefits are attributed to a lower incidence of chronic disease including CVD, obesity, dementia, some cancers, and overall mortality demonstrating its safety, palatability and sustainability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>Pilot data to support the shift from current dietary therapy to a novel MedDiet intervention of patients with NAFLD has been published by Ryan et al. in NAFLD patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. This study demonstrated a significant improvement in insulin sensitivity and hepatic steatosis with the MedDiet compared to no change in the low fat diet group.</p><p>This study, MEDINA (Mediterranean Dietary Intervention study in Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease) aims to replicate the findings of Ryan et al&#x02019;s pilot study ina larger cohort of participants with NAFLD in a more translatable environment and with assessment of sustainability. The study aims to investigate the effects of adhering to the MedDiet as compared to a low fat diet. We hypothesise that the MedDiet will demonstrate a potential to reverse insulin resistance and reduce fatty liver and that the benefits will be sustained 12&#x000a0;months post study initiation date with maintenance of the diet. We also aim to explore molecular mechanisms at play in the disease process and the interplay with diet.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design and outcome measures</title><p>This is a 12&#x000a0;week, multi-centre, parallel, randomised controlled trial of a Mediterranean diet versus a Low Fat Diet (LFD) in patients with NAFLD on insulin resistance, hepatic steatosis and Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) risk factors. Enrolment of 94 participants will occur at four sites across metropolitan Melbourne, Australia: Alfred Health, St Vincent&#x02019;s Hospital, The Royal Melbourne Hospital and Eastern Health. Both the recruitment and intervention are anticipated to take place over a 24&#x000a0;month period.

The diet is rich in plant based foods including vegetables, whole grains and fruit with the main added fat being extra virgin olive oil. The diet emphasises increased legumes and raw unsalted nut intake and oily fish. Moderate amounts of fermented dairy and poultry with small amounts of red meat and homemade sweets. The diet comprises of 44&#x000a0;% fat (&#x0003e;50&#x000a0;% monounsaturated), 36&#x000a0;% carbohydrate and 17&#x02013;20&#x000a0;% protein and up to 5&#x000a0;% alcohol. The diet was designed to be easy to follow and sustainable with an ad libitum approach focusing on what should be consumed rather than what to avoid. All changes to diet and lifestyle will be administered to participants by an Accredited Practising Dietitian (APD) who is able to tailor the diet to cultural and personal preferences through recommendation of nutritionally appropriate alternatives where necessary.</p><p>All participants will be provided with written resources specifically designed to explain the MedDiet and how it can be successfully followed and adhered to.

While diet and lifestyle changes focussing on achieving weight loss are the accepted recommendations for this patient group, weight loss is both difficult to achieve and maintain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Despite this there have been a limited number of randomised controlled trials in this patient group and no specific diet has been identified as superior to another [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. In a cross-over study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] which forms the pilot data for this trial, patients in the MedDiet arm had significant improvements in insulin sensitivity as determined by a 3-hour hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp and a significant reduction (39&#x000a0;%) in hepatic steatosis. In contrast there was no significant improvement in insulin sensitivity and only a 7&#x000a0;% reduction of hepatic steatosis with the low fat, high carbohydrate diet. The changes observed in the intervention group were without a significant reduction in weight&#x000a0;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The MedDiet has positive effects on insulin sensitivity, which has been attributed to the high content of bio-active phytochemicals with a range of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The MedDiet is characterised by a specific fatty acid profile: low in saturated fat (7&#x02013;8&#x000a0;% of total energy) and high in monounsaturated fat (20&#x000a0;% of total energy). A Spanish study showed that treatment with a balanced diet rich in olive oil contributes to the recovery of the liver from hepatic steatosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. This was achieved by decreasing activation of hepatic stellate cell (decrease hepatic collagen) by monounsaturated fatty acids, which is less susceptible to lipid peroxidation as compared to polyunsaturated fatty acids.</p><p>This study aims to assess the MedDiet in NAFLD patients to determine whether this dietary pattern is superior compared to the current recommendations for patients, thus developing a more evidence based therapy that can be translated into the clinical setting. In addition by addressing diet and lifestyle factors there is likely to be secondary prevention of associated chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes and CVD which are shown to share some pathophysiological similarities with NAFLD.</p><p>This study is also one of the first randomised controlled trials assessing the MedDiet in a non-Mediterranean country. Thus, will provide insight into implementation of the dietary principals across various cultures and the feasibility and sustainability of these changes in specific ethnic groups. The novel markers of compliance including food diaries and food frequency questionnaires will also be supported by robust markers such as plasma fatty acids and urinary metabolites. Other lifestyle changes including physical activity will be measured using the Active Australia Questionnaire and will be considered in the assessment of final results.</p><p>Although environmental influences such as diet have a well-established association with disease it is important to acknowledge that the interplay of genetics and environment are a widely accepted influence in disease outcomes. The relationship between the genome and nutrition (nutrigenomics) is a growing area of research. Studying nutrition alongside genetics is vital as it is now well established that even small differences in gene sequences can alter the metabolic pathways which make individuals more or less responsive to certain diets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Investigating the genotype in terms of response and non-response to the MedDiet in an exploratory manner enhances the understanding at the genomic and molecular level. By examining the associated phenotype with anthropometric and biochemical indices in a NAFLD population and correlating these to inflammation and markers of insulin resistance may help to identify individuals at greater cardio metabolic risk.</p><p>This intervention study has the capacity to provide a cost effective and sustainable therapy for large and increasing patient group which we feel would be highly acceptable and widely applicable at a community level, with the potential to reduce cost burden on society and improve health outcomes for individuals.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ALT</term><def><p>alanine aminotransferase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CVD</term><def><p>cardiovascular disease</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FFQ</term><def><p>food frequency questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HOMA IR</term><def><p>homeostasis model of assessment insulin resistance</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LFD</term><def><p>low fat diet</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MedDiet</term><def><p>mediterranean diet</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NAFLD</term><def><p>non alcoholic fatty liver disease</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NASH</term><def><p>non alcoholic steatohepatitis</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SF-36</term><def><p>short form health survey</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>EP and AT finalised the study protocol and coordinated the study.
