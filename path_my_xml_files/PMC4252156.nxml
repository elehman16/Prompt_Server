The principal investigator is a full-time employee of the VA. No conflicts of interest were identified with any of the authors. The study was a prospective RCT utilizing a sham intervention. Older adults, &#x02265;65 years old, having CLBP and naive to chiropractic were recruited at 2 different VA Medical Centers (VAMCs). Qualified patients were then randomized to receive either SMT or sham intervention. Patients were treated 2 times per week for 4 weeks. The protocol received institutional review board approval through the Syracuse/Canandaigua VAMC and through the VA Western New York Healthcare System (VA WNYHS).

In addition, they could never have undergone chiropractic care and they also agreed to refrain from any additional treatment for CLBP other than that provided in the treatment group for the 12-week duration of the study, unless urgent care was required. Patients were allowed to continue medications that they were taking at the initiation of the study.</p><p>Exclusion criteria included any radiographic or examination evidence of cauda equina syndrome, spinal neoplasia or metastatic disease, destructive joint pathology such as rheumatoid arthritis, urinary retention/incontinence associated with cauda equine syndrome, peripheral neuropathy or focal lumbosacral radiculopathy, progressive myelopathy or neurogenic claudication, spinal surgery within the past 6 months, a history of fragility fracture (defined as a fracture that resulted from a fall from a standing height or less) or radiographic evidence of lumbar compression fracture, and any previous chiropractic care.

The study interventions were provided to veterans at the VA WNYHS in Buffalo, New York, and the VA Rochester Outpatient Clinic (VA ROPC) in Rochester, New York. The interventions were delivered by the staff chiropractors at each facility; each were experienced clinicians with 7 and 17 years of experience, respectively, at the beginning of the trial.</p></sec><sec id="section6-2151458514544956"><title>Interventions</title><p>Spinal manipulative therapy was performed as defined previously in the literature.<sup><xref rid="bibr18-2151458514544956" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="bibr19-2151458514544956" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> The SMT included high-velocity, low-amplitude (HVLA) spinal manipulation, and/or flexion distraction therapy and/or mobilization.<sup><xref rid="bibr18-2151458514544956" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="bibr19-2151458514544956" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr20-2151458514544956" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> The decision to use high-velocity, low-amplitude spinal manipulation, or flexion distraction therapy, alone or in combination, was based on the clinician&#x02019;s judgment. The decision on management strategy was influenced by clinical examination, risk factors, and patient preference; however, there was not a specific algorithm that determined the specific strategy, improving the generalizability of the study. No other physical treatments were permitted, but the clinicians could make reference to the Arthritis Foundation brochure that contained stretching and strengthening exercises. The brochure was given to both the groups.</p><p>The sham intervention consisted of &#x0201c;detuned ultrasound&#x0201d; applied over the lumbar spine for 11 minutes. This type of intervention is chosen to purposefully simulate a treatment that is believable by the patient and one that minimizes patient bias.<sup><xref rid="bibr21-2151458514544956" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="bibr22-2151458514544956" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> The patient lay prone on the treatment table. The clinician applied ultrasound gel over the patient&#x02019;s lumbosacral region. The clinician then turned on the machine and set the intensity at &#x0201c;0&#x0201d; w/cm<sup>2</sup>, a timer started, and the fan of the machine was on. The clinician then utilized the ultrasound wand and gently ran the wand over the patient&#x02019;s back for the 11 minutes of intervention. The clinician asked the patient during this time whether there was any discomfort. At the end of the 11 minutes, the timer went off to let the patient know that the treatment was over and the patient was queried as to how they felt after the treatment.</p><p>Patients in both groups of the study received an educational pamphlet from the Arthritis Foundation entitled &#x0201c;Back Pain.&#x0201d; This brochure contained &#x0201c;an explanation of the different types of back pain, causes, and factors that worsen back pain&#x0201d; (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.arthritis.org/resources/brochures-and-other-resources">http://www.arthritis.org/resources/brochures-and-other-resources</ext-link>). This brochure also contained stretching and strengthening exercises that could be utilized by the patient for the management of their CLBP. At both sites, the treatment environments were standardized to limit variations in the patient experiences. Furthermore, the clinicians were given a standardized script to memorize and follow to define the doctor&#x02013;patient interaction at the beginning of the visit to assure consistency between the groups. Treatment was performed 2 times per week for 4 weeks. The choice of 2 times per week for 4 weeks was a pragmatic decision. The one study available at the time of initiation of this study that did evaluate the effect of treatment frequency utilized 4 weeks of intervention and did not identify an ideal treatment frequency.<sup><xref rid="bibr23-2151458514544956" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>

The pain outcome was operationalized by the scores on the Visual Analog Scale (VAS)<sup><xref rid="bibr24-2151458514544956" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> and the pain subscale of the SF-36.<sup><xref rid="bibr25-2151458514544956" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> The secondary outcomes of improvement in disability and function were operationalized by the scores of the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI),<sup><xref rid="bibr23-2151458514544956" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> the physical function subscale of the SF-36,<sup><xref rid="bibr25-2151458514544956" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> and the Timed Up and Go (TUG)<sup><xref rid="bibr26-2151458514544956" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> test, a performance measure of function. The original TUG was measured using pressure sensors in the chair and at the different data points (at 1.5 m, 3 m, and 4.5 m). We discovered problems with the sensors after about one-third of the patients were tested. We then switched to a method using laser beams at each of the data points to record the time of the test. The patient sat in a chair and a loud &#x0201c;beep&#x0201d; went off and the patient stood and ambulated 3 m out to a cone and then 3 m back; the patient did a &#x0201c;practice run&#x0201d; and then performed the test 3 times. For the TUG analyses, we summed together the times across the 3 trials at baseline, 5-, and 12-week follow-up. Outcome measures were collected at baseline, 5, and 12 weeks postbaseline. Adverse event data were collected at each treatment visit and at the 5- and 12-week follow-up. In addition, we measured patients&#x02019; expectations regarding the treatment at the end of the first treatment session in both the SMT and the sham intervention groups. These measures served as &#x0201c;manipulation checks&#x0201d; to determine the credibility of the sham intervention treatment. First, at the end of the first treatment session (after randomization), we asked patients to rate on a 10-point, face valid scale how confident they were that the treatment they will be receiving will be successful in reducing CLBP. Second, we administered the 4-item modified Borkovec and Nau Scale (mBNS)<sup><xref rid="bibr28-2151458514544956" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> at the end of the first treatment. The mBNS asks patients to rate on 5-point Likert-type scale the extent to which they were confident in the treatment, confident in recommending the treatment to a friend, felt the treatment was logical, and felt the treatment would be successful in alleviating other complaints. We calculated a mean treatment expectation score by computing the mean of the responses on the 4 items, with the higher the score, the more favorable the expectation. The scale was reliable (Cronbach &#x003b1; = .85).</p></sec><sec id="section8-2151458514544956"><title>Randomization</title><p>According to data from recently published study,<sup><xref rid="bibr30-2151458514544956" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> a clinically significant difference in the VAS is 20.

Randomization was through a random number producing algorithm. Separate but parallel, permuted randomization schemes were used to assign patients to a treatment group at both sites. A permuted block of size N = 4 was used. Prior to the initiation of the study at each site, a random number sequence generated by the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 21 created a randomization schedule from a series of permuted blocks. Patients were randomly assigned to the treatment if the permuted number in the block was even and to the sham intervention if the permuted number within the block was odd.</p></sec><sec id="section9-2151458514544956"><title>Blinding</title><p>Although the treating clinicians could not be blinded to the intervention, the patients, the screening clinicians, and the statistician evaluating the outcome data were all blinded to the treatment allocation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section10-2151458514544956"><title>Results</title><sec id="section11-2151458514544956"><title>Recruitment</title><p>Patients were recruited through direct mailing, posters, and physician recruitment.

An SAE was defined as any AE occurring during the study or within 30 days of conclusion of study participation, resulting in any one of the following outcomes: death, life-threatening persistent or significant disability/incapacity, hospitalization (when the result of an AE occurring during the study; hospitalization for an elective procedure or for treatment of a preexisting condition not worsened during the study was not considered an SAE; admission to the emergency department for 23 hours or less was not considered a hospitalization), congenital anomaly, important medical event (ie, an event that in the opinion of the investigator may jeopardize the participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed earlier). The Data Safety and Management Board (DSMB) met 4 times during the study (at 25%, 50%, 75%, and final enrollment); the DSMB evaluated the reported AEs and SAEs and found no issues with the reporting of these events and no trends that would require alteration in the study methods. A total of 250 AEs were reported over the course of the study with 56% in the SMT group and 44% in the sham intervention group. Of the 141 AEs reported in the SMT group, the DSMB judged 35 as definitely or probably associated with the intervention. Of the 109 AEs reported in the sham intervention group, the DSMB judged 10 as definitely or probably associated with the intervention.</p><p>Most AEs were mild to moderate and were related to musculoskeletal soreness. There were no differences in the frequency of the AEs between the SMT and sham intervention groups of the study, <italic>F</italic>

Preexisting conditions accounted for 42% of the AEs, and new events accounted for 58% of the events. The proportion of new events was the same in both groups during the study period; there were 6 SAEs reported after the start of the treatments (5 in the SMT group and 1 in the sham intervention group). Of the SAEs, there were 2 episodes of syncope, 1 chest pain, 1 paresthesia in the group which was thought to be a myocardial infarction, 1 myocardial infarction, and 1 fall and injury to neck. The DSMB judged that none of the SAEs were associated with the study interventions.</p></sec><sec id="section17-2151458514544956"><title>Discussion</title><p>We describe the first placebo-controlled trial utilizing a sham intervention evaluating the effect of SMT on pain, disability, and physical function in older adult veterans who are naive to chiropractic care. The strength of this study design is that it utilized a sham intervention that was seen as credible, as assessed by the patients&#x02019; mBNS treatment confidence self-reports at the start of the treatment.</p><p>We found no support for our primary hypothesis. The SMT did not produce a significantly greater reduction in pain compared to the sham intervention group at either the 5-week or 12-week follow-up. We found weak support for our secondary hypothesis. There was a statistically significant but modest improvement in disability, as measured by the ODI, in the SMT group compared to the sham intervention group at the 12-week follow-up.</p><p>Although statistically significant, the question still remains whether the change in ODI score is clinically important. In our study, the patients&#x02019; ODI scores improved an average of 8.8 points compared to 3.6 points in the sham intervention group. Comparing our results against some recent literature that attempts to define clinically significant improvement in ODI,<sup><xref rid="bibr34-2151458514544956" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> we fall below their benchmark of 10 points of improvement. At the very least, this tempers our conclusions regarding the effectiveness of SMT. It is unclear whether the magnitude of change in ODI represents an upper limit of SMT&#x02019;s efficacy, reflects attenuation of SMT&#x02019;s effectiveness resulting from less than perfect treatment fidelity, or is due to important individual differences in treatment responsiveness.</p><p>The hypothesized mechanisms by which SMT may affect disabilities are varied.<sup><xref rid="bibr35-2151458514544956" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> Reduced disability associated with SMT is thought to be associated with improvement in neuromuscular function,<sup><xref rid="bibr35-2151458514544956" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> pain,<sup><xref rid="bibr36-2151458514544956" ref-type="bibr">36</xref><xref rid="bibr37-2151458514544956" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr38-2151458514544956" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> and range of motion.<sup><xref rid="bibr40-2151458514544956" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> Although throughout the study (baseline, 5-week, and 12-week follow-up) there was a consistent significant correlation between the pain score and the functional score (ie, if there was more pain, there was less function, the change in pain [VAS], SF-36 pain subscale), change function (ODI, SF-36 function subscale) between baseline and 12-week follow-up was not significant (<italic>r</italic> &#x0003c; .11). These findings suggest that changes in pain may not necessarily lead to improvement in pain-related disability.<sup><xref rid="bibr30-2151458514544956" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> Another possible explanation for the modest improvement in function in the SMT group at the 12-week follow-up may be related to an increase in range of motion that may decrease the fear associated with movement, thus allowing the patient to be more active. Future studies are needed to further quantify the extent of improvement in disability in patients who receive SMT and systematically examine what factors may contribute to the effectiveness of SMT.</p><p>We found in our secondary analysis of the results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-2151458514544956">Table 2</xref> that there was a significant improvement in the pain and function scores from baseline to follow-up in <italic>both the SMT and the sham intervention group.</italic> This may point to a general &#x0201c;nonspecific therapeutic effect&#x0201d; that was present in both the groups. We found no differences between sites suggesting that these &#x0201c;nonspecific&#x0201d; effects were not unique to one provider. The relationship established between the clinician and the patient may by itself produce therapeutic effects and serve as a critical ingredient in treatment of CLBP. Future studies are needed to better define the specific versus nonspecific effects of management strategies for CLBP. The current study also provides data, which demonstrate that the use of SMT in older adults is safe compared to an inert sham intervention with relatively minor AEs.</p><sec id="section18-2151458514544956"><title>Generalizability</title><p>This sham intervention controlled trial was performed at 2 different sites utilizing 2 different VA facilities, 1 large VAMC and 1 VA Community Based Outpatient Clinic with almost all male patients.

Future replication studies in non-VA settings and with female patients are called for. The study evaluated a broadly defined treatment method that was designed to be representative of the &#x0201c;normal&#x0201d; chiropractic encounter including the use of both high-velocity, low-amplitude SMT and allowing for more gentle treatment such as flexion distraction.</p></sec><sec id="section19-2151458514544956"><title>Limitations</title><p>One issue that has plagued previous spinal manipulation research is the lack of high-quality, placebo-controlled trials. A recent systematic review reported on only 8 placebo-controlled clinical trials assessing spinal manipulation.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-2151458514544956" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> The current study demonstrates that a sham intervention can be a &#x0201c;believable&#x0201d; intervention to the patients as reflected in their confidence and mBNS ratings. However, one limitation of the sham intervention was that it did involve some tactile stimulation, albeit minimal, over the area of pain. Although the pressure of the ultrasound probe was kept low, there was a remote possibility that it may have had some therapeutic value.</p><p>An additional limitation to this study is that it was only performed in VA facilities, with a predominantly male population. The use of only veterans in studies has been criticized in the past<sup><xref rid="bibr41-2151458514544956" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup>; however, the data are directly relevant to the treatment of veterans within VA and useful for future replication studies. Although there were no significant differences in baseline comorbidities, the authors recognize that clinical research bears the risk of confounders that are not identified in the study. Additionally, the average age of the patients was 77 and as would be expected in this group, they were not employed. One factor that may have played a role in the nonspecific effects of treatment was that the appointments got them out of their home, therefore increasing activity. Additionally, they interacted with the provider and the staff at the clinic. These &#x0201c;nonspecific&#x0201d; factors may have played a role in the overall improvement in both the groups.</p><p>Another limitation is that all patients were given a standardized brochure from the Arthritis Foundation. Educational booklets have demonstrated effectiveness in treating back pain in the past; however, since both groups received the booklet this did not threaten the internal validity of the study. It does, however, raise some questions regarding the extent to which the nonspecific therapeutic effects found in both groups were due in part to the booklet.<sup><xref rid="bibr19-2151458514544956" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>
</p><p>Another limitation in the current study was that the clinicians were not blinded as to which intervention they were delivering. The authors attempted to mitigate study bias by blinding the patients, the screening clinician, and the statistician evaluating the outcome measures to the treatment allocation.</p><p>The study design included a validated measure of physical function (TUG).<sup><xref rid="bibr26-2151458514544956" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> The TUG was originally designed to assess risk of falls in older adults.<sup><xref rid="bibr42-2151458514544956" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> We found no support for our hypothesized improvement in the TUG scores in the SMT group compared to sham intervention. Holding aside measurement confounds resulting from the change in measurement procedures half way through the study, as described earlier, one explanation for this finding is that the disability of these older adults with CLBP was not related to the type of physical function measured by TUG.</p></sec><sec id="section20-2151458514544956"><title>Interpretation</title><p>The data from this trial demonstrate that the use of a broadly defined SMT in older veterans who were naive to chiropractic is safe. We found SMT did not lead to improvement in pain from baseline compared to a sham intervention. The data provide weak evidence, at best, of a specific therapeutic effect of SMT reducing physical disability compared to a sham intervention at the 12-week follow-up. At the same time, our secondary analyses indicate the presence of nonspecific therapeutic effects in the SMT leading to improvement in outcomes in both the SMT and the sham intervention groups from baseline to the 5-week follow-up. The doctor&#x02013;patient interaction can have significant therapeutic value, and this study demonstrated that the use of even an inert placebo treatment, such as &#x0201c;detuned ultrasound,&#x0201d; may have resulted in clinically significant improvements in CLBP.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section21-2151458514544956"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our placebo-controlled trial utilizing a sham intervention did not demonstrate superiority of SMT over sham intervention in older veterans with CLBP in our primary outcome measures of pain. Although the SMT resulted in statistically greater improvement in CLBP-related disability, as measured by the ODI, than a sham intervention group at 12 week follow-up, it failed to reach the threshold of clinically significant improvement. The fact that both the SMT and the sham groups showed improvement in the outcome measure from baseline to the 5- and 12-week follow-up in our secondary analyses demonstrates a nonspecific therapeutic effect of the intervention. Further studies are needed to assess the specific and nonspecific therapeutic effects of SMT in older adults. In addition, given fact that there are approximately 2.2 million younger Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom Veterans and that many have chronic pain, specifically LBP,<sup><xref rid="bibr40-2151458514544956" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> there is a need to evaluate the role of chiropractic care in this population utilizing a placebo-controlled trial.
