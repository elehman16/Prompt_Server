Interventions to prevent postnatal depression have had limited success. <italic>What Were We Thinking (WWWT)</italic> is a structured, gender-informed, psychoeducational group programme for parents and their first infant that addresses two modifiable risks to postnatal mental health. This paper describes the protocol for a cluster randomised controlled trial to test the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of <italic>WWWT</italic> when implemented in usual primary care.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>48 maternal and child health (MCH) centres from six diverse Local Government Areas, in Victoria, Australia are randomly allocated to the intervention group (usual care plus <italic>WWWT</italic>) or the control group (usual care). The required sample size is 184 women in each group. English-speaking primiparous women receiving postpartum healthcare in participating MCH centres complete two computer-assisted telephone interviews: baseline at 4&#x02005;weeks and outcome at 6&#x02005;months postpartum. Women attending intervention MCH centres are invited to attend <italic>WWWT</italic> in addition to usual care. The primary outcome is meeting Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-IV (DSM-IV) diagnostic criteria for major depressive episode; generalised anxiety disorder; panic disorder with or without agoraphobia, agoraphobia with or without panic, social phobia, adult separation anxiety or adjustment disorder with depressed mood, anxiety or mixed depressed mood and anxiety within the past 30&#x02005;days at 6&#x02005;months postpartum. Secondary outcomes are self-rated general and emotional health, infant sleep problems, method of infant feeding, quality of mother&#x02013;infant relationship and intimate partner relationship, and healthcare costs and outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>Approval to conduct the study has been granted.

The cost of postnatal mental health problems to individuals, families, communities and the health system is considerable.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p><p>International guidance recommends screening women for depressive symptoms in the postpartum year and referring them for treatment.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> However, a comprehensive approach to mental health service delivery must include the <italic>prevention</italic> of mental disorders.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Many existing interventions are secondary prevention, and include indicated (for women with current symptoms) or selective (for women exposed to known risk factors) approaches.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> However, primary prevention strategies which are offered universally to reduce population prevalence are more cost-effective, less stigmatising and more likely to be used.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p><p>Seven rigorously-conducted trials of universal postnatal primary prevention interventions have been published.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Of these, only two reported beneficial effects.</p><p>Most of these interventions assessed only depression as an outcome. None of the trials stratified the outcome analyses by psychiatric history; and most did not identify the risk factor they were seeking to address.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> The What <italic>Were We Thinking (WWWT)</italic> programme was designed to address these gaps.</p><sec id="s1a"><title>The <italic>WWWT</italic> prevention programme</title><p><italic>WWWT</italic> is a brief, structured, couple-focused psychoeducational intervention to address modifiable risks and thereby prevent common postnatal mental disorders among women. It is designed to be integrated into universal postnatal primary care as part of a parenting programme.</p><sec id="s1a1"><title><italic>WWWT</italic> conceptual model</title><p>The early postpartum period for a woman is characterised by reduced participation in activities outside the domestic sphere, disruption to social support in paid workplaces and social networks, and therefore greater dependence on her intimate partner. The quality of day-to-day interactions between partners is central to emotional well-being. The workload of caring for an infant and managing a household in which an infant lives is large and never complete. A partner who recognises and affirms a woman's mothering skills and understands her predicament enhances her confidence and well-being.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Conversely a woman whose partner does not recognise or is critical of her work can feel demeaned and shamed. Brown and Harris<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> articulated a social theory of depression in which such experiences of entrapment and humiliation are defined as key risks.</p><p>Caring for a highly dependent infant is isolating and repetitive, and can be anxiety-arousing, especially if the infant is unsettled and is difficult to sooth. Repeated attempts to sooth a baby who cries inconsolably or is difficult to breastfeed can be experienced as demoralising. The use of unsustainable and ineffective strategies to settle the infant to sleep can lead to cycles of increased anxiety and diminished confidence in parents.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p><p>We propose that the impact of unsettled infant behaviour and difficulties in the partner relationship are mediated by occupational fatigue. The work of household management and infant care is neither dignified with the language of work nor accorded the occupational protections that exist in paid workplaces. Since infant care and household tasks are not named as work they can be under-recognised and trivialised. Extreme fatigue is widespread among new mothers and can have a profound negative impact on functioning.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Unsettled infant behaviour exacerbates fatigue at this life stage and contributes to relationship difficulties. Fatigue may precede rather than be symptomatic of depression in women.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p><p>We postulate that depression and anxiety among mothers of infants can be conceptualised as reflecting poorly functioning intimate relationships with the partner and baby, which are potentially modifiable. Since the common mental disorders (anxiety, adjustment disorders and depression) are not easily distinguished, <italic>WWWT</italic> addresses them together.</p><p><italic>WWWT</italic> incorporates the three key elements of psychoeducation: information, skills development and emotional support.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> It uses adult learning, small group instruction and social cognition theories. It is positioned as meeting new parents&#x02019; high learning needs for life stage-specific information and skills to underpin behaviour change.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
<italic>WWWT</italic> includes partners and provides skills to modify day-to-day interactions in this relationship. It includes the infant and addresses infant behaviours. It is informed by established theories and intended to be implemented in primary care.</p></sec><sec id="s1a2"><title>Preliminary evidence of efficacy of <italic>WWWT</italic></title><p>The acceptability, salience and preliminary evidence of efficacy of <italic>WWWT</italic> were demonstrated in a before-and-after controlled study.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Control and intervention groups were recruited and followed sequentially. All received usual postpartum primary healthcare and intervention group participants were also invited to attend a <italic>WWWT</italic> programme, facilitated by trained, supervised, specialist child and family health nurses.</p><p>Among women without a psychiatric history, being in the intervention group was associated with significantly reduced odds (OR=0.43, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.89) for a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-IV (DSM-IV) diagnosis of depression or anxiety or adjustment disorder with depressed mood, anxiety or mixed anxiety and depressed mood in the first 6&#x02005;months postpartum compared to the control group after adjusting for baseline group differences. The <italic>WWWT</italic> intervention appears to be a promising means of preventing common mental disorders.

Once they are proficient, interviewers begin study interviews and then participate with the researchers and other interviewers in weekly supervision and feedback sessions.</p><p>Data will be collected in the CATI platform. The CATI platform uses field limiters which minimise mis-entry and ensure that there are no missing data.
