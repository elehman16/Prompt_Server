Amphetamine-like drugs have been employed as cognitive enhancers, but they show important side effects and induce addiction. In this study, we investigated the use of modafinil which appears to have less side effects compared to other amphetamine-like drugs. We analyzed effects on cognitive performances and brain resting state network activity of 26 healthy young subjects.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology</title><p>A single dose (100 mg) of modafinil was administered in a double-blind and placebo-controlled study. Both groups were tested for neuropsychological performances with the Raven&#x02019;s Advanced Progressive Matrices II set (APM) before and three hours after administration of drug or placebo. Resting state functional magnetic resonance (rs-FMRI) was also used, before and after three hours, to investigate changes in the activity of resting state brain networks. Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) was employed to evaluate differences in structural connectivity between the two groups.

In recent years, modafinil has also been used off-label to treat cognitive dysfunction in psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and the Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) <xref rid="pone.0069224-Dawson1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0069224-Volkow1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p><p>Modafinil is involved in the modulation of orexin, a hypothalamic neuropeptide <xref rid="pone.0069224-Ishizuka1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> that regulates wakefulness. Several studies have also indicated that the drug interferes with the activity of additional neurotransmitters like hypocretin, histamine <xref rid="pone.0069224-James1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) <xref rid="pone.0069224-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, glutamate <xref rid="pone.0069224-Gass1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, and norepinephrine <xref rid="pone.0069224-Minzenberg1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Finally, recent studies have shown that modafinil can also block the dopamine transporter (DAT1), thereby increasing brain dopamine levels <xref rid="pone.0069224-Volkow2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p><p>The employment of psychostimulants to promote cognitive enhancement has been recently widely debated <xref rid="pone.0069224-Greely1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Among the drugs that have gathered some interest as cognitive enhancers, modafinil has emerged as a potential pharmacological aid to enhance performance in domains like attention and memory <xref rid="pone.0069224-Kalechstein1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0069224-Turner1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. However, to date, the potential of this drug as modulator of fluid intelligence (Gf) is still unknown. In this study, we aimed at filling this knowledge gap and evaluated effects of a single dose of modafinil on Gf performances in a cohort of healthy young individuals.</p><p>Several amphetamine-like drugs have been employed as cognitive enhancers but all of them have important side effects and show great risks of inducing addiction <xref rid="pone.0069224-Ghahremani1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Modafinil might have therapeutic potentials compared to other stimulants like methylphenidate <xref rid="pone.0069224-Moldofsky1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> and amphetamine <xref rid="pone.0069224-Kollins1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> as the drug has been reported to produce fewer side effects and shows less risk of inducing addiction. However, this notion has been eventually challenged given the strong effect of modafinil on the dopaminergic system <xref rid="pone.0069224-Volkow2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p><p>In this study a single dose (100 mg) of modafinil was administered to healthy young individuals and acute effects on cognition, modulation of brain resting state network (RSNs) activity, and structural connectivity were evaluated. We tested modafinil effects on Gf in a population of young healthy subjects. The study meant to further our knowledge on the activity of the drug in a physiological setting. We chose a relatively low dosage in order to evaluate potential positive effects while reducing at minimum the drug side-effects. This is in line with previous investigations employing the same dosage <xref rid="pone.0069224-Turner1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p><p>Cognition was evaluated in terms of Gf. Gf is a complex human ability that allows flexible thinking, comprehension of abstract relations, and plastic adaptation to new cognitive problems, situations or events <xref rid="pone.0069224-Carpenter1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Gf is considered a major factor in affecting learning and usually investigated with the Raven&#x02019;s advanced progressive matrices II set (APM) <xref rid="pone.0069224-Raven1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Upon APM evaluation, subjects are asked to choose missing parts of visuo-spatial patterns (i.e., matrices) in a set of fixed alternatives. The tasks involve flexibility in thinking, pattern matching abilities as well as relational reasoning <xref rid="pone.0069224-Carpenter1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.</p><p>Resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) is an excellent tool to evaluate modifications of functional connectivity <xref rid="pone.0069224-Buckner1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. The technique has emerged as an important modality of fMRI acquisition. Compared to task-related fMRI, rs-FMRI offers some advantages. Rs-fMRI allows the simultaneous investigation of multiple cortical circuits at once. The possibility of studying subjects at rest greatly reduces confounding factors like inter-individual variability in task compliance and/or performance during fMRI acquisition <xref rid="pone.0069224-Ferreira1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. For these reasons we decided to employ rs-FMRI to study effects on functional connectivity.</p><p>Early rs-fMRI studies have investigated the activity of specific cerebral regions at rest <xref rid="pone.0069224-Fleisher1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> with blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) fMRI. Rest activity is organized in multiple and highly specific functional RSNs <xref rid="pone.0069224-Damoiseaux1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. To date at least ten RSNs have been identified <xref rid="pone.0069224-Damoiseaux1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0069224-VandenHeuvel1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Of these ten, the most studied are: the Default Mode Network (DMN) <xref rid="pone.0069224-Raichle1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>; the Salience Network (SN); the Fronto Parietal Control (FPC) network (lateralized in both hemispheres); the primary Sensory Motor Network (SMN), the Exstrastriate Visual System (EsV), and the Dorsal Attention Network (DAN) <xref rid="pone.0069224-Damoiseaux1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. These are the RSNs we chose to investigate as previous studies indicated their relation to the main cognitive domains that encompass Gf <xref rid="pone.0069224-Sestieri1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0069224-Corbetta1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>.</p><p>Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) allows the study of white matter tract integrity and provides complementary information to evaluate structural connectivity <xref rid="pone.0069224-Pagani1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>.

We enrolled twenty six young male right-handed (as assessed by the Edinburgh Handedness inventory) <xref rid="pone.0069224-Oldfield1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> adults (age range: 25&#x02013;35 y.o.) with comparable levels of education (13 years). All subjects had no past or current signs of psychiatric, neurological or medical (hypertension, cardiac disorders, epilepsy) conditions as determined by the Millon test and by clinical examination. Subjects showing visual or motor impairments were excluded as well as individuals taking psychoactive drugs or having a history of alcohol abuse. All volunteers were instructed to maintain their usual amount of nicotine and caffeine intake and avoid alcohol consumption in the 12 h before the initiation of the study. Study subjects received, in a double blind fashion, either a single dose of modafinil (modafinil group) or a placebo (placebo group) pill identical to the drug (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0069224-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The day after drug/placebo assumption, subjects were asked about perceived side effects and, in particular, sleep disturbances.

Gf is defined as basic reasoning skill that is not affected by cultural and education factors. APM items are matrices of figures arranged in three rows and three columns and placed in sequence. Participants are asked to identify missing segments and choose among eight alternative answers. The test consists of four series of matrices. The first series is introductory, made of 12 items, not computed, and used as trial for the following items. The other series consist of 12 items each (for a total of 36). In these series items are placed in order of increased difficulty and presented as A, B, and C <xref rid="pone.0069224-Raven1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>
<xref rid="pone.0069224-Schweizer1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Therefore, we analyzed APM results considering three scores that were based on difficulty levels (A&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;low, B&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;medium, C&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;high) in order to have more detailed information on performances.</p><p>Participants completed APM before (pre-test) and after (post-test) rs-fMRI scans and drug/placebo intake. Three subjects in the modafinil group declined to be studied with APM. Measurement of cognitive ability was extrapolated by taking in consideration the number of correct answers. Items were divided in three categories accordingly to the degree of difficulty. Each category was composed of 12 items. Three factor mixed design ANOVA followed by Duncan's post-hoc test was performed and the general linear model (GLM) approach employed after aligned rank transformation (ART) of data <xref rid="pone.0069224-Wobbrock1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Group (modafinil or placebo) was the between-subjects factor. Time (pre- and post-test), and difficulty levels (low, medium, and high) were the within-subjects factors. Type 1 error (&#x003b1;) for null-hypothesis rejection was set at p&#x0003c;0.050. Statistical analysis was performed using Statistica 6.0 (Statsoft, Tulsa, OK) software.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Rs-fMRI acquisition</title><p>Rs-fMRI BOLD data were separated in three runs lasting four minutes each followed by high resolution T1 anatomical images. Subjects were asked to relax while fixating the central point in the middle of a grey-background screen that was projected on a LCD screen and viewed through a mirror placed above the subject head. Subject head was positioned within an eight-channel coil and foam padding was employed to minimize involuntary head movements. BOLD functional imaging was performed with a Philips Achieva 3T Scanner (Philips Medical Systems, Best, The Netherlands), using T2*-weighted echo planar imaging (EPI) free induction decay (FID) sequences and applying the following parameters: TE 35 ms, matrix size 64&#x000d7;64, FOV 256 mm, in-plane voxel size 4&#x000d7;4 mm, flip angle 75&#x000b0;, slice thickness 4 mm and no gaps. 140 functional volumes consisting of 30 transaxial slices were acquired per run with a volume TR of 1671 ms. High resolution structural images were acquired at the end of the three rs-fMRI runs through a 3D MPRAGE sequence employing the following parameters: sagittal, matrix 256&#x000d7;256, FOV 256 mm, slice thickness 1 mm, no gaps, in-plane voxel size 1 mm&#x000d7;1 mm, flip angle 12&#x000b0;, TR&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;9.7 ms and TE&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;4 ms. Image data processing was carried out using the BrainVoyager QX software (Brain Innovation, Maastricht, The Netherlands).</p><p>RSNs were investigated by means of independent component analysis (ICA) (the protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0069224.s003">Checklist S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0069224.s002">Protocol S1</xref>). Briefly, independent components (IC) were extracted for each data set and scaled to spatial z-score maps. In each IC map, the z-score value associated to a given voxel reflects the weight of IC time course with respect to its relative measured BOLD data, thereby providing an indirect indication of functional connectivity. Group IC maps, representing the most physiologically relevant and consistently reported RSNs, were obtained (S1). The group map of each network was threshold at a significance level of p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.05 (Bonferroni corrected for multiple comparisons). This threshold map was then employed to create a mask of voxels representing the whole network. Distinct masks representing the different nodes of the RSN were also obtained considering the 200 most significant voxels around each local Z-score maximum. For each mask, we then extracted the 52 Z-score values representing individual levels of connectivity in the whole network and in single nodes during different experimental conditions. Individual Z-scores in each node were compared by means of a mixed design ANOVA with the factors group (drug, placebo) and time (pre, post) in order to evaluate statistically significant connectivity changes due to treatment (modafinil or placebo). These ANOVAs were followed by Duncan&#x02019;s post-hoc tests with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. A Bonferroni correction with a n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a; number of nodes &#x0200a;=&#x0200a;22 (see results) was considered to avoid false positives. Statistical significance was set at p&#x0003c;0.050. Statistical analysis was performed using Statistica 6.0 software.</p><p>Group-level t-maps resulting from direct voxel-by-voxel contrasts between pre and post-drug conditions were also produced. These maps were threshold at p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons using a cluster size algorithm (S1).</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>DTI imaging and analysis</title><p>DTI images were acquired before and after drug consumption (exactly 3 h later) and data used to build Fractional Anisotropy (FA) maps. DTI images were acquired using the manufacturer&#x02019;s diffusion weighted multi slice spin echo EPI pulse sequence with enhanced gradient mode and 16 gradient directions. Image parameters were as follow: field of view, 22.4 cm; slice thickness, 2 mm; imaging matrix, 112&#x000d7;112; repetition time, 10702 ms; echo time, 55 ms; bandwidth in EPI frequency direction, 2.97 kHz; number of slices, 60; slice gap, 0 mm; b-value 800 s/mm2. EPI factor, 59; SENSE factor, 2. For Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) analysis, diffusion data were processed using FMRIB&#x02019;s FSL 4.1.8 toolbox (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl">http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl</ext-link>) <xref rid="pone.0069224-Woolrich1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>.

This finding is in line with the idea that the drug can work better in individuals performing at submaximal levels <xref rid="pone.0069224-Finke1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>. This result is in accordance with investigation employing modafinil to compensate frank cognitive deficits in psychiatric patients <xref rid="pone.0069224-Minzenberg3" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. Our regression analysis also shows that the drug can work to some extent but cannot increase performances when subjects are facing items of high levels of difficulty. Interestingly, the analysis also revealed a placebo effect in subjects starting with lower baseline scores and dealing with low level of difficulty items. This placebo effect is likely due to an overall increase in motivation. Of note, modafinil has no a similar effect in the same set of individuals (i.e.: subjects starting with lower baseline scores and dealing with low level of difficulty items). Effects of modafinil, observed only in low performing subjects, are in line with previous observations reporting no or even negative modafinil effects on cognition of healthy subjects <xref rid="pone.0069224-Finke1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>.

Interestingly, training tasks that are aimed at improving working memory and Gf also promote increased D1 receptor density in the PFC throughout inhibition of DAT1 activity <xref rid="pone.0069224-McNab2" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>. These results suggest an important role for dopaminergic neurotransmission in these processes and provide a neurobiological substrate for the modafinil effects.</p><p>It should also be emphasized that, despite the common assumption that DAT1 is strictly localized in the striatum (and absent in the frontal cortex), data on rodents demonstrate significant levels of transporter binding in the ACC, prelimbic, and rostral areas of the frontal cortex <xref rid="pone.0069224-Sesack1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref> while extrastriatal DAT1 localizations have been confirmed in post-mortem human brains where the transporter has been found in the neocortex although at lower density when compared its striatal distribution <xref rid="pone.0069224-Ciliax1" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>.</p><p>Our rs-fMRI findings suggest that modafinil modulates functional connectivity in specific RSNs like the lFPC, DAN, and bilateral EsV. In agreement with previous data showing effects on the PFC <xref rid="pone.0069224-Minzenberg1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, we have found that the drug significantly enhanced ACC functional connectivity within the IFPC. An interesting study <xref rid="pone.0069224-Smith1" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref> underlines the fact that the brain is organized in networks that are divided in subnetworks. These subnetworks are associated with different cerebral functions. The FPC network is constituted by two different subnetworks that are strongly lateralized. The right FPC (insular areas) supports perception&#x02013;somesthesis&#x02013;pain domains. The lFPC (Broca&#x02019;s and Wernicke&#x02019;s areas) strongly correlates with cognition&#x02013;language domains. A recent study indicated neural substrates of Gf and showed that the process is modulated by the lFPC <xref rid="pone.0069224-Barbey1" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref>. These left specializations offer a potential neural substrate for the modafinil- induced lateralized effects that we observe on the lFPC. The ACC result is in line with the increased ACC functional connectivity promoted by modafinil in a population of metamphetamine addicts who performed deterministic and associative learning tasks during fMRI <xref rid="pone.0069224-Ghahremani1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p><p>EsV is known to play an important role in attention as selection of relevant information is mediated by visual attention <xref rid="pone.0069224-Driver1" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref> and several studies indicate that, at the neural level, the act of directing attention to a particular stimulus is often associated with increased EsV activation <xref rid="pone.0069224-Corbetta1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>.</p><p>Our findings are not in line with a recent fMRI study in which modafinil (100 mg) was administered for seven days and showed no effect on attentional tasks while promoted decreased ACC connectivity <xref rid="pone.0069224-Rasetti1" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref>. The discrepancy between the two set of findings may be due to differences in drug regimens (acute versus chronic) as chronic exposure to the drug likely favours different re-arrangements of brain regions in response to receptor desensitization.</p><p>Attention processes involve the activation of DMN, FPC and DAN. DAN is hypothesized to modulate externally directed attention by amplifying or attenuating the saliency of relevant and irrelevant cues <xref rid="pone.0069224-Corbetta1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Pharmacological modulation of dopaminergic neurotransmission strongly affects attention and DAN activity. In that respect, methylphenidate is known to block dopamine reuptake and increase DAN activation upon visual attention and memory tasks <xref rid="pone.0069224-Mller1" ref-type="bibr">[69]</xref>. Modafinil also blocks DAT1, thereby providing a common mechanism of the action on DAN activity that we observed.</p><p>A recent study, investigated effects of modafinil on DMN activity in healthy subjects <xref rid="pone.0069224-Minzenberg2" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. In this study, subjects performed a simple visual sensorymotor task upon slow event-related fMRI and the authors found that modafinil promoted DMN deactivation as well as faster reaction time. When considering the study experimental design several differences emerge in comparison to our work [different modafinil doses, wider age range of study subjects as well as the type of task chosen during fMRI (visual sensorimotor)]. These differences can, at least in part, help to explain the discrepancy with our findings as we do not observe changes in DMN activity. However, modafinil appears to induce a plastic reorganization of specific brain regions involved in learning and Gf.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our results suggest that modafinil positively modifies brain connectivity with a pattern that can be related to Gf. Changes of functional connectivity induced by modafinil suggest a speculative hypothesis by which Gf modulation is associated with a concerted enhanced activity of visual-spatial, memory, and attentive skills.</p><p>A word of caution should be spent on the general use of modafinil. Modafinil has been originally indicated as cognitive enhancer with low risk of inducing addiction and few side effects. However, it is becoming clearer that the drug is acting on dopaminergic neurotransmission and therefore, as other classic psychostimulants, poses addiction risks. Furthermore, the long-term modafinil effects are still not completely explored. Better drugs with less addictive profiles will definitely provide more effective tools to safely address the issue of pharmacological modulation of cognition in physiology and pathology.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0069224.s001"><label>Text S1</label><caption><p>
