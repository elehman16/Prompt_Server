Women who experience stillbirth, compared to women with live birth, have a nearly sevenfold increased risk of a positive screen for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and a fourfold increased risk of depressive symptoms. Because the majority of women who have experienced the death of their baby become pregnant within 12&#x02013;18&#x000a0;months and the lack of intervention studies conducted within this population, novel approaches targeting physical and mental health, specific to the needs of this population, are critical. Evidence suggests that yoga is efficacious, safe, acceptable, and cost-effective for improving mental health in a variety of populations, including pregnant and postpartum women. To date, there are no known studies examining online-streaming yoga as a strategy to help mothers cope with PTSD symptoms after stillbirth.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">The present study is a two-phase randomized controlled trial. <italic>Phase 1</italic> will involve (1) an iterative design process to develop the online yoga prescription for phase 2 and (2) qualitative interviews to identify cultural barriers to recruitment in non-Caucasian women (i.e., predominately Hispanic and/or African American) who have experienced stillbirth (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;5). <italic>Phase 2</italic> is a three-group randomized feasibility trial with assessments at baseline, and at 12 and 20&#x000a0;weeks post-intervention.

Each year more than 26,000 babies are stillborn, and in many cases, even after a postmortem evaluation, the cause is unknown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Many mothers suppress their grief and feel stigmatized, socially isolated, and their baby&#x02019;s lives devalued by society [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. These experiences seem to worsen trauma reactions, such as despair, thoughts of suicide, anxiety, guilt, shame, and anger [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].

In an effort to destigmatize stillbirth, <italic>The Lancet</italic> has published two issues dedicated entirely to stillbirth in 2011 and 2016 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Psychological health</title><p id="Par27">Women who experience stillbirth, compared to women with live birth, have a nearly sevenfold increased risk of a positive screen for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a fourfold increased risk of depressive symptoms, twice the risk of a positive screen for generalized anxiety disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Symptoms of PTSD and its associated comorbidities (e.g., anxiety and depression) may contribute to diminished self-compassion (i.e., poor self care), emotional dysregulation, and compromised sleep quality, all of which have been associated with declining physiological well-being, weight retention/gain, increased chronic disease risk (e.g., heart disease, diabetes), premature mortality, poor quality of life, and cognitive delays in subsequent children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].

A recent systematic review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] evaluated intervention studies in bereaved mothers after stillbirth and identified only two [one small RCT and one feasibility study (outside of US)] from 1980 to 2015. One RCT evaluated a support group in women after a stillbirth compared to a no-treatment concurrent control group. The authors concluded that grief counseling may reduce grief symptomology after a stillbirth. This is particularly salient in mothers with poor social support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The other explored the feasibility, acceptance, and cultural fit of a brief mindfulness-based intervention to reduce perinatal grief and other mental health indices (i.e., depression, coping) among Indian mothers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. There were significant improvements in anxiety, depression, coping, life satisfaction, social provisions, and mindfulness as a result of the intervention.</p><p id="Par29">Given the lack of intervention studies conducted within this population, more research with appropriate control groups are needed to inform evidence-based care.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Rationale for study</title><p id="Par30">The most common treatments for PTSD are exposure therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], referral to support groups/interpersonal counseling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], and/or psychiatric medication or other medications to treat physical symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Although these strategies demonstrate some effectiveness in the general population with PTSD, they are unlikely to be fully effective for bereaved mothers for a variety of reasons. First, bereaved mothers&#x02019; engagement in treatment (e.g., initiation of therapy, support groups) is uncommon (&#x0003c;25%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Second, because bereaved mothers may be trying to conceive again, or have already conceived, they are often reluctant to take psychiatric medication, preferring non-pharmacologic alternatives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In addition, medication cannot address the psychosocial aspects of grief and the accompanying emotional distress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Third, though support groups for bereaved parents may provide a familiar and safe environment to connect with others who have had similar experiences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], these groups often have little to no emphasis on adaptive coping strategies for PTSD symptoms (e.g., hypervigilance, intrusion, avoidance) and the underlying emotional etiology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Fourth, bereaved mothers report unique barriers to participation in activities outside the home, such as encountering other babies in public, and many express strong interest in home-based treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Finally, women may not have access to specialized treatment (e.g., exposure therapy, support groups) based on where they live, insurance coverage, or access to specialized clinicians, resulting in limited options for treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. It is crucial for science to develop novel approaches to inter-conception care amenable to the needs of these mothers.</p><p id="Par31">Yoga may be an ideal treatment for addressing the unique PTSD symptoms of bereaved mothers after the death of a baby.

Participants will be asked to perform slow, controlled, and complete movements. Progression will include demonstration by the instructor of modifications with a slightly less difficult and a more challenging version for the specific exercise. For example, a participant may be asked to perform a plank on their knees and a modification may be to straighten their legs, making the exercise more difficult. Variability will be demonstrated by changing the stretching and toning exercises every 3&#x000a0;weeks. For example, in the first 3&#x000a0;weeks, participants will be introduced to the new activities, and in the remaining weeks 4 to 12, they are encouraged to increase the difficulty by adding more repetition or performing the more challenging modification. Participants will be asked to complete the STC videos in a specific order, which will include a warm-up, four upper body, four lower body, three trunk/core, and one to two balance exercises, with appropriate progression over 12&#x000a0;weeks. The STC videos will have discussion related to form and safety by the instructor (i.e., no guidance for movement with breath or mindfulness).

Weekly, the research team will be responsible for ensuring the completeness and timeliness of the data reported by the participants. Additionally, the research team will skim the data after each collection time point to ensure it is complete and will follow-up with any participants in which data collection is not complete.</p><p id="Par85">Data quality will be monitored throughout the study. Measurement values will be compared to their known ranges. Out of range values will be investigated and either corrected if possible or treated as missing data. Statistical analyses will adjust for baseline demographic characteristics when statistically appropriate. Multiple imputations will be used to conduct statistical analysis with missing data. In the event that the missing at random assumption is violated, we will model the missing data mechanism and conduct sensitivity analysis on model parameters.</p><p id="Par86">We have multiple strategies in place to identify yoga participation both during video sessions and outside of video sessions. First, we will be collecting 24-h, time-stamped GENEActiv accelerometer data at baseline, post-intervention (12&#x000a0;weeks), and follow-up (20&#x000a0;weeks) and will have a full record of their activity level during these time points. We will also be monitoring UDAYA website log-in information and will be able to localize activity monitor data while the participant is logged into the website and using the yoga videos. This will allow us to verify whether the participant is being active during the times they are using the website. Second, we will collect self-reported minutes of yoga using a log. This self-report log will also give us a time stamp of yoga activity that we will be able to cross-refer to the accelerometer data. Finally, we will be able to monitor all other physical activities that are performed outside of yoga, examining whether the intervention may have unintended effects of activity within other types of physical activity. Collectively, we will have a full record of yoga and physical activity (outside of yoga) participation that we will be able to use to understand the &#x0201c;dosage&#x0201d; that is being achieved for this trial.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="Par87">Inferential analyses: To examine quantitative feasibility measures, we will use Fisher&#x02019;s exact tests when expected cell counts &#x0003c;5 and <italic>t</italic> tests to compare feasibility scores between the low and moderate dose groups. Significant differences between the two groups will indicate which yoga group is more feasible. We will also use logistic and Gaussian regression analyses to further compare feasibility scores between groups while adjusting for baseline participant characteristics.</p><p id="Par88">We will use Fisher&#x02019;s exact tests and ANOVAs to compare quantitative acceptability scores across control and yoga groups. Logistic and Gaussian regression analyses will be used to compare scores while adjusting for baseline participant characteristics. We expect participants in the control group to report similar levels of acceptability compared to those in the yoga groups, but participants in the yoga groups are expected to report greater improvements on outcomes than control participants.</p><p id="Par89">Descriptive analyses: SPSS and <italic>R</italic> will be used to conduct descriptive statistical analyses, including graphical analysis (e.g., scatter plots, boxplots and histograms) and data summarization (e.g., means, medians, ranges, cross-tabulations) to identify data entry errors, outliers, and non-normal distributions. Standard errors and confidence intervals will be calculated using either parametric or non-parametric methodology, including the use of the bootstrap to estimate standard errors when parametric assumptions fail.</p><p id="Par90">Data from the qualitative interviews will be transcribed and independently coded by the research team using NVivo. After coding is complete, researchers will meet to reach agreement on major themes of the interviews. Once the major themes have been determined, findings will be verified through member checking to determine accuracy of findings. Principal Investigator (PI) Huberty and Co-I Cacciatore have extensive training and experience in qualitative methods.</p><p id="Par91">Psychometric analyses: We will evaluate scale reliabilities using Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha coefficients based on baseline (T1) data. Scale inter-correlations will be estimated along with complete descriptive statistics on scale items.</p><p id="Par92">Randomization check: We will also conduct an ANOVA to compare the experimental and control groups on outcome and demographic variables at baseline.</p><sec id="Sec27"><title>Missing data</title><p id="Par93">Substantial missing data are anticipated in this study. Participants may refuse to participate or withdraw from the study at any time. In addition, daily and weekly logs may not be complete despite efforts by research staff to encourage completion. Missing data due to non-response on certain items within a scale will initially be handled by creating an average scale score for all participants who responded to at least 75% of items on that scale. We will evaluate whether missingness due to attrition is related to group membership and examine relations between missingness and any missing individual&#x02019;s pretest scores on outcome variables. If missingness is found to satisfy the missing at random assumption, we will handle the missing data using multiple imputation. Multiple imputation will also be used to handle item-level missingness for final analyses of scales. In the event that the missing at random assumption is violated, we will model the missing data mechanism and conduct sensitivity analysis on model parameters. All analyses will retain all participants who were assigned to the intervention or control groups (i.e., intent to treat).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Data monitoring</title><p id="Par94">Due to the nature of this study, an IMC will be established and comprised of four committee members. Due to their combined expertise related to stillbirth care, biostatistics, NIH-funded studies, and yoga safety, they are qualified to review the patient safety data generated by this study.</p><sec id="Sec29"><title>Adverse events</title><p id="Par95">An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject during participation in the clinical study or with use of the experimental agent being studied. An adverse finding can include a sign, symptom, abnormal assessment (laboratory test value, vital signs, electrocardiogram finding, etc.) or any combination of these regardless of relationship to participation in the study. Adverse events that are non-serious will be provided to the IMC with summaries of the numbers and rates of AEs by group.</p><p id="Par96">Expedited review will occur for all events meeting the FDA definition of serious adverse events (SAEs), i.e., any fatal event, immediately life-threatening event, and permanently or substantially disabling event. This also includes any event that a study investigator or the IMC judges to impose a significant hazard, contraindication, side effect, or precaution. For purposes of this study, all SAEs will be reported to the IMC regardless of any judgment of their relatedness to the study treatment.</p><p id="Par97">The PI will record all reportable events with start dates occurring any time after informed consent is obtained until 7 (for non-serious AEs) or 30&#x000a0;days (for SAEs) after the last day of study participation. Each week, participants will report in their weekly logs the occurrence of AE/SAEs since the last week. If the participants are not completing their logs, they will be prompted via email by the research team to complete their logs. If there are two consecutive failed email attempts, the participants will be called. Events will be followed for outcome information until resolution or stabilization.</p><p id="Par98">The research team will determine if the event is an AE or an SAE. If an SAE, the research team will complete a form to be provided to the IMC to meet and investigate the SAE until determined resolved or stable and its relation to the study (related or not related). Once recruitment begins, IMC will meet twice a year and will meet ad hoc when AE or an SAE occur. AE reports and annual summaries will not include individual identifiable private information about the human subjects. Each report will only include the identification code previously assigned.</p><p id="Par99">At 6&#x000a0;weeks (midway through the intervention), participants will be asked to complete the IES-R and answer a 1-item Likert-based question related to whether they think the intervention is contributing to their symptoms for the IMC to review. Every 2&#x000a0;weeks of the intervention, participants will be asked to fill out the PHQ-9 via Qualtrics within 48&#x000a0;h. A research team member will monitor PHQ-9 completion daily (including weekend/holidays). Women with scores suggestive of clinical depression (&#x0003e;15) will be notified and advised to follow up with their primary care physician. If suicidal ideation is noted with a screen score of two or three on question 9 of the PHQ-9, the participant will be contacted within 24&#x000a0;h by a crisis-trained, clinical staff for further assessment of risk. Clinical providers trained by the MISS Foundation are well equipped to handle psychological crises, have a system currently used for their existing 3000 grieving families they help annually, and have staff available on weekends/holidays. If imminent suicidal risk is present, the staff will follow MISS Foundation emergency procedures to ensure participant safety, and the participant will be discontinued from the study. If there are no concerns for active suicidal risk after the phone assessment, the participant will be able to continue in the study if she desires. All participants will have the MISS Foundation provider&#x02019;s phone number, and the research personnel can either email, call, text, or page the lead clinical provider to respond to psychiatric issues. Depending on the need of the participant, one of them will be able to talk to a clinician within 2 to 3&#x000a0;h.</p><p id="Par100">If at any time during the study a participant should call a member of the research team emotionally distressed, not making clear sense, sounding intoxicated or impaired, or expressing thoughts of suicide or homicide, the research personnel will use a second phone line to contact the counselor, without losing verbal contact with the woman. At that point, the clinician will guide the interview to ascertain the acuity and/or potential for harm and will first determine if the caller is alone or has access to another adult capable of transportation. If determined that the woman is in need of emergent care, options for such care will be discussed with the caller and may include referral to the closest emergency room (ER), notification of emergency services for transportation to the nearest ER, and emergent counseling appointment coordinated by the MISS Foundation or their preferred provider. If the subject declines such a referral and the clinician remains concerned about the participant&#x02019;s safety, emergency services in her area (determined during the consent process) will be notified of the clinical concern for safety.</p></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Reporting</title><p id="Par101">The PI will report any incidents, i.e., adverse events (AEs) or serious adverse events (SAEs), that meet the Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) criteria for unanticipated problems. The PI will complete a form with the following information to the IRB: (1) appropriate identifying information for the research protocol (i.e., title, investigator&#x02019;s name, IRB project number); (2) a detailed description of the adverse event, incident, experience, or outcome; (3) an explanation of the basis for determining that the adverse event, incident, experience, or outcome represents an unanticipated problem; and (4) a description of any changes to the protocol or other corrective actions that have been taken or are proposed in response to the unanticipated problem. Unanticipated problems that are serious adverse events will be reported to the IRB, IMC, and National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) within 7&#x000a0;days, and any other unanticipated problem will be reported within 14&#x000a0;days of the investigator becoming aware of the problem/event. All unanticipated problems should be reported to the appropriate institutional officials (as required by an institution&#x02019;s written reporting procedures), the supporting agency head (or designee), and the OHRP within 1&#x000a0;month of IRB&#x02019;s receipt of the report of the problem from the investigator.</p><p id="Par102">Study progress and safety will be reviewed monthly (and more frequently if needed). Progress reports, including patient recruitment, retention/attrition, AEs, and SAEs, will be provided to the IMC semi-annually. An annual report will be compiled and will include a list and summary of AEs and SAEs and will address (1) whether AE/SAE rates are consistent with pre-study assumptions, (2) the reason for dropouts from the study, (3) whether all participants met entry criteria, (4) whether continuation of the study is justified on the basis that additional data are needed to accomplish the stated aims of the study, and (5) the conditions whereby the study might be terminated prematurely. The annual report will be sent to the IMC and will be forwarded to the IRB and NCCIH. The IRB and other applicable recipients will review progress of this study on an annual basis. The study team will generate study reports for the IMC and will provide information on the following study parameters: enrollment status, subject status, demographics, stopping or halting rules, unanticipated problems, adverse events, protocol deviations, quality management, and outcome data (if applicable at time of report). Study report tables will be generated only from aggregate (not by group assignment) baseline and aggregate safety data for the study population.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>Research ethics approval</title><p id="Par103">The Arizona State University Institutional Review Board has approved all protocols, data and safety monitoring plans, and study materials. All protocol amendments, other than minor administrative changes as defined by the NCCIH Guidance on Changes in Clinical Studies in Active Awards, will be submitted in a prospective manner to NCCIH except when necessary to protect the safety, rights, or welfare of subjects. Prior to submission to NCCIH, the proposed changes will be reviewed and approved by the IMC. IRB approval will not be sought until after NCCIH approval of the protocol amendment has been obtained.</p></sec><sec id="Sec32"><title>Informed consent</title><p id="Par104">All consent documents will be obtained electronically, via Qualtrics, prior to the woman&#x02019;s participation in the study (phase 1 or phase 2).

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec34"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par106">This RCT study will explore the feasibility and acceptability of a 12-week, home-based, online-streamed yoga intervention, with varying doses (low = 60&#x000a0;min/week; moderate = 150&#x000a0;min/week) among bereaved mothers who have experienced a stillbirth within 6&#x000a0;weeks to 24&#x000a0;months. To date, this is the first study to ascertain the preliminary effects of home-based, online-streamed yoga on reducing PTSD symptoms below the clinical threshold in mothers who have experienced the death of a baby to stillbirth. This study is particularly important not only because the risk for PTSD is nearly seven times the risk as compared to that for mothers with live births but also because there have only been two randomized control trials in the last 30&#x000a0;years aimed at improving emotional and mental health in these grieving mothers, which also affects surviving and subsequently born children. If feasible, the findings from this study will inform a full-scale trial to determine the effectiveness of home-based, online-streamed yoga to improve PTSD. Long-term, health care providers could use online yoga as a non-pharmaceutical, inexpensive resource to help women manage their symptoms after a stillbirth.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>AE</term><def><p id="Par5">Adverse event</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ER</term><def><p id="Par6">Emergency room</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ERQ</term><def><p id="Par7">Emotional Regulation Questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HIPAA</term><def><p id="Par8">Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IES-R</term><def><p id="Par9">Impact of Event Scale-Revised</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IMC</term><def><p id="Par10">Independent Monitoring Committee</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IRB</term><def><p id="Par11">Institutional Review Board</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LD</term><def><p id="Par12">Low dose</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MAAS</term><def><p id="Par13">Mindful Attention Awareness Scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MD</term><def><p id="Par14">Moderate dose</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NCCIH</term><def><p id="Par15">National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NIH</term><def><p id="Par16">National Institutes of Health</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PGS</term><def><p id="Par17">Perinatal Grief Scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PHQ-9</term><def><p id="Par18">Patient Health Questionnaire-9</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PSQI</term><def><p id="Par19">Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PWMAQ</term><def><p id="Par20">Past-week Modifiable Activity Questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCT</term><def><p id="Par21">Randomized controlled trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SAE</term><def><p id="Par22">Serious adverse event</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SCS</term><def><p id="Par23">Self-Compassion Scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>STAI</term><def><p id="Par24">State-Trait Anxiety Inventory</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>STC</term><def><p id="Par25">Stretch and tone control</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to acknowledge Jules Mitchell for her expertise and contributions to the workpresented here.</p><sec id="FPar16"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par107">This study is supported by the National Institutes of Health and National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (1R34AT008808-01A1).
