It is commonly seen in hospital emergency departments and wards with an estimated prevalence of 15% in the UK. A significant proportion of patients with sepsis go on to develop severe sepsis or septic shock with associated mortality rates of up to 50% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Despite considerable research there still remains a lack of targeted pharmacological interventions to treat and improve outcomes from sepsis.</p><p>Statins inhibit 3-hydroxy-3 methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, a rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of cholesterol. They are well established in the prevention of cardiovascular disease and have been shown to exert numerous effects in addition to their lipid-lowering properties. These pleiotropic properties include anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects resulting in improved endothelial function, reduced thrombogenicity and plaque stabilisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>The inflammatory and immune response provoked by sepsis could potentially be modulated by statins via these pleiotropic effects. Several systematic reviews have concluded that statins have a role in improving infection-related outcomes and mortality but most of this evidence comes from retrospective and prospective observational studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In a prospective cohort study of 361 patients it was reported that patients already receiving statin therapy had reduced rates of severe sepsis and intensive care admissions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. So far there have been only two published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the role of statins in sepsis. One of these, a double-blind RCT to assess whether acute administration of statins reduced sepsis progression and cytokine production was stopped prematurely due to slow recruitment and was unable to analyse data relating to sepsis conversion. There were significantly decreased levels of IL-6 and TNF-&#x003b1; at 72 hours, however, compared with baseline (<italic>P </italic>= 0.02) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. A more recent RCT investigated whether continuation of pre-existing statin therapy prevented conversion of sepsis to severe sepsis. It concluded that continuation of statin therapy did not reduce progression of sepsis or the development of organ failure and that the witholding of statin therapy did not result in any inflammatory rebound [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>The recent withdrawal from the market of recombinant activated protein C (drotrecoginalfa, rhAPC) following the results of the PROWESS-Shock trial has resulted in there being no specific therapy for sepsis other than source control and antibiotics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Statins offer a safe multi-modal mechanism to target the inflammatory and immunological cascade of sepsis which could be prescribed to patients prior to the establishment of septic shock.</p><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the acute use of atorvastatin 40 mg/day in ward patients with sepsis would significantly reduce rates of conversion of sepsis to severe sepsis (&#x02265; one organ failure) compared with placebo in patients not previously treated with statins.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>This was a single centre randomized, double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Ethical approval was granted by the South Birmingham Research Ethics Committee and the trial was registered with the International Standard Randomized Control Trial Registry (ISRCTN64637517). Valid informed written consent was obtained from all patients or their next of kin prior to enrolment in the trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Study participants</title><p>Between June 2006 and August 2008, patients admitted to Birmingham Heartlands Hospital within 24 hours, with a white cell count (WCC) &#x0003e; 11 or &#x0003c; 4 &#x000d7; 10<sup>9</sup>/L and with C-reactive protein (CRP) 2 SD above the upper limit of normal (6 mg/L), were identified from the hospital's iCARE Vortal database. These patients were screened further for eligibility for enrolment into the trial.</p><p>The inclusion criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] were as follows: age greater than 18 years; documented new proven or suspected infection, and the presence of any two of the signs and symptoms of infection (WCC &#x0003e; 11 or &#x0003c; 4 &#x000d7; 10<sup>9</sup>/L, temperature &#x0003e; 38&#x000b0;C or &#x0003c; 36&#x000b0;C, heart rate &#x0003e; 90/bpm, or respiratory rate &#x0003e; 20/minute) for less than 24 hours. We excluded patients with evidence of severe sepsis defined by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guideline (SSCG), that is, sepsis with failure of one or more organs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]; pregnancy; acute or chronic liver failure; evidence of myopathy; rhabdomyolysis, or terminal illness. Prior statin therapy within 2 weeks, the concomitant use of macrolides, imidazoles, or other lipid-lowering therapy, and the inability to swallow also precluded enrollment.</p><p>An amendment was approved to allow enrolment of patients prescribed macrolides. These antibiotics form part of local guidelines for treatment of community-acquired pneumonia and are frequently prescribed. The additional risk of myopathy caused by competition for metabolism by cytochrome P450 3A4 between atorvastatin and macrolides was deemed to be mitigated by the careful monitoring of serum creatinine kinase (CK).</p></sec><sec><title>Randomization and blinding</title><p>Study drug packs were prepared by DHP pharma (Powys, UK). The active and placebo drug components of capsules were packaged identically into numbered treatment packs, each containing 40 mg atorvastatin (Pfizer, Sandwich, UK) or placebo. We used a computer-generated randomization sequence with a block size of four. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio by a centralised randomization service (Heartlands Hospital Pharmacy, England, UK). Participants, care providers, and investigators were blinded to group assignment. Study drug was administered orally within 24 hours of randomization. Treatment continued for the duration of their hospital stay or 28 days if earlier. All other therapeutic decisions were at the discretion of the primary physician.</p></sec><sec><title>Data collection</title><p>We obtained the data for diagnosis of sepsis and severe sepsis from medical notes and laboratory reports. Data was also collected to calculate Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) scores with its predicted hospital mortality and Modified Early Warning Scores (MEWS) to evaluate the severity of patients' conditions at baseline. We followed all participants up to 12 months after randomization and collected data for critical care admission rate, hospital readmissions at 28 days and 1 year, length of hospital stay, and 28-day and 1-year mortality. Quality of life (QOL) data were collected at baseline and day of discharge using the validated EuroQol visual analogue scale (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Laboratory investigations</title><p>Appropriate microbiological samples were sent for culture to establish the site of infection and pathogen and collection was guided by clinical condition. Full blood count, plasma urea and electrolytes, liver function tests, CK levels, coagulation studies and arterial blood gas analysis were recorded. Lipid profiles and CRP were measured at baseline, day 4, day 7 and day 28. Urine samples were collected at the same intervals to measure urine albumin creatinine ratios (ACR).</p></sec><sec><title>Study outcomes</title><p>The primary outcome was the progression rate of sepsis to severe sepsis during the hospital stay or by 28 days if earlier. The progression of sepsis to severe sepsis was identified using the SSCG screening tool as described in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). Secondary outcomes were critical care unit (CCU) admission rate, hospital readmission rate at 28 days and 1 year, length of hospital stay, and hospital 28-day and 1-year mortality.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Criteria used for classifying organ dysfunction and progression to severe sepsis</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="center" colspan="2">Severe sepsis defined as new or suspected infection with one or more organ dysfunctions Organ dysfunction defined as:</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><bold>Cardiovascular</bold></td><td align="left">SBP &#x0003c; 90, MAP &#x0003c; 65 mmHg or &#x0003e; 40 mmHg fall in SBP from baseline and/or use of noradrenaline/dobutamine/dopamine</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>Respiratory</bold></td><td align="left">Bilateral pulmonary inflitrates with new or increased oxygen requirements to maintain oxygen saturations &#x0003e; 90% or bilateral pulmonary inflitrates with a PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2 </sub>ratio &#x0003c; 300 mmHg</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>Renal</bold></td><td align="left">Creatinine &#x0003e; 176.8 mmol/L or urine output &#x0003c; 0.5 mls/kg/hr for &#x0003e; 2 hrs</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>Haematological</bold></td><td align="left">Platelets &#x0003c; 100,000/mm<sup>3</sup><break/>INR &#x0003e; 1.5 or APTT &#x0003e; 60 secs</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>Liver/metabolic</bold></td><td align="left">Bilirubin &#x0003e; 34.2 mmol/L<break/>Lactate &#x0003e; 2 mmol/L</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>APTT: activated partial thromboplastin time; INR; international normalized ratio; MAP: mean arterial pressure; SBP: systolic blood pressure.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec><sec><title>Sample size and statistical analysis</title><p>Based on limited data available at the time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], it was postulated that statins might reduce the absolute rate with which sepsis converted to severe sepsis by 15% (40% to 25% change).

It demonstrates that statins were well absorbed in patients with sepsis, and administration early in the septic process significantly reduced the likelihood of sepsis progressing to severe sepsis. One case of severe sepsis was prevented for every five patients with sepsis.</p><p>This randomized controlled trial supports previous retrospective and prospective observational studies demonstrating that patients who are on pre-existing statin therapy have better sepsis-related outcomes compared to matched controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>The significant reduction in urinary ACR at day 4 in the statin-treated group may explain slowing of sepsis progression in that group. Albumin excretion in urine is tightly regulated by the kidneys. In inflammatory states, especially sepsis, however, glomerular permeability increases due to altered endothelial function, resulting in increased protein excretion. This is an early sign in sepsis and persists in patients who develop organ dysfunction. We postulate that the significant reduction seen in ACR in the statin group may reflect less damage in endothelial function and hence a reduction in the progression of sepsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>The atorvastatin group showed significant decreases in both plasma cholesterol and LDL between days 1 and 4. This demonstrates compliance with treatment, absorption of statins and effective plasma concentrations being achieved to cause decreases in plasma lipids. The ability of atorvastatin to reduce lipid levels after only three doses in combination with the reduced rates of sepsis progression seen would indicate that statins are able to exert their pleiotrophic effects acutely, thereby modulating the immune and cellular responses to sepsis. The HARP study showed that 80 mg of simvastatin administered acutely to patients with acute lung injury showed significant improvements in organ failure scores, suggesting that statins modulate the systemic inflammation after only a short duration of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>EuroQol scores at baseline were low for the cohort indicating that the majority of patients considered their QOL to have deteriorated substantially from health due to their sepsis-related hospital admission. This is not surprising; however, when compared to their physiological and biological markers of infection, such as APACHE II scores, which were low, the EuroQOL scores indicate that although our patients had relatively mild disease they perceived their illness to have had a significant impact on their QOL. Reassuringly, the EuroQol scores had improved significantly by the time of discharge, suggesting that patients had improved not only in terms of bio-physical markers of disease but also in their personal well-being.</p><p>Although the trial did not achieve its recruitment target, it is still the second largest RCT to date investigating the role of statins in sepsis, and is the first to suggest benefit from acute statin therapy. The screening process involved assessing all admissions to the hospital on the basis of laboratory levels of CRP, WCC and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria. This process was neither specific nor sensitive for identifying patients with sepsis, and a high refusal rate was seen among those who were subsequently eligible for randomization. The majority of patients randomized were not critically ill, as observed by their low APACHE II scores at baseline. This supports previous studies that have encountered similar recruitment problems when conducting sepsis-related research on ward-based patients, as the vast majority are not critically ill at admission, have a low rate of progression of sepsis, and the diagnosis of sepsis remains non-specific and non-sensitive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Recent validation studies using the predisposition, insult, response, organ dysfunction (PIRO) model for stratification of risk of sepsis have suggested that this may allow more sensitive and specific phenotyping of patients with sepsis. Future studies into sepsis should consider using such models as opposed to the classical criteria used in this study to increase the likelihood of targeting desired populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, our study is the first RCT to demonstrate a benefit from acute administration of atorvastatin 40 mg daily for preventing the progression of sepsis in statin-na&#x000ef;ve individuals. We postulate that statins may modulate the pathophysiology of sepsis via a novel cellular mechanism thereby restoring endothelial integrity and thus blocking one of the mechanisms in the development of multi-organ failure. Future large-scale multi-centre RCTs are required to investigate whether these results are reproducible, further explore the role of statins in sepsis and elucidate the cellular mechanisms by which statins confer protection in sepsis.</p></sec><sec><title>Key messages</title><p>&#x02022; Atorvastatin 40 mg per day may prevent the progression of sepsis to severe sepsis in hospitalized patients.</p><p>&#x02022; Statins may act acutely to prevent organ dysfunction.</p><p>&#x02022; Cellular mechanisms of organ protection need further evaluation, which may be associated with the improvement of endothelial integrity.</p><p>&#x02022; Larger RCTs are warranted to establish whether statins can to be used in the early phases of sepsis to prevent the onset of organ failure.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ACR: albumin creatinine ratio; APACHE II: acute physiology and chronic health evaluation; APTT: activated partial thromboplastin time; CI: confidence interval; CK: creatinine kinase; CCU: critical care unit; CRP: C-reactive protein; HDL: high-density lipoprotein; HMG-CoA: 3-hydroxy-3 methylglutaryl coenzyme A; IL-6: interleukin-6; INR: international normalized ratio; IQR: inter-quartile range; LDL: low density lipoprotein; MAP: mean arterial pressure; MEWS: modified early warning score; PIRO: predisposition, insult, response, organ dysfunction; QOL: quality of life; RCT: randomized controlled trial; rhAPC: recombinant activated protein C; RRT: renal replacement therapy; SBP: systolic blood pressure; SIRS: systemic inflammatory response syndrome; SSCG: Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines; TNF-&#x003b1;: tumour necrosis factor-alpha; WCC: white cell count.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>This trial received funding from The Moulton Charitable Foundation and Pfizer Global Pharmaceuticals.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>FG was chief investigator for this study and takes full responsibility for the integrity of the data analysis.
