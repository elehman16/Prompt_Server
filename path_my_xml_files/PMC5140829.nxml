isotonic sports drink (500&#x02005;ml water, 32 gr carbonhydrate, 120&#x02005;mg calcium, 248&#x02005;mg chloride,
230&#x02005;mg sodium) the level of the skeletal muscle damage of orienteering athletes. [Subjects
and Methods] The study was carried out on 21 male elite orienteering athletes. The
athletes were divided into two groups by randomized double-blind selection. The
experimental group (n=11) was given the isotonic sports drink, while the placebo group
(n=10) was given 500&#x02005;ml pure water. Blood samples were taken pre-competition,
post-competition, 2 hours post-competition and 24 hours post-competition. [Results] The
pre-c troponin, myoglobin and creatinine kinase serum levels of the placebo group were
significantly lower than the post-competition and 2 hours post-competition values. The 24
hours post-competition levels of the same analyses were also significantly lower than the
post-c and 2 hours post-competition. The pre-competition troponin, myoglobin and
creatinine kinase levels of the experimental group were found to be significantly lower
than the post-competition, 2 hours post-competition 24 hours post-competition values. In
conclusion, the present results suggest that the intake of supportive sports drinks before
exercising significantly prevents the observed muscle damage. The study showed that serum
myoglobin levels between the experimental and the placebo group is significantly different
during the 2 hours post-competition period. [Conclusion] The level of serum creatinine
kinase and myoglobin accurately shows the extent of the muscle damage. However, further
studies on the effect of isotonic sports drink in different training programs on the cell
membrane and the muscle damage are needed.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Orienteering athletes</kwd><kwd>Muscular damage</kwd><kwd>Sports drinks</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The muscular damage is described as a condition which results in exhaustion, fatigue, loss
of power and pain after heavy exercises<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.
The cellular damage occurs depending on the intensity and the type of the exercise. This is
termed as micro trauma, micro injury or muscular damage in the literature<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Different type of exercises cause pain in
different degree and they have different effects on the muscular damage<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Strenuous and unaccustomed exercise can induce skeletal
muscle damage and this is particularly true of exercise including eccentric contraction<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Although muscular damage is closely related
to the intensity of the exercise, unfamiliar exercises can cause muscular damage
frequently<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Increased activity of CK and LDH may occur in serum in healthy subjects after exercising
and serves as a marker of injury to skeletal muscle, where the degree of biochemical
abnormality reflects the extent of tissue injury. Due to the nature of the orienteering
competitions which take place on both flat and rough surfaces (downwards and uphill) the
muscles are subjected to both eccentric and concentric contractions. During the runs
downwards the muscles are mainly subjected to eccentric contraction which cause more
muscular damage compared with the runs on flat surfaces where the muscles are subjected to
both eccentric and concentric contractions<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Athletes loose water and electrolyte by sweat and consume a lot of energy during training
and competition periods. The loss of even 2% of liquid as a result of training or a mild
dehydration may cause a significant decrease in their performance. As the body is
dehydrated, the blood volume and the amount of sweat formation decrease and body temperature
increases. In order to compensate this excessive temperature, the body needs to work much
harder to support the blood circulation and produce more sweat. The loss of essential
electrolytes of sodium and potassium salts causes complications such as muscle cramps,
fatigue and exhaustion and headaches. By the help of appropriate drink, the depleted levels
of water, carbohydrates and electrolytes can be replaced. The sports drinks were developed
to replace the liquid, electrolyte and energy lost during the training period. The isotonic
drink quickly replaces the liquid lost by sweat and provides carbohydrate needed<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Based on all this information, the aim of
the study is to determine the effects of the intake of the isotonic sports drink on the
level of the skeletal muscle damage of orienteering athletes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The study was practiced on 21 male elite orienteering athletes who had at least two years

CK and LDH of seven athletes whose muscles primarily perform eccentric contractions. The
athletes were asked to run first on a flat surface then on a surface with %10 inclination.
Following downhill running (57% of VO2max), significant delayed-onset soreness was
experienced in gluteal, quadriceps, anterior leg, and posterior leg muscles, and plasma CPK
(but not LDH) activity was significantly increased (351% at 24 h). In contrast, following a
78% of VO2max running, no statistically significant soreness occurred in any muscle group,
and plasma CPK and LDH activities were not elevated<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Another important factor regarding athletes&#x02019; health and performance is the liquid and
electrolyte balance. This balance is very important to maintain the optimum performance
during the exercise. The increased need of liquid and decrease in sodium intake and the
marginal insufficiency of the calcium, potassium and magnesium may result in a decline in
the performance. It is stated that the intake of drinks before, during and after the
competition within appropriate protocols would obviate the decrease in the performance of
athletes<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. The main functions of water in relation to physical activity are
to carry oxygen to tissues, hormones and nutrients as well as carbon dioxide and other
metabolic wastes; to help regulate the level of blood pH, and to help dissipate heat<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. The water needs depend on the intensity
of the activity and thermal stress and 0.7&#x02013;1 l/h of isotonic drink during activity should be
taken<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. The drink should contain
0.5&#x02013;0.7&#x02005;g Na/l for sports of 2&#x02013;3 hours, while Na 0.7&#x02013;1.2&#x02005;g/l for ultra-endurance<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Sports drinks should hydrate and prevent
dehydration during sports activity, provide mineral salts (mainly Na and Cl and P); provide
carbohydrates (HC) increase the absorption of water by the combination of mineral salts and
sugars (fast and slow absorption in a ratio of 3/1)<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Amelink et al. tested the hypothesis that calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum
contributes to exercise-induced muscle damage. Dantrolene sodium (Dantrium) is a muscle
relaxant that affects the flux of calcium over the sarcoplasmic membrane. Rats were treated
with dantrolene sodium for a week before a 2&#x02005;h run on a treadmill. The total creatine kinase
activity and isoenzyme composition in plasma were measured before and after the exercise.
The treated rats showed a marked decrease (34%) in exercise-induced enzyme efflux, caused by
a decrease in the muscle specific isoenzyme. While a 13-fold increase found in control rats,
only a 6.5-fold increase in treated animals was observed. It is concluded that dantrolene
sodium protects the muscle against exercise-induced damage<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Brink et al., studied the effect of the sports drink on the sustainability of the
performance in a tennis match on 8 tennis players. Their hypothesis was that drinking sports
beverages before, during and after each tennis match would limit the decrease in physical
performance compared to conditions where the only fluid intake was water. The physical test
results for the lower limbs showed no significant differences between the groups.
Conversely, on the upper limbs the EMG data showed greater fatigue of the triceps brachii in
the placebo condition compared to resting, while the ingestion of sports drinks attenuated
this fatigue<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. In another study, six
male volunteers exercised to exhaustion on a cycle ergometer at a workload which required
approximately 70% of Vo2max. After one preliminary trial, subjects performed this exercise
test on six occasions a week. Immediately before the exercise, and at 10-min intervals
throughout, subjects ingested 100&#x02005;ml of one of the following: control (no drink), water,
glucose syrup, fructose syrup, glucose-fructose syrup or a dilute glucose-electrolyte
solution. Each of the syrup solutions contained approximately 36&#x02005;g CHO per 100&#x02005;ml; the
isotonic glucose-electrolyte solution contained 4&#x02005;g glucose per 100&#x02005;ml. Expired air samples
for determination of Vo2, respiratory exchange ratio and the rate of CHO oxidation were
collected at 15-min intervals. Venous blood samples were obtained before and after exercise.
Subjects drinking the isotonic glucose-electrolyte solution exercised longer (90.8
(12.4)&#x02005;min, mean (SEM) than on the control test (70.2 (8.3)&#x02005;min; p less than 0.05)<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Also in another study, Lukaski HC emphasizes the importance of magnesium for the work
performance. Acute, intense activity results in short-term increases in both urine and sweat
losses of minerals that apparently diminish during recovery in the days after exercise.
Supplemental magnesium and zinc apparently improve strength and muscle metabolism<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. Ivy et al. states that in the athletes
given the carbon hydride and protein drink has 22% of their muscle glycogen refreshed after
40 minutes following a strenuous exercise and the replacement of the muscle glycogen after
two hours takes place 4 times faster than the athletes who take carbohydrate support
only<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. Saunders et al., reported that
the athletes given a supplement CHO-P (carbohydrate and protein) mixture throughout the an
exhaustive cycling exercise had 83% lower CK enzyme levels at the15th hour after the
exercise compared with those who took carbon hydride only<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Some results obtained in literature also support the hypothesis of this research. For
example; Isomaltulose, for its slow rate of hydrolysis and low glycogenic index<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>, and for the characteristics of fructose,
its component, with increased fluid and solute absorption in the small intestine and
increased exogenous oxidation<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>, could
improve the duration of exercise. Sports drinks should: hydrate and prevent dehydration
during sports activity, provide mineral salts (mainly Na and Cl and P); provide
carbohydrates (HC) increase the absorption of water by the combination of mineral salts and
sugars (fast and slow absorption in a ratio of 3/1). For hydration to be adequate, drinks
during the competition must be isotonic (200&#x02013;320 mOsm/kg water). During physical activity,
in sports with a duration of less than 1 hour, international institutions recommend not

effect and decreases the muscle damage incurred during competitions. Although the muscle
damage of experimental group was lesser than the placebo group during the competition and
recovery period, it was not found to be significant. It is possible that the isotonic drinks
could be useful for athletes since they prevent the muscle from being damaged and increase
the stability of muscle cells by establishing the liquid and electrolyte balance of the
body. Further research is needed to clarify the effect of the isotonic drinks on the cell
membrane. Sports drinks should moisturize by providing minerals and carbohydrates and
increase the absorption of water with an ideal combination of salts and sugars. Therefore,
it is important to provide correct hydration-protocols before, during and after physical
activity, as well as know possible limitations of the sport.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><person-group><name><surname>Burke</surname><given-names>RE</given-names></name></person-group>: Heart Rate Monitor and Training.
