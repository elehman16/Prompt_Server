They also decrease sympathetic tone causing attenuation of neuroendocrine and hemodynamic responses to anesthesia and surgery, providing greater hemodynamic stability intra- and postoperatively.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] The &#x003b1;2 adrenoceptors belong to G-protein coupled family of transmembrane receptors and are present at both pre- and post-synaptic autonomic ganglia in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Binding of agonists, endogenous (norepinephrine) or exogenous (clonidine and dexmedetomidine), results in G-protein coupling with the inhibition of both adenylyl cyclase and phospholipase C activity and subsequent effects.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Both, clonidine and dexmedetomidine are imidazoline compounds and act by same mechanism, nevertheless there is a difference in the &#x003b1;2 selectivity, dexmedetomidine being 8 times more &#x003b1;2 selective than clonidine, has an elimination half-life, which is 4 times less and distribution half-life, which is 2 times less than clonidine making dexmedetomidine more desirable for continuous infusion.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Although providing a good hemodynamic control both the drugs, however, have been seen to prolong recovery from anesthesia when used along with propofol, and, in addition, dexmedetomidine has been reported to affect the cognitive function after an infusion in healthy volunteers, a property which is not observed with the use of clonidine at low-dose infusions.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] There are no studies comparing this property of the two drugs. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to compare the effects of clonidine and dexmedetomidine on intra-operative hemodynamics, recovery time, and postoperative cognitive function impairment when administered as propofol adjuvants.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study design</title><p>We designed a randomized, double-blinded, control study to evaluate the effects of clonidine and dexmedetomidine (as propofol adjuvants) on intra-operative hemodynamics, recovery time, and postoperative cognitive function impairment.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Patient demographics - inclusion and exclusion criteria</title><p>After obtaining an Institutional Ethical Committee approval and individual written informed consent, 45 adult, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade I and II patients, of both genders, undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy were included in the study. All the patients were assessed for eligibility and were explained about the study protocol and the questions they were going to be asked in the postoperative period. Using sealed opaque envelopes patients were randomly divided into three groups (15 subjects in each group). Group P - patients received propofol and saline infusion; Group C - patients received propofol and clonidine infusion; and Group D - patients received propofol and dexmedetomidine infusion. Both patients and anesthesiologists were blinded to the administered drug. Patients older than 50 years, on &#x003b2; blockers, taking asthma treatment, allergic to any drug, with any degree of heart block or with a history of psychiatric illness, pregnant, and lactating females were excluded from the study.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Patient drug treatment</title><p>Patients received oral lorazepam 2 mg, the night and the morning before the surgery along with oral ranitidine 150 mg. On arrival in the operation theater after the establishment of intravenous (IV) and monitoring lines, all patients were given IV injection glycopyrrolate 0.2 mg and injection ondensetron 4 mg. Group C patients received an initial bolus dose of clonidine 3 &#x003bc;g/kg over 15 min followed by a continuous infusion of 1.5 &#x003bc;g/kg/h, Group D patients received dexemedetomidine 1 &#x003bc;g/kg over 15 min followed by a continuous infusion of 0.6 &#x003bc;g/kg/h, and Group P patients received a bolus of normal saline over 15 min at the same rate followed by an infusion, by the researcher. After the bolus dose patients were induced with IV propofol 2 mg/kg given by the anesthesiologist in a separate IV line, to facilitate intubation IV rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg was administered, and for analgesia IV fentanyl 2 &#x003bc;g/kg was given. All the patients were given diclofenac suppository 2 mg/kg per rectally after the induction.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Anesthesia maintenance/management during and postsurgery</title><p>Maintenance of anesthesia was done with propofol infusion along with N<sub>2</sub>O: O<sub>2</sub> (60:40). Propofol was started at 3 mg/kg/h and then titrated to maintain bispectral index (BIS) of 55 &#x000b1; 5. Intermittent doses of rocuronium were given to maintain muscle relaxation after every 20 min or on the return of spontaneous respiration, whichever was earlier. Electrocardiography, pulse rate (PR), oxygen saturation, end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> were continuously measured, and mean arterial pressure (MAP) was measured every 5 min. A decrease in MAP &#x0003e;20% was intervened with injection mephentermine 3&#x02013;6 mg and IV fluid boluses, bradycardia (PR &#x0003c;40/min) was intervened with injection atropine 0.6 mg.</p><p>At the end of surgery, both the infusions and N<sub>2</sub>O flow were stopped. Before stopping the infusion, it was made sure that at least 30 min have passed since the last dose of muscle relaxant. Patients were called by name and asked to open their eyes. Time from stopping of infusion to making an attempt to open the eyes was noted. After which neuromuscular block was reversed with neostigmine 0.05 mg/kg and glycopyrrolate 0.02 mg/kg and patient was extubated and shifted to the recovery room.

Hence, the dose of clonidine was selected on the basis of previous studies, which have sorted out the its most effective dose of for intra-operative use.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] The dose of clonidine was considered equipotent to that of dexmedetomidine.

The decrease in MAP and PR after both the drugs were administered of similar magnitude with no added advantage of more selective agonist dexmedetomidine over clonidine. Our results are in concert with the results of Taittonen <italic>et al.</italic>,[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] where it is reported that both clonidine and dexmedetomidine provide similar metabolic and hemodynamic effects.</p><p>Hypotension and bradycardia are the major side effects of &#x003b1;2 agonists.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] In the present study, one patient in Group C and 2 patients in Group D experienced brief periods of bradycardia during insufflation, which responded promptly to atropine without any need for interruption of either clonidine or dexmedetomidine infusion. The requirement of propofol to maintain the similar level of BIS score was reduced significantly with clonidine (45%) and dexmedetomidine (40%) compared to the control group. The results are consistent with previous studies showing a reduction in the requirement of maintenance dose of propofol with concomitant use of clonidine (20&#x02013;40%) and dexmedetomidine (30&#x02013;50%).[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] The sedative effect of &#x003b1;2 agonists is mediated through the locus ceruleus in the brain stem, where they decrease sympathetic outflow and increases parasympathetic outflow.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] As the mechanism for producing the sedative effect is different from propofol, there is a possible synergism upon combined administration of &#x003b1;2 agonists and propofol with respect to their sedative effects. The propofol sparing effect of clonidine and dexmedetomidine may be beneficial for reducing the propofol dosage and hence avoiding adverse effects mainly including myocardial depression, metabolic acidosis, and impaired platelet aggregation.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p><p>The time of eye opening (recovery time) was significantly prolonged in patients receiving clonidine compared to propofol alone. The delayed recovery was further significantly higher in patients receiving dexmedetomidine compared to those receiving propofol with clonidine, as well as those receiving propofol alone. The delayed recovery with dexmedetomidine as propofol adjuvant is consistent with previous reports.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] With clonidine however contrasting results have been documented. Goyagi <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and Higuchi <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] have reported a delayed emergence, which is supportive of the findings observed in the present study on the other hand Bella&#x003bf;che <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] have found no delay with the use of clonidine in the propofol based anesthesia. Such discrepancy in results among studies might arise due to different clonidine doses administered and the presence or absence of premedication in the control patients. However, in the previous studies, clonidine was used as premedication oral or IV before induction and not as an infusion during the surgery. A striking finding of the present study, is that, the delay in recovery is much more evident with dexmedetomidine compared to clonidine suggesting an explanation involving &#x003b1;2 receptor selectivity and pharmacodynamics of the drug.</p><p>Postoperative impairment of cognition, as judged by SMSQ, was impaired to a moderate degree in the dexmedetomidine group. In clonidine group, only 40% patients had mild impairment of cognition at 15 min and all the patients had normal cognition at 30 min. On the other hand, not only the dexmedetomidine group had a moderate degree of impaired cognition, it took almost an hour for the full recovery of cognition. Hall <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] have evaluated the effect of clonidine and dexmedetomidine on cognitive function on healthy subjects in two different studies. In one study, it was reported that clonidine infusion up to 2 &#x003bc;g/kg/h for 60 min did not cause an impairment of cognitive functions in healthy subjects, a significant impairment was observed at 4 &#x003bc;g/kg/h infusion (plasma concentration above 1.5 ng/ml).[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Small dose dexmedetomidine infusion, on the other hand, caused an impaired performance on cognition testing, which lasted for at least 1 h after termination of infusion.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>A similar finding has been reported by Bustillo <italic>et al.</italic>,[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] where dexmedetomidine infusion was used for sedation during embolization of cerebral arteriovenous malformations and found that although patients were awake and following simple commands 10 min after the discontinuation of the infusion of dexmedetomidine, they were unable to undergo cognitive testing even after 45 min of discontinuation. Although it has been reported that dexmedetomdine affects complex cortical processing, the cause of cognitive impairment is unknown. One possibility suggested by Bustillo <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] is that dexmedetomidine enters cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) reaching 4% &#x000b1; 1% of the plasma concentration peaked in CSF 2&#x02013;10 min after the end of infusion and remained elevated up to 45 min. In the present study, therefore, very well demonstrates the difference in the effect of clonidine and dexmedetomidine as propofol adjuvants on the cognitive functions, thereby, providing valuable information regarding their use as anesthetic adjuvants especially in elderly patients where postoperative cognitive dysfunction is very common, and in situations where there is a need to perform cognitive functions intra-operatively such as during certain types of neurosurgical (awake craniotomy) and interventional neuroradiologic procedures.</p><p>Although, the present study was very convincingly compares the various effects of using clonidine and dexmedetomidine as propofol adjuvant, however, there are certain limitations. First, owing to its long elimination half-life clonidine is not being used for continuous sedation, and although it has been used as a continuous infusion in different studies, there is no consensus on applied dose regimen for infusion. Second, the plasma concentrations of the drugs were not measured therefore, no comments on the pharmacokinetic interactions could be made. Third, propofol was administered using a manually controlled infusion rather than the recommended target controlled infusion. Furthermore, the recovery assessment was done only by a verbal stimulus, which was not standardized, and the cognitive function assessment test scale that was used was very simple which did not provide a numerical value.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Our study, thus, demonstrates that the use of &#x003b1;2 agonists provide hemodynamic stability by reducing the sympathetic response to laryngoscopy and extubation, and have a propofol-sparing effect, however, both drugs delay emergence from propofol based anesthesia suggesting that propofol sparing effect is not associated with faster recovery. Cognitive impairment was also observed, when both drugs were used as adjuvants. Dexmedetomidine infusion at the recommended dose impairs cognitive functions, which do not improve even after 45 min of discontinuation. Clonidine at the dose of 3 mcg/kg bolus followed by an infusion of 1.5 mcg/kg/h provides good intra-operative conditions, without much affecting the cognitive functions, needs further evaluation.</p><sec id="sec2-9"><title>Financial Support and Sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-10"><title>Conflicts of Interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of
