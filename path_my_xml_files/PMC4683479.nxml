With the advent of newer molecules, there have been time and again efforts to improve its efficacy and utility even for longer duration surgeries. Among the various adjuvants added to intrathecal doses of ropivacaine, dexmedetomidine has attained an admirable position owing to its selective &#x003b1;2-adrenergic agonistic action offering prolongation in sensory-motor blockade and enhanced analgesic effects in spinal anesthesia.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Literature supports its usage over a dose range of 3&#x02013;15 &#x000b5;g with hyperbaric bupivacaine, while up to 5 &#x000b5;g with isobaric ropivacaine.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Considering the dose-dependent action of intrathecal dexmedetomidine, we hypothesize that higher dose of dexmedetomidine used as an adjuvant in spinal anesthesia with isobaric ropivacaine would result in better efficacy profile by further prolongation of sensory-motor blockade in patients undergoing lower abdominal surgery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>After Institutional Ethical Approval and written informed consent, 90 patients aged 18&#x02013;60 years, of either sex, of American Society of Anesthesiologist (ASA) grade I or II scheduled for lower abdominal surgery in between September 2012 and August 2014 were included in this prospective, randomized-controlled, double-blinded trial. Patient with a history of end-organ dysfunction, morbid obesity, pregnancy, hypersensitivity to study drugs, and general contraindication to spinal anesthesia were excluded.</p><p>All patients were randomly (computer generated randomization and concealment via sealed opaque envelope technique) assigned to three equal groups to receive spinal anesthesia by 2.5 ml of isobaric ropivacaine (0.75%, 7.5 mg/ml) added to 5 &#x000b5;g (10 &#x000b5;g/ml) or 10 &#x000b5;g (20 &#x000b5;g/ml) of dexmedetomidine or 0.5 ml of normal saline in group A, B or C, respectively. Randomization was performed by an anesthesiologist involved in studied drug preparation. Further procedure and monitoring were performed by another investigator unaware of group allocation; patients were also blinded to the drug regimen utilized for spinal anesthesia.</p><p>Premedication included tablet alprazolam (0.25 mg) and tablet ranitidine (150 mg) administered orally on the evening before surgery, and 2 h before the scheduled procedure. On arrival to the operating room, standard monitors were placed and baseline parameters recorded. All patients were preloaded with lactated ringer solution (15 mg/kg) via peripheral 18 gauge intravenous (IV) catheter. Before the commencement of spinal anesthesia, patients were explained about the procedure and methodology of monitoring methods. In the lateral decubitus position under standard aseptic precautions, using a midline approach lumbar puncture was performed at L3-L4 or L4-L5 intervertebral space by 25 gauge Quincke spinal needle (BD, Gurgaon, Haryana, India). Having confirmed the free flow of cerebrospinal fluid through the spinal needle, the studied drug solution was injected intrathecally over a period of 10&#x02013;15 s and patients were turned to the supine position.</p><p>Primary outcome included the duration of sensory-motor blockade measured from the time point of commencement of spinal anesthesia. The level of sensory blockade was assessed bilaterally (by pinprick method) at the midclavicular line in an ascending fashion from T12 dermatome. Motor blocked was assessed according to modified Bromage score where 0: Patient able to move hip, knee, ankle, 1: Unable to move hip, able to move knee and ankle, 2: Unable to move hip and knee, able to move ankle, 3: Unable to move hip, knee and ankle. The block assessment was performed every 2 min after the commencement of spinal anesthesia until the T6 dermatomal level and Bromage score of &#x0201c;3&#x0201d; has been achieved (desired criteria to initiate surgery). Further assessments were performed at 20 min intervals, until the recovery of S2 dermatome (duration of the sensory block) and Bromage score of &#x0201c;0&#x0201d; (duration of the motor block). All patients where desired level of anesthesia was not achieved within 20 min were regarding as block failures, and managed by performing general anesthesia. These cases were excluded from the study. Hemodynamic variables (heart rate [HR], mean blood pressure [MBP]) were monitored continuously, and any incidence of associated side-effects was documented till sensory-motor levels regressed to above-mentioned threshold during the postoperative period. Any episode of hypotension (systolic blood pressure &#x0003c;90 mmHg or &#x0003e;25% below baseline) was managed by Ephedrine (5 mg) and an additional fluid bolus of ringer lactate solution. Bradycardia (&#x0003c;50 beats/min) was managed by injection atropine 0.5 mg IV bolus.</p><p>To detect a 20% difference in the primary outcome between the compared groups with a standard deviation of 25% (estimated from initial pilot observations), with 80% power and 5% &#x003b1; error (two-sided); a sample size of 26 per group was required. The sample size was calculated by power and sample size calculator of Department of Biostatics, Vanderbilt University, USA. To take care of any dropouts, we selected 90 patients (30 in each group) for our study.</p><p>The statistical analysis was performed with IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 16.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). The continuous variables were compared by one-way analysis of variance test. Discrete variables were compared by Fisher's exact test/Chi-square test, whichever appropriate.

Besides this, direct antinociceptive action for control of both somatic and visceral pain further contributes to the prolongation of analgesia duration.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Above properties could have contributed to enhance anesthetic effects with the usage of 10 &#x000b5;g of Dexmedetomidine under the methodology utilized in our study. Above results are coherent with previous investigations by Al-Mustafa <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrating similar results with 10 &#x000b5;g of dexmedetomidine added to intrathecal bupivacaine for urosurgical procedures.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>Various animal models have documented a dose-dependent synergistic efficacy of &#x003b1;2 agonists added to local anesthetics in spinal anesthesia, with a plateau after a certain dose.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Further increase in &#x003b1;2 agonist dose contributes only to increase in the incidence of associated side-effects. Previous literature shows a 1:10 equivalence dose ratio between dexmedetomidine and clonidine, with a maximally effective dose of intrathecal clonidine equating to 150 &#x000b5;g.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Considering the dose ratio, theoretically maximal effective dose of dexmedetomidine comes out to be 15 &#x000b5;g. We chose to investigate a submaximal dose of 10 &#x000b5;g of dexmedetomidine to avoid any dramatic increase in associated side-effects while assessing the efficacy of increased dose. Under the studied methodology (ropivacaine 18.75 mg), all the selected patients achieved the desired level of anesthesia without any block failures. Previous studies on isobaric ropivacaine observed similar results at a dose of 22.5 mg, but 10% failure rate was reported with a dose of 15 mg.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>It is a well-known fact that intrathecal local anesthetics block the sympathetic outflow and reduces the hemodynamic parameters during the intraoperative period.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] We observed a similar decrease in hemodynamic parameters in all the patients, irrespective of group distribution. However, Al-Mustafa <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated a dose-dependent, but still insignificant decrease in MAP by addition of dexmedetomidine to bupivacaine over a dose range of 5&#x02013;10 &#x000b5;g, when compared with bupivacaine alone.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] As bupivacaine and ropivacaine share a similar pharmacodynamics profile, difference in above observations could be attributed to dissimilar dose-response relationship of above drugs at a particular concentration and volume used in respective studies. Thus, the addition of different doses of &#x003b1;2 agonist to isobaric ropivacaine did not affected the sympatholysis any further and manifested as the similar incidence of hypotensive episodes and dose requirement of vasopressors among the groups.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>Our study has two main limitations. First, these results may vary from investigations performed on other ethnic groups considering the disparity in body height and variations in subjective anesthetic sensitivity. Second, safety-efficacy profile of any drug could be better delineated by performing a dose-dependent study. Thus, the maximally effective dose of dexmedetomidine could go well beyond 10 &#x000b5;g. Future trials could investigate these aspects, with emphasis on effect of variation in dose of local anesthetics on the maximally effective dose of dexmedetomidine.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Dexmedetomidine appears to augment the efficacy of intrathecal ropivacaine in a dose-dependent manner without associated increase in the incidence of associated adverse effects. It could be an attractive alternative for long duration surgeries performed under spinal anesthesia, where cardiovascular stability is a priority.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn
