Seventeen male crack-cocaine users (mean age 30.4&#x000b1;9.8 SD) were randomized to receive 5 sessions of active transcranial direct current stimulation (2 mA, 35cm<sup>2</sup>, for 20 minutes), every other day, and 19 males (mean age 30.3&#x000b1;8.4 SD) to receive sham-transcranial direct current stimulation (placebo) as control group.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Craving scores were significantly reduced in the transcranial direct current stimulation group after treatment when compared with sham-transcranial direct current stimulation (<italic>P=</italic>.028) and baseline values (<italic>P=</italic>.003), and decreased linearly over 4 weeks (before, during, and after treatment) in the transcranial direct current stimulation group only (<italic>P=</italic>.047).

It can be heated and inhaled or smoked (<xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">Wallace, 1989</xref>), yielding physiological and psychoactive effects that are qualitatively similar to snorting cocaine, but more intense (<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">Hatsukami and Fischman, 1996</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">McClelland, 2005</xref>). It establishes a rapid and more severe dependence and strong withdrawal effects, and prognosis is worse compared with cocaine hydrochloride (<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">Hatsukami and Fischman, 1996</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">Moura et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p content-type="indent">The treatment of crack-cocaine dependence imposes a greater challenge compared with snorted cocaine because of the greater addictive profile and more harmful physical and mental consequences. The highly uncontrollable craving to the drug use and, consequently, crack-cocaine binges (<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Chaves et al., 2011</xref>) and the high frequency of relapses are remarkable clinical patterns of this dependence. Pharmacological treatments and bio-psychosocial therapies are of limited efficacy to defeat this drug addiction (<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">McClelland, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">De Oliveira et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">Goldstein and Volkow, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Connolly et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, efforts are needed to develop alternative approaches to improve therapeutic success.</p><p content-type="indent">The chronic use of crack-cocaine seems to disrupt general cognitive functioning, verbal memory, and attentional resources (<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">De Oliveira et al., 2009</xref>). These effects may be reversed after its discontinuation (<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">De Oliveira et al., 2009</xref>). Prefrontal cortex (PFC) dysfunction with regard to regulation of limbic reward regions and its involvement in high-order executive function (self-control, salience attribution, and awareness) has been associated with the loss of control over drug use (<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">Goldstein and Volkow, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Connolly et al., 2012</xref>), which is an important characteristic of addiction (<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">Garavan et al., 2008</xref>). Dorsolateral PFC (dlPFC) activity is highly required when executive control of cognition is required (<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">Kane and Engle, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">Enriquez-Geppert et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, treatment focusing on dlPFC modulation and possibly improving cognitive control over drug intake may be beneficial in the management of crack-cocaine dependence.</p><p content-type="indent">Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a noninvasive brain stimulation technique that induces polarity-dependent alterations of cortical excitability (<xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">Nitsche and Paulus, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">Nitsche et al., 2003</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Modulation of dlPFC functions with tDCS has been shown to reduce craving for smoking (<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Fregni et al., 2008a</xref>), marijuana (<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">Boggio et al., 2010</xref>), and food in healthy subjects (<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Fregni et al., 2008b</xref>). We thus hypothesized that tDCS over the dlPFC might be a promising therapeutic approach to treat drug dependence.</p><p content-type="indent">Previous studies from our group showed that anodal tDCS over the left dlPFC reduced craving and depressive symptoms (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">da Silva et al., 2013</xref>) and improved frontal executive functions (<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">Nakamura-Palacios et al., 2012</xref>) in severe alcoholic subjects. However, when anodal tDCS was applied repetitively over the left dlPFC, relapses to the use of alcohol were likely increased in alcoholics (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">da Silva et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">Gorini et al. (2014)</xref> showed that risk-taking behavior increased after a single session of left dlPFC anodal stimulation, whereas increased safe behavior was observed after right dlPFC anodal stimulation in cocaine users. Therefore, we altered the stimulation protocols in subsequent studies by placing the cathode over the left dlPFC and the anode over the right dlPFC. With this bilateral montage we showed a long-lasting reduction of relapse probability and improvement of perception of quality of life in severe alcoholics after repetitive application (<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">Klauss et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, we showed that single and repetitive application of tDCS can impact cognitive processing of neutral and especially crack-related visual cues in prefrontal areas (<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Conti et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Conti and Nakamura-Palacios, 2014b</xref>).</p><p content-type="indent">Therefore, in this trial we aimed to investigate the clinical effects of repetitive bilateral tDCS (left cathodal/right anodal) of the dlPFC on crack-cocaine addiction measuring craving as the primary outcome. Secondarily, we tested the impact of tDCS on other clinical measurements. We hypothesized that active tDCS would result in a greater reduction of craving compared with sham tDCS.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods|materials" id="s2"><title>Methods and Materials</title><p>We report this clinical trial according to CONSORT guidelines.

Direct currents were transferred via a pair of carbonated silicone electrodes (35cm<sup>2</sup>) with a thick layer of high-conductive EEG gel underneath them according to our previous study (<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">Nakamura-Palacios et al., 2012</xref>). The electric current was delivered by an electric stimulator (Striat, Ibramed Ind&#x000fa;stria Brasileira de Equipamentos M&#x000e9;dicos Ltd, S&#x000e3;o Paulo, Brazil). For tDCS, the cathode was placed over the left dlPFC (F3) while the anode was placed over the right dlPFC (F4) according to the 10&#x02013;20 international system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). In each session, the currents flowed continuously for 20 minutes (2.0 mA).</p><p content-type="indent">For sham tDCS, the electrodes were placed at the same positions, but the stimulator was gradually turned off after 20 seconds. In this way, subjects remain blinded to the respective stimulation condition, as the itching sensation typical for tDCS is often only experienced initially during stimulation (<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">Brunoni et al., 2014</xref>). A previous study validated the sham procedure of 2 mA tDCS, showing similar blinding efficacy as a placebo pill (<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">Brunoni et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p content-type="indent">Both groups (sham- and real tDCS) received one session per day, every other day, with a total of 5 sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Patients were clinically evaluated (HAM-D, HAM-A, and WHOQOL) before intervention and after completion of the protocol. Furthermore, craving evaluation was performed once per week during the 4 weeks of treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Outcomes</title><p>Craving was scored with a brief scale composed of 5 items (1, 2, 4, 5, and 13) from the Obsessive Compulsive Drinking Scale (<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Anton et al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">Anton et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">Anton, 2000</xref>), which assesses craving in a narrow sense according to <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">De Wildt et al.

Secondarily, exploratory analyses show that active and sham tDCS groups also differed regarding changes in anxiety scores, overall perception of quality of life, and health. In all these secondary outcomes, active tDCS resulted in improved outcomes compared with sham tDCS.</p><p content-type="indent">The sham- and real tDCS groups were well matched by socio-demographic characteristics such as age, gender, schooling, and occupation and also by characteristics of crack-cocaine use, especially regarding days of abstinence before tDCS intervention. The socio-demographic characteristics of crack-cocaine users and patterns of drug use are similar to those reported in the Brazilian population (<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Duailibi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">Oliveira and Nappo, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">Dieckmann et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">Moura et al., 2014</xref>) and also to other countries (<xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">Wallace, 1989</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">Vivancos et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">Haas et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">Oliveira et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p content-type="indent">The main outcome parameter of this study was craving for crack-cocaine. According to Sinha, drug-craving has reemerged as a relevant and important construct in the pathophysiology of addiction with its inclusion in DSM-V as a key clinical symptom of addictive disorders (<xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">Sinha, 2013</xref>). This is due to recent inputs of neurobiological evidence for craving-related neural activation and clinical evidence supporting its association with drug use, relapse, and recovery processes (<xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">Sinha, 2013</xref>).</p><p content-type="indent">Craving is defined as an uncontrolled urge to consume a drug, a state resulting from the presence of particularly strong obsessions about and irresistible compulsions to use (<xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">Robinson and Berridge, 1993</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">Hormes et al., 2012</xref>). It may be considered as a dimensional construct that grows with repetition and increasing levels of drug use (<xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">Robinson and Berridge, 1993</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">Sinha, 2013</xref>), even when pleasurable effects are no longer present and after the cessation of withdrawal symptoms (<xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">Robinson and Berridge, 1993</xref>), and it may also increase in strength over extended periods of abstinence (<xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">Robinson and Berridge, 1993</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">Grimm et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p content-type="indent">Although definition of craving is still a matter of extensive debate and is beyond the scope of this study, its clinical significance is less controversial (<xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">Tiffany and Wray, 2012b</xref>). Craving might be the main factor that makes addiction to drugs so difficult to overcome (<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">George and Koob, 2013</xref>). For those who are addicted, craving is a very real intrusion in their daily lives, at times dominating their thoughts and generating considerable distress (<xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">Tiffany and Wray, 2012b</xref>).</p><p content-type="indent">In this study, crack-cocaine users treated with real tDCS showed a progressive decrease in craving over the intervention, a pattern not seen in subjects from the sham-tDCS group. By the end of the treatment, the tDCS group showed significantly lower craving scores compared with the sham-tDCS group and also compared with their initial scores (baseline).</p><p content-type="indent">There are still no effective therapeutic maneuvers for controlling drug craving in the routine treatment of drug dependence. Recent studies, however, suggest that noninvasive brain stimulation techniques, such as Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation and tDCS, may constitute promising approaches to aid the treatment of substance abuse and drug dependence (<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">Jansen et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p content-type="indent">
<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">Jansen et al (2013)</xref> recently conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the available evidence regarding the effects of noninvasive neurostimulation (Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation and tDCS) of the dlPFC on craving in substance dependence, including highly palatable food. They included 17 eligible studies and found a significant medium effect size favoring active noninvasive neurostimulation over sham stimulation for reduction of craving, with no differences between the techniques, between the various substances of abuse and between substances of abuse and food. They concluded that noninvasive neurostimulation of the dlPFC, irrespectively if magnetic or direct current stimulation, clearly decreases craving.</p><p content-type="indent">However, tDCS so far has been shown variable effects on drug craving. <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Fregni et al. (2008a)</xref> showed that in tobacco smokers, stimulation of both left and right dlPFC with anodal tDCS reduced craving after stimulation, but no effects have been found of anodal left or anodal right tDCS over the dlPFC on nicotine craving in more recent studies (<xref rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">Pripfl and Lamm, 2014</xref>). <xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">Shahbabaie et al. (2014)</xref> found a state-dependent effect of anodal tDCS over the right dlPFC on methamphetamine craving. Anodal tDCS of the left dlPFC slightly improved frontal function and increased the mean amplitude of P3 associated with alcohol-related sounds (<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">Nakamura-Palacios et al., 2012</xref>), but when applied repetitively, it tended to increase relapses to alcohol use in alcoholics although it significantly decreased craving to the use of alcohol (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">da Silva et al., 2013</xref>). Bilateral tDCS decreased craving in alcoholics irrespectively of the polarity (anodal left/cathodal right or cathodal left/anodal right) over the dlPFC (<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Boggio et al., 2008</xref>). Similar effects were obtained with repetitive stimulation of a comparable protocol but with the cathode over the left dlPFC and anode over the right dlPFC, reducing relapse probability to the use of alcohol over a 6-month follow-up (<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">Klauss et al., 2014</xref>). With cathodal left and anodal right dlPFC stimulation, <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">Fecteau et al. (2014)</xref> observed a decrease in the number of cigarettes smoked by tobacco smokers. In this scenario, we found that repetitive bilateral dlPFC tDCS (cathodal left/anodal right) decreased craving for crack-cocaine use.</p><p content-type="indent">There are few studies aimed to investigate the effects of tDCS on cocaine/crack-cocaine addiction. <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">Gorini et al. (2014)</xref> investigated the effects of modulation of left and right cortical excitability on 2 risk tasks. Cocaine users and healthy controls randomly received left anodal/right cathodal, right anodal/left cathodal, and sham (placebo) stimulation at least 48 hours apart. They observed that cocaine users and control subjects showed increased safe behavior after right dlPFC anodal stimulation, whereas risk-taking behavior increased after left dlPFC anodal stimulation in cocaine users only. They suggest that dependent cocaine users have functional abnormalities in the prefrontal neural networks involved in decision-making and risk-taking behavior. The excessive risk propensity in dependent cocaine users would be due to a hypoactivation of the right dlPFC and a dysbalanced interhemispheric interaction (<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">Gorini et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p content-type="indent">In the present study, we also used left cathodal/right anodal tDCS over dlPFC but applied it repetitively (5 applications every other day). Our results seem to agree with those reported above, which allow us to suggest that a better craving control induced by brain stimulation could result in less risk-taking behavior, or the other way around, the better control of risk-taking behavior would help to control craving. However, risk-taking and craving may also not be directly related but represent different dimensions converging to a more favorable cognitive control by tDCS-induced modulation of dlPFC function.</p><p content-type="indent">A careful assessment of quality of life was made in this study, especially because crack-cocaine addiction has tremendous harmful impacts on the individual&#x02019;s life, the families, and the community he/she lives in. In this study the individual&#x02019;s overall perception of quality of life and health improved in crack-cocaine users treated with tDCS after the end of the treatment. By contrast, those who were treated with sham-tDCS showed a change in the opposite direction, that is, towards decrement of quality of life. In addition, the self-esteem of crack-cocaine users from the real tDCS group improved in the psychological domain.</p><p content-type="indent">Less craving, less anxiety, and better quality of life are all favorable features to a better outcome of drug dependence treatment. Craving and quality of life have been recommended as a broader array of outcome measures in research on addiction treatment that go beyond the limited measures of drug use (<xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">Tiffany et al., 2012a</xref>). While craving is a highly salient construct, experienced by the addicted subject as aversive and disruptive to functioning, the addictive process often affects functioning beyond the immediate effects of drug use, including consequences in the domains of health, well-being, psychological functioning, relationships, productivity, and criminality (<xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">Tiffany et al., 2012a</xref>). Thus, addiction treatments would be more effective if they reduce the impact of negative consequences of drug use. The effects of repetitive bilateral direct current stimulation over the dlPFC seem to nicely fit to these criteria.</p><p content-type="indent">There are limitations of this study that need to be taken into account. The sample of crack-cocaine users was relatively small, thus limiting assumptions about the clinical relevance of our findings. Furthermore, patients were about 35 days abstinent of the drug at the beginning of the study, when Obsessive-Compulsive Cocaine Scale scores were possibly already reduced. The reason for this was that during the first month of their drug dependence treatment in the inpatient service, patients usually experience very strong craving and are physically and mentally very unstable. Therefore, they were given some time to stabilize their global status before recruitment to this study. However, this procedure was identical for both randomized groups.</p><p content-type="indent">In summary, repetitive bilateral tDCS over the dlPFC (left cathodal and right anodal) reduced craving to crack-cocaine use and anxiety symptoms and improved the overall perception of quality of life and health in crack-cocaine dependents. Further studies should explore further parameters and additional clinical outcomes such as relapses and long-term effects.</p></sec><sec><title>Statement of Interest</title><p>M.A.N. is member of the advisory board of Neuroelectrics.

The questions of this brief scale are answered on a scale ranging from 0 to 4, resulting in a total score between 0 and 20. The first item (1 of the original scale) asks how much of a person&#x02019;s time (total per day), when the drug is not used, is occupied by thoughts, ideas, desires, or impulses related to cocaine/crack and its effects, having the possible answers: (0) never; (1) &#x0003c;1h/d; (2) 1&#x02013;3h/d; (3) 4&#x02013;8h/d; and (4) &#x0003e;8h/d (or all day long). The second item (2 of the original scale) asks how frequently these thoughts, ideas, desires, or impulses related to cocaine/crack and its effects occur, having as answers: (0) never; (1) no more than 8 times per day; (2) &#x0003e;8 times per day, but most of the day of this person is free of these thoughts; (3) &#x0003e;8 times per day and most of the day the patient is occupied by these thoughts; and (4) these thought are so frequent that he/she cannot count them (almost no hour is free of these thoughts). The third item (4 of the original scale) asks how much distress or disturbance these ideas, thoughts, impulses or desire related to cocaine/crack use cause when the person is under withdrawal, having as answers: (0) no disturbance; (1) slight or infrequent disturbance; (2) moderate or frequent disturbance, but still manageable; (3) severe, very frequent disturbance; (4) extremely disturbing, almost constant or causing disabling distress. The fourth item (5 of the original scale) asks how much effort the person has to make to resist these thoughts, ideas, desires, or impulses, or how much energy he/she has to spend to think of something else when they enter the mind under withdrawal (what matters here is the effort required to resist to the thoughts and not the failure or success to control them), having as answers: (0) intensity is so weak that it requires no effort to resist them; (1) try to resist most of the time; (2) need to make a lot of effort to resist; (3) the effort would be so hard that they give in to these thoughts after a while; (4) They can absolutely not resist and they give in to all these thoughts without trying. Finally, the last item (13 from the original scale) asks about the person&#x02019;s drive to use cocaine/crack, having as answers: (0) they never feel compelled to use cocaine/crack; (1) some pressure to use cocaine/crack; (2) strong pressure to use cocaine/crack; (3) they feel a very important drive that compels them to use cocaine/crack; (4) they feel a very powerful drive to use cocaine/crack that they cannot resist (<xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">Vorspan et al., 2012</xref>). This scale was applied in the week before the beginning of the real or sham-tDCS treatment, during the treatment (first and second weeks) and in the week after the end of the treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s19"><title>Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D)</title><p>The severity of depression symptoms was analyzed via a multiple-choice questionnaire. This instrument assesses the severity of depression symptoms such as low mood, insomnia, agitation, anxiety, and weight loss (<xref rid="CIT0053" ref-type="bibr">Hamilton, 1960</xref>). The examiner must choose between the possible answers to each question by interviewing the patient and observing the patient&#x02019;s symptoms. Each question has between 3 and 5 possible answers that increase in severity. In the original scale, the first 17 questions contribute to the total score, while questions 18 to 21 provide additional information about depression (eg, diurnal variation, paranoid symptoms) but are not included in the total score of the scale. This scale was applied at the beginning and at the end of the treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s20"><title>Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A)</title><p>The severity of anxiety symptoms was analyzed via a structured multiple-choice questionnaire (<xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr">Hamilton, 1959</xref>). The scale consists of 14 items, each defined by a series of symptoms, and measures both psychic anxiety (eg, mental agitation and psychological distress) and somatic anxiety (eg, physical complaints related to anxiety). This scale was also applied at the beginning and at the end of the treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s21"><title>Quality of Life</title><p>An abbreviated instrument of cross-culturally valid assessment of quality of life of the World Health Organization (WHOQOL-BREF) with 26 questions (<xref rid="CIT0054" ref-type="bibr">Skevington et al., 2004</xref>) translated to Portuguese (<xref rid="CIT0051" ref-type="bibr">Fleck et al., 2000</xref>) was applied at the beginning and at the end of the treatment. This instrument yields 4 domains (physical health, psychological, social relationships, and environment) and 2 individually scored items regarding overall perception of quality of life (Q1, ie, first question) and health (Q2, ie, second question). The 4 domain scores are scaled in a way that higher scores stand for higher quality of life. These scores were transformed to be comparable with the scores used in the WHOQOL-100 (WHO, 1996).</p></sec></app></app-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="CIT0051"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
