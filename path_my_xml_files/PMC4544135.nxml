Despite day to day foods are fortified with vitamin D, many studies have shown an absolute deficiency of vitamin D in many people.</p><p>The prevalence of asthma increases globally by 50% every decade. The pathophysiology of asthma is complicated. Vitamin D deficiency leads to increased bronchial hyper-responsiveness and reduced pulmonary function.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Nearly 5&#x02013;15% of patients with asthma symptoms and exacerbation are uncontrolled despite of routine controller medications including corticosteroids. Therefore, they are more prone to have irreversible obstruction of airflow and also associated with airway remodeling.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] If vitamin D plays either preventive or protective role against the development of asthma, then it could be the most effective therapy.</p><p>Very few studies have considered this point and evaluated the relationship between vitamin D<sub>3</sub> and pulmonary function[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and there is no clinical study report from Indian adult population to explore the role of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> in asthma. Thus, the present study was undertaken to study whether or not vitamin D<sub>3</sub> can improve pulmonary function and health-related quality of life in severe persistent asthma patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study design</title><p>The study was approved by the Institutional Ethical Committee and it was conducted in the Department of Pulmonary Medicine, SRM Medical College hospital and research center, Kattankulathur, Tamil Nadu, India. The study was designed as a prospective, randomized, double blinded and parallel group study. A randomization list was generated using random allocation software and concealment of the randomization codes was done by serially numbered, opaque envelope model. Randomization and allocation details were known only to a third party.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Study criteria</title><p>The study participants were 18 to 60 years of age, both sexes, were clinically diagnosed as having severe persistent asthma, had improvement in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) &#x0003e;12% after bronchodilator inhalation and had given their written informed consent. Exclusion criteria included clinically significant renal, respiratory (other than asthma), cardiac, gastrointestinal, hepatic, endocrine, or hematologic disorders, cancer, unresolved upper respiratory tract infection within the past 3 weeks, suspected hypersensitivity to study therapy or excipients, pregnant or lactating mother.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Study protocol</title><p>Patients satisfying above-mentioned study criteria were enrolled in the study. Enrolled patients were randomized by randomization chart generated by computer-assisted random allocation procedure. Patients were divided into two groups, namely usual care (<italic>n</italic> = 69) and intervention care (<italic>n</italic> = 72) groups. Clinical information relevant for the study was collected from the patients, healthcare professionals, necessary records and as well as from patient's bystanders in few cases. Antiasthmatic drugs prescribed till date were stopped and the patients were asked to take salbutamol inhaler (i.e., rescue medication) whenever necessary for 7 days (run-in period) prior to the study. Patients were educated and counseled about the proper usage of inhalers. The usual care group patients received budesonide (800 &#x003bc;g) with formoterol (24 &#x003bc;g) daily. This is the fixed dose combination (FDC). The intervention care group patients received the same FDC plus vitamin D<sub>3</sub> tablet (1000 IU; once daily). All patients could take short-acting &#x003b2;-agonist in case of an asthmatic crisis. Commercially available brands of the study medications were used throughout the study period.</p><p>Spirometry was performed before the morning dose of trial medication at each visit and at least three spirometry maneuvers were performed, and the largest FEV<sub>1</sub> was recorded. Standard spirometer (Mini Wright flow meter, Clement Clarke International, London) was used in the study. The spirometry was performed by well-trained pulmonary technicians. The patients were assessed individually for the appropriate use of inhaler during baseline and at every follow up. The steps which the patients found difficult were identified for each patient and were educated and trained accordingly.</p><p>Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was assessed by Saint George Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). SGRQ is a disease-specific instrument designed to measure impact on overall health, daily life and perceived well-being. SGRQ was scored according to the developer's guidelines.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Patient's compliance with the study medication was assessed with the help of medication compliance charts. Patients not obeying the study protocol were withdrawn from the study. All the patient's clinical symptoms, pulmonary function (% FEV<sub>1</sub> by spirometer) and health-related quality of life (SGRQ scores) were measured at the baseline and every follow up days, i.e. day 30, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180. At each and every follow up, patient medication adherence and their inhaler usage technique were monitored.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Sample size</title><p>Considering &#x003b1; error at 0.05% and 80% power (1 &#x02013; &#x003b2; = 0.8) of study with an approximate 8.5% difference between two groups[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] for a significant increase in % FEV<sub>1</sub> with the standard deviation of 0.05 using 1:1 ratio of independent sample <italic>t</italic>-test, 66 patients must complete the study in each group. Considering 20% dropout, 79 patients should be included in each group.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data are expressed as mean &#x000b1; SD. The probability value less than 0.05 was considered for statistical significance. Demographic characteristics like age and gender, baseline and final visit data were used to assess response rates by comparing usual care and intervention groups. Student's <italic>t</italic> test was used for comparison within the groups. One- way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni multiple comparison test was used for comparison between groups using GraphPad Software, Inc. (USA).

Although there is recent evidence of a modest further increase in asthma rates in countries with high disease prevalence, the causes of the &#x0201c;asthma epidemic&#x0201d; are incompletely understood.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Various International and National guidelines have recommended inhaled corticosteroid as the first-line controller therapy for persistent asthma patients; however, not all the patients respond to inhaled corticosteroid and clinical studies demonstrated that up to 45% of patients do not have a clinical or physiological response to this agent. The component of this variability may be explained by vitamin D status, with studies suggesting that vitamin D may enhance the effects of inhaled corticosteroids.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>It has been hypothesized that vitamin D deficiency, as a result of westernized lifestyles that have led to sun avoidance behaviors and more time indoors, has a role in the development and treatment of asthma and allergies.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Studies carried out in animal model reported that vitamin D<sub>3</sub> pre-treated groups enhanced the efficacy of allergen immunotherapy in a mouse allergic asthma model.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Bergman <italic>et al.</italic> studied the effect of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplementation to reduce the disease burden in patients with frequent respiratory tract infection.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Black and Seragg revealed a strong relationship between serum concentration of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> and pulmonary function parameters like FEV<sub>1</sub> and FVC.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>A possible relationship between asthma and polymorphisms in other genes involved in vitamin D synthesis, bioavailability and metabolism has been proposed. Higher prevalence, hospitalization and emergency visits along with decreased the pulmonary function and increased bronchial hyper-responsiveness has been demonstrated with low serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D in asthmatic pediatric patients.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>Iqbal and co-workers analyzed the various factors and the role of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> in asthma.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] They concluded that vitamin D<sub>3</sub> acts on lung tissue and to improve immune function and reduce the inflammation. However, they did not give any ample evidence that vitamin D<sub>3</sub> has the potential to improve pulmonary function.</p><p>Studies carried out in pediatric population also not reported any definitive proof of improved clinical symptoms of asthma with the adjunctive therapy of vitamin D<sub>3</sub>.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Recently, Gergen <italic>et al.</italic> studied the relationship between serum vitamin D<sub>3</sub> concentration and prevalence of asthma with severity and response of asthma treatment.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] The study concluded that overall vitamin D<sub>3</sub> concentrations were low in two samples of adolescents and they were not reliably linked with the presence of asthma or asthma morbidity.</p><p>From the above-mentioned contradictory statement, we could not come to a conclusion whether the vitamin D<sub>3</sub> has a role on asthma condition or not. Thus, the present study was undertaken. The finding of this study suggests that the addition of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> to the regular treatment regimen had no improvement in the pulmonary function. However, statistical as well as clinical improvement is seen with respect to health-related quality of life. This is in accordance with the study carried out by Castro <italic>et al.</italic> No significant reduction in the rate of first treatment failure or exacerbation was noticed in their study. There was also no significant reduction in the secondary endpoints related to asthma control, airway function or airway inflammation.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>If the dietary intake of vitamin D fails to meet the recommended daily allowance, health care professionals may encourage the asthma people to increase their intake of vitamin D, preferably through the consumption of healthy food sources rich in vitamin D or otherwise through the use of appropriate vitamin supplements. 25-hydroxy vitamin D<sub>3</sub> is the best biomarker of vitamin D metabolic status and reflects contributions from all sources (diet and sun exposure). Further studies may be carried out by serum estimation of serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D<sub>3</sub> to substantiate the current findings.</p><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-7"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Banerjee</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Damera</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Bhandare</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Gu</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Lopez-Boado</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Panettieri</surname><given-names>R</given-names><suffix>Jr</suffix></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Vitamin D and glucocorticoids differentially modulate chemokine expression in human airway smooth muscle cells</article-title><source>Br J Pharmacol</source><year>2008</year><volume>155</volume><fpage>84</fpage><lpage>92</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">18552877</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Viswanathan</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Prasad</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Thakur</surname><given-names>AK</given-names></name><name><surname>Sinha</surname><given-names>SP</given-names></name><name><surname>Prakash</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Mody</surname><given-names>RK</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Epidemiology of asthma in an urban population.
