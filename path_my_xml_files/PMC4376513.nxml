While the plasma ascorbic acid level is decreased in MDD, the serum levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and serum malondialdehyde (MDA) as two markers of oxidation are increased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Ascorbic acid prevents stress-induced cerebrocortical and hippocampal lipid peroxidation and SOD activity in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In addition, ascorbic acid inhibits the increment of the two oxidative stress markers of glutathione reductase and glutathione peroxidase activities in a preclinical model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. However, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study failed to show the expected beneficial effects of vitamin C on oxidative stress in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Clinical studies do not support that vitamin C changes the markers of oxidation in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>The water-soluble vitamin C or ascorbic acid is one of the most important antioxidants in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Vitamin C is a part of the intracellular antioxidant system with neuroprotective effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>Antidepressants are capable of reversing the changes in oxidative stress parameters in MDD patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. A clinical trial demonstrated that the peripheral activity of the antioxidant enzyme SOD and the levels of the oxidative marker MDA were higher in MDD patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. These changes were accompanied by a reduction in the levels of ascorbic acid and reverted after treatment with fluoxetine and citalopram, further reinforcing the role of ascorbic acid in MDD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In addition, ascorbic acid had an effect similar to fluoxetine in an animal model of depression, reverting not only the behavioral profile induced by stress but also the oxidative damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>There are some promising reports about the beneficial effect of vitamin C in animal models of depression. &#x02018;Nevertheless, supplementary vitamins C did not decrease depression in type 2 diabetic patients in a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled trial&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>Ascorbic acid has antidepressant-like effects in animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In addition, vitamin C potentiated the antidepressant effects of antidepressants in animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Ascorbic acid produces an antidepressant-like effect by interaction with the monoaminergic system in animal models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In addition, antagonists of glutamatergic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors rapidly decrease depressive symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Additionally, vitamin C has some anti-NMDA effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>The results of the effects of vitamin C on depression in healthy individuals and patients with some medical conditions are contradictory. A randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled 14-day trial of sustained-release ascorbic acid including 42 healthy young adults showed that vitamin C (3,000&#x000a0;mg/day) increased mood measured by the Beck Depression Scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Vitamin C also decreased psychological subjective stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial including depressed shift workers, vitamin C (500&#x000a0;mg/day) significantly decreased depression severity. The 21-item Beck Depression Rating Scale score decreased from 14.133&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;4.37 to 3.233&#x02009;&#x000b1; 7.08 (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.018) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Nevertheless, supplementary vitamin C (1,000&#x000a0;mg/day) did not decrease the depression score in type 2 diabetic patients in a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>Non-controlled and limited evidence from clinical studies supports the efficacy of vitamin C for treating depressive disorder. For example, vitamin C relieved adrenocorticotropic hormone-induced depressive symptoms in a patient during a 14-day period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The levels of vitamins A, C, and E in patients with depression are lower than that of the healthy controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Adding the combination of 600&#x000a0;mg/day of vitamin A, 1,000&#x000a0;mg/day of vitamin C, and 800&#x000a0;mg/day of vitamin E to escitalopram (10 to 20&#x000a0;mg/day) improved depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Nevertheless, another study reported that depression is not associated with vitamin C level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The only published clinical trial that examined the efficacy of vitamin C as an adjuvant agent for treating MDD included pediatric patients. There were 12 patients in the fluoxetine (10 to 20&#x000a0;mg/day) plus vitamin C (1,000&#x000a0;mg/day) group. The control group included 12 patients administered fluoxetine (10 to 20&#x000a0;mg/day) plus placebo. Depression score decreased in the treatment group more than that of the control group during 3&#x000a0;months as measured by the Children&#x02019;s Depression Rating Scale (CDRS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. However, the scale of Clinical Global Impression (CGI) did not show the efficacy of vitamin C for treating patients with MDD in the same trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Furthermore, suicidal behavior is common in patients with MDD and oxidative stress and lower total antioxidant levels are associated with a history of suicidal attempts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>Considering the preliminary reports from animal studies, a case report about the efficacy of vitamin C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], the contradictory results of one clinical trial on adolescents with depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], and the role of oxidative stress in MDD and suicidal behavior, well-controlled trials are needed to examine whether the effect of vitamin C as an adjuvant medication improves MDD in adults. To the best of the authors&#x02019; knowledge, this matter has never been examined in adult patients with MDD. Therefore, we conducted a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial to examine the efficacy and safety of vitamin C for treating MDD and suicidal behavior. We hypothesized that vitamin C would augment the antidepressant effects of citalopram in treating adult patients with MDD.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The study was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (1964). This trial was approved by the Ethics Committee of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences (number: CT-P-92-6070). The participants were provided with information about the trial procedure, risks, and benefits. Then, the participants provided their written informed consent. This trial is registered in the IRCT (IRCT201312263930N31). This trial was performed at the Department of Psychiatry at Shiraz University of Medical Sciences from September 2013 to March 2014.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participants</title><p>This is a randomized controlled clinical trial investigating the effectiveness of vitamin C in addition to citalopram for treating MDD. Participants were 60 adult outpatients who met the <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition</italic> (DSM-IV) criteria for MDD. Diagnosis was made through a clinical interview by a board-certified psychiatrist. There were two groups. One group received citalopram (up to 60&#x000a0;mg/day) plus vitamin C (up to 1,000&#x000a0;mg/day). The other group received citalopram plus placebo. Citalopram was started with 10&#x000a0;mg/day and increased to 20&#x000a0;mg/day over 7&#x000a0;days. The dosage could be adjusted according to adverse effects. No other antidepressant medication or psychotherapy was administered during this trial. The patients and/or caregivers were asked whether they took the medications in order to check the patients&#x02019; medication compliance. Tablets of vitamin C and placebo were identical. Placebo tablets were made by the Faculty of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences. The patients, the rater, and the clinician who referred the patients were blind to the group allocation.</p><p>The inclusion criteria were: a score of 16 or higher on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS); no psychotropic medication for at least 4&#x000a0;weeks; untreated patients; both genders; and aged more than 18&#x000a0;years and no more than 65&#x000a0;years old.</p><p>The exclusion criteria were: 1) significant co-morbid psychiatric illness, hypothyroidism or severe medical conditions such as epilepsy; 2) psychotic features or bipolar mood disorder or any other psychiatric disorder; current substance abuse except cigarette smoking; suicidal attempt; oral contraception use; pregnancy; breast-feeding; intention to become pregnant during this trial; a history of allergic reactions to vitamin C or citalopram; and receiving psychotropic medication. Suicidal ideation was not an exclusion criterion.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Outcomes</title><p>The patients were assessed 4 times including at baseline, week 2, week 4, and week 8. The HDRS-21 was the primary outcome measure to assess depression severity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The item 3 was scored to measure suicidal behavior. Mean difference of HDRS was compared between the two groups. Reduction of more than 49% in score from baseline to week 8 was defined as response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The 2 groups were compared regarding complete response (# 50%), partial response (# 25% decline in HDRS score), and the rate of adverse effects. The rate of full remission (HDRS less than 8) was compared between the 2 groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].

The rates of partial response, complete response, and remission were not different between the two groups. Vitamin C as much as placebo decreased depression symptoms. These findings are not in line with the results reported from animal studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Nevertheless, this is the first randomized controlled clinical trial examining the effectiveness and safety of vitamin C for treating adult patients with MDD. It should be noted that there is a difference between animal studies and major depression in humans. The animal studies measured depression induced by stress. It is clear that the stress-induced response is not equal to MDD.</p><p>The only trial conducted in humans reported contradictory results about the effectiveness of vitamin C for treating depression symptoms in adolescents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. That trial reported that vitamin C did not decrease depression symptoms measured by the CGI scale. However, the depression symptoms were measured by the CDRS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In addition, the other trial which showed the efficacy of vitamin C had been conducted on healthy individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] rather than patients with MDD.</p><p>Considering that oxidative stress is associated with depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], it was expected that vitamin C would decrease depression symptoms and suicidal behavior. Individuals with depression markedly intake dietary antioxidants less than those without depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Vitamin C has a protective role for oxidative status in stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In addition, some anti-inflammatory agents such as celecoxib effectively decrease inflammatory markers and depression symptoms in patients with MDD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Nevertheless, our results failed to support this assumption. This is in line with a study that vitamin C level was not associated with depression symptoms in community-based adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Another explanation is that although MDD is associated with oxidative stress the effect of antidepressants is independent of oxidative and antioxidative stress systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p>The ceiling effect may be another explanation for the negative results of this trial. It means that citalopram has masked the potential benefit of vitamin C. The animal studies did not concurrently administered citalopram. To eliminate the ceiling effect, a monotherapy trial of vitamin C compared to placebo is needed.</p><p>Suicidal behavior and serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitor-related emergent suicidal ideation and behavior are a matter of clinician&#x02019;s concern in treating patients with MDD. However, efficacy results for this trial showed that vitamin C was not statistically different from placebo for treating patients&#x02019; suicidal ideation and behavior. Regarding the adverse effects, the rates of adverse effects were not different between the two groups.</p><p>While no double-blind randomized controlled clinical trial has ever examined the effect of vitamin C for treating depression symptoms in adults patients with MDD, the small sample size, short duration, and fixed dose of vitamin C were among the limitations of this trial. The current trial included patients without psychosis. It is not clear whether vitamin C is effective for treating patients with severe forms of MDD or those with psychotic features. Although some studies have reported that the level of vitamin C is not associated with depression symptoms, the current trial did not control the dietary intake of vitamin C. Moreover, it is possible that the dose of vitamin C was insufficient. Although none of the patients in the current trial were psychotic and the severity of depression at baseline was not different between the two groups, future studies should consider duration and age of onset of depression as possible co-variate factors. Finally, 25 out of 68 patients declined to participate in this trial; they may be a source of potential bias.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Treating MDD with vitamin C adds nothing to the short-term efficacy of citalopram. This combination is not effective regarding suicidal behavior.
