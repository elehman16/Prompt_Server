In the winter term 2009/10, the Institute of Anatomy and Cell Biology at the University of Ulm implemented an elective called  &#x0201c;Ready for the OR&#x0201d; for 2nd year medical students participating in the dissection course. We attempted to improve learning motivation and examination results by transferring anatomical knowledge into a surgical setting and teaching basic surgical skills in preparation of the students&#x02019; first participation in the OR.  Out of 69 online applicants, 50 students were randomly assigned to the Intervention Group (FOP) or the Control Group. In 5 teaching session students learned skills like scrubbing, stitching or the identification of frequently used surgical instruments. Furthermore, students visited five surgical interventions which were demonstrated by surgical colleagues on donated bodies that have been embalmed using the Thiel technique.  The teaching sessions took place in the institute&#x02019;s newly built &#x0201c;Theatrum Anatomicum&#x0201d; for an ideal simulation of a surgical setting.  The learning outcomes were verified by OSPE. In a pilot study, an intervention group and a control group were compared concerning their examination results in the dissection course and their learning motivation through standardized SELLMO-test for students. Participants gained OSPE results between 60.5 and 92% of the maximum score. &#x0201c;Ready for the OR&#x0201d; was successfully implemented and judged an excellent add-on to anatomy teaching by the participants. However, we could not prove a significant difference in learning motivation or examination results. Future studies should focus on the learning orientation, the course&#x02019;s long-term learning effects and the participants&#x02019; behavior in a real surgery setting.</p></abstract><trans-abstract xml:lang="de"><p>Medizinstudierende machen ihre  ersten Erfahrungen im Operationssaal h&#x000e4;ufig in Famulaturen und damit zeitlich und inhaltlich losgel&#x000f6;st vom Curriculum der Humanmedizin. Im WS 2009/10 implementierte  das Institut f&#x000fc;r Anatomie und Zellbiologie an der Universit&#x000e4;t Ulm die fakultative Lehrveranstaltung &#x0201e;Fit f&#x000fc;r den OP (FOP)&#x0201c; f&#x000fc;r Studierende im vorklinischen Studienabschnitt, die zeitgleich am makroskopisch anatomischen Kurs teilnahmen. Durch den Transfer anatomischen Wissens in den chirurgischen Kontext und durch das Lehren chirurgischer Basisfertigkeiten, die auf den ersten Einsatz im OP vorbereiten, versuchten wir Lernmotivation und Pr&#x000fc;fungsergebnisse zu verbessern.  Von 69 Online-Bewerbern wurden 50 Studierende im Rahmen einer Pilotstudie zuf&#x000e4;llig der Fallgruppe (FOP-Gruppe) oder der Kontrollgruppe zugeteilt. In Rahmen von 5 Terminen erlernten die Studierenden die chirurgische H&#x000e4;ndedesinfektion, Nahttechniken und die Identifikation h&#x000e4;ufig verwendeter chirurgischer Instrumente.  Weiterhin nahmen die Studierenden an f&#x000fc;nf Operationen teil, die von chirurgischen Kollegen an Thiel fixierten K&#x000f6;rperspendern demonstriert wurden. Der Unterricht fand im institutseigenen Theatrum Anatomicum statt, um dort eine optimale Simulation des Operationssettings zu gew&#x000e4;hrleisten. Das Erreichen der Lernziele wurde durch einen OSPE &#x000fc;berpr&#x000fc;ft. Im Rahmen einer Pilotstudie wurden Fall- und Kontrollgruppe bez&#x000fc;glich ihrer Pr&#x000fc;fungsergebnisse im Pr&#x000e4;parierkurs und der Lernmotivation mit dem SELLMO-Test f&#x000fc;r Studierende verglichen. FOP-Teilnehmer erzielten im OSPE zwischen 60,5 und 92% der maximalen Punktzahl. &#x0201e;FOP&#x0201c; konnte erfolgreich implementiert werden und wurde als exzellente Zusatzveranstaltung von den Teilnehmern evaluiert. Ein signifikanter Unterschied in der Lernmotivation oder den Pr&#x000fc;fungsergebnissen konnte nicht nachgewiesen werden. Zuk&#x000fc;nftige Studien sollten die Lernorientierung, sowie langfristige Effekte der Veranstaltung und das tats&#x000e4;chlicher Verhalten der Teilnehmer  bei realen Operationen genauer untersuchen. </p></trans-abstract><kwd-group><kwd>anatomy</kwd><kwd>teaching</kwd><kwd>basic surgical skills</kwd><kwd>motivation</kwd><kwd>examination results</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The historic Theatrum Anatomicum was resurrected at the University of Ulm as a modern teaching tool for the 21st century. Today&#x02019;s Theatrum Anatomicum with its high-quality technical equipment allows up to 200 people to experience and observe preparation and surgical procedures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. The Theatrum has become a meeting place, in particular for students in the preclinical stage of study and their clinical colleagues. Clinicians of different surgical disciplines serve as role models for allowing medical students to understand medicine and to get an introduction to their respective areas of study. </p><p>We have shown in the past that activities in the macroscopy course - especially dissection - impart medical professional skills such as teamwork [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. The body donor can be viewed as the first patient of the future doctors early on in their studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. This is a concept we have continued in the Theatrum Anatomicum by using the body donors in a simulated surgical setting for surgical intervention. The bodies have been embalmed using the Thiel technique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>] which ensures realistic preservation of the consistency and color of body tissues. The theatre thus offers possibilities for professionalization both for medical under and post-graduates. In parallel to the macroscopic anatomy course during the second year of training, behaviors and skill sets can be taught which are often underrepresented in the medical core curriculum. But these behaviors are often already expected in the first student clerkship, even though they are usually left to acquire these through random, non-standard process of learning by doing. For example, a needs analysis amongst students in the 7th semester in Ulm showed that up to 69.1% of respondents felt rather uncertain during their first visit to the OR. 17.1% of respondents had not yet learned how to carry out surgical hand disinfection. Only 35.8% of students at the time of their first OR assistance felt secure regarding compliance with the measures necessary to ensure sterility and 22.5% of them did not feel secure or probably even made themselves non-sterile (own unpublished data). This data is consistent with the data published by Hamdorf and Hall [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>] and highlights the need for teaching basic surgical skills in a structured way before the first clerkship.</p><p>Anatomical and surgical teaching forms a synergistic interaction in the training of students and assistants and a good balance ultimately is in the best interests of patients. And in the worst case, a bad balance could lead to clinical malpractice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. In this process, dissection is a teaching method which imparts manual skills, anatomical variability and the anatomical vocabulary needed for clinical work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. Both disciplines could benefit a lot more from each other though as the option to acquire practical skills is particularly attractive for students in their pre-clinical studies and therefore a promising motivator in the struggle to make students study even more. By bridging this gap, they gain deeper anatomical understanding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>] and their motivation for learning pre-clinical content increased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. The surgeon in a way is the &#x0201c;icing on the cake&#x0201d; and brings the anatomical content to life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. In addition, students see medical skills such as teamwork in action in the surgical theatre. Not only students, but also surgical assistants have the opportunity to practice surgical techniques under ideal simulated conditions in anatomy, without time pressure and without bleeding and to experience and to understand possible errors in the dissection room rather than the operating theatre [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. To meet the wishes of doctors in surgical professional development for improved training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>], surgical professional development in Switzerland is already being supported through exercises using bodies that have been embalmed using the Thiel technique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>], with benefits which are perceived as very high [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>] and judged more effective in comparison to video presentations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. Students have the opportunity to learn surgical skills in the pre-clinical phase of their studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. But so far there are only a few offers which are coordinated by surgeons and anatomists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. Naylor and al. describe a current project which is integrated into the curriculum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>].  </p><p>The effectiveness of simulation-based medical education is indisputable today, especially if it meets best practice requirements in planning and implementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]. Today it is virtually considered standard for a faculty to have a skills lab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]. But the combination of anatomical education - in particular the use of bodies that have been embalmed using the Thiel technique - and simulation-based surgery with teaching of basic surgical skills is innovative and not integrated enough into the degree courses. The Institute of Anatomy and Cell Biology at the University of Ulm therefore for the first time developed and implemented an elective for 25 students of the third pre-clinical semester in the winter semester 2009/10, who were simultaneously participating in the macroscopic anatomy course. The aim was to transfer anatomical teaching to a clinically relevant surgical operational context to increase the motivation to learn and ideally to improve in the anatomical knowledge and test results through optimized learning strategies. In this article we would like to present the project &#x0201c;Ready for the OR&#x0201d; (FOP), the results of the acceptance evaluation, and to investigate the following questions as part of a pilot study and in comparison with a control group:</p><p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Does participation in the FOP course have an effect on student motivation compared to students of a control group who attended only the macroscopic anatomy course?</p></list-item><list-item><p>Does participation in the FOP course have a positive effect on the exam results achieved in the macroscopic anatomical course compared to students in the control group?</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p><italic>Project Presentation: </italic>"Ready for the OR" (FOP) is a bridge between pre-clinical and clinical surgical disciplines. Students are actively involved in the management of surgical demonstrations (OR demos). In preparation for surgery basic skills are taught with three to four learning goals defined for each, which are practiced during the teaching events and examined at the end of the course in an OSPE (Objectively Structured Practical Examination). The lessons took place in small groups (n=5) under the supervision of a student assistant each. During the OR demos, one group had the opportunity to assist the surgeon and even perform individual steps of the operation. The event included a total of 28 teaching units. The content of FOP is closely aligned with the course on macroscopic anatomy. This is divided into five units on the body sections of lower extremity/back, upper extremity/ventral body wall, situs, head/neck and central nervous system which are examined both orally and in writing. For each section, an OR demo which matched in content was offered. In preparation for working in the operating theatre, the students should be able to carry out surgical hand disinfection, sterile dressing, perform simple suturing and knotting techniques at the end of the course. Likewise they should be able to name common surgical instruments or be aware or able to prepare a patient for surgical intervention.</p><p>The project was staffed by anatomical staff, 5 student assistants with prior medical training and had the support of clinical colleagues in the accident, neurological, vascular/thorax and maxillo-facial surgery and anesthesiology (see Table 1 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="T1">(Tab. 1)</xref>). From a group of 69 online applicants, 50 individuals (m=23/f=27) were randomly assigned to the FOP group (m=11/f=14) or the control group (m=12/f=13) and their written consent was obtained for participation in the study. The event was held in the Theatrum Anatomicum, which also has a master's workstation, and the adjacent surgeon&#x02019;s prep room. The usual formalin-fixed bodies were not used for surgery, but donor bodies that have been embalmed using the Thiel technique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. This fixing process primarily uses boron and sodium sulfate salts, which preserve the tissue in its natural color and texture. Donor bodies, surgery equipment and sterile covering of the operation area produced a realistic surgical scenario (see Figure 1 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">(Fig. 1)</xref>). A script was produced to accompany the event. Each course date contained a chapter with historical background information, data and information on the surgery equipment was explained, presented and supplemented by handouts on the surgical step of the surgery demo. To check the acquired learned at the end of the semester, an OSPE was conducted consisting of 6 stations with 12 tasks. The evaluation was conducted by tutors using checklists. Through regular course participation and successful completion of the OSPE with at least 60% of the possible score, the participants received a certificate of participation.</p><p>The following instruments were used to evaluate the classes: </p><p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>The acceptance evaluation was paper-based, using the <italic>evaluation system (EvaSys)</italic> by Electric Papers at the end of the course and conducted by the Studies&#x02019; Office and electronically evaluated.

SELLMO is a standardized reliable questionnaire test for detecting the learning and achievement motivation among students on four different scales [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]: &#x0201c;Learning objectives&#x0201d; scale (Cronbach's &#x003b1;=0.75), the &#x0201c;approach performance objectives&#x0201d; scale (&#x003b1;=0.82), the &#x0201c;avoidance performance objectives&#x0201d; scale (&#x003b1;=0.90) and the &#x0201c;work avoidance&#x0201d; scale (&#x003b1;=0.87). In total, SELLMO contains 31 Items. The &#x0201c;learning objectives&#x0201d; scale describes the goal of wanting to expand one&#x02019;s own abilities. The &#x0201c;approach performance objectives&#x0201d; scale describes the goal of wanting to demonstrate one&#x02019;s skills in front of others, a property associated with somewhat short-term learning success, but without ensuring adequate long-term learning success. The &#x0201c;avoidance performance objectives&#x0201d; scale describes the tendency to try to hide low skills or inability/ignorance due to previous negative experiences. A property associated with poor short and long-term benefits. The "work avoidance&#x0201d; behavior is not learning or performance motivated, i.e. the motivation to invest as little effort. This attitude has a particularly negative effect on interest and intrinsic motivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>].</p></list-item></list></p><p>Statistical analysis was performed following manual data entry using a licensed version of SPSS 17.0 by SPSS Incorporation. Results are described through mean and standard deviation (SD). Significance was tested (p &#x0003c;0.05*, p&#x0003c;0.01**, p&#x0003c;0.001***) using the Mann-Whitney U-test for independent samples and not normally distributed data. The t-test was used if the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test demonstrated a normal data distribution. Correlation data was collected using the Pearson or Spearman test based on the distribution and scale of the data. The questionnaires used are included Appendices 1  and 2  <sup>1, 2</sup>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The event was successfully implemented using manageable resources and one donated body. The participants on average were 21.3 years old. Except for 3, all participants were aiming for a career in surgery, of which 32% cited trauma surgery. All questionnaires were returned completed. 23 (92%) out of 25 students completed the FOP successfully.</p><sec><title>EvySys evaluation data (6-point scale)</title><p>In the overall assessment, the participants awarded an average point score of 5.4&#x000b1;0.7 out of a possible 6 points. Particularly high points were awarded to the fact the event promotes interest in the subject area (5.4&#x000b1;0.6) and high relevance to practical issues (5.9&#x000b1;0.3). In this the participants rated the fact that the tutor dealt with questions in depth as particularly positive (5.7&#x000b1;0.6). The opportunity to actively participate was awarded a score of 4.8&#x000b1;1.0. According to the students, the event encouraged them to think for themselves (5.0&#x000b1;0.8) and the participants had sufficient prior knowledge (5.4&#x000b1;0.7) to follow the content well. The following free response suitably rounds off the response picture: &#x0201c;[...] and of course, you truly understand why you study all that anatomy in general.&#x0201d;</p></sec><sec><title>Internal questionnaire (6-point scale)</title><p>The result of the open questions made it clear that the students judged the number and duration of individual events to be balanced. While the size of the small groups (n=5) only received a satisfactory verdict (2.96&#x000b1;0.71), tutoring was perceived as very good (4.19&#x000b1;0.73). Participants assessed the topical connection to the dissection course as particularly successful (4.39&#x000b1;0.5) and the opportunity to develop a better understanding of anatomy through clinical examples (4.26&#x000b1;0.69). Unexpectedly, the participants deemed the timing of courses in the 3rd pre-clinical semester of undergraduate studies as being somewhat too late (2.35&#x000b1;0.57). The evaluation of classes for teaching basic surgical skills showed consistently that the theoretical content and the instructions for applying these skills were adequately and well explained, but that there often was too little time for independent practice.</p></sec><sec><title>OSPE results </title><p>Out of a maximum of 100 points, 23 of 25 achieved pass grades, with two participants scoring more than 90 points (grade: &#x0201c;very good&#x0201d;), 6 a &#x0201c;good&#x0201d; score, 12 a &#x0201c;satisfactory&#x0201d; score and 3 a &#x0201c;sufficient&#x0201d; score. On average, the achievement was 77.7&#x000b1;7.82 points. Taking into account the overall low level of participants and station numbers, the OSPE achieved a reliability of a=0.57 (see Figure 2 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">(Fig. 2)</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Exam results of the dissection course: </title><p>The control group and the FOP group showed equally good exam results of the macroscopic anatomy course. Both the overall score (2.43&#x000b1;1.01 against 2.46&#x000b1;1.02) and the individual results of the oral and written exams regarding the various body segments, no significant differences were noted between the FOP participants and the control group.</p></sec><sec><title>SELLMO learning and performance scales: </title><p>The internal consistency of the calculated scales in the case and control groups were mostly consistent with the data in the literature (see above), with the following results for the case and control group: learning objectives scale &#x003b1;=0.75 and 0.68; approach performance objectives &#x003b1;=0.83 and 0.77; avoidance performance objectives &#x003b1;=0.87 and 0.84; work avoidance &#x003b1;=0.79 and 0.83. The item parameters of the combined groups (FOP plus control group) were significantly to highly significantly above the item mean values of the test group described by Spinath et al. (n=265; 161 women and 103 men, mean age 22.6 years) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>], both in the &#x0201c;learning objectives&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;approach performance objectives&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;avoidance performance objectives&#x0201d; scales and the individual items of these scales. Only the &#x0201c;work avoidance&#x0201d; scale showed no differences (see Figure 3 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">(Fig. 3)</xref>).</p><p>The control group and the FOP group showed no significant differences in the learning objectives, performance avoidance objectives and work avoidance scales. There was a trend towards the FOP group on average showing slightly higher sum values for the approach performance objectives scale (24.4&#x000b1;4.35 against 22.32&#x000b1;3.92), but these did not reach a significant level (p&#x0003c;0.082) (see Figure 3 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">(Fig. 3)</xref>). Accordingly, a significant difference between the two groups could only be seen in three items in the analysis of individual items using the Mann-Whitney U-test: The item &#x0201c;It&#x02019;s important to me that others think I&#x02019;m smart.&#x0201d; (from the approach performance objectives scale) was valued more highly by the FOP participants than the control group (2.92&#x000b1;1.12 against 2.2&#x000b1;1.2*). Similar results were seen with the items &#x0201c;It&#x02019;s important to me that the others notice if I do well in tests and exams&#x0201d; (2.92&#x000b1;0.95 against 2.4&#x000b1;0.91*) and &#x0201c;It&#x02019;s important to me not to show if one task is more difficult for me than another.&#x0201d; (2.76&#x000b1;0.83 against 2.24&#x000b1;0.72*) (from the prevention performance objective scale).</p><p>The results of the Pearson correlation analysis between </p><p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>the value of the total score and the OSPE points received, </p></list-item><list-item><p>the mean sum scales of SELLMO-ST and the points scored for the OSPE, and </p></list-item><list-item><p>the mean sum scales of SELLMO-ST and the final grade </p></list-item></list></p><p>in the dissection course showed no significant correlations. </p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>FOP has managed to prepare pre-clinical students for their clinical surgical activities in a practice-oriented way which has received excellent evaluations (Grade: 5.4 out of 6.0). Students stated that they were able to transfer anatomical knowledge to the clinical context, to be motivated and to understand the clinical relevance of what they learned. To optimize the course sequence, in the future more time should be made available for practicing the practical skills. Interestingly, the students believe that the contents of FOP were offered to them almost too late in their course of study. The consistently good OSPE results show that the students at the pre-clinical stage of their studies are able to understand, learn and apply clinical teaching content and skills presented to them. However, the reliability of the OSPE in this case should be improved through more testing stations, a review and an examiner training.</p><p>The question underlying this pilot, whether the event objectively leads to an increase in motivation, must at this point be answered negatively due to the SELLMO test results. However, this clearly contradicts the subjective perception of the students. Kozianka and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>] also describe an increase of subjective learning motivation and could not objectify these observations. They were also unable to document improved test results. Our study group overall showed significantly higher scale values than the SELLMO-ST test group, which was composed of students from humanities/social sciences, teacher training, technology and mathematics, and not only from students of human medicine. This could generally speaking have an influence on the level of learning motivation. It is likely that medical students, in addition to the known high study motivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>], also have high learning motivation, so that a difference between the study groups in this maximum range is difficult to prove. A longitudinal study of the development of learning motivation in the study groups at various points in time, including a baseline prior to the course beginning, could provide additional information in future studies. In addition, we suspect that it is difficult to demonstrate statistical significance in learning success with not strictly standardized teaching/learning conditions and low numbers of participants in this pilot study.</p><p>The significant differences between the case and control groups in the analysis of the individual items suggests that students primarily applied to participate in FOP to be able to present themselves positively in front of others and not so much due to the endogenous motivation to expand their own abilities. This is a phenomenon which ought to be compared with the motivation for participating in other optional events.</p><p>The subjective feeling of FOP participants to have gained a better understanding of anatomical topics unfortunately did not lead to better exam results in the dissection course. It is likely that the increased subjective learning motivation was not translated into more time being invested by students in studying anatomic topic. But this also implies, however, that the examinations for the dissection course and the examination format may not be the right or not the sole instrument for evaluating the learning success through participation in the FOP. It has not been investigated yet whether FOP participants have or have not developed a more meaningful learning strategy through the clinical approach to teaching but with static exam results. The learning orientation described  by Entwistle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>] as &#x0201c;deep&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;strategic&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;superficial&#x0201d; are strongly influenced by the curriculum design and amongst others have an effect on the sustainability of the learning process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]. The use of the ASSIST questionnaire after Entwistle (Approaches to study skills inventory for students) could lead to differentiated conclusions about the quality of learning by FOP participants in the future. The sustainability of learned material, should be reviewed both in the case group and the control group by evaluating performance in real-life OT situations.</p><p>In summary, the experiences with FOP from the point of view of the 25 participants and the anatomy staff and surgery representatives are extremely positive. A deeper integration of anatomical and surgical teaching would be desirable in the future to develop a longitudinally oriented anatomical curriculum in addition to the foundation stone of anatomy, the dissection course. With this small study group it was not possible unfortunately to gain statistically reliable data of an objective increase of learning motivation and examination performance. But the results to date from this pilot study should be of use in optimizing the study design of future studies on the added benefits of the integration of clinical content into anatomical teaching. </p></sec><sec><title>Notes</title><p><sup>1</sup> Questionnaires (Evasys, Internal questionnaire and SELLMO-ST) are validated for the German-speaking use only.</p><p><sup>2</sup> The The SELLMO-ST motivation test for students is copyright-reserved and therefore not added as a supplement.
