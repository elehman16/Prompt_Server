It is expressed in higher levels in the colonic tissue and plasma of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). This phase II study assessed the efficacy and safety of BMS-936557, a fully human, monoclonal antibody to IP-10, in the treatment of moderately-to-severely active UC.</p></sec><sec><title>Design</title><p>In this 8-week, phase II, double-blind, multicentre, randomised study, patients with active UC received placebo or BMS-936557 (10&#x02005;mg/kg) intravenously every other week.

<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> However, not all patients will achieve remission, and corticosteroids, immunomodulators and anti-TNF therapy can be associated with toxicities, including infection and malignancy, rendering treatment inappropriate for some patients.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> As such, there is a need for new therapies with alternative mechanisms of action that offer a more favourable risk&#x02013;benefit profile.</p><p>Interferon-&#x003b3;-inducible protein-10 (IP-10), also referred to as CXCL10, is a chemokine that plays an important role in the integrin activation and migration of cells, including activated T cells, monocytes, eosinophils, natural killer, epithelial and endothelial cells.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> The receptor for IP-10 is chemokine (cys-x-cys motif) receptor 3 (CXCR3). Stimulation by IP-10 is directly and indirectly involved in the generation and recruitment of the pro-inflammatory cells that are responsible for inflammation and tissue destruction.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> IP-10 exerts its chemotactic activity on T helper (Th)1 and Th17 cells, and blockade of IP-10 may skew cytokine activity from a Th1 to a Th2 profile.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Thus, this chemokine can regulate inflammation by both induction of cellular migration and promotion of a Th1/Th17 response. IP-10 also appears to modulate cellular functions independently of CXCR3, including epithelial cell proliferation and migration as well as endothelial cell proliferation via heparan sulfate.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9&#x02013;12</xref> These additional mechanisms of action may also contribute to the potential role of IP-10 in driving intestinal inflammation.</p><p>Expression of IP-10 in colonic tissue and IP-10 plasma concentrations are greater in patients with UC compared with healthy controls.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>

BMS-936557 binds to IP-10 with high affinity (&#x0223c;1&#x02005;nM) and specifically blocks its interaction with CXCR3.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> As a result, BMS-936557 is a potent inhibitor of IP-10-induced chemotaxis of activated T cells (EC<sub>50</sub> &#x0223c;0.8&#x02005;nM).<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> BMS-936557 does not bind to either Mig (CXCL9) or ITAC (CXCL11), the other ligands for CXCR3,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> and so is only expected to modulate IP-10-mediated functions.

There appeared to be a numerically higher frequency of infections, including serious infections in the BMS-936557 group compared with placebo. In a previous phase II study of BMS-936557 in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, the frequency of infections was similar in BMS-936557- and placebo-treated patients.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> While all peri-infusion reactions were mild to moderate and none led to early discontinuation, the frequency of events appeared to be higher in the BMS-936557 group compared with placebo. No immunogenicity was detected in any patient (up to 42&#x02005;days post last study dose).</p><p>As highlighted above, the drug exposure&#x02013;response results demonstrated that higher trough serum levels at Day 57 were associated with higher rates of clinical response, clinical remission, histological remission and mucosal healing, whereas the safety profile observed in patients with higher trough levels was comparable with the overall study population. Collectively, these findings suggest that it may be beneficial to investigate doses of BMS-936557 greater than 10&#x02005;mg/kg in future trials.</p><p>The data presented here should be interpreted within the context of the trial's limitations. The primary endpoint was not met in the overall population; although robust efficacy was demonstrated in the subgroup of patients with higher BMS-936557 exposure, the trial was not originally powered to detect statistical differences between active and control treatments in groups of this size. Subgroup and as-observed histology assessments were performed post hoc and should be interpreted with caution owing to the known limitations of such analyses. In addition, histology assessments were carried out for all patients with sufficient available samples, but biopsies were not performed on every patient. Therefore, the possibility of sample selection bias must be considered. It should be noted that the baseline disease severity of this study population was milder compared with other recent studies in moderately-to-severely active UC;<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26&#x02013;28</xref> patients with a baseline Mayo score of greater than 10 were excluded and only 14% of patients were refractory to immunosuppressants and 6% to anti-TNF agents. The placebo response/remission rate observed in this study is comparable with other studies with biological therapies in moderately-to-severely active UC.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>
<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Furthermore, evaluating study results for global studies may be complicated by variations in results between patients from different geographic locations, in particular Eastern Europe and North America. However, of the 109 patients randomised, only 11 were from North America, specifically the USA, and given this small sample size, post hoc analyses by geographic region were not conducted.</p><p>In conclusion, the anti-IP-10 antibody, BMS-936557, is a potentially effective therapy for moderately-to-severely active UC. Higher drug exposure was associated with increasing clinical response and histological improvement. Further dose&#x02013;response studies are warranted.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Web figure</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="gutjnl-2012-303424-s1.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e1110" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank the investigators at the study sites: F Anderson, L Augustin, O Babak, L Barany, J Baz, A Buchman, P Cardarelli, Z Csiki, D Daniela, O Datsenko, D Dejica, C Diaz Stone, A Dorofeyev, L Douda, B Gasztonyi, L Gheorghe, A Goldis, M Gould, M Gurzo, Z Gurzo, R Hardi, A Hemaidan, I Horny, W Hunter Eubanks, B Hunyady, N Kakurina, J Kersak, OA Khrustalev, I Klyarits'ka, P Kohout, M Konecny, J Kotrlik, D Lisova, Y Lozynskyi, G Lysenko, M Lukas, L Mayer, T Mikhailova, O Minushkin, Z Nemecek, TJ Patrick, H Pluta, J Pokrotnieks, I Polianskyi, E Popescu, VM Radu, Y Shvarts, A Svintsitskyy, T Szaloki, M Tichy, I Tolmanis, S Valean, Y Zakharash and F Zsigmond.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> All authors have been involved in analysis and interpretation of the data.
