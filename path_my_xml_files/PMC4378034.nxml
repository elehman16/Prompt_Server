For this cross-sectional sub-study, 91 primarily urban minority health care workers who were ineligible for the main trial because they had self-reported asymptomatic colonoscopy screening, were interviewed by telephone.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Study instrument and variable assessment</title><p>We interviewed the first 100 participants who were ineligible because they had completed CRC screening. After excluding those who completed a test other than a colonoscopy and those who received the test because they were symptomatic, we arrived at our sample size. Participants were all over age 50 and were insured. The interview included an open-ended question, &#x0201c;Tell me, what made you get your (first) CRC screening test when you did? Responses were recorded verbatim and subsequently classified as external or internal. External motivation had a source outside the individual. Self-motivation came from within the individual and with no mention of an outside source. Development of the survey was guided by our past research with this population.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Trained research assistants conducted the interviews, and a senior statistician, who was not linked to the population of participants, coded and analyzed all of the data (P.Z.). The time interval for this data collection was 2/26/10 and 11/7/10.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Use of qualitative data proved important as open-ended questions allowed for the use of follow-up questions to get detailed information about what motivated the participants to receive CRC screening. Descriptive statistics, including frequencies and percentages, or means and standard deviations (SD), were calculated, and differences were assessed with Chi-square, and the Mann&#x02013;Whitney U-test. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards at Teachers College, Columbia University, Columbia University Medical Center, and William Paterson University.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Seventy-four participants (81.3%) were deemed externally motivated and 17 (18.7%) were internally (self) motivated. <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> displays demographic characteristics and beliefs by motivational status. The mean age was 59.8 (5.4 SD). The most commonly reported motivation was external, and that was that respondents heeded their primary care physician's recommendation (<italic>n</italic> = 60, 65.9%). Other external motivations were having had exposure to CRC or polyps through family or work (<italic>n</italic> = 16, 17.6%) and having been pressured to get tested by relatives or friends (<italic>n</italic> = 8, 8.8%). Seventeen participants mentioned none of these external motivations and offered responses such as &#x0201c;knew it was important,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;made appointment on my own;&#x0201d; these individuals were deemed self-motivated. Compared with the externally motivated, the self-motivated were more likely to have an income over $50K/year (46.2% vs. 16.4%, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) and to be US born (35.3% vs. 12.2%, <italic>P</italic> = 0.05); they were more likely to mention that they were age-appropriate for the test (58.8% vs. 28.4%, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05), knew more people who had had colonoscopies (median 6, range = 2-25 vs. median 3, range= 0-20, (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001); they were less likely to report thinking that most of the age-appropriate population in New York City had received colonoscopy screening (35.3% vs. 77.0%, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.005) and less likely to be deterred from colonoscopy by work schedule (0% vs. 50%, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) or by having to take a powerful laxative (11.8% vs. 62.2%, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001).

Over 80% of respondents reported external motivations, most notably a recommendation from a primary care physician. Our prior research on CRC screening in an independent sample,[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] has highlighted the importance of a recommendation from a primary care physician. This is consistent with the finding that physicians are the most trusted source of health information and demonstrates the importance of physicians&#x02019; recommendations for increasing rates of CRC screening. In this paper, we also describe characteristics that distinguish the self-motivated from the externally motivated. This study was limited by the cross-sectional design and a small sample size. In addition, because the participants in the study work in a health care setting this could make them more privy to the need for a screening test. Nevertheless, this study contributes to the sparse research related to factors motivating the decision to complete a colonoscopy.</p><p>Analysis of the motivations of individuals who have sought colonoscopy screening versus those who have not has yielded important findings. To place these ideas about motivation for screening in a broader theoretical context, we recognize motivation is a necessary, but not sufficient, factor influencing initiation or maintenance of behavioral changes. Even if motivated, some individuals may not be able to act on their motivation or have adequate social support to reinforce their choices.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>Literature on correlates of cancer screening, namely that minorities,[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] those of lower socioeconomic status,[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and those with lower levels of education[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] are less likely to be screened. This study fills a gap in the literature by focusing on factors that motivated participants from a primarily minority population to complete CRC screening. To the extent that similar motivating factors can be generalized to other settings and populations requires further study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Most of the characteristics we found to be associated with self-motivation are not amenable to change (e.g., birthplace) or are difficult to change (e.g., income); others may be addressed through education. These latter include knowledge about the age at which CRC screening is recommended, tolerability of preparation, and facilitation in taking time off from work. The significance of this last factor is that while health insurance may cover direct medical cost, other financial costs may interfere with motivation or ability to act on motivation to be screened.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>This work was primarily supported by the American Cancer Society (grant number RSGT-09-012-01-CPPB), and for CHB by the ART fund
