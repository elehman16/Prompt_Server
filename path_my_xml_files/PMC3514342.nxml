[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Despite the wide availability of effective therapy, long-term management of asthma falls for short of the goals set in guidelines
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], and many patients do experience a profound burden of disease
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Self-management is an essential component in the proactive management of asthma
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] because it helps patients to reach their treatment goals and enables patients to manage symptoms, treatment, physical and psychosocial consequences, and lifestyle changes inherent in living with a chronic condition
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. However, the uptake of self-management in clinical practice may be hampered because easy-use tools that enhance sustained uptake of action plan usage by patients are lacking in today&#x02019;s practice
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], and patients can experience a lack of ownership of these action plans
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Not surprisingly, a minority of general practices provide patients with written action plans
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Internet technology is increasingly being seen as an appealing tool for self-management for patients with chronic disease
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Telehealth care in asthma is defined as healthcare being delivered from a distance, facilitated electronically, and involving the exchange of information through the personalized interaction between a healthcare professional using their skills, judgment, and the patient providing information
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Telehealth care may overcome barriers towards optimal care in patients with mild to moderate asthma
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. More specifically, internet technology can be employed for ongoing individualized management of the patient
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>Internet-based self-management (IBSM) support in asthma consists of the following components: internet-based asthma monitoring, internet-based goal setting, decision support with a treatment plan, online medical review, tailored online information, and communication with a healthcare provider. Recently, we have shown that such IBSM can improve asthma-related quality of life, asthma control, the number of symptom-free days, and lung function in patients with mild to moderate persistent asthma, as compared to usual care
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In a cost-utility analysis
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], it was demonstrated that IBSM support can be as effective as current asthma care with regard to quality of life in terms of patient utilities, and costs are similar over a one-year period.</p><p>Therefore, the current challenge is to implement IBSM support in routine asthma management within primary care. Patients that are most likely to be willing to participate and benefit from (internet-based) self-management are those with partially controlled or uncontrolled asthma
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. These patients constitute about two-thirds of the asthma population in primary care
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>A structured implementation strategy is needed to incorporate IBSM in current clinical practice and subsequently into a patient&#x02019;s daily life. Implementation strategies for IBSM, consisting of several components (so-called &#x02018;multi-faceted implementation strategy&#x02019;) are suggested to be more effective in changing current clinical practices
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In addition, tailoring the implementation strategy to barriers and facilitators experienced by the target group&#x02014;patients with asthma, practice nurses (PNs), and general practitioners (GPs)&#x02014;is recommended
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Such barriers can be identified at different levels of healthcare system
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]: innovation, the individual patient (<italic>i.e.</italic>, illness perceptions), professional level, societal context (opinion of colleagues), organisational context (organisation of care process), and economic and political contexts.</p><p>Prior to this project, we conducted focus groups and interviews with patients and professionals for exploring barriers and facilitators for usage of IBSM in primary care
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. These barriers were identified at patient and professional/organizational level. Main barriers at the patient level were unawareness of their level of asthma control and subsequent possibility for improvement, and patients often do not perceive asthma as a chronic condition and experience difficulties of integrating self-management activities into daily life. Main barriers at the professional level (PN, GP) and organizational level were unawareness of the level of asthma control of patients, lack of structure of asthma care, and lack of structure of routine asthma consultations within general practice and lack of time. Consequently, we developed three implementation strategies (the strategies will be described in more detail below):</p><p>1. Minimum strategy (MS): dissemination of the IBSM program.</p><p>2. Intermediate strategy (IS): MS + start-up support for professionals (<italic>i.e.</italic>, support in selection of the appropriate population and training of professionals).</p><p>3. Extended strategy (ES): IS + additional training and ongoing support for professionals.</p><p>In summary, the MS strategy has not been tailored to previously identified barriers and corresponds with commonly used implementation strategies (<italic>i.e.</italic>, dissemination of the innovation only). This is in contrast with the IS strategy, which specifically have been developed for addressing previous identified barriers. The ES strategy is the most extensive and time-intensive strategy. Currently, there are only sparse data on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of implementation strategies for IBSM in primary care. This information is particularly important for the time-intensive implementation interventions, such as selection of the appropriate population, professional training, and ongoing support for professionals in IBSM support.</p><sec><title>Hypotheses</title><p>To evaluate the impact of these three different implementation strategies for IBSM in current clinical practice, we have proposed four hypotheses, which are constructed to compare the effect of tailoring implementation strategies to identified barriers (IS and ES) versus a commonly used, non-tailored strategy (MS):</p><p>1. More general practices will participate in IBSM in the IS or ES strategy as compared with the MS strategy;</p><p>2. The proportion of referred patients who participate in the IBSM program in the ES or IS strategy will be greater as compared with the MS strategy;</p><p>3. The proportion of referred patients who participate in the IBSM program in the ES or IS strategy will be greater as compared to the MS strategy;</p><p>4. The ES and the IS strategy will be more cost-effective as compared to the MS strategy.</p></sec><sec><title>Objectives</title><p>The objectives of this study are to investigate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a MS strategy, as compared to an IS strategy and an ES strategy in a three-arm, cluster randomized trial. Because these different implementation strategies have a sequence of effects, the evaluation is aimed to assess to what extent: practices participate in IBSM; IBSM improves asthma related quality of life; patients participate in IBSM; and the various implementation strategies are cost-effective.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>This study is a three-arm, cluster randomized trial with a cluster pre-randomisation design
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] (Figure&#x02009;

The IBSM application contains functionalities that are characterized by some innovative aspects, such as options for e-consultation and integration of results into the general practice system. These functionalities address previously stated requirements for both patients and professionals. The findings of this study will lead to recommendations for a potential cost-effective strategy that can be used for the implementation of IBSM in practice.</p><p>This study has been designed for translation of research findings into actual practice. Primarily, the pre-cluster randomization design allows us to study the effect of the different implementation strategies on the number of primary care practices that participate in IBSM. Second, the impact of the different strategies at both professional and patient level on actual implementation (<italic>i.e.</italic>, participation, patient outcomes, and cost-effectiveness). Third, general practices are given a leading role to adapt and internalize IBSM in clinical practice: the project team will only act as facilitators to these practices. Additionally, the influence of research activities on implementation has been incorporated in the design of this study, because these might function as an extra stimulus for both practices and patients to adapt and internalize IBSM during the study period. Therefore, the content of the MS strategy is not only similar to commonly used (non-tailored) implementation strategies, but also the number and amount of research activities are minimized. This is in contrast to the IS and ES strategies, which are specifically designed to address previous identified barriers. These differences give us the opportunity to study how much support is required by general practices for IBSM implementation. Finally, this study evaluates the costs of the implementation from a societal perspective, which is in contrast to other implementation studies
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Therefore, we will include costs for asthma care from both non-participating practices and non-participating patients.</p><sec><title>Implications</title><p>The results of this study will help to determine the most effective way of implementing IBSM. Both the pre-cluster randomization and the inclusion of the IS and ES strategies provide a more detailed view of the implementation process and thereby direction to the focus for future implementation processes in primary care. For example, it may provide information on: the quality and intensity of support professionals need to identify eligible patients; whether it is sufficient to focus only on the start-up period of implementation; and whether continuing support of professionals has additional value in maintaining implementation.</p><p>The results of this study can enhance a broad implementation of IBSM in current clinical care, based on a cost-effective strategy. Thereby it can contribute to improved care for patients with asthma. Furthermore, design and results of this trial can contribute to development of effective implementation strategies for self-management initiatives for other chronic diseases.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethical approval</title><p>This study has been approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the Leiden University Medical Centre.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>All authors declare that they have no competing interests.
