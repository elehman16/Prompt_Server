Despite a large body of research, few practical and cost-effective farm-level interventions have been identified. In this study, a randomized controlled trial was conducted to assess the effect of reducing the level of water in automatically refilling water-troughs on fecal shedding of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> O157:H7 in feedlot cattle. Pens in a feedlot in the Texas Panhandle were randomly allocated as control (total number: 17) or intervention (total number: 18) pens. Fecal samples (2,759 in total) were collected both at baseline and three weeks after the intervention, and tested for the presence of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> O157:H7 using immunomagnetic bead separation and selective culture. There was a strong statistical association between sampling date and the likelihood of a fecal sample testing positive for <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> O157:H7. Pen was also a strong predictor of fecal prevalence. Despite accounting for this high level of clustering, a statistically significant association between reduced water levels in the trough and increased prevalence of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> O157:H7 in the feces was observed (Odds Ratio = 1.6; 95% Confidence Interval: 1.2&#x02013;2.0; Likelihood Ratio Test: p = 0.02). This is the first time that such an association has been reported, and suggests that increasing water-trough levels may be effective in reducing shedding of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> O157:H7 in cattle feces, although further work would be needed to test this hypothesis. Controlling <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> O157:H7 fecal shedding at the pre-harvest level may lead to a reduced burden of human foodborne illness attributed to this pathogen in beef.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000199</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Agriculture</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Accession No. 1002529; Project No. TEX09586</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ivanek</surname><given-names>Renata</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5T35OD010991</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bean</surname><given-names>Melissa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5T35OD010991</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Blanco</surname><given-names>Anthony</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award004"><funding-source><institution>Texas Veterinary Medical Foundation</institution></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bean</surname><given-names>Melissa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award005"><funding-source><institution>Texas Veterinary Medical Foundation</institution></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Blanco</surname><given-names>Anthony</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award006"><funding-source><institution>NIH</institution></funding-source><award-id>Veterinary Scholars Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bean</surname><given-names>Melissa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award007"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Veterinary Scholars Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Blanco</surname><given-names>Anthony</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award008"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5 T32 0D 011083-8</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bryan</surname><given-names>Laura</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was funded by the Formula Animal Health Fund from the United States Department of Agriculture (Accession No. 1002529; Project No. TEX09586).

Many intervention strategies have been suggested, such as the use of probiotics, antibiotics, vaccinations, bacteriophages, dietary changes, and improved animal management [<xref rid="pone.0192149.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. However, these interventions have been shown to have either a weak effect, or the observed effect lacks repeatability when evaluated against naturally colonized cattle under field conditions.

Water-to-cattle ratio denotes the amount of standing water at a point in time available per head of cattle; it is estimated by dividing the volume of water in water-troughs in a pen with the number of animals in the pen. Water-troughs have an automatic water refill system that assures water refilling as cattle drink. Prior mathematical modelling studies [<xref rid="pone.0192149.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0192149.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] suggest that if the water trough volume is high relative to the number of animals in the pen (high water-to-cattle ratio), a large pool of standing water is available, which in warm weather will heat up and may promote <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> O157:H7 growth. Thus, drinking water was identified as a potential pathway of infection transmission with drinking water-to-cattle ratio as a strong modulator of the process. This gave rise to a hypothesis that at a given elevated ambient temperature, a lowered water-to-cattle ratio will secure a faster refill of fresh water and reduce the growth and accumulation of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> O157:H7 in water, leading to a reduced prevalence and load of fecal shedding among cattle.

To our knowledge, this is the first time that decreasing water levels in troughs has been shown to be associated with an increased risk of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> O157:H7 fecal shedding, and the result was surprising given that previous modeling suggested that the effect would be in the opposite direction [<xref rid="pone.0192149.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0192149.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>Since pens were allocated to intervention or control status using systematic random sampling, the risk of bias leading to a false finding of an effect was minimized. We found no evidence that the observed relationship between water-level and prevalence of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> O157:H7 in fecal pats was confounded by weather or pen population size (the potential effect of days in feeding was controlled through the study design by blocking). We cannot rule out the possibility of an unmeasured confounder, such as a spatially-related variable, e.g., topology or microenvironments which may vary between pens, and could be related to moisture and survival of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> O157:H7 in the fecal pats. However, mapping of the positive and negative pens in both years did not reveal a spatial pattern. Furthermore, the finding was consistent in years one and two, despite the fact that there was an overall trend of increasing prevalence in year one, from the beginning to the end of the trial, and an overall trend of decreasing prevalence in year two. Further, the magnitude of effect was greater for pens that had a high initial water-trough level, which is consistent with what would be expected if this was a true causal effect.</p><p>Although changing the water-trough level appeared to affect fecal prevalence of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> O157:H7, no <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> O157:H7 was identified in any of the water troughs, and we did not detect an association between generic <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> or coliform counts in the water troughs and either fecal prevalence of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> O157:H7 or the intervention. In view of these water results we can only speculate on the mechanism of action. The apparent absence of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> O157:H7 from the water troughs may be explained by the relatively low sensitivity of the test for the volume of water tested. The detection limit for <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> O157:H7 in water samples was 1 CFU/ 100 ml meaning that concentrations below that threshold could have been missed.</p><p>The purpose of enumerating the generic <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> and coliforms in water troughs was to use them as indicators of fecal contamination that may help elucidate the effect of the implemented intervention on the bacterial dynamics in a trough. It is possible that re-testing water at 3-week intervals was insufficient to capture the causative relationship, if real, between water contamination and animal colonization. Cattle colonization has been reported to last up to 3 weeks [<xref rid="pone.0192149.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] meaning that even cattle that became colonized soon after the intervention was implemented could still be colonized and observed at the time of re-testing 3 weeks later. Alternatively, the level of water contamination may have varied much more rapidly even within a day due to the stochastic nature of contamination events and rapid water turnover rate. Water turnover rate is the time it takes for cattle to drink the volume of water equal to the total volume of the water trough; it is calculated by dividing the volume of water with the water flow rate. In a pen with 200 cattle each drinking 50 liters of water per day [<xref rid="pone.0192149.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] from a water trough that is automatically refilled to the capacity of 400 liters, the water turnover rate would be 400/(200*50) = 0.04 days or 0.96 hours, meaning that cattle would drink approximately the volume of the trough every hour or 24 times per day. Reducing the water volume to a half in the intervention pens reduced that time to a half, meaning that fluctuations in contamination level would occur at a faster rate in those pens. Using a simple mathematical model of bacterial contamination in an automatically refilled water trough (not presented), it can be shown that under the assumptions of constant rates of water contamination and drinking, homogenous mixing within the trough and no growth or decay of bacteria in water, the concentration of bacteria would approach the same equilibrium level regardless of water volume, but that the equilibrium level would be approached faster in the intervention compared to control pens. At timescales relevant to cattle exposure to contaminated water through drinking, the water contamination rate is unlikely to be constant. The events that lead to contamination of water are stochastic in their timing and variable in the amount of introduced bacteria. Likewise, cattle drink water at a variable rate during a 24 -hour period, resulting in fluctuations in the concentration of bacteria. Assume two troughs refilled to the levels of 400 liters and 200 liters, respectively, in otherwise identical control and intervention pens, and instantaneous and homogeneous dispersal of bacteria after their introduction into water. After a single introduction of the same amount of bacteria into each of the two troughs, the concentration of bacteria would be twice as large in the intervention compared to the control trough, because the bacteria would be more diluted in the larger volume of water, but the bacteria would be eliminated faster from the intervention compared to the control trough through cattle drinking. Therefore, reducing the volume of water in intervention pens may have had a short-term effect on the concentration of bacteria in the trough post each contamination event that resulted in an increased dose of bacteria being consumed by cattle. While this mechanism of action may seem feasible, to capture it empirically would require more frequent sampling of water and cattle than was feasible in this study.</p><p>As another possible explanation of the mechanism of action, reducing the water level could have caused debris at the bottom of the water troughs to be disturbed more easily and frequently, causing the cattle to consume more <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> O157:H7. The debris with <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> O157:H7 may occur as part of the environmental contamination with feces contaminated with <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> O157:H7, which has been shown to be important in the spread of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> O157:H7 [<xref rid="pone.0192149.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0192149.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Alternatively and unlikely, reducing the water level could have changed the behavior of the cattle, for example causing them to drink more or less frequently, which could have some effect on the probability of colonization of the intestinal tract. It has been shown that trough height can affect cattle drinking behavior, although trough depth did not seem to have an effect [<xref rid="pone.0192149.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. However, predictors of colonization of the intestinal tract are currently not well understood, so this is only speculative [<xref rid="pone.0192149.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p><p>As expected, there was clustering of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> O157:H7 shedding within pens and within sampling dates. Other studies have observed similar variability in fecal shedding between pens and within pens over time [<xref rid="pone.0192149.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Despite this between-pen and between-sampling date variability, the only predictors that we found to be significantly associated with fecal prevalence were a high mean maximum dew-point in the previous seven days and increased rainfall in the previous seven days, both of which were negatively associated with fecal prevalence. Together, these findings suggest that higher moisture was associated with lower numbers of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> O157:H7 in the environment. The relationship between <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> O157:H7 survival and environmental conditions is complex; dry conditions can decrease survival of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> in the environment through water stress, whereas high levels of water can decrease survival by producing anoxic conditions [<xref rid="pone.0192149.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The apparent effects of precipitation and dew point in previous studies have been relatively small and inconclusive [<xref rid="pone.0192149.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0192149.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. One study of four calves reported a reduced self- and allo-grooming behavior during wet periods, and this could in theory reduce spread of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> O157:H7 through licking of contaminated hides [<xref rid="pone.0192149.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Finally, there were no significant predictors of the probability of a pen having positive <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> O157:H7 status according to the environmental screening. This may be in part due to the high level of variability in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> O157:H7 prevalence over time, which is not captured by pen-level variables.</p><p>This study has a few important limitations. The latex agglutination test without PCR confirmation can in some cases detect <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> other than <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> O157:H7, and this could have resulted in an over-estimation of prevalence. However, this non-differential misclassification bias would result in an under-estimation of any effect of the intervention as it would apply to control and intervention groups equally, meaning that the true association between the intervention and <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> O157:H7 faecal shedding could have been even stronger [<xref rid="pone.0192149.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Unfortunately, the change in feedlot management in year 2 made some analyses impossible because of unavailable data. Also, the concurrent commercial trials in year 2 restricted our ability to fully randomize pens, which could have introduced confounding. The study showed the effect of reduced water level on <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> O157:H7 shedding prevalence in only one feedlot over a relatively short time-period: three weeks. Furthermore, the results may not be reproducible in different climatic conditions. However, repeatability of the findings in year 1 and 2 contribute to the evidence that a true effect was observed. <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> O157:H7 shedding within an individual animal is highly variable and dependent on complex interactions between the cattle and the environment, which may have reduced the power of the study to observe more subtle effects.</p><p>In conclusion, despite the limitations, this study provides evidence that keeping water levels in the troughs high could prevent potential increases in prevalence of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> O157:H7 fecal shedding. Further, this suggests a novel control strategy for reduction of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> O157:H7 at the pre-harvest level. However, increasing the water-level in troughs was not directly tested and should therefore be investigated with longer-term trials in different settings before implementation of the strategy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec036"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0192149.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Counts of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> O157:H7 in fecal samples based on spiral plating.</title><p>Shown are only samples with counts &#x0003e;0 CFU/g of feces.
