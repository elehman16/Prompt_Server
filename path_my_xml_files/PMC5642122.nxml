ARBs are being preferred because they are effective in reducing blood pressure (BP) with good tolerability profile, and convenient once a day dosing.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Losartan was the first marketed ARB that has shown relatively ineffective control of BP throughout the day.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Subsequently, in 1998, telmisartan was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and it offers the advantage of a long plasma half-life of 24 h and improves insulin sensitivity and lipid profiles.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Olmesartan medoxomil was approved by FDA in April 2002. It is also shown to improve BP and lipid levels similar to telmisartan.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>Various studies have demonstrated the difference in antihypertensive efficacies among ARBs.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Although previous studies have compared the antihypertensive efficacy of ARBs on the basis of cuff BP change, such comparisons have largely been against a single member of this group. Hypertension and dyslipidemia often coexist and are well-established risk factors for cardiovascular diseases.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Very few studies have directly compared losartan, telmisartan, and olmesartan for efficacy, safety, and effect on metabolic parameters such as lipid profile and blood glucose. At the same time, data supporting the same in Indian population are not substantial. There is paucity of studies showing the effect of ARBs on lipid profile in Indian population.</p><p>Therefore, the present study was planned in patients of Stage I hypertension with the objectives to compare the efficacy and tolerability of losartan, telmisartan, and olmesartan as antihypertensive and to evaluate and compare the effects of losartan, telmisartan, and olmesartan on lipid profile and blood glucose.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ATERIALS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>The present study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee and carried out in accordance with Good Clinical Practice guidelines and the ethical principles as mentioned in the Declaration of Helsinki. This was a randomized, open-label, parallel-group, comparative study conducted in sixty patients of Stage I hypertension carried out from January 2013 to September 2014. Patients were recruited from the medicine outpatient department (OPD) of a tertiary care hospital. Newly diagnosed patients of Stage I hypertension of either gender with age &#x0003e;18 years, willing to participate, and ready to give written informed consent were included in the study.</p><p>Patients suffering from diabetes, abnormal liver or kidney function, or any other systemic illness and taking other concomitant medication including antihypertensive medication were excluded from the study. Pregnant and lactating women were also excluded from the study.</p><p>Change in sitting cuff diastolic BP (DBP) from baseline to 12 weeks was taken as primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints were change in sitting cuff systolic BP (SBP), change in fasting blood glucose (FBG) FBG level (FBGL), and serum lipids from baseline to 12 weeks.</p><p>Tolerability profile of the drugs was also studied.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study procedure</title><p>Patients attending medicine OPD were screened by the physician. For confirmation of diagnosis of hypertension, at least 3 sets of readings were taken on three consecutive days.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Patients of Stage I hypertension as diagnosed by the physician (SBP 140&#x02013;159 mmHg and DBP 90&#x02013;99 mmHg according to JNC&#x02013;7 classification)[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and those who met the inclusion criteria were briefed about the study. Patient information sheet was given to all prospective participants, and written informed consent in vernacular language was obtained from patients willing to participate. Subject confidentiality was maintained throughout the study. A detail medical history was obtained and physical examination performed. Liver function tests (LFTs), kidney function tests (KFTs), FBG, and lipid profile were estimated to check the eligibility of the patients to participate in the study and recorded in the case report form (CRF).</p><p>The eligible patients were randomly allocated into the following three treatment groups using computer-generated table of random numbers:</p><p>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Group 1: Tablet olmesartan (20 mg once a day)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Group 2: Tablet telmisartan (40 mg once a day)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Group 3: Tablet losartan (50 mg once a day).</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>All the patients were given the respective tablets for 2 weeks and were asked to come for follow-up after 2 weeks. Subsequently, BP was assessed at the interval of 2 weeks for a period of 3 months. Adverse event, if any, was recorded in the CRF. The patient was asked to bring the empty packets of tablets during follow-up visits to check the adherence. Ninety percent consumption was considered to be adequate adherence. After completion of 3 months, LFT, KFT, FBG, and lipid profile were repeated.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Calculation of sample size</title><p>Sample size was calculated for 5% &#x003b1; and 80% power. A difference of 6 mmHg in diastolic blood pressure, assuming a standard deviation of 8 was considered for calculation. The calculated sample size was 16 in each group. The study sample size was rounded to sixty (20 patients in each group) considering the rate of dropouts and noncompliance.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>The reduction in BP within each group was analyzed at 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 8 weeks and at 12 weeks using the repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey's post hoc test. For analysis of FBG and lipid profile before and after treatment in each group, the paired 't' test was used. The intergroup analysis was done using the one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's post hoc test. Baseline data were analyzed using the one-way ANOVA (parametric data), Kruskal-Wallis (non-parametric data) and Chi- square (nominal data) tests.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>R<sc>ESULTS</sc></title><p>A total of 87 patients were screened for participation in the study. Of these, sixty patients satisfied the inclusion criteria and were randomized into three groups of twenty each to receive either olmesartan or telmisartan or losartan. Out of sixty patients of newly diagnosed Stage I hypertension, 57 patients completed the study as per protocol with regular follow-up [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>].

This is consistent with the findings from previous studies.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] In our study, there was significant difference in reduction of cuff DBP, between olmesartan and losartan group and between telmisartan and losartan group. It indicates that olmesartan and telmisartan is more efficacious than losartan in reducing cuff DBP. These observations are in line with the findings of previous studies.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Nakayama <italic>et al</italic>. showed that olmesartan, at oral dose of 20&#x02013;40 mg once daily, was effective, safe, and more efficacious than losartan for hypertension (50&#x02013;100 mg once daily).[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] The characteristic effect of telmisartan in decreasing the diastolic BP may be related to its long half-life.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] The greater efficacy of olmesartan in reducing trough cuff DBP may be related to its relatively long half-life of 12&#x02013;18 h.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] The half-life of losartan is 2 h and that of its active metabolite (EXP3174) is 4&#x02013;5 h. Since a longer half-life is associated with a longer duration of action, this difference in pharmacokinetics may partially explain the differences in efficacy among these three ARBs. The long half-life of drug such as olmesartan may minimize the effect of missed or delayed dosing of medication.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] MacMahon <italic>et al</italic>. reported that a reduction in DBP of 5 mmHg is associated with reductions of at least 21% in the incidence of CHD and at least 34% in the incidence of stroke.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Significant differences in DBP reduction among these three ARBs noted in our study may be of clinical value. However, there was no significant difference in the reduction of cuff DBP between olmesartan and telmisartan group suggesting that both the drugs are equally efficacious in reducing DBP. Arao <italic>et al</italic>. found no difference between olmesartan and telmisartan group with respect to the antihypertensive effect on the BP.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Olmesartan shows high selectivity and strong binding to AT1 receptors while telmisartan has been reported to have a longer residence time on AT1 receptors that contributes to a more sustained antihypertensive effect.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] In our study, there was significant difference in reduction of SBP between olmesartan and telmisartan group and between olmesartan and losartan group. Our findings are consistent with findings from previous studies.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] In our study, telmisartan significantly reduced the FBGLs at 12 weeks which was not seen with olmesartan and losartan [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>]. Previous studies have also shown that telmisartan (40 mg) once daily results in a significant improvement in glucose metabolism in insulin-resistant subjects with improvement in beta-cell function.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Blockade of angiotensin II receptor can promote adipocyte differentiation and this may contribute to the antidiabetic effect.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Several clinical trials have demonstrated that ARBs prevent the new-onset diabetes more effectively than other classes of antihypertensive drugs.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] However, among ARBs, only telmisartan has blood glucose-lowering effect, indicating that telmisartan has pleiotropic effect on glucose metabolism independent of the angiotensin II receptor antagonist effect.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Recently, telmisartan has been shown to function as a partial agonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-&#x003b3;) while other ARBs did not have effect on PPAR-&#x003b3; activity.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Many studies have shown that PPAR-&#x003b3; plays an important role in regulation of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism and that activation of PPAR-&#x003b3; can improve insulin sensitivity.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Results of our study indicated that telmisartan significantly reduced serum TGs and LDL cholesterol when compared with losartan. Telmisartan significantly reduced LDL cholesterol when compared with olmesartan. Observations of our study also showed that olmesartan significantly decreased serum TG, TC, and LDL cholesterol when compared with losartan. However, the reduction of serum TG is not significant in telmisartan group when compared with olmesartan group. Telmisartan activates PPAR-&#x003b3;, which regulates lipid metabolism. Other mechanisms contributing to the lipid-lowering action of telmisartan could be high lipophilicity and structural differences of telmisartan as compared with other ARBs.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Aky&#x000fc;rek <italic>et al</italic>. performed a study to determine the metabolic effects of olmesartan in newly diagnosed hypertensive patients. It was reported that TG, TC, FBG, and LDL levels were significantly reduced at the end of 3 months' treatment with olmesartan. However, olmesartan did not produce any significant increases in serum PPAR-&#x003b3; transcription-factor concentration.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</p><table-wrap id="T4" position="float"><label>Table 4</label><caption><p>Comparison of changes in blood glucose and lipid profile from baseline to 12 weeks in treatment groups</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JPP-8-106-g006"/></table-wrap><p>The results of our study show that olmesartan is the most efficacious in reducing BP in Stage I hypertensive patients. Telmisartan has favorable effects on lipid profile. Hence, telmisartan can be the preferred ARB in such patients. However, long-term studies are needed to confirm this effect. In addition, telmisartan lowers blood glucose levels and whether this blood glucose-lowering effect of telmisartan proves to be beneficial in diabetic patients with hypertension needs to be evaluated.
