cognitive and walking ability after stroke. [Subjects and Methods] Twenty patients
diagnosed with stroke participated in this study. All participants were receiving a
traditional rehabilitation program 5 days a week. Dual-task and single-task training were
additionally performed for 4 weeks, 3 days a week. The Stroop test, Timed Up and Go (TUG)
test, 10-Meter Walk Test (10MWT), and Figure-of-8 Walk Test (F8WT) were used to measure
cognitive and walking abilities and were evaluated 3 times (before and after training and
at the 2-week follow-up). [Results] Dual-task training improved cognitive and walking
abilities, and dual-task training subjects&#x02019; performance was better than single-task
training subjects&#x02019; performance. In addition, these training benefits were maintained for 2
weeks. [Conclusion] Dual-task training improves cognitive and walking abilities of
patients with stroke.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Cognitive</kwd><kwd>Gait</kwd><kwd>Dual task</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Cerebrovascular disease-related mortality rates have been increasing, and 1 out of every 4
cerebrovascular disease patients dies within a month after the onset of disease<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Among the surviving patients, 15&#x02013;30% become
severely handicapped, and 40% are left with functional deficits, resulting in problems with
the major components of functional independence: motor, sensory, and cognitive
functions<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Cognitive function refers to the ability to understand the things that occur in daily life.
It is the capacity to adapt to various situations as one begins activities, plans and
considers issues, and resolves problems. The cognitive domain includes the abilities of
concentration, memory, planning, systematization, problem solving, abstraction, and use of
language<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Because movements cannot be
performed without intent, cognitive processing is crucial for motor control<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. During the rehabilitative training process,
stroke patients with decreased cognitive ability cannot adequately utilize the cognitive
function needed for motor learning<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus,
the normal mechanisms of postural control that were once automatic, such as the maintenance
of a standing position, walking, and dual-task performance, are temporarily or permanently
lost, and are changed into a conscious and slow response with a limited extent<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Thus, the evaluation of cognitive function in patients with early stroke is important for
planning treatment for their functional recovery and return to daily life<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In addition to cognitive function, walking is one of the major physical functions that is
highly affected by stroke<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Stroke
patients exhibit inefficient walking because of decreased dynamic balance ability, as well
as decreased musculoskeletal and cardiovascular function, and expend a significant amount of
energy compensating for this deficiency<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Compared with healthy persons, therefore, stroke patients have lower
walking speeds and shorter duration of walking. Their daily functions are also limited and
they cannot complete certain simultaneous tasks, such as conversing while walking<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The relationship between cognition and motor control after neurological damage due to
factors such as stroke has significant implications for understanding the recovery of motor
function. Thus, it has been the center of much research, and the number of studies
investigating the role of cognition and walking in elderly populations and clinical disease
research has increased<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Cognitive-motor interference refers to the phenomenon that occurs when 1 or 2 tasks that
interfere with each other are being performed, such as engaging in cognitive and motor tasks
simultaneously<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Interference between
cognitive tasks and motor control activities (such as walking) is important for functional
improvement in patients with neurological deficits. Thus, the therapist must address both
cognitive and motor training in planning rehabilitation therapy<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>A dual task requires subjects to perform complex tasks simultaneously, and emphasizes the
role of cognition and concentration using a dual-task method that involves a cognitive task
combined with postural and walking control<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. Typically, the concurrent performance of
motor and cognitive tasks in dual-task training affects the performance of one or both
tasks<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. Various studies on the
interaction between cognitive tasks and cognitive characteristics, and between motor tasks
and dynamic characteristics are under way<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>According to the task integration hypothesis, single-task training has lower demands than
dual-task training. Single-task training does not permit the concurrent performance of 2
tasks, whereas dual-task training allows the coordination of various tasks via the
simultaneous performance of 2 or more tasks<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, the majority of gait training for stroke patients focuses
on functional recovery via exercise under single-task, rather than dual-task, conditions.
Therefore, the therapeutic approaches available currently fall short of addressing cognitive
deficits.</p><p>Thus, the present study aimed to investigate the effects of dual-task training including a
cognitive task component on the cognitive and walking abilities of chronic stroke patients
using objective measurement equipment and functional evaluation tools.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The present study included 20 patients who consented to participate in the study from among
patients who had received a diagnosis of hemiparalysis due to stroke. The study was
performed at the C hospital in Gwangju, began in August 2012, and lasted for 4 weeks. All
the subjects voluntarily consented to participate in this study prior to its initiation.
Data collection was carried out after approval had been granted by the Institutional Review
Board of Donshin University.</p><p>The 20 stroke patients were randomly assigned to 2 groups (n = 10 per group). The
experimental group received dual-task gait training with cognitive tasks, whereas the
control group received single-task gait training.</p><p>To evaluate the cognitive and walking abilities of stroke patients, we used the Stroop
test, Timed Up and Go (TUG) test, 10-Meter Walk Test (10MWT), Figure-of-8 Walking Test
(F8WT), and dynamic gait index (DGI). Three repeated measurements were taken (before the
intervention, after the intervention, and 2 weeks after intervention).</p><p>The Stroop test was used as part of the cognitive assessment. The assessment involved
showing the subjects words written using inks of various colors, and having the subjects
state the color of the ink<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. The number of correct answers completed within a given
time was counted.</p><p>The TUG test is an assessment tool that quickly assesses basic motor and balance control.
It is currently being used to assess the elderly, as well as patients with stroke,
Parkinson&#x02019;s disease, and arthritic diseases<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. The TUG test measures the time it takes a subject to rise from an
armchair, walk 3 m, and then return to the chair and sit down. The TUG test was administered
under both the single-task and dual-task conditions.</p><p>For the 10MWT, a walkway of 14&#x02005;m was measured and marked with marks at 2 and 12&#x02005;m. The
person taking the measurement assured the safety of the subjects. The time taken by the
subjects to walk the 10&#x02005;m between the 2 and 12&#x02005;m marks was recorded<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>For the F8WT, distances of approximately 5 feet (1.5 m) and 4 feet (1.2 m) were measured.
Cones were placed at either end of this area, and the subjects stood in the center, facing
the front. The subjects chose the direction in which to walk and walked at a natural gait
speed when ready around the two cones, finally returning to the start position, thereby
drawing a figure-of-8. The parameters measured include speed (time to completion), number of
steps taken during the performance, accuracy (whether the subject deviated from the walking
direction), and continuity of walking<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The DGI test is comprised of 8 different gait tasks including walking on a level surface,
walking while changing gait speeds, walking with vertical or horizontal head turns, walking
with pivot turns, stepping over or around obstacles, and walking up and downstairs.
Subjects&#x02019; performance of each test item was rated on a 4-point scale (0&#x02212;3), with the total
score ranging between 0 and 24<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In the present study, the speed and number of steps were evaluated, whereas accuracy and
continuity of walking were not.</p><p>Single-task and dual-task gait trainings were conducted 30&#x02005;min per day, 3 days a week, for
a total of 4 weeks. The single-task gait training group performed gait training based on the
research of Silsupadol et al. and Silsupadol et al. with modified and supplemental methods
to meet the needs of stroke patients<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>. The dual-task walking group performed a
cognitive task concurrently with the single-task training program. While moving during
dual-task training, changes in priority are divided into fixed priority (FP) and variable
priority (VP). In the present study, VP conditions were applied so that participants had to
give the same priority to the 2 tasks.</p><p>Data analyses were performed using SPSS for Windows 17.0. Normal distribution of the data
was confirmed using the Shapiro-Wilk test. A repeated measures 2-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) was performed to compare changes in cognition and walking according to the 2 types
of exercise (dual-task training or single-task training) and the time points of each
training condition (pre-training, post-training, or follow-up). A multiple comparison post
hoc analysis was also performed using Bonferroni&#x02019;s multiple comparisons test. Statistical
significance was accepted for values of &#x003b1; &#x0003c; 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Twenty subjects participated in the study. The average age of the dual-task training (DT)

including a cognitive task component on cognitive function and walking ability of stroke
patients using functional evaluation tools.</p><p>The evaluation of cognitive function of stroke patients is important for the identification
of treatment strategies for functional recovery and their return to daily living<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The Stroop test was used to measure cognitive function in the present study. This test
simultaneously reflects reaction time (speed aspect) and accuracy. Here, the effect of
different performance levels among the subjects was minimized by specifying the reaction
time as the number of items performed within a given time. In addition, accuracy was
measured using the number of errors made.</p><p>Cognitive function increased with time, and differences were observed in the degree of
improvement in the Stroop test according to training group. The DT group displayed greater
improvement than the ST group, and these improved cognitive capacities were sustained at the
follow-up, which was performed 2 weeks after the end of the intervention.</p><p>Hiyamizu et al. divided 45 elderly subjects into dual-task and single-task training groups
and studied the effects of dual-task balance training on cognition and concurrent standing
postural control. Their results show that the dual-task group had significantly improved
performance compared to the single-task group in the Stroop test<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup>. That study also showed that balance training for the
elderly under dual-task conditions led to improvement in dual-task performance during
standing postural control.</p><p>Vasques et al. conducted a dual-task training combined with aerobic training for depressed
elderly subjects. Their data showed improvements in cognitive assessments, including the
Stroop test, which led them to suggest that dual-task training is a safe and useful approach
for cognitive function training<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Walking is the most basic means of human transport in daily life, and is the movement that
is most easily performed concurrently with other tasks, such as conversing with another
person or moving an object<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><sup>)</sup>. Hemiplegia
resulting from stroke has serious effects on an individual&#x02019;s walking ability. Even when
functional walking is possible, it is different from the walking of a healthy person.</p><p>Various capacities, including the maintenance of appropriate walking speed, endurance,
curved-path walking, and balance while walking, are required<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><sup>)</sup> for independent walking
in daily life.</p><p>Cho et al. studied the effects of lower extremity circuit training based on a task-oriented
training program on the walking ability of stroke patients, and proved that there were
significant improvements in straight-line and curved-line walking speed<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Seo et al. reported that 4 weeks of a dual-task training program with VP conditions
effectively improved the static balance, dynamic balance, and walking abilities of patients
with stroke-induced hemiplegia<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><sup>)</sup>. In
addition, Lee et al. found that the training group with VP conditions exhibited
statistically significant differences in TUG single and TUG double tasks compared with other
training groups. There was also a statistically significant difference in the dynamic gait
index (DGI) score<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In the present study, TUG was performed under single-task and dual-task conditions to
evaluate dynamic balance ability. In addition, the 10MWT, DGI, and the F8WT were used to
evaluate walking ability. Under single-task conditions, TUG gait speed increased with time
in both groups. In single-task conditions, TUG speed remained increased at 2 weeks after the
end of the intervention.</p><p>We observed that, under dual-task conditions, both training groups exhibited significant
increases in walking speed in the TUG and 10MWT with time. We think that the gait-training
program, which was performed identically by both training groups, influenced the
improvements of the DT group as well as those of the ST group. The pattern of change in DGI
was different between the two groups: the DT group showed higher increases in DGI than the
ST group.</p><p>There were no differences between the groups regarding improvements with time in the F8WT,
as measured by speed and number of steps. This result was likely due to inadequate
intervention in the gait-training program components that involve curved paths.</p><p>The present study was performed to investigate the effects of dual-task training with a
cognitive task component on cognition and walking of stroke patients. Dual-task training
improved cognition and walking ability. However, the sample size of our study was small;
therefore, we could not draw generalized conclusions from our results. Additional studies
with larger sample sizes will be required to validate our findings. The gait-training
program showed limited improvement in complex evaluation tasks requiring a sense of
direction, such as the F8WT. This may be attributable to the fact that the gait-training
program, selected as the intervention method, did not include a variety of training
components. Further research using a gait-training program with more diverse training
components would help to identify a broader rehabilitation strategy for clinical use.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Bahle</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Stroke prevention screening program</article-title>.
