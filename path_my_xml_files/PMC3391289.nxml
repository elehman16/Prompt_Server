The current study was undertaken in order to evaluate implications of 17&#x003b2;HSD14 in breast cancer, measuring 17&#x003b2;HSD14 protein expression in breast tumours.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>An antibody targeting the 17&#x003b2;HSD14 antigen was generated and validated using <italic>HSD17B14</italic>-transfected cells and a peptide-neutralising assay.

Of the 17&#x003b2;HSD enzymes described to date, type 1 has been ascribed most importance in breast cancer. Expression levels and activity of 17&#x003b2;HSD1, which reduces oestrone to oestradiol, is thought to be of relevance for the local elevation of oestradiol levels measured in tumours compared to plasma, observed in breast cancer, and indeed intratumoural levels of this enzyme have been shown to be of prognostic importance in breast cancer <xref rid="pone.0040568-Gunnarsson1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040568-Gunnarsson2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040568-Gunnarsson3" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040568-Oduwole1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. 17&#x003b2;HSD2, which was the second 17&#x003b2;HSD to be cloned and described, efficiently oxidises oestradiol to oestrone and has been shown to act as a protective factor in breast cancer <xref rid="pone.0040568-Oduwole1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. The present study focuses on the fourteenth member of the 17&#x003b2;HSD enzyme family, 17&#x003b2;HSD14. Relatively little is known about the function of this enzyme, however, similarly to 17&#x003b2;HSD2, it has been shown to oxidise oestradiol <xref rid="pone.0040568-Lukacik1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. In a previous study examining mRNA of <italic>HSD17B14</italic> in tumours from a Swedish breast cancer material, we found high expression levels of the <italic>HSD17B14</italic>-transcript to be associated with longer disease-free survival among breast cancer patients <xref rid="pone.0040568-Jansson1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Furthermore, breast cancer cells transiently over-expressing <italic>HSD17B14</italic> significantly lowered oestradiol levels compared to mock-transfected cells, suggesting a protective role of this enzyme in which 17&#x003b2;HSD14 may act by lowering intra-tumoural levels of oestradiol available for oestrogen receptor (ER) binding.</p><p>The non-steroidal anti-oestrogen tamoxifen has shown great efficacy both as adjuvant and neo-adjuvant treatment for breast cancer patients as a whole, however, not all patients benefit from the treatment. Several mechanisms, including the relative abundance of steroid-converting enzymes such as 17&#x003b2;HSDs, have been suggested as factors important for predicting tamoxifen treatment response <xref rid="pone.0040568-Jansson2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p><p>The aim of the current study was to further investigate and validate the concept of 17&#x003b2;HSD14 as a marker for improved clinical outcome in breast cancer.

At the time of diagnosis, all patients were postmenopausal and had lymph node-negative primary breast cancer with tumours of &#x02264;30 mm. Prior to randomization, 432 patients were treated with breast conserving surgery including axillary dissection plus radiation treatment of the breast (50 Gy/5 weeks), whereas the remaining 1 348 patients had a modified radical mastectomy. After surgery, the patients were randomised to tamoxifen treatment (40 mg daily) or no endocrine treatment. After two years of tamoxifen treatment, disease free patients were offered to participate in a trial comparing tamoxifen for an additional three years or no further therapy. The mean follow-up period for patients in the present investigation was 17 years. Loco-regional recurrence was defined as a relapse on the chest wall or in the ipsilateral regional nodes. Information about relapse was supplied by the responsible clinician to the trial centre. Among other deceased patients, follow-up data was collected from regional population registers and the Swedish Cause of Death Registry. A flow-chart of patients included in the initial tamoxifen trial and further included in the current analysis is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040568-g001">Fig. 1</xref>. The relatively large number of missing tumours is due to logistical and practical problems involved in the recruitment of tumour blocks from the participating trial centers.

Retrospective tumour analysis, including the current analysis, was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the Karolinska Institute (dnr 97&#x02013;451, with amendments). According the approval, informed consent from the patients was not required.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Tumour material</title><p>Samples from 912 patients were available for the present investigation. Sections from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumour samples collected at surgery were cut and stained with hematoxylin and eosin in order to identify morphologically representative areas. Three cylindrical core tissue specimens (diameter 0.8 mm) were taken (when possible) from each donor block and mounted in a recipient block, with a total amount of at most 243 cores per block. The tissue microarrays (TMAs) were constructed using a manual arrayer (Beecher Instruments, Sun Prairie, WI). TMA blocks were cut in 4 &#x000b5;m sections and mounted on frost-coated slides. ER and progesterone receptor (PR) status of the tumours was originally determined by isoelectric focusing with a cut-off level set to 0.05 fmol/&#x000b5;g DNA. Retrospectively, both ER and PR status of the tumours was examined with immunohistochemistry using the Ventana automated slide stainer (Ventana Medical Systems, Tucson, AZ). The antibodies employed were the monoclonal VentanaMedical Systems' CONFIRM mouse anti-ER primary antibody (clone 6F11) and the monoclonal Ventana Medical Systems' CONFIRM mouse anti-PR primary antibody (clone 16). Comparative analysis of the same tumour material has shown immunohistochemistry and cytosol analysis for the determination of ER-status to be equally effective at predicting long-term effect of adjuvant tamoxifen <xref rid="pone.0040568-Khoshnoud1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. In the present study, ER and PR status was derived from immunohistochemical analysis with cut-off levels set to 25&#x00025; of positively stained tumour cell nuclei. Cytosol measurements were used in cases of missing immunohistochemical data. Immunohistochemistry data on 17&#x003b2;HSD1 and 17&#x003b2;HSD2 expression was previously generated and described <xref rid="pone.0040568-Jansson2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Antibody production</title><p>The peptide sequence (NH2-)CKASRSTPVDAPDIP(-CONH2) corresponding to amino acids 255 to 269 of human 17&#x003b2;HSD14 with an additional terminal cystein residue for affinity purification purposes, was synthesised and sequenced by AgriSera (V&#x000e4;nn&#x000e4;s, Sweden). A breed of New Zeeland white rabbits/French lop received initial subcutaneous injections of 200 &#x000b5;g peptide dissolved in a buffer emulsified in Freunds Complete Adjuvant. Three booster injections were administered at 3 months interval; the first including 200 &#x000b5;g peptide and the two following 100 &#x000b5;g. Freunds Incomplete Adjuvant was used with the booster injections. The animals were finally bled one week after the last immunisation and were thereafter sacrificed by injection of an intravenous pentobarbital (Apoteket, Stockholm, Sweden). The anti-17&#x003b2;HSD14 antibody was affinity-purified on a column containing a peptide-coated gel matrix (Ultralink; Thermo Fischer Scientific, Waltham, MA). The preparation of the 17&#x003b2;HSD14 antibody was performed with permission given by the Swedish animal welfare authority (dnr A112-06).

The sections were thereafter treated in a decloaking buffer (Biocare Medical, Concord, CA) in a decloaking chamber to retrieve antigenicity. The temperature was allowed to reach 120&#x000b0;C at which the heat was turned off. The sections were left in the chamber until 90&#x000b0;C was reached and were thereafter removed from the chamber and allowed to cool to room temperature. To reduce non-specific staining, sections were immersed in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) supplemented with 0.1&#x00025; bovine serum albumin (BSA) and then incubated with a commercial protein blocking solution (Spring Bioscience, Pleasanton, CA) for 10 min. The tissue sections were incubated with the in-house polyclonal rabbit anti-human 17&#x003b2;HSD14 antibody diluted to 1&#x02236;1200 in antibody diluent (DakoCytomation, Glostrup, Denmark) at 4&#x000b0;C over night. After a washing step in PBS/BSA, sections were incubated with EnVision horseradish peroxidase conjugated anti-rabbit polymer (DakoCytomation) for 25 min. The immune reaction was visualised by incubating the samples in a solution containing 3,3-diaminobenzidine chromogen supplemented with hydrogen peroxide for eight min. Sections were briefly counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated in ascending concentrations of ethanol and finally mounted. A test for antibody specificity was performed by peptide neutralising assay. Pre-incubation of antibody and 17&#x003b2;HSD14-peptide was done for two hours in room temperature with peptide (10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup> M) and 17&#x003b2;HSD14 antibody (1&#x02236;600) at a molar ratio of 100&#x02236;1 in tris buffered saline with tween (TBST) without blocking reagent. Prior to TMA tissue incubation over night, the pre-incubation solution was added to an equal volume of TBST supplemented with blocking solution. The TMAs were investigated microscopically using a Leica LB30T microscope (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) by two independent investigators blinded to clinical data (TS and AJ) and scored as negative, weak, intermediate or strong. In cases where scoring results differed, a consensus score was reached after re-evaluation.

In the patient group with tumours expressing high levels of 17&#x003b2;HSD14, tamoxifen significantly reduced the number of local recurrences. Among patients with tumours expressing less 17&#x003b2;HSD14, tamoxifen treatment did not influence the local recurrence rates. It thus appears as though expression levels of 17&#x003b2;HSD14 can predict the benefit of tamoxifen in lowering the number of local recurrences. When analysing all patients receiving tamoxifen, high tumour expression of 17&#x003b2;HSD14 significantly lowered local recurrence rates, and the current study thus supports findings from our previous study in which <italic>HSD17B14</italic> transcripts were analysed in a different patient group, all receiving tamoxifen <xref rid="pone.0040568-Jansson1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. In that study, which comprised patients with larger tumours with lymph node involvement, higher <italic>HSD17B14</italic> levels were associated with improved clinical outcome.</p><p>The function of 17&#x003b2;HSD14 is not fully understood. We and others have shown that the enzyme oxidises potent oestradiol into less bioactive oestrone <xref rid="pone.0040568-Lukacik1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040568-Jansson1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Although ovarian oestrogen production ceases at menopause, the supply of oestrogens is maintained through local production from aromatisation of androgens <xref rid="pone.0040568-Lonning1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, and a high postmenopausal plasma oestradiol level is associated with a subsequent risk of developing breast cancer <xref rid="pone.0040568-Key1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. In malignant breast tissue, the tissue/plasma ratio is elevated compared with benign breast tissue <xref rid="pone.0040568-vanLandeghem1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, suggesting higher tumoural aromatase activity and/or higher reductive than oxidative 17&#x003b2;HSD activity. The role of oestrogens for breast cancer growth is evidenced by the success of anti-hormonal treatment regimens, e.g. selective estrogen receptor modulators such as tamoxifen, in improving clinical outcome in the disease. Although the overall benefit from tamoxifen in reducing the risk of breast cancer relapse is clear, with clinical trials demonstrating an approximate 50&#x00025; reduction in relapse for patients with ER&#x0002b; tumours <xref rid="pone.0040568-Rutqvist1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040568-Davies1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, a subset of patients fail to respond to the drug, either due to acquired resistance or to an intrinsic insensitivity to tamoxifen <xref rid="pone.0040568-Pasqualini1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. One of several proposed mechanisms underlying failure to respond to tamoxifen involve a situation in which excessive oestradiol levels cannot be counteracted by normal doses of tamoxifen. This scenario has been described in a murine model by Iino et al who demonstrated that, although tamoxifen inhibited the growth of MCF-7 tumours in athymic mice, the tamoxifen inhibitory effect on tumour growth could be partially reversed by increased oestradiol levels <xref rid="pone.0040568-Iino1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Indeed, a recent meta analysis by the Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group, reported a greater reduction in breast cancer recurrence in trials of higher daily tamoxifen doses when comparing 20, 30, and 40 mg per day <xref rid="pone.0040568-Davies1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. We found high tumoural expression levels of 17&#x003b2;HSD14 to be associated with better tamoxifen response in terms of risk of developing local recurrence, and it is plausible that the oestradiol lowering capacity of 17&#x003b2;HSD14 contributes to this finding.</p><p>17&#x003b2;HSD14 expression was correlated with expression levels of 17&#x003b2;HSD1 and 17&#x003b2;HSD2, two highly potent enzymes catalysing the reduction of oestrone and oxidation of oestradiol respectively, for which expression levels have been previously assessed in the current tumour material <xref rid="pone.0040568-Jansson2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Interestingly, in that study, high tumoural expression of 17&#x003b2;HSD2 as compared with 17&#x003b2;HSD1 was significantly beneficial for tamoxifen response when considering distant recurrence and breast cancer survival as endpoint, whereas it was not significant when considering local recurrence as endpoint <xref rid="pone.0040568-Jansson2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. In the current study, the situation was the opposite, with 17&#x003b2;HSD14 having an influence on local recurrence but no impact in predicting distant recurrence or breast cancer-specific survival. This discrepancy is rather surprising, as one would expect these enzymes to all influence the same pathways, namely steroid conversion. It thus seems likely that, although expression levels of 17&#x003b2;HSD1, 17&#x003b2;HSD2 and 17&#x003b2;HSD14 are correlated and possibly co-regulated, the role of 17&#x003b2;HSD14 is separated from that of 17HSD1 and 17&#x003b2;HSD2, with 17&#x003b2;HSD14 in addition to oestradiol, also acting upon other substrates. Indications for 17&#x003b2;HSD14 in local recurrence could implicate a role for the enzyme in interactions with the microenvironment. In a recent publication 17&#x003b2;HSD14 is shown to act immunomodulatory, affecting the levels of 5-androstenediol which in turn is shown to be a significant inducer of anti-inflammatory responses mediated by ER&#x003b2; in the central nervous system <xref rid="pone.0040568-Saijo1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Whether this role of 17&#x003b2;HSD14 is relevant in neoplasia remains to be elucidated.</p><p>In conclusion, we have shown that tumoural expression levels of 17&#x003b2;HSD14 can predict the outcome of adjuvant tamoxifen treatment in terms of local recurrence-free survival in patients with lymph node-negative ER&#x0002b; breast cancer. Although these results should be verified to confirm any clinical relevance, it is clear that a better understanding of the risk of local recurrence facilitate therapeutic decision making. The mechanism underlying effects related to 17&#x003b2;HSD14 remain elusive, however one might speculate that the enzyme lowers oestradiol levels and thereby enhances the anti-proliferative action of tamoxifen. In cases of low oestradiol oxidising enzymes such as 17&#x003b2;HSD14, more clinical benefit would likely be generated by alternative treatments such as enzyme inhibitors of e.g aromatase or inhibitors of reductive 17&#x003b2;HSD-enzymes. The association of 17&#x003b2;HSD14 with local relapse implies that the enzyme, in addition to oestradiol, works upon other steroid or non-steroid substrates, and that these factors have importance for interactions with the microenvironment.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Josefina Berntsson for her involvement in the immunohistochemical staining of the tumour material.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Competing Interests: </bold>The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding: </bold>The study was supported by grants from the Swedish Cancer Society, Swedish Research Council (K2008-54X-20639-01-3), Olle Engkvist Byggm&#x000e4;stare Foundation, The Cancer and Allergy Foundation and Percy Falk's Foundation.
