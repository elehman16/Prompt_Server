The infant can &#x02018;signal&#x02019; his needs through vocalisation, and the mother can respond by allowing or restricting nipple access, which might alter the breast milk composition or volume. This may lead to parent-offspring conflict during the lactation period. Challenging infant behaviour has also been associated with maternal psychological distress, which might affect breastfeeding performance. Most attempts to improve breastfeeding rates focus on providing additional support, yet many aspects of the breastfeeding process are poorly understood. Thus, our objective is to investigate mother-infant signalling during breastfeeding by manipulating maternal psychological state using a relaxation therapy intervention. The study will test the hypothesis that mothers who listen to the therapy will be more relaxed/less stressed and this will favourably alter breast milk composition and/or affect milk volume and hence influence infant outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par3">A randomised controlled trial will be conducted in first-time breastfeeding mothers and their new-born infants. Pregnant mothers will be recruited at antenatal clinics in Selangor, Malaysia, and four home visits will be carried out at 2, 6, 12 and 14&#x000a0;weeks postnatally. Participants will be randomised into a control and an intervention group in the early post-partum period. Mothers from the intervention group will be asked to listen daily to an audio recording with relaxation therapy during breastfeeding. Maternal psychological state, breastfeeding practices and infant behaviour will be assessed using validated questionnaires. Milk volume will be measured using stable isotopes. Breast milk samples will be collected to measure macronutrient content and hormone levels. Anthropometric measurements (weight, length and head circumference) will be performed during all home visits, including body composition at week 14.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par4">The main outcomes will be the effect of the intervention on maternal psychological state, milk production, cortisol levels, and infant behaviour and growth. Secondary outcomes will be associations between breast milk composition and infant appetite and growth.

The factors involved in mother-infant signalling in early infancy can be broadly categorised as psychosocial or physiological. The psychosocial aspects such as physical contact, maternal psychological state and infant behaviour occur in all mother-infant pairs, regardless of their feeding method. However, physiological mechanisms are unique to breastfed infants and their mothers because during breastfeeding, milk synthesis and milk composition do not solely reflect maternal physiological and psychological processes. Breastfeeding also represents a complex physiological and behavioural negotiation between the mother and the offspring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. For example, the infant can &#x02018;signal&#x02019; his needs through vocalisation or non-nutritive suckling, and the mother can respond by allowing/restricting nipple access, hence down- or up-regulating milk synthesis and affecting milk volume. She can also alter the breast milk composition resulting in different concentrations of macronutrients or bioactive factors. This may result in a competition for energy between a mother and her infant during the lactation period, which is described as parent-offspring conflict. Thus, breastfeeding should not be regarded as a one-way communication or an inevitably harmonious cooperation between the mother and the infant, but rather as a dynamic process which involves complex psychosocial and physiological signalling between both parties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p id="Par21">This relationship between infant behaviour and maternal response in terms of breastfeeding behaviour or the composition of milk, particularly bioactive factors (e.g. hormones) in breast milk, is largely unexplored in humans. Moreover, all of these factors are complex and inter-related. Therefore, there is a need for research to explore the non-nutrient components in breast milk that may act as messengers in breastfed infants, potentially affecting the infant&#x02019;s behaviour and metabolic regulation. For example, infant behaviour and temperament in early life may be affected by the concentrations of certain hormones or endogenous opiates such as cortisol and endorphins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Naturally occurring opiate substances in breast milk such as &#x000df;-casomorphins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] may act as sedatives, and hence blunt or lower infant appetite, whereas ghrelin and leptin may influence feeding behaviour (affecting appetite and satiety) and are suggested to be major factors involved in metabolic regulation in breastfed infants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Therefore, studies have hypothesised that mothers have the potential to shape infant behaviour in early life by the transmission of biologically active compounds including cortisol in milk during breastfeeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Other studies also suggest that breast milk hormones may influence infant appetite and feeding pattern, which can influence growth and body composition in early and later life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Therefore, to address this, as part of this trial, we will investigate breast milk hormones (cortisol, ghrelin and leptin concentrations) in relation to infant behaviour and growth in early infancy.</p><p id="Par22">Although there are many interesting and unexplored issues in the signalling between mother and infant during breastfeeding, the complexity of the inter-relationships between factors makes it problematic to define cause and effect using an observational study design. Thus, many aspects of the breastfeeding process remain poorly understood, and most attempts to improve breastfeeding rates mainly focus on providing additional support, for example improving maternity leave or providing BF support via groups and organisations, rather than on understanding maternal and infant factors in early life. Therefore, to explore these factors in early human life, we plan to use an experimental approach to investigate causal relationships between maternal psychological state, manipulated using a randomised relaxation intervention, and breast milk volume and composition and infant behaviour and growth. We hypothesise that maternal psychological state is associated with breast milk production which will have consequent effects on infant feeding behaviour and growth. This is because emotional distress in mothers has been reported to inhibit the let-down reflex leading to disruption of milk flow and reduced milk volume [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Conversely, milk ejection can be improved by relaxation therapy, as demonstrated in previous studies using relaxation techniques such as guided-imagery and music therapy. Randomised studies in mothers of premature infants found that mothers who listened to guided relaxation/imagery recordings (as a relaxation therapy) produced significantly more milk than control groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], but to our knowledge this type of intervention has not been formally tested in mothers who are breastfeeding their healthy term infant, and none of the previous studies investigate the consequent effects on infant outcomes.</p><p id="Par23">In summary, this study aims to investigate the signalling between mother and infant in early life, using an experimental approach to determine causal relationships between maternal psychological state and milk intake, milk cortisol levels, and the consequences for infant behaviour and growth. Other mother-infant factors such as changes in milk leptin, ghrelin and macronutrient concentrations within a feed, infant appetite and temperament will be studied as secondary outcome measures. The results may identify modifiable factors which can be used to encourage and support breastfeeding, including increasing breastfeeding rates. The study, named the Mother-Offspring Milk (MOM) Study, is intended to fill current research gaps by investigating both psychological and physiological mother-infant factors during breastfeeding and by using a more robust methodological design. This manuscript describes the rationale and design of the MOM Study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par24">This is a randomised controlled trial that involves first-time healthy breastfeeding (BF) mothers and their full-term infants (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;64 mother-infant dyads).

Randomisation will be stratified by ethnicity: Malay or Bumiputera, Chinese and Indian. Mothers will not be informed about this process as doing so will most likely influence their behaviour. Thus, the mothers will be blinded to the randomisation process in order to prevent the mothers in the control group from seeking or using some form of relaxation therapy, if the possibility of it being beneficial has been raised. However, they will be informed that the MOM Study is investigating the effects of maternal mood as well as infant factors on breastfeeding at a general level. The randomisation schedule will be generated by computer in randomised blocks of permuted length (2,4,6). Assignments will be prepared by a member of the research team in London who does not have contact with the subjects and assignments will be held in sealed opaque envelopes. Each assignment will be revealed by the researcher on the day, just before the first home visit, in order to prepare the intervention materials including the diary log specifically for mothers in the intervention group. There will be a low possibility of contamination between randomised groups since home visit sessions will be performed over a large geographical area in the central region of Malaysia. Therefore, the mothers in the intervention group will not be likely to have the opportunity to reveal the existence of the intervention tool to mothers in the control group.

Thus, overall, the findings showed that the majority of participants in the pilot study had a good perception of the therapy, and it appeared to produce the expected effects on their emotions and feelings. A minor amendment to the voice and content of the Malay-version of the therapy was done to improve the recording based on feedback from the pilot study.

Data will be recorded initially in Excel datasheets and later exported to SPSS. All questionnaires and anthropometric data will be analysed using IBM SPSS (version 23). Normality of continuous data will be assessed by Q-Q Plot, histogram and will also be tested by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test. The main analysis will be an intention-to-treat analysis comparing the difference between groups in the final outcome adjusted for the baseline value where data are available using independent t-tests. Independent t-test and repeated measures will be used to examine changes in milk intake and other milk components including cortisol levels between groups and between time points respectively as secondary analyses. For the secondary outcomes, associations between infant temperament/behaviour and milk volume, milk composition, infant growth and body composition will be examined using univariate analyses. Correlation and regression analysis/MANOVA will then be used to adjust for confounding factors. Interaction terms will be introduced where appropriate, especially in the multivariate analysis.

This method takes into account the baseline weight (HV1) in calculating the change from baseline to an endpoint or increase in weight between two-points of measurements.

During this period, the mother and her infant will be taken care of either by their family members, particularly the infant&#x02019;s grandmother, or by a confinement lady who will be paid to stay overnight with the mother or come to the house on a daily basis. The caretaker will usually prepare meals for breakfast, lunch and dinner following the cultural confinement diet for the mothers, and will also perform special postpartum traditional massage on the mother, especially during the first 3&#x000a0;weeks of the postnatal period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The caretaker will also help to take care of the infant by changing the nappy, bathing or holding the infant when necessary. This is because the mother is encouraged to minimise physical activity and have ample rest to recover from the birth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. This confinement practice should facilitate the trial since all mothers in the study will receive similar care.</p><p id="Par94">The composition of human milk varies across lactation, and between and within individuals diurnally and across a single feeding. Thus, milk sampling is an important issue, as there is a lack of consistency in sample collection in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. One possible explanation for the inconsistent findings between published studies is the different methods used for sample collection (e.g. single spot sample or pooled milk sampling), as well as a lack of standardisation of timing with respect to both time of day or stage of lactation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. This is especially important when measuring milk energy density in breast milk, as the changing fat content between fore- and hindmilk affects the total energy content. Presumably, this will also influence the content of other fat-soluble substances in breast milk, such as fat-soluble vitamins or other bioactive substances. To date, there is no universal sampling protocol or gold standard method for human milk sampling since there are various ethical aspects to be considered as well as limitations of the population and conditions in the field [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Thus, comparing data from different studies is challenging and problematic, especially for data that are based on a single milk sample collection. Hence, in this trial, fore- and hindmilk will be collected at 3 different time points and the milk sampling protocol will be standardised in terms of time and sampling method in order to minimise the variability. Moreover, unstandardized sample collection methods and different times for sampling may lead to unrepresentative samples being used during analysis. Therefore, in this trial, the isotope method will be used to estimate milk intake over a period of 14&#x000a0;days, which has the advantage of being physiological (ie. suckled breast milk), non-invasive (since it does not interfere with the breastfeeding process), and suited to free-living infants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p><p id="Par95">In summary, the experimental design of this study aims to show causal relationships between maternal psychological state and infant behaviour and growth, which may be mediated through breast milk composition and/or volume. By investigating the mechanisms of biological and behavioural signalling during early human life, this project aims to provide a greater understanding of maternal-infant factors which influence BF outcomes. This may in turn allow identification of modifiable factors that can be useful targets for future interventions to increase breastfeeding duration.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>BAI</term><def><p id="Par7">Beck Anxiety Inventory</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BEBQ</term><def><p id="Par8">Baby Eating Behaviour Questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BF</term><def><p id="Par9">Breastfeeding</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EDD</term><def><p id="Par10">Estimated delivery date</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ELISA</term><def><p id="Par11">enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EPDS</term><def><p id="Par12">Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HV</term><def><p id="Par13">Home visit</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IFQ</term><def><p id="Par14">Infant Feeding Questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IIFAS</term><def><p id="Par15">Iowa Infant Feeding Attitude Scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MANOVA</term><def><p id="Par16">Multivariate analysis of variance</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MOMS</term><def><p id="Par17">Mother-Offspring Milk study</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PSS</term><def><p id="Par18">Perceived Stress Scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RIBQ</term><def><p id="Par19">Revised-Rothbart&#x02019;s Infant Behaviour Questionnaire</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank Philips Avent UK and Malaysia for donating breast pumps and mp3 players for the trial, the Ministry of Health Malaysia for allowing the recruitment to be carried out at the selected government antenatal clinics in Selangor, the nurses who are involved in assisting with the recruitment of participants (especially nurses from Bandar Baru Bangi and Kajang antenatal clinics), and Dr. M.
