Therefore, in the present study a simple, rapid and yet sensitive HPLC method with UV detection was developed and validated for quantitation of imipramine in human plasma samples. An efficient liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) of imipramine from plasma with the mixture of hexane/isoamyl alcohol (98:2) and back extraction of the drug in acidic medium concomitant with evaporation of organic phase allowed the use of UV detector to conveniently measure plasma levels of this compound as low level as 3 ng/ml. Separation was achieved on a &#x003bc;-Bondapak C<sub>18</sub> HPLC column using sodium hydrogen phosphate solution (0.01 M)/acetonitrile (60/40 v/v) at pH 3.5 &#x000b1; 0.1 at 1.5 ml/min. Trimipramine was used as the internal standard for analysis of plasma samples. The retention times for imipramine and trimipramine were 4.3 and 5.2 min, respectively. Calibration curve was linear in the range of 3-40 ng/ml using human plasma with the average extraction recovery of 85 &#x000b1; 5%. Imipramine was found to be stable in plasma samples with no evidence of degradation during three freeze-thaw cycles and three months storage at -70&#x000b0;C. The current validated method was finally applied in bioequivalence studies of two different imipramine products according to a standard two-way crossover design with a two weeks washout period.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>HPLC</kwd><kwd>Imipramine</kwd><kwd>Human plasma</kwd><kwd>Bioequivalence study</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) drugs have commonly been used to treat endogenous depression, panic attacks, phobic states, neuropathic pain and pediatric enuresis (<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). The antidepressant effects of TCA drugs are largely due to their ability to inhibit prejunctional re-uptake of norepinephrine and serotonin (<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Imipramine is one of the most widely used of this class which is metabolized in the body to desipramine with more potent inhibitory effect of norepinephrine (<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Imipramine with low molecular weight is very liposoluble, readily and completely absorbed from gastrointestinal tract with the peak levels occurring at 2-3 h after oral administration. The majority of the dose of the drug is excreted in the urine mainly as metabolite and plasma half-life is 8-20 h (<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Different analytical methods have been reported in the literature for the assay of imipramine in biological fluids including spectrofluorimetry (<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), isotope-derivative dilution analysis (<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), gas-liquid chromatography (<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). In recent years, HPLC has been frequently used for the determination of imipramine in biological fluids with either ultraviolet (UV) (<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), fluorescence (<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), electrochemical (<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), diode-array (<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) or mass spectrometry (MS) detection (<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). None of the HPLC methods employing ultraviolet (UV) detector were sufficiently sensitive to measure the low plasma concentrations following single oral dose of the drug. Fluorescence and MS detections have provided the most sensitive means of measuring plasma levels of imipramine and its major metabolites, desipramine. However, both procedures involve expensive equipment which are not affordable at most laboratories. In the present method, an efficient liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) of imipramine from plasma allowed the use of UV detector to conveniently measure plasma levels of this compound and extend the sensitivity of the assay to 3 ng/ml.</p><p>Many different clean up procedures have been reported so far to recover imipramine from plasma samples including protein precipitation (<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), solid phase extraction (<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), and LLE (<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Although some studies have been performed with regard to HPLC determination of imipramine in plasma after LLE, none of them are appropriately developed and validated to be entirely applicable and reproducible to the pharmacokinetic studies of this drug. Chen and coworkers (<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) proposed an HPLC method for determination of imipramine in plasma and urine samples using LLE and UV detection. The calibration curve was linear in the range of 20-500 ng/ml and the method was not validated according to the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guidelines. In some other similar studies after LLE of plasma samples, the limit of quantitation (LOQs) of imipramine was reported to be between 15 to 40 ng/ml (<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). The quantification limits in the aforementioned studies is not sufficiently low to characterize precisely the drug plasma profiles especially at later time points after oral administration of the drug where the concentration of imipramine is quite low. In the current study, it was of interest to us to develop a reliable HPLC method using UV detection and LLE for determination of imipramine in human plasma in the range of 3-40 ng/ml. The described method does not utilize fluorescent detection and yet more sensitive, making the method rapid, simple and appropriate for pharmacokinetic and bioequivalence studies of this drug. This method was validated for its accuracy, precision, limit of detection (LOD), LOQ, robustness and stability as per ICH guidelines.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title/><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Chemicals and reagents</title><p>Imipramine, trimipramine, clomipramine, verapamil, and nortriptiline were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co.

A literature survey indicated that studies on HPLC measurement of imipramine in biological samples following LLE with UV detector are scarce and the quantification limits have not been sufficiently low to precisely characterize the drug plasma profiles (<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).</p><p>The inherent fluorescence of imipramine allowed the use of sensitive fluorescence detector with HPLC to measure plasma levels of this drug (<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Although, the methods described in these reports are sufficiently sensitive and accurate for the measurement of imipramine and indicated short chromatographic run time, they require extremely pure solvents and are not readily available and affordable at most laboratories. The very low quantification limit of 3 ng/ml obtained in the current study is less than that of most previous reports even when fluorescence detection was used which allowed us to avoid using fluorometric detection. UV detection produces more reproducible responses in comparison with fluorescence detectors. Another advantage of the method developed in the present study is efficient LLE of the drug from plasma which renders the method more convenient and faster for pharmacokinetic and bioequivalence studies of imipramine. Although mild acidic solution was finally injected in to the injection port, it did not seem to cause any problem to the column or injection port. The method described in this report has been used for two years in a research setting. Several hundred injections have been made on a single column with no effect on column durability or HPLC injection port. The use of guard column greatly extends the analytical column life. Among different extracting solvents examined, only the mixture of hexane/isoamyl alcohol (98:2 <italic>v/v</italic>) resulted in excellent recoveries around 85% for the drug. In order to achieve highest resolution under isocratic condition, the mixtures of methanol and/or acetonitrile with sodium hydrogen phosphate solution with various combinations were assessed as mobile phase. Binary mixture of phosphate solution/acetonitrile in proportion of 60/40 (<italic>v/v</italic>) proved to be the most effective combination as evidenced by more efficient resolution devoid of any tailing. In some previous works (<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) the gradient mode was used to resolve imipramine peak from internal standard peak, in which composition of mobile phase should be changed throughout the run. However, gradient method is more complex technique and is not sufficiently reproducible compared to isocratic method. The HPLC assay developed in the current study was successfully used in pharmacokinetics and bioequivalence studies of imipramine tablets. Based on estimated pharmacokinetic parameters and statistical analyses, it was found that imipramine tablets manufactured by Lorestan company is bioequivalent to Tofranil<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, manufactured by Novartis company, and that both products can be considered equally effective in medical practice. The estimated pharmacokinetic parameters found to be in accordance with previous reports.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The present investigation describes a simple, sensitive and selective HPLC method for analyses of imipramine in plasma samples with LLE and UV detection. The mixture of hexane/isoamyl alcohol as extracting solvent gave excellent recovery for the drug. The method was validated and met the requirements of linearity, recovery, accuracy, precision, and robustness. This analytical procedure could readily be applied to routine analysis of plasma samples for bioavailability and pharmacokinetic studies of imipramine in
