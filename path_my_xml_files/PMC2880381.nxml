Latanoprost 0.005% is more effective than timolol maleate 0.5% in reducing diurnal IOP fluctuations. This is clinically important because optic nerve damage is accelerated by IOP fluctuations.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT5">5</xref> However, both drugs are expensive and there is poor compliance with long-term use in Nigerian patients.

All newly diagnosed adult subjects with bilateral open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension were eligible to participate. The research dose assessor, clinical assessors, subjects and ophthalmic surgeons were masked to the allocation of medication and treatment groups. This study complied with the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki and was conducted in accordance with the ethical standards of Institutional Ethical Review Committee at each investigational centre. Written informed consent was obtained from all study participants. The Pharmacy Council of Nigeria approved and registered <italic>G.

Randomization occurred in blocks of two using computer generated random numbers (Excel 5.0, Microsoft Corp., Redmond, Wa., USA). The subjects were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either timolol maleate 0.5% [Group 1] or <italic>Garcinia kola</italic> 0.5% aqueous solution eye drops [Group 2], twice daily (bid), for a period of 24 weeks.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Inclusion and exclusion criteria</title><p>Patients were eligible if they were at least 18 years old and diagnosed with either POAG or OH based on an average IOP of greater than 21 mmHg consistently for six weeks without treatment. In the POAG group, there were demonstrable typical glaucomatous visual field defects (nasal step, arcuate, para-central, or Seidel's scotoma) detectable by automated threshold perimetry and glaucomatous optic nerve head cupping in the presence of open normal appearing angles. The OH group had no optic nerve or visual field defects.</p><p>Patients were excluded if they had any other ocular disease, any systemic disease, were currently using eye medications, had a contraindication to <italic>Garcinia kola</italic>, beta blockers or to any of the components of the medications.

In cases where both eyes fulfilled all inclusion criteria, the eye designated the study eye was the one with higher IOP. Both eyes were treated with the same medication in patients with simultaneous bilateral involvement. The clinicians and researchers reconciled the subject outcome data. In cases where data and results could not be reconciled, the patient was excluded from data analysis.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Study masking procedure</title><p>At each study center, a consultant ophthalmologist who was not part of the study group performed the initial clinical evaluation of prospective subjects.

The nurse was masked to medications in the study and the allocation of individuals to the different groups. At each center, a senior registrar in ophthalmology who was not part of the research group measured IOP, visual acuity, central visual field and performed clinical evaluations. All measurements were standardized across study centers as described below.</p><p>Control and research medications were instilled at 6 am and 6 pm daily. Clinicians and subjects were masked to the type of topical medication being instilled into the eye. Clinicians and subjects were masked to the block size until after completion of the study. Subjects were treated for six months with regular follow-up at 2 weeks, 6, 12 and 24 weeks.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Study subject evaluation</title><p>To ensure adequate compliance and adherence to study protocol, each subject was given a drug diary for marking the dosage of each medication. The diary and the marked drug containers were inspected at every follow-up visit.</p><p>Goldman applanation tonometry was performed 9 am, 12 pm and 3 pm at the baseline visit, week 6, week 12 and week 24 visits. All subjects underwent visual acuity, gonioscopy and funduscopy (direct and indirect) at each visit. The central visual field was measured in each subject using the AP-125 Kowa full threshold 30-2 visual field analyzer (Kowa Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) at all centers. Each patient had two baseline visual fields performed within 1 month. The central visual field was repeated at 3/12 and 6/12 and subsequently at one year intervals.</p><p>During follow-up visits, some of the participants voluntarily commented about possible side effects of the topical medication they were allocated. The clinical evaluators also verbally enquired about possible side effects. All volunteered and elicited reports of adverse events were documented.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Safety</title><p>The subjects who received at least one dose of the study medications were assessed for their safety. Tolerability evaluations consisted of clinical laboratory testing such as hepatic (aminotransferase activities) and renal (serum creatinine) functions, adverse events, and physical examinations. Adverse events reported by the patient or observed by the investigator during clinical evaluation were documented. In addition, patients were questioned at each visit regarding the occurrence of adverse events using a nonspecific question. Safety was assessed by measurement of visual acuity, slit-lamp biomicroscopy, and adverse event reports. Patients could choose to withdraw from the study at any time. If patients were lost to follow-up during the study, data were included for analysis up to the last visit date. Investigators rated the intensity of adverse events and their subjective assessment of the relationship to study medications while masked to the treatment group. Adverse events were significant if they were severe enough to lead to subject withdrawal from the study.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-7"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>The target sample size of 176 participants (88 participants per group) was determined by assuming that a standard deviation of 3.2 mmHg would provide 90% power and a difference of 1.5 mmHg or 80% power such that a difference of 1.25 mmHg could be excluded between groups.</p><p>All analyses were performed with the intention to treat a cohort, defined as all patients who took at least one dose of a study medication. Data were analyzed by using Statistic Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 15.0 for windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Ill, USA). The comparability of patients in the two groups was determined from the demographic data and baseline IOP. A paired <italic>t</italic>-test was used for parametric comparison of the means.

Additionally the outcomes confirm the efficacy of timolol among Nigerians with POAG and OH. Timolol and <italic>G</italic>. <italic>kola</italic> aqueous eye drops were effective in the reduction of IOP at 6, 12 and 24 weeks. <italic>G</italic>. <italic>kola</italic> had a significant IOP lowering effect at 12 weeks compared to timolol. Chromatography has established that <italic>G</italic>. <italic>kola</italic> extracts have similar features to some commonly used glaucoma medications.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT17">17</xref></p><p>In the <italic>G</italic>. <italic>kola</italic> group, IOP reduction from baseline to the 6<sup>th</sup> week was approximately 24% and 25% in the timolol-treated eyes. The mean IOP reduction at 6 months in the <italic>G</italic>. <italic>Kola</italic> group and timolol-treated eyes was 47.8% and 48.2%, respectively with no statistically significant difference between groups (<italic>P &#x0003e;</italic>0.05). The significantly greater IOP lowering effect after six weeks of treatment was due to poor drug compliance initially in the majority of subjects. Most subjects exhausted their assigned drug earlier than expected and stopped further treatment a few days prior to the upcoming follow up. Hence the IOP reduction was minimal six weeks into the study compared to subsequent visits. Furthermore, subjects did not contact the study coordinator for additional medication because they felt that the treatment had no effect. However, were counseled on the importance of continuing medication regardless of their perceptions for the duration of the study and there was better compliance from 6 weeks onwards.</p><p>The efficacy reported in the current study is better than the previous reports which examine different IOP lowering medications. For example, randomized, double-masked clinical trials in patients with POAG or OH reported mean IOP reduction of 31% in latanoprost-treated group and 26% in timolol-treated patients over six months.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT20">20</xref> This is somewhat lower than the 47.8% and 48.2% reduction seen in Groups 1 and 2 respectively. One possible explanation for this difference is that the subjects in the current study were newly diagnosed and had not undergone medical therapy for glaucoma previously. Therefore, drug resistance, adaptation and possible tolerance to the control and <italic>G</italic>. <italic>kola</italic> eye drops were not encountered compared to patients with a history prolonged use of topical medications.</p><p>The IOP lowering effect <italic>G</italic>.<italic>kola</italic> 0.5% aqueous eye drops over a two-week period has been previously demonstrated in animal studies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT13">13</xref> A study of guinea pigs, rabbits, sheep and dogs reported a decrease in IOP of normal eyes ranging from 62.9% to 76.2%.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT13">13</xref></p><p>The use of ocular hypotensive medications has been associated with various adverse events in routine practice.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT23">23</xref> Systemic side effects such as headaches, cough and allergy can occur in some patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT29">29</xref> We monitored the safety of treatment through diverse sources of information.
