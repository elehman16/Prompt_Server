In Sri-Lankan traditional system of medicine, <italic>Chandra Kalka</italic> with <italic>Mahadalu Anupanaya</italic> are used successfully in the management of early stage of <italic>Pakshaghata</italic> and mentioned in <italic>Vatika Prakaranaya</italic>, a book on traditional medicine. So far, no scientific studies have been performed to evaluate the efficacy of <italic>Chandra Kalka</italic> with <italic>Mahadalu Anupanaya</italic>. This study was conducted at Kurunegala Ayurvedic Base Hospital, Sri-Lanka. Thirty patients were selected and randomly divided into two groups. The first group consisted of twenty five patients and treated with one pill of (250 mg) <italic>Chandra Kalka</italic> with 40 ml of <italic>Mahadalu Anupanaya</italic> three times a day for fourteen days as an internal therapy. Second group consisted of five patients who were treated with placebo in single blind method. The response to the treatment was recorded and therapeutic effect was evaluated through symptomatic relief of the patients. In the group of patients treated with the above drugs, statistically significant reduction was observed in symptoms such as slurring of speech, swallowing difficulties, fasciculation of tongue, and mouth deviation. In view of this observation and results obtained in this study, it is concluded that the above drug is a very effective traditional preparation that could be used in early stage of management of <italic>Pakshaghata</italic>, providing speedily and positive effects with a powerful action in controlling symptoms of <italic>Pakshaghata</italic>.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Hemiplegia</kwd><kwd><italic>Mahadalu anupanaya</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Chandra Kalka</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Pakshaghata</italic></kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The term <italic>Pakshaghata</italic> literally means paralysis of one half of the body where &#x0201c;<italic>paksha</italic>&#x0201d; denotes the right half of the body or the left half of the body and &#x0201c;<italic>Aghata</italic>&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;paralysis&#x0201d; denotes the impairment of <italic>Karmendriya, Gyanendriyas</italic> and <italic>Manas</italic>.</p><p><italic>Gyanendriyas</italic> are considered as part of the <italic>Sangnavaha srotas</italic> (sensory system) and <italic>Karmendriya</italic> are considered as part of the <italic>Cheshtavaha srotas</italic> (motor system) and <italic>Manas</italic> is supposed to control and guide the both, <italic>Gyanendriya</italic> and <italic>Karmendriyas</italic>. <italic>Pakshaghata</italic> is a <italic>Vatavyadhi</italic> of <italic>Nanatmaja</italic> variety according to <italic>Charaka</italic>,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] but <italic>Acharya Sushruta</italic> categorized <italic>Pakshaghata</italic> under <italic>Mahavatavyadhi</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] <italic>Vata Dosha</italic> gets vitiated due to the indulgence of various diet and regimen then <italic>Dosha</italic> would accumulate in <italic>Rikta Srotas</italic> (vacant channels) in the body and produces <italic>Pakshaghata</italic>.

According to the modern medicine, hemiplegia is a disease with paralysis of one side of the body. The term &#x0201c;hemiplegia&#x0201d; consists of two words &#x0201c;hemi&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;plege&#x0201d;. &#x0201c;Hemi&#x0201d; means half and &#x0201c;plege&#x0201d; means a blow, or stroke. Paralysis or palsy literally means to relax, implies a total or partial loss of either motion or sensation or of both in one or more or all parts of the body and also palsy is defined as loss or impairment of voluntary muscular power. Clinical features are described as slurring of speech, mouth deviation, fasciculation of the tongue, swallowing difficulties, abnormal reflexes, and weakness of muscles.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>]</p><p>Traditional physicians of Sri-Lanka use <italic>Chandra Kalka</italic> with <italic>Mahadalu Anupanaya</italic> which describes management of early stage of <italic>Pakshaghata</italic> to purify vitiated <italic>Dosha</italic> and expel vitiated <italic>Dosha</italic> accumulated in <italic>Srotas</italic>. <italic>Chandra Kalka</italic> with <italic>Mahadalu Anupanaya</italic> is one of the traditional treatments used by traditional physicians with success[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] (hemiplega).</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Aims and objectives</title><p>In management of <italic>Pakshaghata</italic>, traditional physicians of Sri-Lanka use <italic>Chandra Kalka</italic> with <italic>Mahadalu Anupanaya</italic> success.
