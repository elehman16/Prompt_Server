These include the lack of a biological finding in the majority of cases, high rates of latent psychiatric morbidity as well as the reluctance on the part of patients to accept psychiatric referrals, and normalizing explanations offered by the clinician.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] While many of these patients may carry rigid, inflexible attitudes about the nature of their symptoms, it is also true that the majority of sufferers are willing to accept more than one explanation for their symptom, thus presenting significant treatment opportunities for clinicians.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Growing evidence suggests that multipronged treatment strategies including assimilation of principles from cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) may yield significant treatment gains in MUS.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] A 10-session CBT-based model for managing MUS has been proposed for application in liaison psychiatric settings that emphasizes the practical management of symptoms as opposed to causal discussions.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Numerous studies, mostly from the west, have shown the value of CBT and reattribution techniques in managing MUS[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] but the optimal duration and components of therapy have varied from setting to setting. In this context, it is important to note that Sumathipala <italic>et al</italic>. have published a negative study carried out in an Asian setting, wherein, the authors found that six sessions of CBT work were no more efficacious than structured care for MUS.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] This raises interesting questions on cultural background as a determinant of response to CBT in MUS. Guided muscular relaxation therapies have also been widely studied and found to be effective in a variety of settings and syndromes involving MUS.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Its positive evidence base, simple yet tangible nature makes it an attractive candidate for inclusion in trials involving behavior modification particularly in low-resource setting.</p><p>Against this background, the present study was designed to test the efficacy of add-on single session counseling (SSC), which combines the principles of CBT with guided muscular relaxation, for Indian patients with MUS as compared to treatment as usual (TAU). Specifically, we tested the hypothesis that the proposed SSC intervention would be efficacious in reducing (i) as primary outcome &#x02013; somatic symptom severity over the 1-month follow-up period and (ii) as secondary outcomes &#x02013; anxiety and depressive symptoms, number of workdays lost, and number of hospital visits made during the follow-up period. Comparisons of efficacy were made against a psychoeducational control group.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study design and setting</title><p>This was a randomized controlled trial (RCT) carried out in the specialty psychosomatic outpatient clinic at a Government Medical College located in Puducherry, South India, from June 2015 to June 2016. The clinic team includes a consultant psychiatrist, senior resident (qualified psychiatrist), junior resident (postgraduate trainee), a clinical psychologist, and psychiatric social worker. After detailed evaluation of a case by junior resident and discussion with the consultant, a psychiatric diagnosis is allotted as per International Classification of Diseases-10, clinical descriptions, and diagnostic guidelines.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Subsequently, a detailed management plan is formulated which includes both pharmacological and psychosocial treatment options.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Subjects and methods</title><p>Inclusion criteria for participants in the present study included participants aged 18 years or older, presence of single/multiple physical symptoms for at least 3-month duration, and basic/ordered investigations within normal limits following which the symptoms are deemed to be medically unexplained by the treating physician. Patients not having proper referral letters from physicians were excluded as were those above the age of 65 to avoid spurious cases. Other exclusion criteria included Mini-Mental State Examination score &#x0003c;23,[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] presence of psychotic symptoms, intellectual/hearing or language impairment, and pregnant women or those who have delivered in the last 1 year. Consecutive patients satisfying these criteria were prospectively screened and randomized into one of the two study arms: SSC intervention arm or TAU control arm. The randomization was done using computer-generated random numbers and allocation concealment using sequentially numbered opaque sealed envelopes. The random number sequence was generated and maintained by one of the investigators (VM) not involved directly in patient recruitment or assignment. A total of 84 participants were assessed for eligibility. Of these, 71 were found to be eligible for recruitment and were randomly assigned to either the intervention group (<italic>n</italic> = 41) or TAU control arm (<italic>n</italic> = 35) [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>].

</p><p>The intervention sessions were administered by a single qualified psychiatrist (BS). In addition, both groups received standard care that included appropriate pharmacotherapy for symptoms as indicated. The control group (TAU) received brief psychoeducation that focused on disseminating information about the origins, meaning, impact of symptoms in day-to-day life, and management options. However, the reattribution component and muscle relaxation were not included in the content for control group psychoeducation. The study protocol had prior approval from the Institute Ethics Committee.

Gender was used as a factor as it differed between the intervention and control group at baseline. For PHQ-15, time (i.e., follow-up) was not associated with significant decrease in the scores (Pillai's Trace <italic>F</italic> = 3.811, <italic>P</italic> = 0.055 and partial &#x003b7;<sup>2</sup> = 0.054). Group allocation or gender also did not significantly affect the findings.</p><p>Regarding secondary outcomes, the scores on GAD-7 decreased with time (Pillai's Trace <italic>F</italic> = 8.713, <italic>P</italic> = 0.004 and partial &#x003b7;<sup>2</sup> = 0.115), but group membership (intervention versus control) or gender did not have a moderating influence on the outcome. The scores on PHQ-9 significantly decreased with time (Pillai's Trace <italic>F</italic> = 9.512, <italic>P</italic> = 0.003 and partial &#x003b7;<sup>2</sup> = 0.124). The time X group interaction suggested a trend level significance with the reduction in scores more pronounced in the intervention group (Pillai's Trace <italic>F</italic> = 5.530, <italic>P</italic> = 0.022 and partial &#x003b7;<sup>2</sup> = 0.076). Further, only time had a significant effect on the number of visits to the hospital in a month (Pillai's Trace <italic>F</italic> = 22.949, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001 and partial &#x003b7;<sup>2</sup> = 0.255), suggesting that the number of visits decreased in both groups. For the number of workdays lost in a month, both time (Pillai's Trace <italic>F</italic> = 19.684, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001 and partial &#x003b7;<sup>2</sup> = 0.230) and time X group interaction were significant (Pillai's Trace <italic>F</italic> = 8.281, <italic>P</italic> = 0.005 and partial &#x003b7;<sup>2</sup> = 0.111). This suggested that the number of workdays lost decreased in both groups, and the decrease was more in the intervention (SSC) group.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec1-4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The present study shows that a single session of structured counseling for MUS is no more efficacious than routine care in the short-term for control of somatic symptoms and associated anxiety but may improve work productivity and depressive symptoms. Therefore, this intervention may hold some promise in Indian settings. Martin <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] in a methodologically similar study, evaluated the efficacy of an SSC on MUS and found that both the intervention and waitlisted control groups had comparable improvement over 6 months on an array of healthcare utilization parameters, somatization severity, and absenteeism from work. Nonsuperiority of cognitive behavioral intervention delivered by family physician was also noted by investigators studying MUS in a primary care setting.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</p><p>In an RCT from Sri Lanka, wherein the investigators compared the efficacy of six sessions of CBT versus structured care consisting of six 30 min sessions with the primary health-care provider, it was observed that CBT was no more efficacious than structured care.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] However, a pilot study conducted on a smaller sample showed a superiority of psychiatrist-delivered CBT over standard care.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] These two studies are particularly relevant for discussion as they are from culturally similar and geographically proximate backgrounds. Our study provides two important methodological advances over the study by Sumathipala <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] first, all the intervention sessions were administered by a single trained psychiatrist who eliminates potential therapist bias and suggests greater fidelity to protocol; and second, our study had a TAU arm which allowed meaningful comparisons of the experimental intervention with routine care.</p><p>The findings of the present intervention in terms of its positive effects on work absenteeism do assume significance. Multiple Indian and foreign studies have highlighted the loss of productivity and economic impact of MUS on its sufferers and emphasized the need for CBT-based interventions in reducing personal distress and disability.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] Being able to work, even in a somewhat mitigated manner, may reduce guilt feelings of not being able to contribute which will disrupt the cycle of passivity, social isolation, and eventual marginalization seen among patients with MUS.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] To this extent, the single session intervention described here merits further evaluation. It can also be delivered even in low-resource settings by personnel with minimal training. No previous study has evaluated the feasibility and efficacy of brief CBT-based treatments in MUS in our setting, and therefore, our findings may serve to catalyze further research along similar lines with longer follow-up periods. Encouragingly, the intervention was overall well received as evidenced by the acceptable dropout rate in the intervention group (17.1%).</p><p>The limitations of the study include sampling from a single tertiary care center, short follow-up period, and reliance on patients' self-report for some of the outcome measures such as number of hospital visits in follow-up though we also verified information from the key informant wherever available to minimize recall bias. We also used a strict definition of caseness in MUS which may mean that more cases with greater disability got included. We insisted on a proper referral letter from the physician to minimize errors in recruitment. The strengths of the study include acceptable attrition rates, randomized controlled design, use of prospective assessment, single therapist-delivered intervention, and use of blinded outcome raters.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Single session counseling based on principles of Cognitive-Behavior Therapy may hold significant promise for Indian patients with medically unexplained symptoms (MUS), especially with regard to increasing work productivity and reducing psychological distress. MUS are a complex, multifaceted condition with impairment in various domains, and it may be too simplistic to expect a single session of CBT to exert immediate therapeutic gains. However, it may also not be prudent to write off CBT given its considerable evidence base in MUS.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] In the present study, we have used simple, easy to deliver techniques, and therefore, we suggest that this model be evaluated in multiple settings and over longer follow-up periods. Future research should also focus on effective therapies for sufferers from MUS who may be unwilling to go through the grind of CBT work.</p><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Financial support and
