This study assessed this training method in healthy older (45&#x02013;60 years.) men. Initially, 35 older men performed an incremental isometric exercise test to determine the linearity of the heart rate versus percentage peak EMG (%EMG<sub>peak</sub>) and systolic blood pressure versus %EMG<sub>peak</sub> relationship. Thereafter, 20 participants were allocated to a training or control group. The training group performed three double-leg isometric sessions per week for 8 weeks, at 85% of peak heart rate. The training resulted in a significant reduction in resting systolic (11 &#x000b1; 8 mmHg, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) and mean arterial (5 &#x000b1; 7 mmHg, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) blood pressure. There was no significant change in resting systolic blood pressure for the control group or diastolic blood pressure in either group (all <italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05). These findings show that this training method, used previously in young men, is also effective in reducing resting systolic and mean arterial blood pressure in older men.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>electromyography</kwd><kwd>resting blood pressure</kwd><kwd>heart rate</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Isometric exercise training has been shown to reduce resting blood pressure (BP).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-oajsm-4-033">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-oajsm-4-033">5</xref> Previous isometric training studies have consistently used a given force or maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) to prescribe isometric exercise intensity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-oajsm-4-033">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-oajsm-4-033">3</xref> More recently, Wiles et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-oajsm-4-033">6</xref> presented a novel, carefully controlled method of prescribing isometric exercise training.

The isometric training was performed at an intensity (%EMG) equivalent to 85% of each individual&#x02019;s peak HR obtained during their incremental isometric exercise test.

Although all three major muscles of the quadriceps femoris have been found to be active during leg extension exercise, it is suggested that the vastus lateralis muscle provides the most linear force&#x02013;EMG relationship.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-oajsm-4-033">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-oajsm-4-033">18</xref> The electrodes were placed in a bipolar configuration over the central portion of the muscle belly and orientated in parallel to the direction of the underlying muscle fibers. The EMG signal was amplified (gain = 300, input impedance = 10 G&#x02126;, CMRR &#x02265; 100 dB at 65 Hz) by the active electrodes and directed to a high level transducer (HLT100C; Biopac Systems, Goleta, CA, USA). The EMG was further filtered using 20 Hz high-pass and 500 Hz low-pass filters, smoothed with a 1 second moving average and was root mean squared. HR was recorded continuously through a three-lead electrocardiogram using pre-gelled disposable electrodes (EL501; Biopac Systems). For both types of electrode, prior to placement, the skin surface was shaved and cleansed with an alcohol wipe.</p><p>To allow for precise synchronization of torque, EMG, HR, and BP, all data generated by the dynamometer was transferred to the MP150WS Biopac data acquisition system using Acknowledge (version 3.8.1) software (Biopac Systems) via an analog output. To eliminate high frequency vibration noise, the torque signal was cleaned using a Butterworth low pass filter<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-oajsm-4-033">19</xref> of 6 Hz. BP was measured using a noninvasive BP monitor (NIBP100A; Biopac Systems). The monitor displays mean values of the pressure waveform using a sensor positioned cutaneously across the radial artery, with the reading being updated approximately every 10 seconds. This method has been reported to provide reliable measures of BP.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-oajsm-4-033">20</xref> Resting BP measures were recorded for 60 seconds following 15 minutes rest, with the participants in the supine position.</p></sec><sec><title>Procedure</title><sec><title>Resting measures</title><p>Following an initial familiarization session and prior to the first incremental isometric exercise test, participants&#x02019; resting measures (HR and BP) were recorded. These measures were subsequently recorded, at least 24 and no more than 48 hours after the end of week 4 and post training. Resting measures in the CON group were taken at the same time periods. All participants avoided performing strenuous exercise within 24 hours and agreed to abstain from alcohol and caffeine for a 12-hour period prior to all sessions. None of the participants were taking medication that could affect the cardiovascular variables being investigated in this study.</p></sec><sec><title>Incremental isometric exercise test</title><p>The first of two visits to the laboratory allowed the participants to become familiar with the equipment and test procedures. On the second visit, which was between 24 and 72 hours after the first visit, the subjects completed a double-leg incremental isometric extension exercise test. Once the participants were seated on the dynamometer with the BP monitor and electrodes attached, the dynamometer seat was adjusted appropriately for each individual so that the axis of rotation around the dynamometer shaft was adjacent to the lateral femoral condoyle of the subject&#x02019;s right leg.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-oajsm-4-033">5</xref> These individual adjustments were recorded for future tests. Once in position, the bilateral shoulder straps and an abdominal strap was adjusted and tightened to prevent any upper body movement. The participants were also asked to place their arms across their chests to stop individuals gaining extra leverage and thus increasing their MVC values and also to allow for better positioning of the BP monitor. With the knee bent at a 90&#x000b0; angle, the legs were strapped to the knee extension/flexion attachment arm of the dynamometer, with the protective pad sitting proximal to the medial malleolus of the ankles.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-oajsm-4-033">5</xref> See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-oajsm-4-033">Figure 1</xref>.</p><p>Each participant then undertook three 2&#x02013;4 second maximum isometric double-leg knee extensions to determine MVC and EMG<sub>peak</sub>.

After a further 5 minutes recovery, the subjects performed a continuous incremental isometric contraction at intensities of 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, and 30% of EMG<sub>peak</sub> or to voluntary exhaustion. These contractions were held for 120 seconds; %EMG<sub>peak</sub> values were provided as visual feedback to aid the participants in maintaining the appropriate level of intensity. This was accompanied by verbal feedback and encouragement. Participants were also cautioned not to hold their breath but to breathe as normally as possible to prevent the Valsalva maneuver. The experimental setup can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-oajsm-4-033">Figure 1</xref>.</p></sec><sec><title>Training sessions</title><p>Following the initial incremental isometric exercise test, participants trained 3 days per week for 8 weeks, with training sessions at least 24 hours apart. Specific target EMG values that equated to 85% of the HR<sub>peak</sub> were used to determine each individual&#x02019;s training intensity. These values were interpolated from the linear relationship between HR and EMG produced from the incremental exercise test. These measures were recalculated following an intermediate incremental isometric exercise test at the end of week four. This allowed the application of progressive overload by adjustment of the training intensities associated with any adaptations which may have occurred over the initial 4 weeks of training. During all training sessions, participants performed four 2-minute isometric exercise repetitions interspaced with a 2-minute rest period. During the isometric contractions, SBP ranged from 145 to 158 mmHg. EMG, HR, BP, and torque were continually measured and recorded. Training intensity (EMG, mV) was finely adjusted during the weekly training sessions if the monitored mean HR over the four 2-minute bouts deviated (&#x000b1;5%) from the target HR.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Data analysis</title><p>The data were assessed for the basic parametric test assumptions using Shapiro-Wilk&#x02019;s and Levene&#x02019;s tests<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-oajsm-4-033">21</xref> and those that did not conform (BP during the incremental test) were log transformed where appropriate. Statistical analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA), SPSS Statistics (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA) software, version 15. It has been reported<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-oajsm-4-033">22</xref> that the magnitude of the BP reductions are related to the initial resting values. Therefore, analysis of covariance (group, TRA and CON; time, pre and post) was used to determine if there was a significant difference in the pre- and post-training BPs compared with the baseline measures, using the baseline values as the covariate. Post hoc analysis (Bonferroni) was then used to further determine specific significant differences. Microsoft Graph-pad Prism software, which uses analysis of covariance to compare the slopes and intercepts of the linear regression lines, was used to analyze the data from the incremental isometric exercise test.

This relationship has previously been observed following isometric exercise training.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-oajsm-4-033">22</xref></p><p>Previous findings have suggested that the training-induced reductions in BP may be associated with changes to autonomic function, cardiac output, baroreceptor function, and/or alterations in arterial compliance.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-oajsm-4-033">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-oajsm-4-033">23</xref> The current understanding of the mechanisms associated with hypotension following exercise are suggested to be a combination of increased vasodilation due to presynaptic inhibition of vasoconstrictor nerves and elevated histamine receptor activation, centrally controlled mediated decreases in sympathetic nerve activity, and muscle afferent induced resetting of the baroreflex, resulting in a reduced muscle sympathetic nerve activity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-oajsm-4-033">24</xref> These mechanisms would alter both cardiac output and total peripheral resistance.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-oajsm-4-033">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-oajsm-4-033">25</xref> Only one previous study incorporating isometric training has shown a reduced resting HR.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-oajsm-4-033">26</xref> Millar et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-oajsm-4-033">27</xref> have also reported changes in the neurocardiac control following a single bout of isometric handgrip exercise which may be associated with an increase in parasympathetic activity.</p><p>Previous studies have compared the responses to isometric exercise in older and younger participants.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-oajsm-4-033">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-oajsm-4-033">30</xref> They have shown that increases in HR during exercise are attenuated in older persons,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29-oajsm-4-033">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-oajsm-4-033">30</xref> but BP responses tend to be similar.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-oajsm-4-033">28</xref> The differences in the HR<sub>peak</sub> and SBP<sub>peak</sub> in the present study, when compared with those recorded by Wiles et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-oajsm-4-033">6</xref> support this finding (HR<sub>peak</sub> group means, young 121.8 &#x000b1; 18.9 bpm, older 104.2 &#x000b1; 11.4 bpm; SBP<sub>peak</sub> group means, young 181.8 &#x000b1; 14.6 mmHg, older 189.2 &#x000b1; 16.0 mmHg). The strong HR versus %EMG<sub>peak</sub> and SBP versus %EMG<sub>peak</sub> linear relationships identified in the present study and those shown previously in younger participants<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-oajsm-4-033">6</xref> compare favorably (<italic>r</italic> = ~0.99, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 in both cases). However, the slope of the relationship may differ due to the attenuated increase in HR during isometric exercise in older adults.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29-oajsm-4-033">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-oajsm-4-033">30</xref> These similarities suggest that regulation of the pressor response continues to be closely linked to muscle activity during isometric exercise, even with increasing age.</p></sec><sec><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>The main strengths of the study are, firstly, that it supports the idea that the novel methods used by Wiles et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-oajsm-4-033">6</xref> to determine isometric exercise intensity, is repeatable in older (45&#x02013;60 years) men. Using this method to establish exercise intensity allows cardiovascular responses to reach a steady state during each isometric contraction. Secondly, this relationship has been used successfully in older men to determine exercise intensity for an isometric training program that significantly reduced resting BP. The main limitation of the study is that the %EMG, HR or BP relationship was only identified in sedentary older men. Further studies need to be undertaken to determine whether this protocol can be used to determine isometric exercise intensity in habitually active older men and other populations.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, it appears that 8 weeks of double-leg isometric training conducted at an exercise intensity of 85% HR<sub>peak</sub> was sufficient to cause a significant reduction in resting SBP, MAP, and resting HR in these older men. Also, it is evident that the HR versus %EMG<sub>peak</sub> and SBP versus %EMG<sub>peak</sub> relationships seen during incremental isometric exercise in younger men can be reproduced in older (45&#x02013;60 years) men. This relationship can therefore be used to set the intensity of isometric training of older men, in a similar way to that of younger men.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref
