Its introduction to orthopedic practice occurred nearly a decade ago at the turn of the century. Proposed advantages of CAS TKA include decreased blood loss<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref> among others. The major reason for this is that the intramedullary canal of the femur is not breached during CAS surgery. A large number of studies have been published assessing the benefits of this technique. The results have been equivocal, however, and no clear consensus has been reached on its benefits. Conteduca <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref> in their well designed study found that there was decreased blood loss in the CAS group compared to a cohort in which the standard technique was used. It is difficult to compare these results to the results of the current study as their practice differs significantly. Their tourniquet pressure was 450 mmHg versus 350 mmHg in our series, they left drains in for 48 h versus 24 h in our study, and their transfusion threshold was different (7 g/dL vs. 8 g/dL). Likewise, Kalairajah <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref> also found a significant decrease in blood loss in the CAS group. The number of patients included in their study was low, however, and little information is presented on how well matched their cohorts were. Their perioperative practice also differed significantly with three suction drains being used, again making direct comparison with this study difficult. Reported blood loss in patients having TKA with the standard technique in the previous studies is higher than that reported by other authors (1500 mL)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref> and is significantly higher than the average blood loss (562 mL) in the current study [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>].</p><table-wrap id="T3" position="float"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Comparisons with published series (Blood loss and Tourniquet times)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJOrtho-47-63-g003"/></table-wrap><p>Other authors have found conflicting results, however. Chang <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref> reported no significant difference in blood loss between the CAS and open techniques, although they looked at a minimally invasive open technique.</p><p>The current study has also demonstrated no significant difference in blood loss between our conventional and CAS TKA when performed using the same surgical technique. There was no significant difference in postoperative limb alignment, drop in postoperative Hb, or transfusion requirements between the two groups. The tourniquet time was increased in the navigated group. While this was not statistically significant, it is in keeping with previous reports<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref> [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>]. CAS is a relatively expensive technique compared to conventional surgical techniques in knee arthroplasty. In our unit, each navigated knee costs approximately &#x000a3;500 more than a non-navigated TKA. There also is no convincing evidence of significant clinical benefits in TKA. Added to this is a significant increase in operative time for navigated procedures.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref> The results of this study suggest that CAS techniques do not reduce blood loss during primary TKA. While blood loss has been used a measure of the benefits of CAS TKA, the primary aim of the computer-assisted technique is not to reduce bleeding. To consider blood loss is therefore an unusual endpoint for CAS TKA. The results of this study suggest that if surgery is performed carefully and done well, the amount of bleeding is unaffected by the use of CAS techniques.</p><p>Navigated TKA has emphasised the importance of accurate component alignment. In the same way the surgeon also must adhere to the principles of soft tissue balancing during the procedure to help achieve accurate alignment. handling. Though it takes longer to perform, this time is not significant and is associated with no increased morbidity with respect to blood loss.</p><p>The main limitations of this study are that it is retrospective and nonrandomized. It does, however, present the results of a well matched consecutive series of patients from a nonspecialist center. We believe that these results are therefore relevant to the majority of practicing orthopedic surgeons. There is a need for a large multicenter prospective randomized controlled trial is to be performed before a consensus can be reached on the influence of CAS techniques on blood loss during primary TKA.</p><p>Our results suggest that there is no difference in the blood loss in CAS TKA and conventional TKA. This study also highlights the heterogeneity of methods used in studies relating to CAS TKA.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>R<sc>EFERENCES</sc></title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="webpage"><date-in-citation>Last accessed on 25/4/201</date-in-citation><comment>Available from:
