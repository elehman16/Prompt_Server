This study adhered with the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. Inclusion criteria were, diagnosis of macular edema due to BRVO (non-ischemic), with baseline Snellen best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in the study eye less than 6/12, central foveal thickness (CFT) on optical coherence tomography (OCT) greater than 250 microns, age greater than 40 years. All subjects consented to participating in the study. Patients were excluded if they had additional eye disease that could compromise visual acuity, ocular inflammation, intraocular surgery less than a month before presentation, uncontrolled glaucoma, prior treatments with laser photocoagulation or other intervention for macular edema due to BRVO. Patients who excluded if they were pregnant or did not consent to participate in the study.</p><p>Thirty eyes (30 patients) were included in the study. These patients underwent a thorough ophthalmologic examination, including measurement of BCVA with a Snellen chart, applanation tonometry, indirect ophthalmoscopy, slit lamp examination with + 90 D, fluorescein angiography (FFA), and OCT, (Model 3000; Carl Zeiss Meditec Inc., Dublin, CA, USA). The patients were randomized into one of three groups: Group 1 received a single intravitreal injection of ranibizumab (Lucentis; Genentech, San Francisco, CA, USA) (0.5 mg/0.05 ml) on Day 0 followed by standard laser treatment on Day 7; Group 2 received a single dose of intravitreal bevacizumab on Day 0 followed by standard laser treatment on Day 7 and; Group 3 received laser treatment only.</p><p>Patients who underwent intravitreal injections received a drop of proparacaine followed by cleansing of the periocular area with 5% povidone-iodine solution. Subsequently, a sterile drape placed over the eyes. Another drop of proparacaine was instilled, followed by infiltration of conjuctival cul-de-sac by 5% povidone-iodine solution. After 2 minutes the povidone-iodine solution was washed and intravitreal injection (0.05 ml) was delivered through a pars plana route. The distance for injection was measured with Castrovejo calipers, using 3 mm for aphakic patients, 3.5 mm for pseudophakic patients and 4 mm for phakic patients. Pressure was applied with a sterile cotton swab at the injection site. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured with applanation tonometry. One drop of antibiotic was instilled and the eye was patched with a sterile pad. Patients were prescribed systemic antibiotics (ciprofloxacin) and topical antibiotic for a period of 5 days.</p><p>In all the groups, laser photocoagulation was performed with a spot size of 50 microns, exposure time of 0.1 seconds. The power was adjusted and started at 50 mw and increased in steps of 10 mw to produce mild intensity covering areas of capillary leakage as seen on FFA, 1 burn width apart. In Groups 1 and 2, patients were monitored for potential injection-related complications such as cataract, glaucoma, vitreous hemorrhage, retinal detachment, endophthalmitis on day 1 and day 7 follow-up visits.</p><p>Patients were followed at 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months. At each follow up visit, BCVA, slit lamp biomicroscopy, direct and indirect ophthalmoscopy, IOP, clinical fundus photography, and OCT were performed. Patients with loss of more than 2 lines of Snellen acuity or an increase in CFT more than 100 microns from previous visit were retreated as per the primary protocol of the Group. These patients underwent repeat FFA to reveal persistent areas of capillary leakage and then treatment was performed as per the noted protocol.</p><p>Primary measures of efficacy demonstrated during the study period were, improvement in mean BCVA, reduction in mean CFT and incidence of significant visual gain defined as gain of &#x02265;3 lines on Snellen acuity at 6 months from baseline.</p><p>Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS for Windows, version 16.0 (IBM Corp., New York, NY, USA). One way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed for intergroup comparisons of quantitative variables that did not follow a normal distribution between the three treatment Groups. Differences in the gender distribution in the different study Groups, differences between proportions of patients exhibiting and visual gain of &#x02265;3 lines were assessed for statistically significant changes with the Chi-square test with Yates correction. A probability <italic>P</italic> &#x02264; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Demographics</title><p>Thirty patients (30 eyes), comprising 12 males and 18 females, who presented with macular edema due to BRVO during the study period were included.

In most patients, macular edema is the predominant cause of visual loss although severe non-perfusion of perifoveal capillaries is an additional cause of reduced vision. Elevated intraocular levels of VEGF have been demonstrated in eyes with BRVO and this has been linked to vascular leakage.<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Thus, there is a strong rationale for using VEGF antagonists such as ranibizumab and bevacizumab in eyes with macular edema following BRVO.</p><p>The natural history of macular edema secondary to BRVO was delineated in the Branch Vein Occlusion Study (BVOS).<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> BVOS also demonstrated a benefit with grid photocoagulation in eyes with BRVO of 3-18 months duration and visual acuity 20/40-20/200.<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Treated eyes were more likely to gain 2 lines of visual acuity (65%) compared to untreated eyes (37%).<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Furthermore, treated eyes were more likely to have 20/40 or better vision at 3 years follow-up (60% vs 34% untreated), with a mean visual acuity improvement of 1.3 lines ETDRS versus 0.2 lines in the untreated group.<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p><p>Although the effect of anti-VEGF agents is very rapid and dramatic, the effect is short-lived and repeated injections are required which increases the cost of treatment. If the prolonged effects of laser (i.e. sustained stoppage of vascular leakage as compared to the temporary effects of intravitral injections) can be combined with the rapid effect of intravitreal injections of anti-VEGF agents, then it not only reduces the number of intravitreal injections but also reduces the financial burden of treatment, which is very important in developing countries such as India.</p><p>The largest study to date involving ranibizumab for macular edema following BRVO (BRAVO study) found that an intraocular injection of 0.3 or 0.5 mg of ranibizumab provided a rapid, effective treatment for macular edema due to BRVO.<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> The BRAVO study utilized a monthly injection of ranibizumab for 6 months, with an option of rescue laser beginning from three months, if eligible.<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Rescue laser eligibility was defined as clearing of hemorrhage with visual acuity of &#x0003c;6/12 or CFT &#x0003e;250 microns.<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> In the present study however, a different protocol was used. All patients received anti-VEGF agents at the first visit, followed by laser after 7-10 days as soon maximal effect of anti-VEGF agent was expected. This was performed on the following two premises; first, to reduce the number of intravitreal injections required, thereby reducing the cost of treatment and circumventing potential adverse effects of intravitreal injections; secondly, to provide a reduction in vascular leakage by photocoagulating the areas of leakage to create a prolonged and sustained effect.</p><p>The degree of improvement in visual acuity and reduction in CFT in the present study, where intravitreal ranibizumab was used was comparable to the BRAVO study<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> despite different treatment protocols between studies.</p><p>Although several studies have found intravitreal bevacizumab to be effective in reducing macular edema secondary to BRVO, to our knowledge no study has compared the efficacy of intravitreal ranibizumab and bevacizumab. Intravitreal ranibizumab appeared more effective than bevacizumab in terms of &#x02265;3 line visual gain of Snellen acuity at the 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months follow-up visits [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>]. However reduction in CFT in patients treated with ranibizumab, compared to patients treated with bevacizumab and laser did not produce a statistically significant outcome. The reason for the slightly better results with ranibizumab could be related to the smaller molecular size, allowing rapid penetration through the retinal layers as well as greater affinity for VEGF established by ranibizumab. However the small sample size in our study precludes a definitive conclusion about superiority of ranibizumab.</p><p>Although laser is the current gold standard for treatment of macular edema due to BRVO, the BVOS<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> study found a modest improvement in patients treated with laser photocoagulation. Laser treatment cannot be performed on patients with fresh venous occlusions owing to retinal hemorrhages and it takes several months for the haemorrhages to clear. During this time, severe retinal edema could compromise retinal cells leading to permanent structural damage.</p><p>Both improvement in visual acuity and reduction in CFT appeared to be better in eyes that had received intravitreal ranibizumab therapy as compared to eyes treated with laser alone during the entire study.</p><p>In conclusion, both ranibizumab and bevacizumab for macular edema due to BRVO resulted in a gain in visual acuity and a rapid reduction in intraretinal thickness. These anti-VEGF agents could be combined with a more permanent treatment such as laser photocoagulation, which would yield much better results than any single mode of treatment alone. However, a larger sample size and longer follow up to evaluate the observations of this study.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold>
