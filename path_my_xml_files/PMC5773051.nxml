Evidence suggests that local heat preconditioning could help improve the provision of this procedure by reducing skin necrosis. Before testing the effectiveness of heat preconditioning in a definitive randomised controlled trial (RCT), we must first establish the best way to measure skin necrosis and estimate the event rate using this definition.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">PREHEAT is a single-blind randomised controlled feasibility trial comparing local heat preconditioning, using a hot water bottle, against standard care on skin necrosis among breast cancer patients undergoing reconstructive breast surgery. The primary objective of this study is to determine the best way to measure skin necrosis and to estimate the event rate using this definition in each trial arm. Secondary feasibility objectives include estimating recruitment and 30&#x000a0;day follow-up retention rates, levels of compliance with the heating protocol, length of stay in hospital and the rates of surgical versus conservative management of skin necrosis. The information from these objectives will inform the design of a larger definitive effectiveness and cost-effectiveness RCT.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">This article describes the PREHEAT trial protocol and detailed statistical analysis plan, which includes the pre-specified criteria and process for establishing the best way to measure necrosis. This study will provide the evidence needed to establish the best way to measure skin necrosis, to use as the primary outcome in a future RCT to definitively test the effectiveness of local heat preconditioning. The pre-specified statistical analysis plan, developed prior to unblinded data extraction, sets out the analysis strategy and a comparative framework to support a committee evaluation of skin necrosis measurements. It will increase the transparency of the data analysis for the PREHEAT trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par4">ISRCTN <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1186/ISRCTN15744669">ISRCTN15744669</ext-link>.

The 2002 National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines recommend immediate breast reconstruction whenever it is safe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Revised NICE guidance in 2009 re-emphasises the importance of immediate reconstruction after mastectomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par30">There are essentially two types of reconstruction that a patient can have after mastectomy: implant-based or autologous flaps, where the patient&#x02019;s own tissue is used to create a new breast. Skin-sparing mastectomy (SSM) followed by autologous microsurgical breast reconstruction is an increasingly popular procedure within the UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. It results in highly satisfactory results both oncologically and cosmetically from a surgical and patient&#x02019;s perspective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In 2011, 16,485 women underwent mastectomy in the UK and approximately a third of these underwent autologous reconstruction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par31">These procedures, particularly autologous reconstruction, are highly labour intensive requiring significant expertise and involvement of several healthcare professionals. Implant-based reconstruction is less expensive initially than autologous reconstruction but more patients are opting for the latter due to more satisfactory results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. A bilateral mastectomy and reconstruction can take an entire day of operating theatre time. The average cost of a free flap breast reconstruction is estimated at &#x000a3;10,910 compared to an implant only reconstruction, which costs &#x000a3;8034 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, it is important to remember that autologous reconstruction has a lower long-term cost to the NHS as it requires fewer revisions and has higher patient satisfaction compared to implant reconstruction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par32">According to the NHS&#x02019; Institute for Innovation and Improvement, reducing the length of hospital stay is ranked as a level 1 priority [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In autologous breast surgery, the average length of stay (LOS) following a &#x0201c;deep inferior epigastric perforator&#x0201d; (DIEP) flap is 8&#x000a0;days and our own LOS concurs. In the USA, the LOS is much shorter however this is mainly due to the reluctant nature of private funding from insurance companies for the same procedure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. LOS is the most influential factor in reducing the cost of autologous breast reconstruction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Local heat preconditioning could help improve the provision of this procedure by helping to reduce the complications and overall costs associated with its service delivery.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Evidence for local heat precondition</title><p id="Par33">A non-randomised phase 1 study conducted by three of the authors (JF, SM and VC) in 50 participants looked at the use of heat preconditioning to reduce skin necrosis in SSM. The study showed a reduction in necrosis from 36 to 12% (controls vs tests) and an average length of stay from 8 to 4&#x000a0;days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. There is little data on the cost implications of specifically skin necrosis, however, the incidence rate is between 20 and 40% and the cost of surgical treatment (debridement and skin graft) is approximately &#x000a3;1782 plus extra theatre time (&#x000a3;3840 for half a day in theatre [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]). Extra hospital stay means the costs can spiral into the thousands.</p><p id="Par34">The simple heat preconditioning intervention we are exploring has the potential to improve wound healing preoperatively and to prevent complications in a safe way reducing the burden to patients at minimal cost. This is important in a modern NHS with increasing financial constraints and, if found to be efficacious, heat preconditioning could allow us to offer autologous reconstruction to more patients. Aside from the financial benefits, benefits to patients would be improved wound healing resulting in quicker recovery and reduced LOS with faster progression to adjuvant therapy. This means a quicker return to normal life but more importantly, earlier discharge improves recovery, reduces the risks of hospital-acquired infections and venous thromboembolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study aim</title><p id="Par35">PREHEAT is a feasibility study for a trial that will evaluate local heat preconditioning with respect to its effects on wound healing after reconstructive breast surgery in patients with breast cancer. The aim of this study is to inform the design of a larger trial among breast cancer patients undergoing SSM and nipple-sparing mastectomy (NSM) focusing on effectiveness. This article describes the PREHEAT trial protocol (version 1.1, 26/02/2016) and the detailed statistical analysis plan, which has been developed prior to unblinded data extraction to meet the trials objectives.

Exclusion criteria include delayed (2-stage) reconstruction patients, patients with a latex allergy and patients with inflammatory cancer.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Intervention</title><p id="Par46">The intervention is heat preconditioning of the breast (to be operated on) the night prior to the surgery by means of a hot water bottle. Participants in the intervention arm will be given a hot water bottle and an underwater thermometer for use at home. The preconditioning heating protocol is as follows: the participants will need to heat water in a saucepan at home to 43&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C and pour it into the bottle. This is then placed on the naked study breast (the breast to be operated on) over the nipple-areola complex for 30&#x000a0;min. The breast is then allowed to cool for 30&#x000a0;min to body temperature. The participants will then need to do another 30-min application of heat at the same temperature for 30&#x000a0;min with fresh heated water. The bottle must be placed in the same area. After another 30-min break, the participants will need to do a final, third heat application. The preconditioning intervention will be undertaken once, 12&#x000a0;h before surgery, i.e. the evening before. For the BRCA carrier status participant undergoing bilateral mastectomy and reconstruction, we will ask them to heat only the right breast.</p><p id="Par47">This heating procedure is based on the protocol used in our phase 1 study and an experimental animal model investigating the effect of local heat preconditioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. A temperature of 43&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C provides heat application to a supraphysiological level without causing a burn. We will ask participants to record the temperature of the water and the number of heating applications they undertook to assess adherence to the heating protocol. All usual medication will be continued.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Randomisation and blinding</title><p id="Par48">Participants will be allocated to treatment arm via an online randomisation system hosted by the King&#x02019;s College London Clinical Trials Unit (KCTU) to ensure concealment of treatment allocation for clinicians who are assessing participants.

In order to do this with sufficient precision to inform the design of a later definitive study, the sample size calculations have been based on estimating with precision and not hypothesis testing.</p><p id="Par70">The study will take place at Guy&#x02019;s and St Thomas&#x02019; NHS Foundation Trust (GSTT) in the department of plastic surgery. Within GSTT over 150 SSMs are performed per year and recruitment will occur for 2&#x000a0;years. Three hundred participants would allow us to estimate the 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the recruitment rate with precision of at least &#x000b1;&#x02009;6 percentage points (calculation based on proportion requiring the largest sample size, e.g. 50%). Based on our previous experience, we anticipate that the actual recruitment rate will be no less than 60% so this would provide us with at least 180 participants. Assuming the proportion of necrosis events among participants in the control arm is 30%, this number will allow us to estimate &#x02018;necrosis&#x02019; rates to within each arm to at least &#x000b1;&#x02009;9 percentage points.
