However, progressive &#x003b2;-cell failure and insulin resistance are the principal core defects responsible for development and progression of hyperglycemia in individuals with T2DM (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Nonetheless, hyperglycemia is the major factor responsible for retinopathy and nephropathy, and every 1% decrease in HbA<sub>1c</sub> is associated with an &#x0223c;35% reduction in risk of microvascular complications (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Microvascular complications are uncommon if the HbA<sub>1c</sub> is maintained at less than 6.5&#x02013;7.0% (48&#x02013;53 mmol/mol) (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Therefore, the standard of diabetes care recommends maintaining the HbA<sub>1c</sub> at &#x0003c;7.0% (53 mmol/mol) to minimize the microvascular risk in patients with T2DM (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).</p><p>Metformin is the most commonly used first-line antidiabetic agent in T2DM (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). It lowers HbA<sub>1c</sub> by inhibiting hepatic glucose production (7.8). Because metformin does not halt or prevent the progressive &#x003b2;-cell failure (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), after an initial decrease, the HbA<sub>1c</sub> rises progressively over time. Although the American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends several therapeutic options in patients in whom metformin is failing, sulfonylureas remains the most commonly used second-line therapy, and similar to metformin, they also lack protective effect on &#x003b2;-cell function (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p><p>Insulin is very effective in lowering the plasma glucose concentration, but requires an injection and home glucose monitoring, causes hypoglycemia, and promotes weight gain (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Nonetheless, insulin is the recommended therapeutic option in patients with poorly controlled T2DM when multiple oral agents fail (e.g., metformin plus a sulfonylurea) (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).</p><p>Progressive &#x003b2;-cell failure, weight gain, and hypoglycemia remain major obstacles in maintaining HbA<sub>1c</sub> within the normal range (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), including with insulin therapy. Further, recent clinical trials have reported that hypoglycemia is associated with increased mortality risk (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). This presents a dilemma in patients with poorly controlled T2DM between lowering HbA<sub>1c</sub> to prevent microvascular complications and minimizing the risk of hypoglycemia. The ADA recommends &#x0201c;lowering HbA<sub>1c</sub> to &#x0003c;7.0% (53 mmol/mol) in most patients and more stringent targets (6.0&#x02013;6.5%) (42&#x02013;48 mmol/mol) in selected patients if achieved without hypoglycemia&#x0201d; (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).</p><p>Thiazolidinediones are potent insulin sensitizers (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), improve &#x003b2;-cell function (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), and as reviewed by DeFronzo (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>), clinical trials have demonstrated durable HbA<sub>1c</sub> reduction with lower risk of hypoglycemia compared with sulfonylureas (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>).</p><p>GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide 1) receptor agonists (RA) improve &#x003b2;-cell function (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), an effect that lasts for up to 3 years (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Thus, they produce a durable reduction in HbA<sub>1c</sub> with a low risk of hypoglycemia.</p><p>We recently demonstrated that the addition of exenatide plus pioglitazone, which improve insulin sensitivity and &#x003b2;-cell function, to metformin in patients with newly diagnosed T2DM produces a greater and more durable reduction in the HbA<sub>1c</sub> and a lower risk of hypoglycemia than the recommended sequential add-on of metformin, followed by a sulfonylurea and insulin (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Subjects who were started on metformin/pioglitazone/exenatide at the time of diagnosis of T2DM maintained a mean HbA<sub>1c</sub> of 5.9% (41 mmol/mol) for 2 years compared with HbA<sub>1c</sub> of 6.5% (48 mmol/mol) in patients in whom metformin, a sulfonylurea, and insulin were sequentially added (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). The group with triple therapy with metformin/pioglitazone/exenatide also experienced much less hypoglycemia and weight gain than the group receiving sequential addition of metformin, followed by glipizide and then a progressively increasing daily dose of glargine insulin (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>).</p><p>Millions of patients with poorly controlled T2DM worldwide are currently treated with metformin plus a sulfonylurea. Although a third oral agent (e.g., DPP-4 inhibitor) can be added to improve their glycemic control, because of advanced &#x003b2;-cell failure (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>), insulin therapy is the most commonly used addition in those patients with poorly controlled T2DM on multiple oral agents.</p><p>The aim of the current study was to compare the efficacy and safety of combination therapy with GLP-1 RA plus thiazolidinedione, which correct the major metabolic defects responsible for the development of progressive hyperglycemia in T2DM (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>), versus basal/bolus insulin in patients with long-standing poorly controlled T2DM treated with maximum doses of metformin plus sulfonylurea.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Research Design and Methods</title><p>The Qatar Study is an open label, single-center, randomized control trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02887625) that examines the efficacy, durability, and safety of combination therapy with exenatide plus pioglitazone versus basal/bolus insulin in patients with poorly controlled T2DM on metformin plus a sulfonylurea. This is an ongoing study at Hamad General Hospital, Doha, Qatar. Here we report the effect of each therapy on glycemic control and safety parameters at a mean of 1 year of follow-up (range, 6&#x02013;18 months). The study protocol was approved by the Hamad General Hospital Institutional Review Board, and informed written consent was obtained before patient enrollment.</p><sec id="s3"><title>Subjects</title><p>Subjects with poorly controlled (HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x0003e;7.5% [58 mmol/mol]) T2DM (age 18&#x02013;75 years) treated with a maximal/nearly maximal dose of metformin (&#x0003e;1,500 mg/day) plus a sulfonylurea (&#x0003e;4 mg glimepiride or &#x0003e;60 mg gliclazide) were recruited. Patients were in good general health as determined by medical history and physician examination. Participants had normal kidney and liver function, serum chemistry results, electrocardiogram results, and urinalysis, stable body weight (&#x000b1; 3 pounds within preceding year), and a negative pregnancy test.

There was no limit on the upper value of HbA<sub>1c</sub> for enrollment (range of initial HbA<sub>1c</sub> was 7.5&#x02212;15.1% [58&#x02013;142 mmol/mol]).</p><p>Subjects randomized to combination therapy were started on weekly exenatide injection (2 mg/week extended-release exenatide [BYDUREON] administered with a pen), and pioglitazone (15 mg/day) was added at week 2, and the dose was increased to 30 mg/day at week 4. Subjects receiving insulin therapy were started on insulin glargine before breakfast. The Treat-to-Target Trial (4T) algorithm was used to calculate the starting glargine dose, and the dose was adjusted weekly to achieve a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) of &#x0003c;110 mg/dL. After the FPG goal was achieved, if the HbA<sub>1c</sub> was &#x0003e;7.0% (53 mmol/mol), 4&#x02013;6 units of insulin aspart was started before each meal, and the dose was adjusted to a achieve a plasma glucose concentration of &#x0003c;140 mg/dL at 2 hours after meals.</p><p>Patients were seen monthly during the first 4 months or as needed, based on the results of the plasma glucose concentration, and bimonthly thereafter. FPG, body weight, and HbA<sub>1c</sub> were measured at each follow-up visit, and the medication dose was adjusted to maintain a FPG &#x0003c;110 mg/dL, 2-h postprandial plasma glucose &#x0003c;140 mg/dL, and HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x0003c;7% (53 mmol/mol), unless hypoglycemia (blood glucose was &#x0003c;60 mg/dL or symptoms) was encountered. Hypoglycemia was defined as blood glucose concentration of &#x0003c;60 mg/dL, with or without symptoms, or hypoglycemia symptoms that subsided after glucose ingestion. Patients were instructed to perform a 7-point home blood glucose profile level (One Touch, VivaCheck, Wilmington, DE) before and 2 h after a meal and at bedtime 1 day each week. Blood glucose levels measured at home were downloaded at each follow-up visit and verified by the study coordinator. During each follow-up visit, FPG was measured, records of glucose values measured at home were reviewed, and patients were questioned about symptoms of hypoglycemia. Severe hypoglycemia was defined as hypoglycemia requiring third-party assistance. Down titration of medications was allowed to avoid hypoglycemia. If more than three hypoglycemic events per visit on two consecutive visits were encountered, down titration, usually of the sulfonylurea, was done to lower the risk of hypoglycemic events.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Data Analysis and Statistical Analysis</title><p>Primary end point was the HbA<sub>1c</sub> difference between subjects receiving combination therapy and those receiving insulin therapy. Because all patients (<italic>N</italic> = 231) in the study completed at least 6 months of follow-up, the full effect of therapy on the HbA<sub>1c</sub> in each treatment arm was achieved. Therefore, the values of HbA<sub>1c</sub> available at the last follow-up visit (range 6&#x02013;18 months) were used for the final analysis.

The EDICT study randomized, patients with new-onset diabetes to receive initial combination therapy with metformin/pioglitazone/exenatide versus sequential add-on of metformin, followed by a sulfonylurea and insulin. At 2 years, &#x0003e;80% of subjects in the sequential add-on therapy group were receiving more than one agent, and subjects who received initial triple therapy had 0.55% lower HbA<sub>1c</sub>. From these results we assumed that subjects with combination therapy (pioglitazone plus exenatide) would achieve a lower HbA<sub>1c</sub> by &#x02265;0.55% versus subjects receiving metformin, sulfonylurea, and insulin. We computed that 156 subjects per arm would provide 90% power to detect a 0.55% HbA<sub>1c</sub> difference between treatment arms at &#x003b1; &#x0003c; 0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s6"><title>Results</title><p>The study screened 296 patients and randomized 251 eligible patients, of whom 129 were randomized to combination therapy and 122 to insulin therapy.

As anticipated, insulin therapy, which is very powerful in lowering the plasma glucose concentration, produced a robust reduction in mean HbA<sub>1c</sub> (&#x02206; = 2.9%), and half of the subjects receiving insulin therapy achieved the ADA treatment goal of HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x0003c;7.0% (53 mmol/mol) without significant hypoglycemia. The mean FPG concentration in insulin-treated subjects reached the target (110 mg/dL) at &#x0223c;2 months, confirming rigorous insulin intensification in the insulin-treated group. However, the glycemic goal (HbA<sub>1c</sub>&#x0003c;7.0% [53 mmol/mol]) was achieved in only half of the patients because hypoglycemia precluded further escalation of the insulin dose. Subjects receiving combination therapy experienced a more robust reduction in mean HbA<sub>1c</sub> (&#x02206; = 3.9%). Because neither pioglitazone nor exenatide are associated with an increased risk of hypoglycemia, subjects receiving combination therapy experienced a threefold lower risk of hypoglycemia despite an HbA<sub>1c</sub> that was 1% lower compared with the insulin therapy group. Of note, most of the hypoglycemic events in subjects receiving combination therapy were related to the use of sulfonylureas, because down titration or stopping the sulfonylurea in these patients eliminated most of the hypoglycemic events.</p><p>The combination of pioglitazone plus exenatide was very effective in lowering the HbA<sub>1c</sub> independent of ethnicity, BMI, sex, or baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub>. Remarkably, the HbA<sub>1c</sub> in subjects in the upper half of the HbA<sub>1c</sub> range (baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub> 9.5&#x02013;15% [80&#x02013;140 mmol/mol], mean 11.3% [100 mmol/mol]) in the combination therapy group decreased at 4 months to the same level as patients with baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub> between 7.5 and 9.5% (58 and 80 mmol/mol) (mean HbA<sub>1c</sub> 8.5% [69 mmol/mol]); there was no difference in the mean HbA<sub>1c</sub> between groups after 3 months (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1<italic>C</italic></xref>). These results demonstrate that the combination of once-weekly exenatide plus pioglitazone, antidiabetic agents that have been shown in previous studies to correct the underlying core defects responsible for the development of hyperglycemia in T2DM (i.e., &#x003b2;-cell dysfunction and insulin resistance) (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), reduces the mean plasma glucose concentration close to the normal range, regardless of the starting HbA<sub>1c</sub>, and with a low risk of hypoglycemia.</p><p>Subjects receiving combination therapy experienced half of the weight gain compared with subjects receiving insulin therapy (2.1 vs. 4.2 kg) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). Although pioglitazone therapy resulted in weight gain, 32% of patients receiving combination therapy experienced weight loss compared with only 13% (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01) in the insulin treatment group. This most likely is explained by the concomitant use of exenatide, which is well documented to suppress appetite and cause weight loss (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). It also should be pointed out that with pioglitazone, the greater the weight gain, the greater are the improvements in HbA<sub>1c</sub>, insulin sensitivity, and &#x003b2;-cell function (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p><p>Both treatments were well tolerated, and few subjects (&#x0003c;3% in combination therapy; 0% in insulin therapy) withdrew because of adverse events. Most of the adverse events were mild and unrelated to study treatment. Hypoglycemia was the most common adverse event; the absolute hypoglycemia rate was relatively low (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc16-1738/-/DC1">Supplementary Table 1</ext-link>) compared with other studies that have used intensive insulin therapy in T2DM (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). The relatively low rate of peripheral edema (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc16-1738/-/DC1">Supplementary Table 1</ext-link>) with combination therapy most likely is explained by the lower dose of pioglitazone (30 mg/day) used in the current study. The natriuretic effect of exenatide also could have reduced the incidence of peripheral edema. Most of edema that occurred was mild and easily controlled with the addition of a distally acting diuretic to the treatment regimen. Only two subjects discontinued combination therapy because of ankle edema. No congestive heart failure or fractures occurred in either group.</p><p>Although the study was not powered to detect the effect of therapy on cardiovascular events, five cardiovascular events, one fatal, occurred in the insulin therapy group. Because of the small sample size in the current study and short follow-up duration, it is impossible to determine whether this result was due to chance or to a potential protective cardiovascular effect of pioglitazone (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) or GLP-1 RA (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), both of which have been shown to reduce CVD events, but longer monitoring will be required to see the CVD benefit. A much larger and longer cardiovascular outcome study will be required to answer this question.</p><p>The current study has several limitations. The therapies used (weekly exenatide and multiple daily insulin injections) prohibited the study from being blinded. Because study was performed in a single center, it included a relatively small number of participants, primarily of Arab origin (&#x0223c;70% of participants). Thus, a larger multiethnic study is warranted to examine the generalizability of this novel treatment approach in individuals with poorly controlled, long-standing T2DM. Further, longer follow-up is required to determine the durability of glycemic control achieved in the combination therapy group. Whether the HbA<sub>1c</sub> difference (6.1% [43 mmol/mol] in combination therapy vs. 7.1% [54 mmol/mol] in insulin therapy) in this range of HbA<sub>1c</sub> will be translated into greater prevention of diabetic microvascular complications also remains to be determined.</p><p>Nonetheless, the present results are impressive and, contrary to standard dogma, demonstrate that even in individuals with very poorly controlled, long-standing T2DM, combination therapy with a GLP-1 RA plus pioglitazone can achieve nearly normal/normal HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels. We believe that the robust results observed in the current study should foster a larger multiethnic study with longer duration to validate the findings in the current study and examine their benefit on diabetic microvascular and macrovascular complications.</p><p>In summary, the present results demonstrate that combination therapy with pioglitazone plus exenatide is a very effective and safe therapeutic option in patients with poorly controlled, long-standing T2DM on metformin plus a sulfonylurea. Continued follow-up will be required to ascertain how long the beneficial effects of combination therapy are maintained.</p></sec>
