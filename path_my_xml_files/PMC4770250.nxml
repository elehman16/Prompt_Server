Eligible subjects were centrally randomised 1:1, stratified by number of pulmonary exacerbations (2&#x02013;3 or &#x02265;4) in the preceding 12&#x02005;months. DRCFI consisted of liposomal ciprofloxacin for inhalation (150&#x02005;mg in 3&#x02005;ml) and free ciprofloxacin (60&#x02005;mg in 3&#x02005;ml), each provided in separate vials. Matched placebo consisted of control liposomes (15&#x02005;mg in 3&#x02005;ml) and normal saline (0.9%, 3&#x02005;ml). Subjects nebulised DRCFI or matching placebo once-daily through a PARI LC Sprint powered by a PARI Turbo Boy-S compressor (PARI, Richmond, USA) for up to three treatment cycles of 28&#x02005;days &#x02018;on&#x02019; inhaled therapy, 28&#x02005;days &#x02018;off&#x02019; (figure 1; see online data supplement). Trial medication was discontinued once subjects reached the pulmonary exacerbation endpoint although subjects remained in the study and continued trial visits and assessments. Hence, all subjects (excepting subjects who withdrew from the study for AEs prior to experiencing pulmonary exacerbation) contributed to pulmonary exacerbation data.</p><p>Subjects were reviewed after 2, 4 and then every 4&#x02005;weeks. Assessments performed at each visit included spirometry, sputum collection, 6&#x02005;min walk test (6MWT) and St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ).

This microbiological efficacy, representing a greater than 10&#x02005;000-fold fall in CFU (4 log fold drop), was associated with positive effects upon pulmonary exacerbation outcomes assessed by both time to first exacerbation (although statistically significant only in the per protocol population) and need for supplemental antibiotics. This is the first double-blind, placebo-controlled study of an inhaled agent to demonstrate clinical benefits in subjects with non-CF bronchiectasis, although it must be recognised that this was a specific, selected group of <italic>P aeruginosa</italic>-infected non-CF bronchiectasis subjects and hence the study results are not more broadly generalisable.</p><p>While the effects upon the primary outcome measure in ORBIT-2 were large and unambiguous, the effects upon pulmonary exacerbation outcomes need to be considered in the light of potential study limitations. First, the modest sample size creates the risk of Type 1 error. Second, the time to exacerbation endpoint was only conventionally statistically significant on the per protocol population (p=0.057 on mITT). Third, the DRCFI group were older and we cannot exclude that random imbalance in subject age at baseline may have influenced exacerbation outcomes in the two groups. However, baseline pulmonary exacerbation rates (a stratification variable at randomisation) were matched. Finally, the novel trial design employed in the current trial, in which subjects were withdrawn from study drug following first exacerbation, did reduce the potential to capture longer-term safety and tolerability data in some patients. However, this design safeguarded patients (given that many prior studies of inhaled therapies in this subject group have shown increased respiratory AEs)<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5&#x02013;9</xref> and yet ensured that the primary and key secondary (time to first pulmonary exacerbation) outcome measures were robustly captured. Furthermore, the potential duration of drug exposure in the current study was actually substantially longer than has been the norm in recent studies of inhaled antibiotics in both CF and non-CF bronchiectasis, which have mostly consisted of single 28-day antibiotic cycles.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17&#x02013;21</xref></p><p>The antimicrobial efficacy of DRCFI developed early following commencement of therapy and was seen with each of the subsequent repeat treatment cycles. The reduction in bacterial density with DRCFI was similar in magnitude to that previously reported for TOBI in bronchiectasis subjects<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> and substantially greater than the 2.2 log<sub>10</sub>/g reduction seen with TOBI in CF subjects after 4&#x02005;weeks of therapy.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> However, in contrast to the prior study of nebulised TOBI in bronchiectasis,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> in ORBIT-2 there were fewer respiratory-related AEs and reductions in exacerbations in subjects receiving DRCFI compared with placebo. The recently reported single-blind study of low-dose inhaled gentamicin<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> and double-blind RCT of inhaled ciprofloxacin dry-powder inhaler<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> have also both demonstrated reductions in bacterial density of a similar magnitude to that reported here. However, both of those studies assessed this outcome in a range of airway pathogens in contrast to ORBIT-2 which assessed <italic>P aeruginosa</italic> alone.</p><p>DRCFI was well tolerated, without bronchodilator premedication. It is unclear whether this simply reflects improved tolerability of ciprofloxacin generally compared with aminoglycosides, given that ciprofloxacin dry-powder inhaler was not associated with bronchospasm in a recent study,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> or whether liposomal encapsulation may further improve tolerability.</p><p>Although there was no significant positive effect on quality of life to accompany the improvements in exacerbation data and respiratory AEs, this was not surprising as the study was not powered for this endpoint. Interestingly, two larger, recently reported studies of macrolides have also failed to show significant between-arm improvements in SGRQ scores in spite of significant improvements in a number of important clinical outcomes.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>
<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></p><p>In the current study, only subjects demonstrating at least one ciprofloxacin-sensitive <italic>P aeruginosa</italic> strain were enrolled and whether a significant benefit of therapy would emerge in subjects without any sensitive strains is unclear. However, we would anticipate that subjects with only resistant <italic>P aeruginosa</italic> strains on in vitro susceptibility testing will also derive clinical benefit from this formulation as DRCFI achieves high and sustained airway concentrations of ciprofloxacin that are likely to overcome even the most resistant strains.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Furthermore, in studies of TOBI in CF, nearly 30% of subjects had tobramycin-resistant <italic>P aeruginosa</italic> and these subjects demonstrated similar clinical benefits to those with fully susceptible strains.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Future studies evaluating the clinical efficacy of DRCFI in those without ciprofloxacin-sensitive <italic>P aeruginosa</italic> are needed.</p><p>The potential for development of antimicrobial resistance is inherent to any antibiotic therapy, particularly when used as a chronic maintenance therapy. While the current study did not demonstrate any significant increased resistance of <italic>P aeruginosa</italic> isolates to ciprofloxacin, some degree of selection pressure will result from the long-term use of any inhaled antibiotic including ciprofloxacin. For individuals with non-CF bronchiectasis, the critical question is whether the long-term use of inhaled antibiotics (including DRCFI) will result in improvements in clinical outcomes that outweigh the risks related to reductions in antimicrobial susceptibility. Only adequately powered long-term studies will address this question, although the data in subjects with CF suggest that the benefits of long-term nebulised antibiotics far outweigh any negative outcomes resulting from resistance induction.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Until there are data to further inform this dilemma, it would be prudent to limit consideration of inhaled antibiotic therapies in non-CF bronchiectasis to those subjects experiencing the greatest morbidity, specifically <italic>P aeruginosa-</italic>colonised individuals with frequent infective exacerbations (ie, the population studied in ORBIT-2).</p><p>One further potential limitation of a strategy of maintenance, cycled, inhaled ciprofloxacin for bronchiectasis relates to the lack of an alternative, orally active antipseudomonal antibiotic class. Put simply, if a patient with bronchiectasis develops an infective exacerbation while on inhaled ciprofloxacin, would there be any added benefit in treatment with an oral fluoroquinolone or will subjects have an increased risk of subsequently requiring intravenous (non-fluoroquinolone) antibiotics for rescue? The current study was not powered to assess this. Future studies will evaluate this by determining whether subjects inhaling DRCFI who exacerbate recover more slowly with oral antipseudomonal therapy or are more likely to require rescue with intravenous antibiotics.</p><p>In the current study, once-daily inhaled DRCFI was well tolerated and demonstrated potent antipseudomonal microbiological efficacy in adults with non-CF bronchiectasis and airway infection by ciprofloxacin-sensitive <italic>P aeruginosa</italic>. Furthermore, positive effects upon pulmonary exacerbation outcomes were seen for the first time in a double-blind RCT of inhaled antibiotics in this patient group, although this was statistically significant only per protocol and may have been influenced by baseline age imbalance in this modest-sized phase II study. Confirmatory results in a larger data set are now required, which will also inform upon the competing risk of antimicrobial resistance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Web supplement</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="thoraxjnl-2013-203207-s1.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d36e898" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The ORBIT-2 study group (all of whom recruited subjects and performed study related procedures) included Conroy Wong, Middlemore Hospital, Auckland, New Zealand; Gregory King, Woolcock Institute of Medical Research, Sydney, Australia; Paul King, Monash Medical Centre, Melbourne, Australia; Rob Stirling, The Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, Australia; Peter Wark, Centre for Asthma and Respiratory Disease, University of Newcastle, Newcastle, Australia; John Gillies, formerly of P3 Research, Tauranga, New Zealand.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> IG, PB, DC, DJS, DB and ADS participated in study design; DJS, PJT, JK and HG recruited study subjects and conducted study procedures; PB, IG, DC and DJS analysed and interpreted the results; DJS drafted and wrote the paper; all authors reviewed and revised the paper.
