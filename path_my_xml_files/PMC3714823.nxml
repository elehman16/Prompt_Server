Therefore, one of the ideal properties of a root-end filling material is its apical sealing ability.</p><p>Several materials have been suggested as root-end filling materials; however, each of these materials has its own limitations.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] In recent decades, mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA), suggested as a root-end filling material by Torabinejad[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] has been marketed as gray-colored (GMTA) and white-colored (WMTA). Both these materials are composed of Portland cement, bismuth oxide, and gypsum.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] The most notable difference between gray and white ProRoot MTA is the disparity in concentrations of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, MgO, and, especially, FeO.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] MTA has been broadly examined, and the experiments have resulted in interesting outcomes. This material is reported to have less dye and bacterial leakage, and better adaptation than amalgam, Super-EBA and IRM.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] Although associated with some drawbacks such as extended setting time, difficult handling and high price, MTAs have become the gold standard for root-end filling, primarily because of their ideal characteristics.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] As a result of virtually the same chemical composition, MTA and Portland cement demonstrate similar physical properties, antimicrobial activity, and biocompatibility (the only difference in the composition of these materials is that Portland cement does not contain bismuth, and this results in a lack of radiopacity in this material).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] Based on this similarity, we have viewed the reported properties of Portland cement as a reference, since the manufacturers of MTA have confirmed that Portland cement is one of the components. If Portland cement proves to be an appropriate root-end filling material, it can be an alternative for MTA since it has some advantages such as low cost.</p><p>Recently, calcium-enriched mixture (CEM) cement consisting of different calcium compounds (e.g., calcium oxide, calcium phosphate, calcium carbonate, calcium silicate, calcium sulfate, calcium hydroxide and calcium chloride) has been suggested as a proper root-end filling medicament[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] with physical properties conforming to ISO 6876:2001. CEM cement shows favorable results such as good performance in apexogenesis, treatment of inflammatory external root resorption, and obturation of immature necrotic teeth.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] As a root-end filling material, it takes part in regeneration of periapical tissue.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] It also has better biocompatibility and antibacterial effects than those of MTA.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] When used as a root-end medicament, CEM stimulates hard-tissue healing and forms a seal as effective as MTA.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] In comparison to MTA, CEM has an increased flow, decreased working time, appropriate setting time and suitable handling characteristics, and sets in aqueous environments more easily.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>] However, the sealing ability of CEM cement when used as root-end filling material has not been examined yet.</p><p>The main challenge in laboratory-based leakage testing is designing a reliable experimental procedure that can be easily repeated and will clearly result in conclusion. In an attempt to solve this problem, different methods such as dye and bacterial leakage methods have been suggested to assess the sealing of different root-end filling materials.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>] The aim of this <italic>in vitro</italic> study was to assess bacterial and dye microleakage of four different root-end filling materials and to evaluate the agreement degree between these two methods.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Selection and standardization of the samples</title><p>Fifty-four single-rooted teeth, extracted for different periodontal problems were selected for this <italic>in vitro</italic> experimental study. Teeth were stored in distilled water and thymol (0.2%) until use. Preoperative radiographs of each tooth were taken to confirm the presence of a single canal and a fully formed apex, and the lack of internal or external resorption, calcification, or root caries. Standard infection control protocols were followed during all phases of the study. Their surfaces were scaled to remove calculus and were immersed in NaOCl 5.25% for 1 h in order to remove organic tissue. Afterwards, the teeth were rinsed with and stored in normal saline. Using a #012 long-fissure bur (Mani Inc., Tochigi-ken, Japan) in a high-speed handpiece with water spray, the crowns were removed above Cementoenamel junction (CEJ) level, perpendicular to the long axis of the tooth. Root length was standardized to 13 mm (from root apex to coronal border).</p><p>After initial radiographs, root canals were instrumented to the master apical file #40 (Dentsply/Maillefer, Ballaigues, Switzerland) using step back technique under thorough irrigation of 2.5% sodium hypochlorite. The canals got completely prepared by cleaning and shaping up to the file #80. Each root canal was instrumented at 1 mm short of the radiographic apex. Root canals were dried with paper points (Aryadent, Tehran, Iran), and obturated with gutta-percha (Diadent, Seoul, Korea) and AH26 sealer (Dentsply, DeTrey, Konstanz, Germany) by the lateral condensation method. Afterwards, the sealer set completely for 24 h in an incubator under a 99% humidity atmosphere at 37&#x000b0;C. A high-speed handpiece with a #008 diamond-fissure bur (Mani Inc., Tochigi-ken, Japan) under a continuous water spray was used to cut off the apical 3 mm of each root-end perpendicular to the long axis of the tooth; 3-mm-deep root-end cavities were prepared using a #008 diamond-fissure bur. Then, the apical preparation was irrigated with 1 ml of normal saline and dried with paper points. The roots were then randomly divided into four study groups of 12 each and two control groups of three each. Root-end cavities were filled with either one of the studied materials: WMTA (ProRoot MTA, Densply Tulsa Dental, Tulsa, OK), GMTA (ProRoot MTA, Densply Tulsa Dental, Tulsa, OK), Portland Cement Type IV (Isfahan cement, Isfahan, Iran) or CEM cement. All materials were prepared according to their instructions, were placed by using an MTA carrier (Sybro Endo, Orange, CA, USA), and were packed with a cotton pellet. A cotton pellet moistened with sterile distilled water was placed and incrementally placed up to preparation surface level. All teeth were placed in 99% humidity at 37&#x000b0;C for 24 h to allow complete setting of retrofill materials. The setting of materials was checked by an explorer. Except the end-prepared portion of the root, external surfaces of roots were entirely coated with two layers of nail polish (Max Factor, Cosmetics and Fragrances, Los Angeles, CA, USA) to prevent penetration of dye and bacteria through dentinal tubules and accessory canals. Gutta-percha was then removed using Hedstrom file and reamer (Dentsply, Maillefer, Ballaigues, Switzerland).</p><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Positive controls</title><p>The three teeth in this group were not filled after cavity preparation.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-2"><title>Negative controls</title><p>The canals and root-end cavities were filled with sticky wax.

The 1.5 mm end of three-millimeter micropipettes (Supa Co., Tehran, Iran) was cut, and the tooth was placed in the cap end part. Sticky wax was then used to fill in the space between tooth and micropipette.</p><p>The system was sterilized using ethylene oxide gas and placed in sterile test tube containing 10 ml sterile TSB (Trypticase Soy Broth) (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), whose diameter was equal to that of micropipettes in order to make a firm fit. The aim of this process was to limit the pathway between the microbial reservoir and TSB to the root canal [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>].

All the samples were prepared with such concentration and induction. After that, the samples were incubated at 37&#x000b0;C.

The study was performed for a period of 70 days, a duration that seems to be suitable according to the Torabinejad, <italic>et al</italic>., study.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>] Using two methods of leakage measurement helped us to gather more information, and to have a comparison between two methods. Dye leakage method determines material adaptation along the canal walls, and, because of the small size of dyes, it may demonstrate bacterial byproduct penetration. On the other hand, bacterial leakage measurements evaluate the sealing ability of all portions against bacteria.</p><p>Different types of bacteria have been used in different studies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>] In this study <italic>E. faecalis</italic> was used, mainly because it is the prime bacterium in chronic apical periodontitis and failed root canal treatment.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>] While some other studies have used other bacteria instead of <italic>E. faecalis</italic>, their results are in agreement with ours in demonstrating a not significant difference between GMTA and WMTA in terms of bacterial leakage.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>] Studies on leakage in Portland cement cases have reported incompatible results. In one study, Portland cement and MTA had same leakages, while some other studies have reported less leakage for MTA than for Portland cement, which is in agreement with our study.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>]</p><p>In the present study, the mean times for microbial leakage in different material groups were close in the 70 days of observation. The trends after the 70<sup>th</sup> day were not followed; however, by using Kaplan-Meier calculations we could complete our data for the days after the 70<sup>th</sup> day. The results of survival analysis showed that the behavior of these materials diverges after 70 days such that there would be a significant difference between GMTA and CEM cement and also Portland cement. In regard to the time of bacterial leakage, Estrela <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] have reported different results on MTA and Portland cement. These differences can be explained by the use of different types of Portland cement, or different bacteria in the experiments.</p><p>Our results are consistent with those of Islami, <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>] in that no significant difference was observed among dye leakages of GMTA, WMTA, and Portland cement. Some studies have reported that there was no complete dye leakage in GMTA, WMTA, and Portland cements.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>] These differences in results may be attributed to the upper position of the dye to the root-end filling material, or to the role of gravitational force in reinforcing the penetration process.</p><p>The microleakage of CEM cement, which is comparable with MTA and Portland cement, indicates its good apical sealing. Due to the other good properties of this material such as biocompatibility,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] antibacterial[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>] and low cytotoxic effect,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] flow ability, good clinical handling,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>] CEM cement is suggested as a proper root-end filling material.</p><p>It is not yet determined whether we can simulate the penetration of bacteria and their byproducts in apical periodontitis with dye leakage method. Kersten, <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>] showed that the smaller the dye molecules, the more they can penetrate. As a result, one may conclude that dye molecules that are significantly smaller than bacteria, are capable of a deeper penetration.</p><p>Surprisingly, in dye microleakage studies, dye did not completely penetrate between the sealing material and tooth, even after two weeks. One reason for such a phenomenon might be the presence of air bubbles that can inhibit the penetration process.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref>] In our study, dye was placed over root-end filling material so that gravity force could enhance the act of penetration. Even with such an arrangement, dye penetration was less than that of bacteria. Barthel <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref>] have listed some possible causes for this phenomenon. For example, in a clinical condition, several factors such as pH, temperature, or ionic charge, are altered with bacteria; however, these situations cannot be simulated with the dye method. Moreover, the bacteria's ability for active movement and growth, and their ability to change their shape and size, will consequently result in more penetration.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>There was a poor agreement between the dye and bacterial leakage methods; therefore, bacterial leakage cannot be predicted by dye leakage results. It can be concluded that CEM cement provides leakage results comparable to other commonly used root-end filling materials such as WMTA. However, further <italic>ex vivo</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> studies are needed to assess other properties of this novel material.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>This study was supported by the Iranian Center for Endodontic Research, Dental Research Center, Shahid Beheshti Medical University, Tehran, Iran.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> This study was supported by the Iranian Center for Endodontic Research, Dental Research Center, Shahid Beheshti Medical University, Tehran, Iran</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Torabinejad</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Eby</surname><given-names>WC</given-names></name><name><surname>Naidorf</surname><given-names>IJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Inflammatory and immunological aspects of the pathogenesis of human periapical lesions</article-title><source>J Endod</source><year>1985</year><volume>11</volume><fpage>479</fpage><lpage>88</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">3913729</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Khayat</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>SJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Torabinejad</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Human saliva penetration of coronally unsealed obturated root canals</article-title><source>J Endod</source><year>1993</year><volume>19</volume><fpage>458</fpage><lpage>61</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">8263453</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Asgary</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Eghbal</surname><given-names>MJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Parirokh</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Sealing ability of a novel endodontic cement as a root-end filling material</article-title><source>J Biomed Mater Res A</source><year>2008</year><volume>87</volume><fpage>706</fpage><lpage>9</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">18200558</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Abdal</surname><given-names>AK</given-names></name><name><surname>Retief</surname><given-names>DH</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The apical seal via the retrosurgical approach.
