Cytomegalovirus genotyping results from a phase 2 trial comparing brincidofovir to placebo for prophylaxis against cytomegalovirus infection in hematopoietic cell transplant recipients provided initial data on the clinical resistance profile for brincidofovir. In this study, no known resistance-associated mutations were detected in brincidofovir-treated subjects; identified genotypic substitutions did not confer resistance to cytomegalovirus antivirals in vitro, suggesting that these changes represent polymorphisms unrelated to brincidofovir resistance. Lack of evidence for genotypic resistance during prophylaxis suggests that first-line use of brincidofovir for prevention of cytomegalovirus infection may preserve downstream options for patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>brincidofovir</kwd><kwd>cytomegalovirus</kwd><kwd>CMV</kwd><kwd>stem cell transplantation</kwd><kwd>CMV phosphotransferase</kwd><kwd>UL97</kwd><kwd>CMV (DNA) polymerase</kwd><kwd>UL54</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="funding-1"><funding-source>Chimerix and the Department of Veterans Affairs research funds</funding-source><award-id>I01-BX00925</award-id></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is an enveloped, double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) virus that infects most people worldwide by adulthood and establishes a latent infection. It is a major cause of morbidity and mortality among immunocompromised individuals, especially those who have undergone allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) [<xref rid="JIW073C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Prevention of CMV reactivation or new infection with antivirals has been a goal for HCT recipients since proof of concept was established for ganciclovir (GCV); however, neutropenia and other adverse events have prevented the prophylactic use of current antivirals for prevention of CMV infection in HCT recipients [<xref rid="JIW073C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="JIW073C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Four antiviral drugs are currently available for the prevention and/or treatment of CMV infections: GCV; the GCV prodrug, valganciclovir (vGCV); cidofovir (CDV); and foscarnet (FOS). None are approved for prophylaxis against CMV infection in HCT recipients because of inadequate risk and benefit trade-offs.</p><p>Current CMV-associated antivirals target CMV DNA polymerase, encoded by <italic>UL54</italic>, although GCV is first converted to the monophosphate by CMV-encoded UL97 kinase before it is phosphorylated by cellular enzymes to the active triphosphate [<xref rid="JIW073C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="JIW073C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Therefore, CMV resistance to currently available antivirals maps to <italic>UL54</italic> or, in the case of GCV, to both <italic>UL54</italic> and <italic>UL97</italic>; mutations in <italic>UL97</italic> are detected in approximately 90% of GCV-resistant clinical isolates [<xref rid="JIW073C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="JIW073C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Brincidofovir (BCV; CMX001; phosphonic acid, [[(S)-2-(4-amino-2-oxo-1(2H)-pyrimidinyl)-1-(hydroxymethyl)ethoxy]methyl]mono[3-(hexadecyloxy)propyl] ester) is an orally bioavailable lipid acyclic nucleoside phosphonate that is converted intracellularly into the active antiviral moiety, cidofovir diphosphate (CDV-PP), that serves as an alternate substrate inhibitor of CMV DNA replication [<xref rid="JIW073C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="JIW073C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. BCV has demonstrated broad antiviral activity in vitro against dsDNA viruses and is currently in development for the treatment of adenovirus infection, prevention of CMV infection, and treatment of smallpox. While BCV has a spectrum of antiviral activity similar to that of CDV, it is typically 100-fold more potent in vitro [<xref rid="JIW073C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="JIW073C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. For example, the median concentration that effectively reduced in vitro replication of wild-type human CMV (AD169) by 50% was 1 nM for BCV, 400 nM for CDV, and 3800 nM for GCV in a direct comparison [<xref rid="JIW073C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>In vitro, prolonged (10 months) serial passage with BCV selected for a unique mutation (D542E) in <italic>UL54</italic> that was associated with slower CMV replication and resistance to BCV and CDV [<xref rid="JIW073C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Mutations in <italic>UL97</italic> associated with GCV resistance do not affect in vitro susceptibility to BCV or CDV, but most mutations in <italic>UL54</italic> that are associated with resistance to GCV also encode resistance to CDV and BCV [<xref rid="JIW073C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="JIW073C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Similarly, data from an expanded-access study that enrolled subjects for treatment of resistant and refractory CMV disease (Study 350) suggest that <italic>UL97</italic> mutations have minimal effect on virologic response to BCV, while <italic>UL54</italic> mutations associated with CDV resistance diminish virologic response to BCV [<xref rid="JIW073C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>In a phase 2 trial (CMX001-201), BCV demonstrated a dose-response relationship for the prevention of CMV infection in adult allogeneic HCT recipients, with BCV 100 mg twice weekly showing statistically significant differences from placebo with respect to the proportion of patients with plasma CMV DNA levels of &#x02265;200 copies/mL at the end of treatment assessment (10% vs 37%; <italic>P</italic> = .002) [<xref rid="JIW073C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. To better understand the BCV resistance profile in the context of CMV prevention, we evaluated data from study CMX001-201 to investigate whether substitutions in CMV polymerase were associated with antiviral resistance. Understanding the resistance and cross-resistance profiles of CMV-associated antivirals is critical for optimizing the clinical utility of these agents.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study Population, Clinical Design, and Selection of Samples for Analysis</title><p>CMX001-201 (clinical trials registration: NCT00942305) was a phase 2, multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study of BCV in adult allogeneic HCT recipients seropositive for CMV [<xref rid="JIW073C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. BCV dosing was distributed over 5 cohorts: recipients of 40 mg once weekly, recipients of 100 mg once weekly or twice weekly, and recipients of 200 mg once weekly or twice weekly; each cohort had an embedded placebo group. Dosing was initiated following engraftment and continued to week 13 after transplantation. CMX001-201 enrolled 171 subjects who received BCV and 59 subjects who received placebo. CMV genotyping (Viracor-IBT 5600) was attempted for plasma samples from 11 of 25 subjects (44%) from the BCV 40 mg once weekly cohort, 8 of 27 (30%) from the BCV 100 mg once weekly cohort, 16 of 39 (41%) from the BCV 200 mg once weekly cohort, 14 of 50 (28%) from the BCV 100 mg twice weekly cohort, 9 of 30 (30%) from the BCV 200 mg twice weekly cohort, and 26 of 59 (44%) from the placebo arm (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="JIW073F1">1</xref>). Among subjects with a confirmed viremia level of &#x02265;200 copies/mL during the treatment phase of the trial, CMV genotyping was attempted for 40 of 41 subjects (98%) from the BCV-treated cohorts, and sequences from 34 of 41 (83%) were obtained. In addition, genotyping was attempted for 20 of 27 subjects (74%) from the placebo-treated cohort, and sequences were obtained from 19 of 27 (70%). Genotyping was also attempted for 18 subjects who received BCV, and 6 who received placebo who did not have a confirmed viremia level of &#x02265;200 copies/mL during the treatment phase of the trial (sequences from 10 and 3 subjects, respectively, were obtained). These latter subjects had an unconfirmed viral load of &#x02265;200 copies/mL during treatment and/or had CMV viremia in the posttreatment phase of the trial. Sequencing failure was primarily attributable to a CMV viremia level of &#x0003c;500 copies/mL. Conduct of CMX001-201 followed the human experimentation guidelines of the Department of Health and Human Services, and informed consent was obtained from all subjects.

For the remaining 12 subjects, 10 sequence variants were found in 1 subject each and were located in nonconserved regions, suggesting that they also represent polymorphisms unrelated to drug resistance. Two mutations were identified for in vitro phenotyping: one in a conserved region, although the specific residue is not conserved (M827I in <italic>UL54</italic> region III) and another that occurred in &#x0003e;1 subject (R1052C) and had been previously reported in a CDV drug-resistant clinical isolate that carried additional mutations in <italic>UL97</italic> and <italic>UL54</italic> [<xref rid="JIW073C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Three subjects who received BCV had a detectable CMV variant carrying R1052C plus the polymorphisms A885T and S897L, and 1 of these subjects had all of these sequence variants detected at baseline.

The other 2 subjects had undetectable CMV plasma viremia at baseline, so it was not possible to determine their baseline CMV genotype. Both subjects had the R1052C mutation detected at the first time point after viral breakthrough, at weeks 5 and 6 of BCV dosing at 100 mg once weekly and 200 mg once weekly, respectively. One of these subjects subsequently initiated CDV therapy, while the other initiated vGCV therapy.

This subject had a plasma viremia level of 21 000 copies/mL at week 5 and 700 copies/mL at week 4 post-BCV therapy following 4 weeks of GCV therapy (1.5 log<sub>10</sub> copies/mL decrease).</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Phenotypic Analysis of Candidate RAMs</title><p>The 2 mutations identified for subsequent in vitro phenotyping (M827I and R1052C) were evaluated by marker transfer.

While this sequence covers all known <italic>UL54</italic> RAMs, it is possible that other substitutions outside of this region may be selected by BCV. Resistance analysis in all clinical studies following study CMX001-201 in which CMV is a primary or secondary end point will include sequencing of the entire <italic>UL54</italic> gene. The results from this analysis should not be extended to CMV therapy-experienced subjects and/or subjects with a high plasma CMV load at baseline, when preexisting resistance is more likely. Results from CMX001-201 suggest that preventive therapy with BCV is not likely to select for RAMs to BCV, CDV, GCV, or FOS when used as prophylaxis in CMV-seropositive HCT recipients, preserving future options for patients.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Notes</title><p><bold><italic>Acknowledgments.&#x02003;</italic></bold>We thank Gail Marousek, Benjamin Houser, and Ronald J.
