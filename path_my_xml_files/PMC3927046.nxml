respiratory functions by applying both abdominal stimulation and inspiratory muscle
training (IMT) to train the inspiratory muscle and the expiratory muscle simultaneously,
to improve the efficiency of IMT of chronic stroke patients. [Subjects] Eighteen stroke
patients were randomly assigned to an experimental group (n = 9) and a control group (n =
9). [Methods] The experimental group was administered IMT with abdominal stimulation, and
the control group was administered only IMT. During the intervention period, the
experimental group and control group received training 20&#x02005;min/day, 3 times/wk, for 4
weeks. To examine the lung functions of the subjects, FVC, FEV<sub>1</sub>, PEF, and
FEF<sub>25&#x02013;75</sub> were measured using an electronic spirometer. The diaphragm
thickness ratio was calculated from measurements made with a 7.5-MHz linear probe
ultrasonic imaging system. [Result] The experimental group and the control group showed
significant increases in diaphragm thickness ratio on the paretic side, but not on the
non-paretic side. With regard to lung function, the experimental group showed significant
increases in FEV<sub>1</sub>, PEF, and FEF<sub>25&#x02013;75</sub>. The changes between before and
after the intervention in the two groups were compared with each other, and the results
showed significant differences in FEV<sub>1</sub> and PEF. [Conclusion] The present study
identified that IMT accompanied by abdominal stimulation improved the pulmonary function
of chronic stroke patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Abdominal stimulation</kwd><kwd>Inspiratory muscle training</kwd><kwd>Stroke</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The decline in respiratory function of stroke patients is caused by reduced physical
activity. The decline in cardiopulmonary function is related to reduced oxygen transport
ability caused by extended bed rest after hospitalization<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. This condition can cause stroke patients who require intensive
rehabilitation to tire easily during aerobic activities requiring endurance, thereby
restricting their performance of daily living activities. Consequently, the success rate of
rehabilitation drops because functional recovery is hindered<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In a study conducted by Khedr et al.<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>,
40% of stroke patients showed decreases in diaphragm displacement. The results of analysis
of lung function show only 50% of the values expected of normal adults<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Among the
different types of training used to improve respiratory functions, inspiratory muscle
training (IMT) improves inspiratory muscle strength and endurance, regardless of damage to
the inspiratory muscles, by applying loads to the diaphragm and the accessory muscles of the
inspiratory muscles<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. It was reported that
IMT performed by subacute stroke patients for six months improved lung function, maximal
inspiratory pressure (MIP), exercise tolerance, and pulmonary function indexes<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. In a study conducted by Britto et al.<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup> of chronic stroke patients, IMT for eight
weeks improved MIP and inspiratory muscular endurance (IME).</p><p>Gollee et al.<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that
neuromuscular stimulation of the abdominal muscles supported respiration and the application
of simple surface stimulation to major paralyzed expiratory muscles induced even muscle
contraction, thus helping to improve cough and forced expiration. It was reported that
abdominal muscle stimulation improved respiratory functions during expiration, because the
contraction of the abdominal muscles caused by stimulation induces increased coughing and
directly increases MIP to improve expiratory flow<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Gollee et al.<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>
also reported that abdominal muscle stimulation could improve conditions in which
respiratory rates increase because of decreased lung volume. Abdominal muscle stimulation
also improved lung function of paretic patients with decreased functional residual capacity
(FRC) and elastic recoil during inspiration<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that among the methods used to improve the respiratory function
of stroke patients, IMT is an excellent intervention for improving inspiratory muscle
strength and endurance<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, it has
had limited success at directly improving forced expiration. In addition, abdominal muscle
stimulation induced improvement in forced expiration of patients with nervous system
disorders, showing decline in respiratory function caused by respiratory air passage
obstruction or decreased forced expiration.</p><p>The present study aimed to verity more efficient IMT method, the IMT used in clinics with
abdominal muscle stimulation, and identify the effects of the new IMT method on the
improvement of the respiratory function of chronic stroke patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The participants were eighteen stroke patients (11 males, 7 females) who voluntarily
consented to participate in the study. They had a full understanding of its objective and
consented to participation. They were randomly and equally divided into two groups: an
experimental group and a control group. The experimental group received abdominal
stimulation while performing inspiratory muscle training, and the control group only
performed inspiratory muscle training. Both groups performed the training 3 times per week,
non-consecutively, for 4 weeks.</p><p>This study was approved by the Kangwon National University Institutional Review Board. The
average age, height, weight, and body mass index (BMI) of the experimental group were
54.44&#x02005;years, 159.86&#x02005;cm, 63.68&#x02005;kg, and 24.82&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup>, respectively, and the average time since
stroke onset was 40.55 months. The average age, height, weight, and body mass index (BMI) of
the control group were 55.88&#x02005;years, 158.7&#x02005;cm, 62.32&#x02005;kg, and 24.71&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup>,
respectively, and the average time since stroke onset was 46.22 months.</p><p>The subjects of the present study were patients who had been diagnosed with stroke using
computed tomography and had hemiplegia as a sequela of partial damage of the cerebral
hemisphere. The following exclusion criteria were stroke patients who had had the disease
for at least six month or were receiving physical therapy in hospital but not receiving any
particular treatment for rehabilitation.</p><p>Lung-function was measured with a spirometer (CHESTGRAPH HI 101, Chest M.I. Inc., Japan). A
full explanation accompanied by a demonstration was given to the participants in advance.
Lung function was examined three times, and the results of reliability were chosen for the
analysis. The subjects maintained an upright sitting position, and the measurement values
included FVC, FEV<sub>1</sub>, the PEF, and FEF<sub>25&#x02013;75</sub>.</p><p>Changes in the diaphragm thickness were analyzed using ultrasonography (Logiq 7, GE Co.,
USA). For all subjects, the mid axillary lines between ribs 8 and 9 on both sides were
checked in a standing posture, then the chest wall was perpendicularly illuminated by a
linear transducer (5.0&#x02013;14.0&#x02005;MHz) in an upright sitting position to observe the region
between rib 8 and rib 9 in 2D images. The diaphragm thickness was measured as the distance
between two parallel lines that appear bright in the middle of the pleura and in the middle
peritoneum. The distance was measured three times, and the average value was calculated<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The diaphragm thickness ratio (TR) was calculated. The formula of Enright et al.<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup> formula was used to obtain standardized
diaphragm thickness ratios (TR). TR= (Diaphragm thickness during MIP maneuver of FRC/Mean
thickness while relaxing at FRC).</p><p>Abdominal stimulation was applied when the subject was sitting with 90&#x000b0; hip flexion. A
functional electrical stimulator (Microstim, Medel GmBH, Germany) was used. The adhesive
surface electrodes (PROTENS electrodes 48 &#x000d7; 48&#x02005;mm, Biopro-Tech Inc, Korea) were attached to
the abdominal muscles (rectus abdominis muscle, lateral abdominal muscle)<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. The electricity used had symmetric biphasic rectangular waveforms, a
pulse duration of 250&#x02005;&#x000b5;s, a frequency of 40&#x02005;Hz, a maximum output of 90 mA, and a stimulation
intensity ranging from 10 to 30 mA. The stimulation began at low intensity and was gradually
increased. Stimulation time per session was 20 minutes (current flowing time 5 seconds, no
current flowing time 5 seconds, and gradient variation 2.5 seconds).</p><p>Using a threshold IMT device (Threshold Inspiratory Muscle Trainer, Respironics Health
Scan, Inc., USA) during an expiration after one inspiration, the patient pressed the current
flowing switch with his/her hand on the non-paretic side to induce expiration while
stimulation was applied to the abdominal region<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. The therapist helped if a patient had difficulty pressing the
switch because of a coordination disorder. For both othe groups, IMT was identically
performed with 30% of the maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) for 20 minutes per session,
three times per week for four weeks, a total of 12 times.</p><p>Data obtained from the two groups of subjects were analyzed using SPSS 18.0 (SPSS Inc.,
Chicago, IL, USA). Data are presented as medians (interquartile range). Because of the small
size of the study sample, non-parametric tests were used, and between-group comparisons were
performed using the Mann&#x02013;Whitney U-test. Within-group comparisons were made using Wilcoxon&#x02019;s
signed rank test. The level of statistical significance was chosen as &#x003b1;=0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Changes in lung function found after the four-week intervention are shown in <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title> The values of the variables measured before and after the intervention

residual capacity or decrease in the lung volume of stroke patients causes weakening of the
inspiratory muscle and the expiratory muscle. The muscles necessary for maintaining posture
and the muscles that act during breathing are closely related. The difficulties of stroke
patients in maintaining posture and their deteriorated trunk stability cause the weakening
of the expiratory muscles that maintain posture<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Because these expiratory muscles are weak, patients with abdominal
muscle paresis, including stroke, experience inability to clean the air passage and are
prone to respiratory infections<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Therefore, Gollee et al.<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup> suggested
applying neuromuscular stimulation to the abdominal muscles to help the contraction of the
major expiratory muscles and to increase expiratory flows and tidal volumes, in order to
improve respiration function.</p><p>The present study examined a method designed to combine IMT with abdominal muscle
stimulation to improve forced expiration. In order to examine the effects of the new IMT
method, the new method was performed by the experimental group, whereas only IMT was
performed by the control group. Moreover, the abdominal stimulation was applied in order to
strengthen the expiratory muscle in order to try to improve the cost and time efficiency of
using IMT devices with other types of devices, as well as to avoid interrupting subject&#x02019;s
breathing patterm.</p><p>Enright et al.<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that when the
effects of IMT were checked in healthy adults, diaphragm thicknesses and TR at maximal
inspiration showed significant increases after exercises lasting for eight weeks. A previous
study that conducted IMT for cystic fibrosis patients reported that diaphragm thicknesses
and TR at maximal inspiration showed significant increases<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the present study, the TR of the diaphragm on the paretic side
showed significant increases in both the experimental group and the control group,
consistent with the results of previous studies. The values of TR also increased on the
non-paretic side although this increase was not statistically significant.</p><p>Sutbeyaz et al.<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup> divided subacute stroke
patients into an IMT group, a breathing retraining group, and a control group. They
conducted interventions six times per week for six weeks and compared lung function among
the groups. Their results showed significant increases in FVC, FEV<sub>1,</sub>
FEF<sub>25&#x02013;75,</sub> and maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP), but no increase in PEF in the
inspiratory muscle-training group. In a study conducted by Britto et al.<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>, MIP and IME (inspiratory muscular
endurance) were measured after IMT, and showed significant increases. In a study conducted
by Enright et al.<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>, a group which
performed IMT showed significant increases in TLC (total lung capacity) and VC (vital
capacity), but not in FVC and FEV<sub>1</sub>. Moreover, in a study conducted by Fregonezi
et al.<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>, the IMT group showed no
significant changes in FVC, FEV<sub>1</sub>, or TLC.</p><p>Interpreting the results of these previous studies, although IMT shows clear effects on TR,
and MIP, the effects of IMT on lung function are inconsistent. In particular, we identified
that the effects of IMT are not strong enough to improve forced expiration. Therefore, in
the present study, in order to improve forced expiration, abdominal stimulation was applied
during IMT.</p><p>Our results show significant increases in FEV1, PEF, and FEF<sub>25&#x02013;75</sub> and the
changes in FEV<sub>1</sub> and PEF showed significant differences between the two groups.
These results were similar to the results of a study conducted by Cheng et al.<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>, who reported significant increases in
FVC, FEV<sub>1</sub>, and PEF after applying abdominal stimulation for four weeks. In a
study conducted by Lee et al.<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>,
stimulation was applied to the anterior and posterolateral regions of the abdomen. Their
results showed significant increases in FVC, FEV<sub>1</sub>, and PEF, which is consistent
with the results of the present study. Therefore, abdominal stimulation reeducates the
expiratory muscles, improves muscle strength and endurance, and induces powerful contraction
of the expiratory muscles through repetitive afferent stimulation of the abdominal muscles,
thereby increasing intra-abdominal pressure, facilitating upward movement of the diaphragm
and decreasing pleural pressure and lung volume, thereby improving expiratory and sputum
discharge abilities<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>If IMT were performed by stroke patients with pulmonary function problems resulting from
damage to the respiratory muscles caused by stroke and reduced exercise capacity, abdominal
muscle stimulation would improve respiratory function. However, we admit this study had some
limitations. The researchers conducted a four-week experiment, and due to the short period
of experiment, it was difficult to examine the positive effects on lung function (FVC) of
the experimental and control groups. For this reason, it will be necessary to conduct long
term experiments that include a more comprehensive analysis of the impact of abdominal
stimulation during IMT intervention on chronic stroke patients.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Kashihara</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Haruna</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Suzuki</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Effects of mild supine exercise during 20 days bed rest on
