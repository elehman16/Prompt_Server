The pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and safety profile of two dexlansoprazole 30 mg ODTs were compared with one dexlansoprazole 60 mg capsule in this randomized, phase I, open-label, single-center, multiple-dose, two-period crossover study.</p></sec><sec id="section2-1756283X16666800"><title>Methods:</title><p>Participants were randomized in one of two treatment sequences, each comprised two 5-day treatment periods during which two dexlansoprazole 30 mg ODTs or one 60 mg capsule was administered once daily. Pharmacokinetic parameters and the mean intragastric pH profile for the 24-hour period after dosing on days 1 and 5 were described.

Systemic exposure, measured by the area under the plasma concentration&#x02013;time curve (AUC), was approximately 25% lower after ODT administration. On day 5, mean pH after daily doses of two 30 mg ODT or one 60 mg capsule was 4.33 and 4.36, respectively; both regimens maintained intragastric pH above 4.0 for 60% of the 24-hour period.

Unlike other drugs in this class, the PPI dexlansoprazole is formulated as a capsule with a dual delayed-release mechanism [<xref rid="bibr25-1756283X16666800" ref-type="bibr">Vakily <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bibr23-1756283X16666800" ref-type="bibr">Takeda Pharmaceuticals America, Inc., 2016</xref>]. According to the dual delayed-release mechanism, dexlansoprazole is first released 1&#x02013;2 hours after ingestion, followed by a second release within 4&#x02013;5 hours.

Most adverse events (49/52) were classified as mild, and the majority (38/52) were considered unrelated to the study drug. Headache, nausea, and dizziness occurred in five (9.6%), three (5.8%), and two (3.8%) participants, respectively, when receiving the two 30 mg ODTs. Headache, decubitus ulcer, oropharyngeal pain, and flatulence were reported in six (11.5%), three (5.8%), two (3.8%), and two (3.8%) participants when receiving the 60 mg capsule. Adverse events experienced by one (1.9%) participant included oropharyngeal pain and flatulence with the two ODTs and nausea with the capsule. There were no deaths or serious adverse events recorded, and no adverse events led to withdrawal from the study.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="section19-1756283X16666800"><title>Discussion</title><p>The relative bioavailability, safety profile, and pharmacodynamics of two dexlansoprazole 30 mg ODTs and a single 60 mg capsule were evaluated in this study. Both formulations employ a dual delayed-release mechanism and contain two types of enteric-coated granules that release drug at different pH values after dosing. The ODT and capsule formulations of 30 mg dexlansoprazole are approved for the treatment of heartburn associated with symptomatic nonerosive GERD for 4 weeks, and maintenance of healed EE and relief of heartburn for up to 6 months. Dexlansoprazole delayed-release capsules are also indicated for the healing of all grades of EE for up to 8 weeks when dosed at 60 mg once daily [<xref rid="bibr23-1756283X16666800" ref-type="bibr">Takeda Pharmaceuticals America, Inc., 2016</xref>].</p><p>Bioequivalence between the 30 mg dexlansoprazole ODT and the 30 mg dexlansoprazole capsule has been demonstrated by similar <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> (688 and 618 ng/ml for the ODT and capsule, respectively) and AUC values (3048 and 3212 ng&#x000b7;hour/ml for the ODT and capsule, respectively) [<xref rid="bibr14-1756283X16666800" ref-type="bibr">Kukulka <italic>et al</italic>. 2015</xref>].

An ODT alternative to a capsule may make PPI treatment easier for these patients.</p><p>In the present study comparing the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of two 30 mg ODTs with one dexlansoprazole 60 mg capsule, the systemic exposure (AUC) was roughly 25% lower in participants receiving the two ODTs than in participants receiving the capsule. Similar peak dexlansoprazole concentrations (<italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub>) were observed after ODT and capsule administration. On day 5, mean pH profiles after daily doses of two 30 mg ODT or one 60 mg capsule were similar; both regimens maintained intragastric pH above 4 for 60% of the 24-hour period. The pharmacokinetic profile of 60 mg dexlansoprazole administered as two ODTs or one capsule was not affected by multiple dosing, as the systemic exposure to dexlansoprazole was equivalent on days 1 and 5 for each formulation.</p><p>The reason for reduced bioavailability is unclear, but the equivalent pH control maintained after administration of two 30 mg ODTs compared with a single 60 mg capsule suggests that adequate exposure is achieved to maximize pharmacodynamic effect. Importantly, the intragastric pH profile over the 24-hour period after dosing of 60 mg dexlansoprazole was similar irrespective of ODT or capsule administration. Higher mean pH values were observed on day 5 than on day 1 for participants receiving dexlansoprazole ODT and capsule. This shift in pH after multiple daily dosing could be due to the cumulative acid-suppressive effect of PPIs. In the acidic environment of the gastric parietal cell, PPIs convert to active sulfenamides; the binding of sulfenamide to the proton pump results in acid secretion inhibition, and its prolonged binding after multiple dosing results in an accumulative inhibitory effect [<xref rid="bibr25-1756283X16666800" ref-type="bibr">Vakily <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>].</p><p>With regard to dexlansoprazole&#x02019;s safety profile, there were no differences in adverse events reported when either two 30 mg ODTs or one 60 mg capsule was administered, and there were no serious adverse events reported for either treatment regimen.</p><p>The findings from this study indicate that although the criterion for pharmacokinetic bioequivalence was not met due to the difference in AUC, the acid-suppressing activity of the dexlansoprazole 60 mg capsule can be achieved with administration of two dexlansoprazole 30 mg ODTs. The prescribing information for dexlansoprazole states that two 30 mg dexlansoprazole ODTs are not interchangeable with one 60 mg dexlansoprazole capsule, based on the reduced bioavailability observed with the administration of two 30 mg ODTs in this study [<xref rid="bibr23-1756283X16666800" ref-type="bibr">Takeda Pharmaceuticals America, Inc., 2016</xref>].
