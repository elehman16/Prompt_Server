behavior in recent centuries, fertility remains of
crucial importance and children play an important
role in cementing a marital relationship. Fertility,
as one of the major reasons for marriage, actually
results from human nature and introduces the concept
of eternal life (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Another concept, sterility,
as the opposite of fertility is defined as the inability
to bear offspring after a year of regular sexual activity
without contraception (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). This inability is
considered a failure and leads to the feeling of imperfection
in sexual identity. Sterility often causes
the person to feel a loss of control over one&#x02019;s life,
doubting one&#x02019;s manhood/womanhood and generally
damages self-confidence and health (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Highcosts
of treatment, constant anxiety about treatment
outcomes, exhaustion from visiting various clinics,
societal repercussions, confronting questions about
a childless marriage, potential distress during the
treatment and fear for missing the spouse or destruction
of the family are among the factors which
result in multiple psychological complications.
These complications include frustration, personal
conflict, disappointment, sharp decline in self-esteem,
isolation, identity crisis and loss of marital
adjustment (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Marital adjustment is a process
commonly composed of: i. Marital satisfaction, ii. Dyadic cohesion, iii. Consensus on matters of importance
to marital functioning, iv. Showing affection
and warmth toward the spouse and v. Sharing
intimacies (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Couples who are well-adjusted
gain great satisfaction out of the marital relationship
and think well of the spouse&#x02019;s habits. They
enjoy communicating with family and friends, and
ask their help with problems. These couples derive
immense sexual pleasure as well (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p><p>Sterility has physical, financial, emotional
and psychological impacts on a person (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).
Therefore it seriously undermines self-confidence
and results in a sexual identity crisis
which results in a decline in life quality (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).
Life quality has a wide range of definitions.
Some believe that it is the ability of an individual
to manage life from his/her standpoint,
as such, fertility status and its factors can put
social and psychological pressures on the person.
It lowers sexual pleasure and life satisfaction,
meaning a decline in quality (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Donald
considers quality of life as a descriptive term.
Quality of life is a perception that an individual
holds of their state of health which has a feeling
of contentment within, and is accompanied by
happiness and joy (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p><p>Downey and Mckinney (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) declared that women
who sought treatment for fertility problems suffered
from greater depression, anxiety and stress,
along with decreased dyadic cohesion. Most researchers
reported increased marital quarrels
among infertile couples, which in some cases led
to separation (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Decreasing familial disputes
and striving to gratify the partner&#x02019;s desires could
alleviate these problems (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p><p>In this regard, a host of researches have confirmed
efficacy of couples therapy for decreasing
marital conflicts (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). As emotions play a
central role in infertile couples&#x02019; relationships,
the emotionally focused approach is employed
as short-term structured counseling of 9-20
sessions. This technique is used because it is a
branch of couples therapy and because it takes
advantage of emotions to develop the process.
This method addresses communication disorders,
marital discord, and persuades people to
express their emotions and talk over them. From
the standpoint of couples therapy, marital distress
is mostly caused by negative emotions and
attachment injuries (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).</p><p>A study on 120 infertile couples in East India
suggested that infertile men had problems
with their character and social interactions. On
the other hand, women displayed symptoms of
depression. The study indicated that infertility
spoiled gender concept, life quality, marital adjustment,
and sexual relationships of the couples
(<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Poor quality of marital relationship
was followed by a number of social and familial
troubles. Sterility along with other differences
and problems between couples challenged the
mind and social welfare of spouses. In general, a
low quality within the marital relationship could
be problematic when couples struggled with infertility
(<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>).</p><p>As a result, attention to psychological needs of
infertile couples is essential for successful infertility
treatment. Each partner requires support and
empathy while undergoing treatment (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). There
are a variety of practices to cope with psychological
reactions of infertility, among which is
emotionally focused therapy for couples (EFT-C)
which merges three approaches of systematic, humanistic
(empiricism) and attachment theory. This
therapy was founded by Johnson and Greenberg in
the early 1980s. Given the major role of emotions
in attachment theory, EFT-C emphasizes emotions
and employs them to organize interaction patterns
(<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Hence, EFT-C concentrates on the emotional
relationship of couples as a basis to tackle their
problems. EFT-C has a process of 9 steps as follows
(<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>):</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>Step 1:</label><p>Evaluation, making contact, and then

of behavior (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).</p></list-item></list><p>Thus, showing emotions and attachment needs
along with sincere fulfillment by the partner constitute
the process of EFT-C and are necessary for
change (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>).</p><p>In light of the points previously mentioned, the
current study intends to meet the necessity for enhancing
marital adjustment of infertile couples -
people who suffer from poor life quality and are
locked in marital disputes. In addition, the results
can serve as a practical map or a manual for counselors,
psychotherapists and family therapists to
raise their clients&#x02019; self-esteem and show mismatch
in communication methods between individuals.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This semi-experimental method with a pre- and
post-test design was conducted on a sample group
of 15 couples and a control group of the same
number. Initially, demographic characteristics of
the subjects were collected. Next, they were tested
prior to conducting the independent variable (EFTC).
According to Johnson&#x02019;s plan (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), couples in
the sample group underwent 10 EFT-C sessions of
120 minutes duration conducted twice per week.
By the end of the term, subjects were again tested.
To meet ethical standards, a compact course of 4
weeks was offered to volunteers from the control
group.</p><p>The sample population comprised couples married
for 10 years who attended infertility clinics
in pursuit of treatment during 2013. According to
purposive sampling, 30 couples (60 individuals)
were selected in terms of poor marital adjustment
and low sexual satisfaction. Couples were then divided
into two groups of 15 couples (15 men and
15 women); one as control group and another as
sample population.</p><p>Infertile couples attended fertility clinics. The
data-gathering tools were demographic characteristics
and World Health Organization (WHO)
quality of life questionnaires.</p><p>Data were analyzed using SPSS software (version
18) by application of the methods of mean
calculation plus minimum and maximum standard
deviation from descriptive statistics and analysis
of covariance from inferential statistics (alpha
0.81). In order to use analysis of covariance, first
the equality of variances was noted. Hence, the hypothesis
was examined by the Levin test. <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>

this protocol is emotionally-focused therapeutic
approach, which have been provided to the couple
during 10 sessions.</p><sec><title>Ethical consideration</title><p>In order to observe ethical considerations, a few
tutorial sessions were held over four weeks for the
control group that did not receive EFT-C.</p></sec><sec><title>Research tools</title><sec><title>Questionnaire of Demographic Characteristics:</title><p>This questionnaire comprised parameters of age,
gender, education level, occupation, income level,
cause of infertility, duration of infertility, duration
of marriage, number of surgeries, date of last surgery,
history of attending psychological or counseling
sessions, history of any chronic physical or
psychological disorders.</p></sec><sec><title>Spanier&#x02019;s Dayadic Adjustment Scale:</title><p>This scale
(<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) consists of 32 questions based on a Likert
approach of responding which measures the total
score of marital adjustment within a range of 0
to 15. People who score 101 or less, according to
Spanier, are supposed to be maladjusted and those
with higher scores are considered well-adjusted. In
a study by Hassan shahi (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), well-adjusted couples
had an average score of 114.7 &#x000b1; 17.8 whereas the
average score of maladjusted couples was 70.7 &#x000b1;
23.8. Spanier grouped the data into four subscales
of marital satisfaction, dyadic consensus, dyadic
cohesion, and affectional expression with evaluated
validity of 0.94, 0.90, 0.81 and 0.73. The entire
scale had a validity of 0.96. Reliability was 0.86
according to Pearson&#x02019;s correlation coefficients between
Spanier&#x02019;s scale and the Locke-Wallace Marital
Adjustment Scale. Hassan shahi (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) evaluated
the validity of Spanier&#x02019;s scale in Iran by calculating
the cohesion between the Locke-Wallace Marital
Adjustment Scale and Spanier&#x02019;s scale (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="T1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Johnson&#x02019;s Protocol of emotionally focused therapy (EFT-C) for infertile couples</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><th colspan="4" rowspan="1"><hr/></th></tr><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Step </th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Purpose </th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Session </th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">To do</th></tr><tr><th colspan="4" rowspan="1"><hr/></th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Identification </td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Collect general information about the couple;

positive effect on marital adjustment. There was
improvement in the dyadic satisfaction, dyadic cohesion,
dyadic consensus, affectional expression,
dimensions of life quality, physical and psychological
health, social relationships, and social surroundings
subscales. The difference was observed
between the control and sample groups as well as
between the pre- and post-test results. Findings
of this study were consistent with previous studies.
Aarts et al. (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>) through their research indicated
that scores of anxiety, depression, and poor
life quality in fertility clinics were related to each
other. Consideration of these factors could create
positive experiences. They concluded that EFT-C
could improve an infertile couple&#x02019;s quality of life
and decrease the level of anxiety and depression.
This influence has been attributed to the power
of emotions over marital relationships. Emotions
play a key role in an infertile couple&#x02019;s relationship
which deserves attention. It is recommended to apply
this approach for 9 to 20 structured sessions, as
it is both a branch of couples therapy and focuses
on emotions. EFT-C addresses communicative disorders
and maladjustment and encourages people
to speak about their emotions. From the standpoint
of EFT-C, marital distress originates from negative
emotions and attachment injuries.</p><p>The findings of present study were consistent
with results of studies by Soltani et al. (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>), Zuccarini
et al. (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>) and Vizheh et al. (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). According
to research by Soltani et al. (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>) on the influence
of EFT-C on couple intimacy in Shiraz, it was
suggested that EFT-C could improve emotional,
psychological, sexual, physical, communicative,
ethical and mental dimensions of couples. However
it had no effect on their spiritual and social
dimensions.</p><p>The results of present study corresponded with
findings of Michelle (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>) and Tie and Poulson (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>)
with respect to dyadic consensus. The results of
present study also matched findings of Pinto-Gouveia
et al. (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>) in terms of mutual affection.</p><p>Of note, infertile couples tend to express negative
and damaging feelings, remarks, sarcasm and
criticism rather than empathy while their spouse is
trying to deal with an issue (infertility). According
to Morin-Papunen and Koivunen (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>), marital
satisfaction of infertile couples is significantly
lower than fertile couples with regards to mutual
affection. Onat and Beji (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>), in an investigation
into the marital life and relationship of infertile
couples, have declared that the stress coming from
the inability to conceive negatively influenced the
couple&#x02019;s relationship. EFT-C could significantly
improve the sexual relationship of the partners.</p><p>With regards to physical health of the couples,
our findings were consistent with the results of research by Peterson et al. (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>) who stated that
counseling could improve physical and psychological
health of infertile couples. They asserted
that psychological counseling through persuasion
of the clients to continue with medical treatments
significantly improved both their psychological
status and physical health.</p><p>Our findings were also compatible with the results
of Naamen et al. (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>) which revealed that
social support and understanding played an important
role in psychological health of infertile
couples, which motivated the couples to continue
with infertility treatment and reduced the call for
divorce. Javidi et al. (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>) indicated that EFT-C had
influential effects on family functioning, inasmuch
as this protocol took advantage of a systematic approach
which refined the inflexible interaction patterns
of couples in distress and strengthened their
bonds. Soltani et al. (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>) concluded that EFT-C
was capable of promoting marital adjustment of
infertile couples.</p><p>Najafi et al. (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>) evaluated studies about questionnaires
of life quality among infertile couples.
Through screening all studies, they found 10 general
and 2 specialized inventories. Although no
meta-analysis was found, infertility negatively
influenced couples&#x02019; quality of life. This research
indicated that general questionnaires (SF-36,
WHO-QoL, and FERTI-QoL) were mostly used
for evaluation of infertile couples quality of life.</p><p>Ramezanzadeh et al. (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>) investigated the emotional
adjustment of infertile couples. They concluded
that people unable to conceive suffered
from psychiatric disorders (particularly stress and
depression) which led to emotional maladjustment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>EFT trains couples to give stronger support to
each other, corrects their patterns of behavior and
raises their accessibility accompanied by responsiveness
to the partner&#x02019;s needs in order to achieve
an optimal sexual relationship.</p><p>The present study showed that EFT-C significantly
increased satisfaction, cohesion, consensus
and affection expression of the partners. The life
quality of infertile couples remarkably grew which
was attributed to EFT-C. This method improved
the social relationships of infertile couples and
improved their physical and psychological health.
The findings have opened a window for family
therapists to conduct more practical and clear
counseling in order to improve their client&#x02019;s selfworth
and assist with self-disclosure, as well as
revision of wrong communicative patterns which
can lead to a decline in marital disputes and increase
in adjustment. In addition, the results have
shown that EFT-C has a significant effect on enhancement
of sexual satisfaction in infertile couples
by increasing physical sexual satisfaction as
well as emotional sexual satisfaction.</p><p>We recommend that similar research be conducted
with different populations (in addition to infertile
couples) that have diverse levels of education.
In addition, follow-ups should be conducted at
later months in order to compare the results.</p><p>Constraints of the study included the enrollment
of couples that had a minimum educational level
of a diploma. Hence, to generalize the results of
the present study to illiterate individuals, measures
of prudence should be taken. The study was
performed in one province. Generalization of the
findings to other statistical areas should be made
with caution.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to sincerely thank all
