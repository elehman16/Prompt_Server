However, dexmedetomidine was not found to improve other renal biomarkers after surgery. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first prospective study to report dexmedetomidine has a renal protective effect after pediatric open cardiac surgery.</p><p>A previous multicenter trial reported that a younger age, lower body weight, lower body surface area, and prolonged CPB time are risk factors of AKI after pediatric cardiac surgery.<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> In the present study, we only included 1- to 6-year-old patients with a simple atrial or VSD. Our patients did not have risk factors of AKI, and no patient suffered from clinically significant symptoms, signs of AKI, or needed treatment for AKI before surgery. Nonetheless, 44.8% of the patients enrolled experienced AKI fulfilling the AKIN criteria.<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> We also found renal function declined after weaning from CPB based on eGFR, RFI, FENa, and U<sub>NAG</sub>/Ucr ratio results, which suggests that post-bypass renal function decline is common even in low risk patients after pediatric cardiac surgery.</p><p>Dexmedetomidine is a highly selective &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-adreno-receptor agonist, which inhibits sympathetic outflow in the central nervous system and reduces norepinephrine release in presynaptic &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-receptor.<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> These sympatholytic activities of dexmedetomidine might help to prevent hemodynamic variations induced by sympathetic activation after cardiac surgery.<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> Furthermore, inhibition of circulating epinephrine and norepinephrine release by dexmedetomidine might protect renal function and stabilize hemodynamic profiles. A previous animal study revealed that &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-adrenoreceptor is widely distributed in the renal cortex and dexmedetomidine dose-dependently inhibits stimulation-evoked norepinephrine release and induces renal vasodilation.<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> Although no significant intergroup differences were observed between hemodynamic changes, in the present study, MAP, HR, and CVP were more stable in the dexmedetomidine group than in the control group after weaning from CPB. A previous study also has reported that a low bolus dose of dexmedetomidine (0.25 or 0.5&#x0200a;&#x003bc;g) had limited hemodynamic effects in health human volunteers.<sup>[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup></p><p>During CPB, contact between blood and extracorporeal circuit produces systemic inflammatory responses, the releases of various cytokines, and the activation of inflammatory cells, which can lead to kidney dysfunction.<sup>[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup> Furthermore, an <italic>in vitro</italic> study demonstrated that acute inflammatory responses, as determined by the release of interleukin (IL)-8, after CPB were greater in pediatrics than in adults.<sup>[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup> Other studies also demonstrated elevated serum IL-6 and -10 in children who develop AKI after cardiac surgery.<sup>[<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup> Although the mechanisms responsible for the effect of dexmedetomidine on renal function after CPB weaning are unclear, dexmedetomidine-induced &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-receptor activation might suppress the production of monocytic cytokines.<sup>[<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup> An earlier clinical study demonstrated that intraoperative dexmedetomidine infusion significantly decreased the productions of IL-1&#x003b2;, tumor necrotic factor-&#x003b1;, and IL-10, and reduced postoperative leukocyte counts and C-reactive protein levels.<sup>[<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup> Another possible mechanism is that dexmedetomidine suppresses systemic inflammation via a cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway. In a previous in-vitro study conducted using a lipopolysaccharide-induced endotoxemia model, it was suggested that the preemptive administration of dexmedetomidine might inhibit inflammatory cytokine release by modulating the vagus nerve and an &#x003b1;7nAChR-mediated cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway.<sup>[<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup> In this present study, we observed that eGFRs were significantly higher in the dexmedetomidine group, which concurs with the results of adult studies.<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup> In addition, a retrospective study also reported that the use of dexmedetomidine was associated with reduced AKI incidence after pediatric congenital heart surgery.<sup>[<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup> Thus, it is assumed that the perioperative use of dexmedetomidine have protective effect on renal function after open heart surgery.</p><p>As the primary target for AKI management is the prevention, its early detection is very important after pediatric open heart surgery. Noninvasive biomarkers for early detection of AKI are suggested such as U<sub>NAG</sub>, U<sub>Alb</sub>, IL-18, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), and kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1). An earlier study has reported that U<sub>Alb</sub>/Ucr was a reliable predictor for AKI and its optimal cutoff value was &#x0003e;400&#x0200a;mg/g in pediatric open heart surgery.<sup>[<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</sup> In this present study, U<sub>NAG</sub>/Ucr and U<sub>Alb</sub>/Ucr were measured for detecting early AKI or renal tubular injury and there were no intergroup differences at any time points. Also, the number of patients with U<sub>Alb</sub>/Ucr &#x0003e;400&#x0200a;mg/g at 2&#x0200a;hours after CPB was comparable between the control and dexmedetomidine groups (29% [4/14] vs 20% [3/15], <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.681) in this present study.</p><p>The present study has several limitations. First, U<sub>NAG</sub>/Ucr and U<sub>Alb</sub>/Ucr was measured as renal biomarkers to detect AKI, but the range of these biomarkers was too wide to detect intergroup differences. Although changes in serum and urinary biomarkers revealed a decline in renal function in both groups, the beneficial effect of dexmedetomidine on renal function was only reflected with eGFR. The change in Scr levels was also similar between the groups because it is not the most accurate marker of kidney injury, especially during the acute phase. The use of more sensitive biomarkers such as serum cystatin C or NGAL would have given better assessment of renal function in early postoperative period,<sup>[<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</sup> but Scr remains criterion standard for diagnosing the AKI and reliable predictor of AKI even immediate after cardiac surgery.<sup>[<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</sup> Second, the lack of inflammatory cytokines makes impossible to elucidate the mechanism underlying renal protective effect of dexmedetomidine. Third, the inclusion of different risk index category patients in this study. Risk-adjusted Congenital Heart Surgery Score (RACHS) indicates that secundum ASD is category 1 and VSD is category 2, and Li et al<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> have reported that no patients from the RACHS-1 category 1 surgeries developed AKI. However, only 3 ASD patients were included in this study (2 in the control and 1 in the dexmedetomidine group) and when data of only VSD patients were analyzed, the results were the same. Lastly, although calculated, the sample size is too small to extrapolate to pediatric patients with various congenital heart diseases. Larger sample size is needed for generalized results with greater precision and power. We added these comments in the discussion section.</p><p>In conclusion, intraoperative dexmedetomidine infusion may reduce the incidence of AKI and the incidence of post-bypass eGFR decline after pediatric congenital heart surgery under CPB. However, intraoperative dexmedetomidine infusion was not found to improve renal biomarkers, such as U<sub>NAG</sub> and U<sub>Alb</sub>, after pediatric open heart surgery.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: AKI = acute kidney injury, AKIN = acute kidney injury network, ASD = atrial septal defect, BIS = bispectral index score, CPB = cardiopulmonary bypass, CVP = central venous pressure, eGFR = estimated glomerular filtration rate, FE<sub>Na</sub> = fractional excretion of sodium, HR = heart rate, IL = interleukin, KIM-1 = and kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1), MAP = mean arterial pressure, NGAL = neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, POD = postoperative day, RFI = renal failure index, Scr = serum creatinine, S<sub>Na</sub> = serum sodium, TNF = tumor necrotic factor, U<sub>Alb</sub> = urine microalbumin, Ucr = urine creatinine, U<sub>Na</sub> = urine sodium, U<sub>NAG</sub> = urine N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase, VSD = ventricular septal defect.</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The authors report no conflicts of interest.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>[1]</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Rosner</surname><given-names>MH</given-names></name><name><surname>Okusa</surname><given-names>MD</given-names></name></person-group>
