The trial consisted of 3 stages: two month pre-treatment, two month treatment, and two months post treatment. Comparison of outcomes to the initial baseline factors was made and also 6 months after the cessation of the study.</p><p><italic>Setting:</italic> Chiropractic Research Centre of Macquarie University.</p><p><italic>Participants:</italic> Thirty two volunteers, between the ages of 20 to 65 were recruited through media advertising. The diagnosis of migraine was based on a self reported detailed questionnaire, with minimum of one migraine per month.</p><p><italic>Interventions:</italic> Two months of chiropractic SMT at vertebral fixations determined by the practitioner, through orthopedic and chiropractic testing.</p><p><italic>Main Outcome Measures:</italic> Participants completed diaries during the entire trial noting the frequency, intensity (visual analogue score), duration, disability, associated symptoms and use of medication for each migraine episode.</p><p><italic>Results:</italic> The initial 32 participants showed statistically significant (p &#x0003c; 0.05) improvement in migraine frequency, VAS, disability, and medication use, when compared to initial baseline levels. A further assessment of outcomes after a six month follow up (based on 24 participants), continued to show statistically significant improvement in migraine frequency (p &#x0003c; 0.005), VAS (p &#x0003c; 0.01), disability (p &#x0003c; 0.05), and medication use (p &#x0003c; 0.01), when compared to initial baseline levels.</p><p>In addition, information was collected regarding any changes in neck pain following chiropractic SMT. The results indicated that 14 participants (58%) reported no increase in neck pain as a consequence of the two months of SMT. Five participants (21%) reported a slight increase, three participants (13%) reported mild pain, and two participants (8%) reported moderate pain.</p><p><italic>Conclusion:</italic> The results of this study support the hypothesis that Chiropractic SMT is an effective treatment for migraine, in some people. However, a larger controlled study is required.
