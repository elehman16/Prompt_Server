Thus, the adjustment of the clinical refraction with topographic data: topography-modified refraction (TMR) was introduced. The purpose of this study was to validate this novel measurement by comparing the visual outcomes when the TMR was used in myopic LASIK to using the standard clinical refraction.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods|subjects"><title>Patients and methods</title><p>This prospective, randomized, interventional study received approval from the ethics committee of the LaserVision Clinical and Research Institute, adherent to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from each subject at the time of the intervention. The study was conducted in the author&#x02019;s clinical practice on patients during scheduled pre- and post-operative procedure visits.</p><p>The 50 consecutive patients enrolled in the study underwent uncomplicated primary bilateral topography-guided LASIK by the same surgeon (AJK) on the same refractive surgery platform (FS200 femtosecond and EX500 excimer lasers).</p><p>Pre-operative spherical equivalent was between 0.00 and &#x02212;8.00 D and up to 6 D of cylinder RE (expressed in minus value).</p><p>Exclusion criteria for the LASIK operation were systemic or ocular diseases, eyes with a history of corneal dystrophy or herpetic eye disease, topographic evidence of keratoconus (as evidenced by Placido topography) or warpage from contact lenses, corneal scaring, glaucoma, severe dry eye, and collagen vascular diseases. Programmed planned flap thickness was 110 &#x000b5;m and diameter was 8 mm.</p><p>All eyes were evaluated pre-operatively for distance best CDVA and post-operatively for UDVA. Pre-operative evaluations included wavefront analysis, pupillometry, and contrast sensitivity utilizing the functional vision analyzer (Stereo Optical, Chicago, IL, USA). Post-operative examination included manifest and dilated refraction, slit-lamp microscopy, tonometry, and keratometry, by means of corneal topography utilizing the Vario (WaveLight, Erlagen, Germany) and Scheimpflug tomography assessment utilizing a Pentacam-based device, the Oculyzer II (WaveLight).</p><p>The treatment used for the eyes randomized in group A was the subjective clinical refraction, entered into the topography-guided software as the surgeon override data, and is the standard operation in these treatments.</p><p>The clinical refraction data are the first line of data on the treatment planning software window shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-opth-10-2213">Figure 1</xref>, both top and bottom. The specific patient example shows the clinical refraction on the top, of &#x02212;6.50 D of sphere and &#x02212;0.50 D of cylinder at 45&#x000b0;. The middle line of refraction in both top and bottom windows of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-opth-10-2213">Figure 1</xref> shows the topography software-recommended cylindrical refraction. In this particular case, the sphere is &#x02212;0.45 D (the topography software has no axial length data and cannot calculate myopia), and the cylinder that derives from several consistent Vario, topolyzer (Alcon, Fort Worth, TX, USA) topographies shows &#x02212;1.11 D at 0&#x000b0;. The lower third refraction in both top and bottom images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-opth-10-2213">Figure 1</xref> is modified by the surgeon. In the top, all refraction data are set on purpose to 0&#x000b0;. In this way, the topography-guided software reveals the correction it will attempt in order to normalize this cornea with regard to the corneal vertex. Thus, the trefoil-like ablation image on the right of the top image in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-opth-10-2213">Figure 1</xref>. The trefoil-like image is also presented here in correlation with the pupillary aperture, also captured by the Vario topographer, and in this top window it shows clearly decentration to the trefoil-like normalization ablation, revealing angle-kappa compensation by the topography software. This ablation pattern will induce some myopia and it was calculated that in order to keep it neutral there is a need to add &#x02212;0.25 D of myopia to the clinical refraction sphere, so the total sphere should be &#x02212;6.75 D. The cylinder suggested by the software (middle refraction) is much higher than the clinical by 0.5 D and of different axis: 0&#x000b0; instead of 45&#x000b0;. The topography suggested cylinder is then entered into the third lower &#x0201c;modified&#x0201d; refraction to read &#x02212;1.0 D at 0&#x000b0; or 180&#x000b0; in the bottom version of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-opth-10-2213">Figure 1</xref>. This would further increase the spherical equivalent by &#x02212;0.25 D of sphere; hence the final adjustment made to the modified refraction on the bottom window of this same treatment image is to reduce the sphere from &#x02212;6.75 D, as noted earlier, to &#x02212;6.50 D so as to keep the same spherical equivalent. Therefore, the TMR in this case is &#x02212;6.50 D to 1.00 D at 180&#x000b0;, instead of the &#x02212;6.50 D to 0.50 D at 45&#x000b0; of the standard clinical refraction.</p><p>The treatment used in the contralateral eyes of group B was modified, as noted earlier, to reflect the topography-guided suggested cylinder power and axis calculated by the software based on the Vario topographies uploaded, as seen in the middle &#x0201c;measured&#x0201d; refraction of both top and bottom images of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-opth-10-2213">Figure 1</xref>. In most cases, the cylinder was increased and the sphere decreased accordingly, but there were some cases that the actual clinical refraction cylinder was reduced and the sphere increased accordingly. In the TMR cases of group B, the cylinder axis was always that suggested by the topography processing as noted in the middle measured refraction line.</p><p>Post-operative follow-up examinations were conducted at 1 week, 1, 3, and 6 months, and at 1 year.

The modification of the clinical refraction with topography-guided data with regard to the amount and axis of astigmatism appears to offer superior visual function with regard to UDVA, CDVA, residual RE in terms of spherical equivalent and residual astigmatism, total high-order aberrations, coma, and functional contrast sensitivity. Specifically, the percentage of eyes achieving a post-operative spherical equivalent refraction within 0.5 D of the target and the total range of RE, which are considered the best markers of the quality of a refractive procedure. The better refractive results obtained in terms of spherical equivalent refraction were also confirmed by the defocus equivalent results achieved from the first 3 months with the refraction adjusted with topography data (group B). This parameter gives a better understanding of the accuracy of a procedure for correcting the entire RE.</p><p>It was theorized that this treatment adjustment pre-emptively bypasses the bias of lenticular astigmatism that is probably active in young myopic eyes in their physiological state and may compensate for some amount of cornea astigmatism and cornea coma generated by angle kappa. This theoretical lenticular astigmatism appears to be the factor that distorts the objective cylindrical refractive data, resulting in wavefront refractive data similar to the subjective refraction, which appears to subside within months following the refractive surgery intervention. The author has adopted this concept in modern refractive cataract surgery, assuming that the post-operative cylindrical refraction will depend mainly on the cornea astigmatism, but have not adopted this concept yet in laser vision correction techniques applied on the cornea. The data in this contralateral eye study are compelling in studying further this novel principle that may increase accuracy in refractions used for laser vision correction.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Topographic adjustment of the amount and axis of astigmatism treated: TMR when different from the clinical refraction may offer superior outcomes in topography-guided myopic LASIK.
