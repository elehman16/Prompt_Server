The mGluR2/3 receptors function as autoreceptors that, when stimulated by endogenous glutamate, are able to diminish the activity of hyperactive and dysregulated cortical pyramidal neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Pomaglumetad methionil (LY2140023 monohydrate, hereafter referred to as LY2140023) is the methionine prodrug of the potent specific mGlu2/3 receptor agonist LY404039. It is anticipated that LY2140023 treatment may re-establish regulated and balanced glutamatergic cortical activity and improve psychosis.</p><p>An initial proof-of-concept study (Study HBBD) demonstrated that patients treated with LY2140023 (40&#x000a0;mg twice daily, BID) or olanzapine (15&#x000a0;mg) reported significant improvement versus placebo on positive and negative schizophrenia symptoms following 28&#x000a0;days of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, the results of a second Phase 2 study (Study HBBI) were inconclusive. In Study HBBI, none of the LY2140023 dose arms (5&#x000a0;mg, 20&#x000a0;mg, 40&#x000a0;mg, 80&#x000a0;mg BID), nor the active control, olanzapine (15&#x000a0;mg), separated from placebo in the treatment of acute schizophrenia. Overall, while LY2140023 treatment was generally well-tolerated in both studies, in the HBBI study, seizures were reported in 4 patients treated with LY2140023 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>The primary objective of Study HBBM tested the hypothesis that LY2140023 (80&#x000a0;mg or 40&#x000a0;mg BID) would demonstrate significantly greater efficacy than placebo following 6&#x000a0;weeks of treatment, as measured by the change from baseline in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score in an overall schizophrenia population and/or in a predefined subpopulation which excluded non-Hispanic white patients with the A/A genotype at the serotonin 2A receptor (HTR2A) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs7330461. This predefined subpopulation was defined based upon pharmacogenetic analyses conducted from prior LY2140023 trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].

Patients could be antipsychotic treatment na&#x000ef;ve or have had prior exposure to antipsychotic medications and were not treatment refractory in the opinion of the investigator. Patients were excluded from study participation if they had any other current Axis I psychiatric diagnoses in addition to schizophrenia, a diagnosis of substance dependence or substance abuse, a history of one or more seizures, answered yes to any suicide-related behaviors within 1&#x000a0;month of Visit 1, participated in any clinical trial for which they received a study-related medication in the 6&#x000a0;months prior to Visit 1, were treatment refractory, or had demonstrated an inadequate response to treatment with risperidone, or for whom treatment with risperidone, LY2140023, or placebo was contraindicated.</p><p>An inclusion/exclusion review process was completed for each patient in the study prior to the patient being entered into the blinded placebo lead-in.

A blinded placebo lead-in period was included in the study to improve signal detection by identifying patients whose change in PANSS total scores during this week suggested a high, anomalous placebo response.

Treatment with 80&#x000a0;mg BID LY2140023 was started at a dose of 40&#x000a0;mg BID for 3&#x000a0;days, followed by an increase to the target dose of 80&#x000a0;mg BID. Treatment with risperidone was started with 2&#x000a0;mg risperidone on the first day, and 4&#x000a0;mg (2&#x000a0;mg given BID) each day thereafter.

Dosing of risperidone was based on approved labeling.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Assessments</title><p>The primary objective of this study tested the hypothesis that LY2140023, given orally to patients with schizophrenia at 80&#x000a0;mg or 40&#x000a0;mg BID, would demonstrate significantly greater efficacy than placebo following 6&#x000a0;weeks of treatment (Visit 9), as measured by the change from baseline in the PANSS total score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], in one or more of the following populations: 1) overall schizophrenia population, 2) predefined subpopulation including all patients except non-Hispanic white patients (by self-report of race/ethnicity) who had the A/A genotype at the HTR2ASNP, rs7330461. Baseline was defined as the last non-missing observation at or before Visit 3.</p><p>To help reduce potential rating bias, improve reliability, and decrease variation, ratings were not performed by members of the treatment team but instead by blinded, independent raters. At the majority of sites (86%), centralized ratings via real-time video conference were conducted by an approved vendor (MedAvante, Hamilton, USA). In those countries where this technology was not available, local, blinded raters who were not a part of the treatment team performed the efficacy assessment. In both cases, the raters were blind to the study design, entrance criteria, and patient treatment assignment.</p><p>Key gated secondary objectives tested that LY2140023, at 80&#x000a0;mg or 40&#x000a0;mg BID, would demonstrate significantly greater improvement in functioning than placebo at Visit 9 in 1) the overall schizophrenia population, and 2) the predefined subpopulation, as assessed by the change from baseline in the Personal and Social Performance Scale (PSP) score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>Rates of discontinuation and time to discontinuation were compared between LY2140023 and placebo. The pharmacokinetics (PK) of LY2140023 and LY404039 were characterized.</p><p>Safety assessments included the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), neurological changes, vital signs, laboratory changes, and electrocardiogram (ECG) changes. Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) were assessed by the Barnes Akathisia Scale (BAS) for akathisia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], Simpson-Angus Scale (SAS) for parkinsonism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], and Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) for dyskinetic symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>Blood samples were collected from patients for genotyping (Verigene&#x000ae; mGlu Nucleic Acid Test; Nanosphere, Chicago, IL).</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>It was planned to randomize approximately 880 patients in a 2:2:2:1 ratio to LY2140023 (40 or 80&#x000a0;mg BID), placebo or 4&#x000a0;mg risperidone, respectively. This sample size provides a greater than 94% chance of at least one significant result from the four LY2140023 versus placebo tests (2 populations at 2 dose levels) associated with the primary objective. The power calculations were based on Monte Carlo simulations assuming an effect size of 0.3 and 0.4 in the overall population and the predefined subpopulation, respectively, and the predefined subpopulation makes up approximately 70% of the overall population.</p><p>The analyses were conducted on an intent-to-treat (ITT) basis that included all patients according to the treatment group to which they were assigned and received at least 1 dose. To increase signal detection, &#x0201c;placebo responders&#x0201d; who had a 25% or greater improvement in the PANSS total score (based on a 1&#x02013;7 scale for each PANSS item) during the placebo lead-in period were excluded from the efficacy analyses. The resulting analysis population was referred to as the efficacy-evaluable ITT patient population.</p><p>To control the family-wise error rate associated with testing the alternate co-primary hypotheses, a fallback testing procedure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] was employed. This procedure began by testing the efficacy of LY2140023 80&#x000a0;mg BID treatment first in the overall population, followed by testing the efficacy of LY2140023 40&#x000a0;mg BID treatment, and then conducting the corresponding tests in the predefined subpopulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>For analysis of the PANSS total score in the overall population, the mixed model repeated measure (MMRM) included the fixed effects of treatment, pooled investigative site, visit, treatment-visit interaction, gender, predefined subpopulation (yes/no) as well as the continuous, fixed covariates of baseline score and baseline score-by-visit interaction. In the predefined subpopulation analysis, the categorical term of predefined subpopulation was excluded from the model. The within-patient errors were modeled using an unstructured covariance matrix. The Kenward-Roger approximation was used to estimate denominator degrees of freedom. The primary contrasts were the LY2140023 doses versus placebo comparisons at Visit 9.</p><p>The gated secondary outcome was change from baseline in the PSP score. Only when the null hypotheses from the primary testing sequence were rejected, would testing of the gated secondary hypotheses have commenced using a parametric gatekeeping procedure: test the efficacy of LY2140023 treatment versus placebo in the overall population, followed by testing in the predefined subpopulation.</p><p>The comparison between risperidone and placebo at Visit 9 was conducted at a 2-sided alpha level of 0.05 without adjustment for multiplicity.</p><p>Time to discontinuation due to adverse events (AEs), lack of efficacy, and for any reason were analyzed separately using Kaplan-Meier estimated survival curves; and the log-rank test was used to do comparisons.</p><p>The safety measures, including EPS scores, vital signs, body weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, and ECG intervals, were analyzed using the MMRM analyses as specified previously. All the safety analyses were based on the ITT patients in the overall population. All tests of safety parameters were conducted at a 2-sided alpha level of 0.05 without adjustments for multiple comparisons.</p><p>For all other continuous variables such as patient&#x02019;s age, height, baseline weight, BMI, waist circumference, baseline efficacy, and baseline EPS measures, a single-factor analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a fixed effect of treatment was used. For changes from baseline to last observed measure in laboratory analytes, the rank-transformed change from baseline data were used.</p><p>For all categorical data including patient&#x02019;s gender, race, patient disposition, TEAEs, treatment-emergent abnormal, high, or low laboratory values, treatment-emergent EPS symptoms, Fisher&#x02019;s exact test was used.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Baseline and demographic characteristics</title><p>Among ITT patients in the overall population, there were no statistically significant imbalances among treatment groups with respect to baseline characteristics, psychopathology, or psychiatric history (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

Two populations, both the overall schizophrenia population and a predefined subpopulation of patients defined by genotype of the HTR2A SNP, rs7330461, race, and ethnicity, were evaluated as a part of the primary objective. LY2140023 did not separate from placebo in the primary efficacy endpoint (i.e., change in PANSS total score) in either the overall or predefined subpopulation at the 2 doses investigated (40&#x000a0;mg and 80&#x000a0;mg BID). The active control, risperidone, did separate from placebo in both populations. Therefore, HBBM is a negative study.</p><p>In an earlier clinical trial (Study HBBI), none of the LY2140023 dose arms (5&#x000a0;mg, 20&#x000a0;mg, 40&#x000a0;mg, 80&#x000a0;mg BID), nor the active control, olanzapine (15&#x000a0;mg), separated from placebo in the treatment of acute schizophrenia symptoms likely due to a higher than expected placebo response (&#x02212;14.6 points) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Research has highlighted an increasing placebo response in schizophrenia clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], and enrichment designs have been developed to separate early placebo responders from randomized patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. This study utilized several methods to attempt to prevent an abnormal placebo response, including the use of blinded independent raters and a 1-week placebo lead-in phase to identify &#x0201c;placebo responders&#x0201d; who were excluded from the primary efficacy analysis. The resulting mean PANSS total response of patients randomized to placebo in HBBM was not found to be excessive and was consistent with similar conclusive antipsychotic drug efficacy clinical trials reported in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. However, despite the utilization of those methods to improve signal detection, LY2140023 did not show greater improvement compared to placebo. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses that included the placebo responders did not significantly alter treatment outcome. Therefore, the trial was conclusive in not showing antipsychotic efficacy for LY2140023 in the populations studied. In addition, another clinical trial (Study HBBN) with a similar study design and 10-mg, 40-mg and 80-mg BID doses was stopped for futility based upon an interim analysis (early termination; NCT01307800).</p><p>The time to all-cause discontinuation was shorter on both doses of LY2140023 than on placebo. While time to discontinuation due to AEs was comparable between the LY2140023 and placebo treatment groups, time to discontinuation due to lack of efficacy was shorter on both doses on LY2140023 than on placebo. The reasons why patients discontinued sooner on either dose of LY2140023 compared to placebo are unclear, although &#x0201c;Perceived Lack of Efficacy-Physician Decision&#x0201d; reported as a reason for early study discontinuation differed significantly among groups (LY2140023 80-mg BID group&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;placebo). Patients in the risperidone group had a significantly longer time to discontinuation due to lack of efficacy compared to those treated with placebo.</p><p>Both LY2140023 doses were found to be generally safe and well tolerated. The most common TEAEs were headache, schizophrenia-related events, nausea, insomnia, and increased blood CK, and these observed TEAEs are generally consistent with those reported in previous trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The TEAEs seen in patients treated with risperidone were consistent with the known AE profile of this antipsychotic. While significant differences between treatment groups and placebo were observed in laboratory analytes and vital signs, those differences were generally small and not considered to be clinically relevant. Although the AE of extrapyramidal disorders was significantly associated with 80&#x000a0;mg LY2140023, this event was not reflected in rating scales. LY2140023 was not associated with weight changes compared to placebo.</p><p>Three patients experienced a seizure during the study, although none occurred in either LY2140023 dose group. The aggregate data as of June 2012 provides crude and exposure-adjusted incidence rates which are comparable to the rates of atypical antipsychotics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The crude incidence rate was calculated to be 0.264% and an exposure adjusted incidence (per patient year) of 0.011 (Lilly data on file).</p><p>The increase in prolactin levels due to treatment with risperidone (+50.90 ug/L) was anticipated and is consistent with the reported literature. The statistically significant increase in mean serum prolactin with LY2140023 80&#x000a0;mg BID (+1.16 ug/L) has not been seen previously, although the magnitude of this increase is small and may reflect normal variance, and its significance relative to placebo may have been influenced by the decrease in mean prolactin with placebo treatment.</p><sec id="Sec21"><title>Limitations</title><p>Selecting Visit 3 for baseline due to the blinded placebo lead-in design may have resulted in a baseline PANSS total score that does not fully represent the acute state of illness of patients at Visit 1. The placebo lead-in may have led to the discontinuation of otherwise appropriate patients to have studied in this trial and lessened the response to treatment on efficacy scales. The high discontinuation rate on LY2140023 represents a significant number of missing patients whose potential data could have informed the final results differently (eg, better understanding of who are the patients who cannot tolerate LY2140023).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec22" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Treatment with LY2140023 at the studied doses was not efficacious in improving symptoms of an acute exacerbation of illness in patients suffering from schizophrenia as studied in this trial. Overall, LY2140023 was generally well tolerated with no new significant adverse safety findings compared to previous trials. Further understanding of the role of glutamate as a therapeutic target in schizophrenia is needed.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec23"><title>Additional file</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12888_2014_351_MOESM1_ESM.docx" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>
