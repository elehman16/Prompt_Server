</p></sec><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>In many countries, strategies to control healthcare spending rely upon the availability and use of generic medicines. The safety and effectiveness of high-quality generic medicines is ensured through a demonstration of bioequivalence (BE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The methodology for assessing the BE of systemically absorbed drugs and for the statistical assessment of comparative systemic bioavailability (BA) based upon pharmacokinetic (PK) endpoints is well established. The same is not true for topical drug products, which are not intended to be absorbed into the systemic circulation. In the former instance, conventional regulatory BE acceptance criteria are based on the maximum plasma concentration (<italic>C</italic>
<sub>max</sub>) of the drug and the area under the curve (AUC) of the plasma drug concentration vs. time profiles. For pharmaceutically equivalent products to be considered bioequivalent, the 90&#x000a0;% confidence interval for the ratio of the means of each of these PK endpoints should fall within specified BE limits (typically 0.80&#x02013;1.25) on a log transformed basis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. For topical glucocorticoid drug products, the vasoconstrictor assay is a well-established approach to efficiently evaluate BE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]; however, it has limited scope only to that class of drug products. Otherwise, in general, a randomized, double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled, comparative, clinical endpoint BE study that compares the test (generic) product with the reference listed drug product is the default approach routinely accepted in USA to demonstrate BE for most locally or regionally acting topical dosage forms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. This impacts the availability of topical generic products because such clinical endpoint BE studies may require even more participants than the studies originally performed by the innovator for the new drug [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Moreover, clinical endpoint BE studies may not be the most accurate, sensitive, or reproducible approach by which to distinguish differences in BA between different topical drug products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. While a cutaneous PK approach may be a more efficient way to assess BE, evaluating the rate and extent at which the topical drug becomes available at the site of action (in the viable epidermis and dermis) is particularly challenging. Different recommendations for such BE evaluations have previously been suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>To address this issue and help make high-quality topical generic drug products available to patients, Raney et al. explored the possibility of developing appropriate PK-based BE approaches for the comparative assessment of BA from topical dermatological drug products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Evidence supporting the potential feasibility of such alternative in vivo methods has been presented in the literature, notably relating to tape stripping [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and dermal microdialysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>More recently, dermal open-flow microperfusion (dOFM) has been investigated as another potential approach to assess the BA/BE of topical products. It facilitates a continuous assessment of the in vivo cutaneous kinetics of topically administered drugs directly in the dermis in human subjects. dOFM can assess the intradermal biochemistry and drug concentrations by sampling the dermal interstitial fluid for up to 48&#x000a0;h (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The benefit of dOFM has been shown by PK-pharmacodynamic studies where a wide range of substances from small lipophilic drugs to large proteins and antibodies could be successfully monitored in the dermis of healthy human subjects and patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Additionally, dOFM may be used with patients experiencing dermatologic diseases and may enable evaluation of topical BE under conditions where the disease status of the skin barrier may lead to altered BA of the drug.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Schematic of dermal open flow microperfusion</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="40262_2016_442_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>
</p><p>The overall aims of this study were (1) to evaluate whether dOFM can accurately and reproducibly identify the in vivo BA of acyclovir in the dermis to be equivalent between two treatment sites both dosed with the same <italic>R</italic> acyclovir cream 5&#x000a0;% (<italic>R</italic>

The results demonstrate that dOFM accurately and reproducibly determined the positive control products to be BE (R<sub>2</sub> vs. R<sub>1</sub>) and that it had the sensitivity to differentiate the negative control products (<italic>T</italic> vs. <italic>R</italic>
<sub>1</sub>) as not being BE, in both cases based upon PK endpoints and the usual BE acceptance criteria.</p><p>The dOFM probes facilitated a stable intradermal sampling for 36&#x000a0;h from 4 <italic>R</italic> and 2 <italic>T</italic> treatment sites simultaneously in each subject, and thereby enabled characterization of the dermal PK profile for a relatively slow and low level of permeation of topical acyclovir. All subjects tolerated 36-h post-dose sampling well and no subject withdrew from the study prematurely. The positive subject compliance may be, in part, attributed to the compact wearable open-flow microperfusion devices, allowing enhanced mobility of the subjects. Bedside glucose analysis in dermal samples showed that exchange across the dOFM probe (the &#x02018;relative recovery&#x02019;) was stable over 36&#x000a0;h and thus indicated that skin cooling and the maintenance of an equilibrium period of 60&#x000a0;min post insertion was appropriate for this study.</p><p>dOFM delivered stable acyclovir profiles (&#x0003c;1&#x000a0;% outliers) and thereby demonstrated good reliability. Importantly, the high precision and reproducibility of the study results are attributable to several specific controls implemented to standardize and optimize study procedures, such as stabilization of the treatment sites to reduce strain and stretching, pain management during probe insertion to improve consistency and control of probe depth insertion, cooling after implementation to reduce trauma formation, and control of ambient temperature and humidity. Furthermore, several factors that were not necessarily amenable to better control, but which had a potential to influence the variability, were monitored so that their influence on variability could be evaluated and potentially corrected for: transepidermal water loss and impedance were monitored to evaluate potential subgroups in the population with skin permeability that may be more or less discriminating to differences in topical BA; glucose and deuterated water were monitored in the perfusate to identify any perturbation in the sampling environment; probe depth of the entire perfusate exchange area and flow rates of each time interval of each probe were monitored. The PK endpoint data in this study were not corrected by any of those factors.</p><p>Acyclovir products were chosen for this proof-of-principle dOFM study of comparative BA owing to the availability of 5&#x000a0;% cream products with different compositions and potentially different BA, and also because a dermal PK approach may have particular value to assess BE of topical products intended for local action rather than a clinical endpoint study in patients. The hydrophilicity of this drug, however, is not representative of most topical drugs and further research with hydrophobic drugs is warranted. The <italic>C</italic>
<sub>max</sub> was not seen for the reference product within 36&#x000a0;h, and the slow and ongoing permeation of acyclovir from both 5&#x000a0;% cream products produced a PK profile from which it was not possible to calculate the AUC<sub>0&#x02013;&#x0221e;</sub>. Hydrophilic drugs such as acyclovir may be poorly absorbed owing to a low partitioning through the skin&#x02019;s hydrophobic permeability barrier, the stratum corneum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Low levels of percutaneous absorption and slow kinetics are among the reasons why prior studies using conventional dermal microdialysis, which were limited to a 5-h post-dose sampling duration, only succeeded to sample acyclovir when simultaneously inhibiting local skin blood flow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p>This study was intended to evaluate how accurately, precisely, and reproducibly dOFM could monitor the rate and extent to which a topically applied drug (acyclovir) becomes available in the dermis, and to compare the dermal BA of acyclovir between <italic>T</italic> and <italic>R</italic> creams administered using the same clinically relevant dose amount under essentially identical study conditions, using a single-dose study design. The labeled use of these acyclovir cream products involves a repeated dosing regimen throughout each day of use. Repeated dosing (e.g., every 4&#x02013;5&#x000a0;h) is an effective strategy to maintain therapeutic drug concentrations at the site of action. However, differences in BA that might not be evident in a study where the products were re-dosed every 4&#x000a0;h may become evident in clinical use, where the product may not be re-dosed precisely every 4&#x000a0;h, particularly if one product dries more rapidly. In addition, a multiple dosing study design could obscure or convolute PK endpoints such as <italic>C</italic>
<sub>max</sub>, which were of interest to compare. Therefore, a single-dose study design was considered to be the most appropriate for the purposes of comparing acyclovir BA between the <italic>T</italic> and <italic>R</italic> products precisely because it may be more sensitive and discriminating than a multiple dosing study design. Indeed, it is possible that the differences in BA observed between the <italic>T</italic> and <italic>R</italic> products in this study may not be distinguishable in the clinical use of these products.</p><p>The application of dOFM accurately and reproducibly confirmed BE when acyclovir cream 5&#x000a0;% (Zovirax<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) was compared with itself (R<sub>2</sub> vs. R<sub>1</sub>). The statistical power estimation revealed that the sample size of <italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;40 (20 subjects in this study) was well chosen, as <italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;38 (19 subjects) would have been sufficient to demonstrate BE with a confidence level above 80&#x000a0;%. Both PK endpoints for the <italic>T</italic> vs. <italic>R</italic> product comparison failed to satisfy the conventional criteria for BE, demonstrating that dOFM was sufficiently sensitive to discriminate between the <italic>T</italic> and <italic>R</italic> products.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this study, dOFM showed low variability and high robustness, successfully characterizing the dermal BA of acyclovir from <italic>T</italic> and <italic>R</italic> products in a manner that could support evaluations of BE for topical acyclovir cream 5&#x000a0;% products in vivo with <italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;40 (20 subjects in the independent replicate leg design used for this study). Factors contributing to variability of in vivo dermal PK data were well controlled in this clinical study, which is the first to evaluate clinical dOFM for comparative dermal BA/BE assessment.</p><p>The results of this study suggest that an appropriately designed and well-controlled in vivo dOFM study could have the requisite accuracy, precision, reproducibility, and statistical power to compare the rate and extent to which a topically applied drug such as acyclovir becomes available in the dermis and that dOFM may provide a viable dermal PK approach for the BE assessment of topical drug products.</p><p>In the future, the sensitivity of dOFM may be even further improved for compounds permeating the skin more rapidly and to a greater extent than acyclovir, by refinements in subject inclusion/exclusion criteria, by correcting for perturbations to the dermal sampling caused by changes in blood flow or variations in probe depth, or by choosing shorter dose durations and monitoring the dermal PK for the <italic>T</italic> and <italic>R</italic> products during the period when the drug is being cleared from the skin. Further research exploring dOFM and other cutaneous PK methodologies to evaluate topical BA/BE is warranted based upon the results of this study.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>An erratum to this article is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40262-016-0487-z">http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40262-016-0487-z</ext-link>.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><p>The authors thank Alison Green for help writing the project proposal, Bernd Tschapeller and Christian Krainer for data management, Petra Baumann for statistics, Selma Mautner and Beate Boulgaropoulos for help in manuscript preparation (Joanneum Research GmbH, Graz, Austria), Sonja Kainz, Simon Schwingenschuh, Peter Reisenegger, J&#x000fc;rgen Lancaj, Joanna Adamczak, and Christian H&#x000f6;fferer (Joanneum Research GmbH) and Stefanie Sach-Friedl, Eva Ekardt, Stefan Korsatko, Sarah Bischof, Robert Lipp, and Martina Brunner (Medical University, Graz, Austria) for their help with the clinical study, Denise Kollmann, Stefanie Weiss, and Anton Mautner (Joanneum Research GmbH) for help with bioanalytics, Mike Roberts (University Brisbane, Australia) and Christopher Anderson (University of Link&#x000f6;ping, Sweden) for the valuable discussions on potential covariates, Priyanka Ghosh (US Food and Drug Administraton) for scientific collaboration and project administration, and Elena Rantou and Youngsook Lee (US Food and Drug Administration) for their advice on BE statistics.</p></ack><notes notes-type="COI-statement"><title>Compliance with Ethical Standards</title><sec id="FPar2"><title>Funding</title><p>Funding for this project was made possible, in part, by the FDA through research award FD004946.
