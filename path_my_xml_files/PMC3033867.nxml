Such musculoskeletal pain - which is often associated with restricted range of motion and loss of muscle strength - is one of the most common conditions treated by physical therapists. The exact mechanism of neck pain is rarely revealed by clinical examination and the treatment has varied from passive rest to active treatments. Active treatments have often been divided into either training of the painful area or the surrounding musculature avoiding direct training of the painful area. Our study investigates the effect of the latter approach.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>A randomized controlled trial of 10 weeks duration is currently being conducted. Employed office workers with severe neck-shoulder pain are randomized to 3 &#x000d7; 20 min shoulder function training with training supervision or to a reference group receiving advice to stay physically active. Shoulder function training primarily focuses on the serratus anterior and lower trapezius muscle with only minimal activation the upper trapezius.</p><p>An announcement was sent to the administrative section of the university including jobs characterized by intensive computer work. The first 100 positive replies entered the study. Among these inclusion criteria were pain intensity in the neck/shoulder of at least 3 on a 0-9 scale. Exclusion criteria were cardiovascular disease, trauma, hypertension, or serious chronic disease. Before and after the intervention period the participants replied to a questionnaire about musculoskeletal disorders and work disability, and underwent a standardized clinical examination of the neck and shoulder girdle. Further, on a weekly basis the participants log pain intensity of the neck and shoulder during the previous week.</p><p>The primary outcome measure is pain in the neck and shoulders at week 10 based on the weekly pain registration and results from the clinical examination. Secondary outcomes are strength and work disability.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials (NCT): <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01205542">NCT01205542</ext-link></p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Neck and shoulder complaints are common among employees in sedentary occupations characterized by intensive computer use[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Chronic neck pain is often a widespread sensation with hyperalgesia in the ligaments and muscles during both passive and active movements. Musculoskeletal pain - which is associated with restricted range of motion and functional loss[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] - is one of the most common conditions treated by physical therapists. The occurrence of neck/shoulder muscle pain has increased during recent decades and computer work is particularly associated with neck symptoms[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>Physical exercise is a cornerstone in health and well-being[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. An increasing number of studies and reviews within the last decade provide evidence for the effectiveness of physical exercise at the workplace in managing musculoskeletal pain[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The origin of chronic neck pain is multifactorial, including physical strain and psychosocial stress[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Treatment regimes has varied from complete rest to high-intensity strength training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Excess activation of the upper trapezius, combined with decreased control of the lower trapezius and the serratus anterior likely contributes to neck/shoulder pain. Supporting this, patients with shoulder disorders show an altered muscle activation balance towards increased upper trapezius activation and reduced serratus anterior activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Targeted rehabilitation of these types of neck/shoulder dysfunctions requires detailed knowledge of exercise-specific activation balance of the scapular muscles. Thus, restoration of balanced muscle activation is a challenge in the rehabilitation training. This study investigates in a randomized controlled design the efficiency of 10 weeks shoulder function training - i.e specific strength training of the lower trapezius and the serratus anterior muscle while minimizing direct training of the upper trapezius. We hypothesize that such exercise relieves neck/shoulder pain among office workers.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and design</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>We are currently conducting a randomized controlled trial in Denmark.

The main questions are described in more detail below. Each week the participants received an email asking them "How intense was your worst pain in the neck-shoulder area during the last week on a 0-9 scale?" (0 means no complaints and 9 means pain as bad as it can be).</p><p><italic>Musculoskeletal pain symptoms </italic>of the neck, shoulder, arm, hand, and back were evaluated using scales concerning both intensity and duration of symptoms. Participants replied to the questions "How many days have you had trouble in [body part] during the last three months?" (0 days; 1-7 days; 8-30 days; &#x0003e;30 days; everyday) for symptom duration, and "On average, how intense was your pain in [body part] during the last three months on a 0-9 scale?" (0 means no complaints and 9 means pain as bad as it can be) for symptom intensity. Answers to the question that concerned symptom duration were recoded as follows: 0 days = 0, 1-7 days = 4, 8-30 days = 19, &#x0003e;30 days = 60, everyday = 90[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Illustrations from the Nordic questionnaire defined the respective body regions[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Further, headache was evaluated using a questionnaire on intensity, duration, and frequency of headache during the previous month.</p><p><italic>Stages of change </italic>in relation to physical activity was in this study assessed by a questionnaire originally presented by Marcus and colleagues in 1992[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Questions asked in the questionnaire were e.g. "As far as I'm concerned, I don't need to exercise regularly", "I really think I should work on getting started with a regular exercise program in the next 6 months", and "I have started exercising regularly within the last 6 months".</p><p><italic>Productivity </italic>was rated on an 11-step ordinal scale: "How do you perceive your overall productivity the last 4 weeks?" The rating went from 0 (the worst a worker could do) to 10 (the best a worker in the same job could do)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>Participants rated <italic>work disability </italic>at baseline and follow-up by the work module of the Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand questionnaire (DASH): "In the past week did you have any difficulty:" 1) "using your usual technique for your work?", 2) "doing your usual work because of arm, shoulder or hand pain?", 3) "doing your work as well as you would like?", 4) "spending your usual amount of time doing your work?". Participants replied on a 5-point Likert scale from "No difficulty" to "Unable". The DASH score was normalized on a scale of 0-100 (by adding the 4 values, dividing by 4, subtracting by 1, and multiplying by 25)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical measurements</title><p>A physiotherapist performed a thorough clinical examination of the neck and shoulder girdle of the participants as previously described in detail[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].
