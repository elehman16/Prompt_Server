Here, we report on the ability to boost immune responses with an additional dose of VGX-3100. Patients completing our initial phase 1 trial were offered enrollment into a follow on trial consisting of a single boost dose of VGX-3100. Data show both cellular and humoral immune responses could be augmented above pre-boost levels, including the induction of interferon (IFN)&#x003b3; production, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)&#x003b1; production, CD8+ T cell activation and the synthesis of lytic proteins. Moreover, observation of antigen-specific regulation of immune-related gene transcripts suggests the induction of a proinflammatory response following the boost. Analysis of T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing suggests the localization of putative HPV-specific T cell clones to the cervical mucosa, which underscores the putative mechanism of action of lesion regression and HPV16/18 elimination noted in our double-blind placebo-controlled phase 2B trial. Taken together, these data indicate that VGX-3100 drives the induction of robust cellular and humoral immune responses that can be augmented by a fourth &#x0201c;booster&#x0201d; dose. These data could be important in the scope of increasing the clinical efficacy rate of VGX-3100.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>The Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is well established as being an etiologic agent for cervical cancer, as well as being a major contributor linked to a diverse set of other cancers of mucosal tissue including vulvar, vaginal, penile, anal, oropharyngeal and in rare cases, respiratory.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1 bib2 bib3 bib4 bib5 bib6 bib7 bib8">1&#x02013;8</xref></sup> Although over 100 genotypes of HPV have been identified,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref></sup> types 16 and 18 are the most highly associated with the induction of cervical cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref></sup> as identification of one or both types is found in roughly 70% of cases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref></sup> Additionally, HPV16 has been identified as the leading cause of HPV driven oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma with an estimated 90% prevalence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11 bib12 bib13">11&#x02013;13</xref></sup> Treatments for HPV-associated precancerous and cancerous states vary based on disease and may fall anywhere from a &#x0201c;watch and wait&#x0201d; approach for the former to surgical intervention in addition to chemotherapy and radiation for the latter.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14 bib15 bib16">14&#x02013;16</xref></sup> There is currently no approved immunotherapeutic treatment for HPV-driven pathology.</p><p>In the cervix, the intraepithelial lesion that precedes virtually all squamous cervical cancers, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2/3 (CIN2/3), is treated with surgical excision.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref></sup> However, surgical resection does not lead to complete elimination of the virus in cervical tissues in all cases, resulting in persistent HPV infection of the type initially responsible for the disease state.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref></sup> As persistent HPV infection is a significant risk for disease recurrence, HPV persistence after resection is also a significant risk factor for disease recurrence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup> Thus, viral clearance represents an important and desirable component of effective treatment of advanced dysplasia that surgical intervention may not be best suited for. As immune-mediated control and elimination of chronic viral infections are associated with CD8+ T cell responses,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20 bib21 bib22 bib23">20&#x02013;23</xref></sup> an immunotherapy able to generate HPV-specific T cells that show long-term persistence and can migrate to cervical tissues and mediate clearance of virus would be a useful tool for prevention of disease recurrence in patients with persistent infection. Moreover, the ability to benefit from additional treatments of such an immunotherapy would prove useful in this endeavor.</p><p>We have previously reported data from a phase 1 study of tolerability, safety, and immunogenicity of an HPV16/18 candidate DNA vaccine, VGX-3100, delivered by intramuscular (IM) injection followed by <italic>in vivo</italic> electroporation (EP), in women who had undergone an excisional procedure for intraepithelial HPV disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref></sup> We have also reported the results from our phase 2 double-blind randomized placebo-controlled efficacy study of VGX-3100 in which we noted statistically significant rates of regression of HPV16/18-positive CIN2/3 and clearance of HPV16/18, which were statistically associated with an immunological response.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref></sup> Here, we describe a follow-on Phase I trial in which thirteen of the eighteen subjects enrolled in the original Phase I study were administered a single boost of 6&#x02009;mg VGX-3100 followed by EP in order to study the ability of previously generated HPV16- and HPV18-specific immune responses to be further boosted. Immune responses measured after the boost revealed an augmented humoral response, an increase in cytokine expression from both the CD4+ and CD8+ T cell compartments and an increase in the expression of lytic proteins within HPV-specific CD8+ T cells. These responses were similar in magnitude and quality to those observed in our phase II double-blind placebo-controlled efficacy study of VGX-3100 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>). Additionally, in the current study, we determined the diversity of TCRs in T cells isolated from subject-matched peripheral blood and cervical tissue samples. Clonally expanded TCRs that appeared after vaccination, and were also present in the cervix suggest putative HPV-specific TCRs. These data suggest that VGX-3100 elicits humoral responses and cellular responses with a CTL phenotype, and that both have the ability to be boosted by additional administrations. Taken together with efficacy data generated from our phase 2 study, the data presented here suggest that VGX-3100 generates immune responses which may be critical in preventing recurrence of disease as well as the opportunity for additional dosing to further augment responses suggesting it is an attractive alternative to surgical intervention for advanced cervical dysplasia.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Study subjects</title><p>Screening evaluations were performed within 30 days prior to study enrollment on Day 0. If the screening assessments were performed within 7 days of dosing on Day 0, a single assessment could count as both the screening and Day 0 evaluations, however, pregnancy testing had to be repeated if screening and Day 0 assessments were performed greater than 48 hours apart.</p><p>The Month 9 visit of the HPV-001 study could count as the screening visit for the HPV-002 study, provided that all of the necessary evaluations for both visits were performed. A total of 18 subjects were identified for screening from the HPV-001 study, of which 13 were eligible for HPV-002 and 13 provided written informed consent, and were enrolled to receive 6&#x02009;mg of VGX-3100 followed by EP, regardless of the dose that they received in the HPV-001 study. Three subjects were not eligible due to pregnancy, one was not given the option to participate in HPV-002 due to protocol noncompliance, and one subject declined due to shoulder pain. All 13 subjects received 6&#x02009;mg of VGX-3100, and all except one completed the follow-up visit (Month 6). The mean age of the study population was 30.5 years (range: 20&#x02013;42 years).</p></sec><sec><title>Safety and tolerability of VGX-3100 followed by electroporation</title><sec><title>Injection site reactions.</title><p>Injection site reactions were evaluated within 30 minutes after EP and on Day 7 postdose. Overall, injection of 6.0&#x02009;mg of VGX-3100 followed by EP was well-tolerated. No severe or potentially life-threatening reactions were noted during the course of the study. Local postadministration injection site reactions were evaluated for severity by &#x0201c;Grade&#x0201d; on Day 0 at 15 minutes post-EP and on Day 7 postdose. &#x0201c;Grade&#x0201d; was defined as Grade 1 = &#x0201c;mild&#x0201d;, Grade 2 = &#x0201c;moderate&#x0201d;, Grade 3 = &#x0201c;severe,&#x0201d; and Grade 4 = &#x0201c;potentially life threatening.&#x0201d; One or more of the local postadministration injection site reactions (pain, tenderness, redness, and/or swelling) were experienced by each of the 13 subjects. No grade 3 or 4 adverse events (AEs) or serious adverse events (SAEs) were observed during the study (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="xob5">Supplementary Table S1</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Treatment emergent adverse events.</title><p>No deaths or serious adverse events were reported and no adverse events led to withdrawal from the study.

Overall, eight subjects (62%) reported any treatment emergent AEs with the highest severity as &#x0201c;moderate&#x0201d; for one subject, and &#x0201c;mild&#x0201d; for five subjects. All were determined to be not related or not likely related to VGX-3100.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Boosting with VGX-3100 augments HPV-specific humoral immune responses and production of IFN&#x003b3; generated by VGX-3100 priming</title><p>In our previously reported phase 1 dose-ranging trial (HPV-001) consisting of a three-dose regimen of 0.6 to 6&#x02009;mg VGX-3100, we identified robust <italic>de novo</italic> cellular immune responses generated after immunization that persisted out to 6 months following the third dose.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref></sup> Upon establishing this, we began analysis of the impact of a single 6.0&#x02009;mg boost with VGX-3100 had on that established HPV-specific immune response. To that end, we performed ELISA and IFN&#x003b3; ELISpot in order to assess the humoral and cellular compartments, respectively. Observation of humoral responses following the boost revealed that the median endpoint titer against HPV16 E6 and HPV18 E7 proteins at entry of HPV002 (0 and 1:1,350, respectively) were boosted by the administration of one dose of VGX-3100 to a median titer of 1:1,350 and 1:4,050, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Responses against the other two antigens did not benefit from the boost (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="xob1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). In total, 10 of the 13 subjects (76.9%) showed an increase in endpoint titer against HPV16 E6 and 7 of the 13 (53.9%) showed an increase in endpoint titer against HPV18 E7 when compared to the titer at enrollment in HPV-002. The remaining subjects showed a sustained titer between timepoints with no decrease in titer. These data further highlight the persistence of response generated by VGX-3100 and suggest the boost had a positive impact on subject antibody titers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>Analysis of IFN&#x003b3; ELISpot responses show that the median response at entry of HPV002 (195 SFU/10<sup>6</sup> Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs)) was boosted by 1.5-fold after the administration of one dose of VGX-3100 to a median magnitude of 297 SFU/10<sup>6</sup> PBMCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). In total, 8 of the 12 subjects (66.7%) with evaluable sample showed an increase in SFU when compared to their magnitude at enrollment in HPV002, suggesting that the single boost with VGX-3100 imparted a beneficial influence on the HPV-specific cellular immune response for the majority of the subjects in the study.</p><p>In order to determine the relative contributions of CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells to the production of IFN&#x003b3;, we employed flow cytometric analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Examination of HPV-specific responses across the study population revealed that HPV16 and HPV18-specific IFN&#x003b3; production was increased after administration of the boost in both the CD8+ and CD4+ T cell compartments, with the former increasing from 0.20 to 0.30% in total magnitude and the latter increasing nearly twofold from 0.14 versus 0.27%, amounting to a cumulative increase of over 1.5-fold in the T cell compartment as a whole (0.34 versus 0.57%, respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Analysis on a subject-by-subject basis for whom sufficient sample was present revealed six of the nine subjects (66.7%) had an increase in HPV-specific IFN&#x003b3; production from one or both T cell compartments, with two subjects showing increased production in the CD8+ compartment only and the remaining four subjects showing increased IFN&#x003b3; production from both T cell compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). Magnitudes of IFN&#x003b3; production in these six subjects ranged from 0.18 to 0.50% in the CD4+ compartment and 0.13 to 0.47% in the CD8+ T cell compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). Observation of the relative contributions of response broken out by T cell maturation status reveals that putative Effector Memory cells (CD45RO+/CCR7-/CD27-) were the primary producers of HPV16- and HPV18-specific IFN&#x003b3; in the CD4+ T cell compartment with Effectors (CD45RO-/CCR7-CD/27-) contributing slightly less and Transitional (CD45RO+/CCR7-/CD27+) and Central Memory (CD45RO+/CCR7+/CD27+) populations contributing the least (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="xob2">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). The CD8+ T cell compartment exhibited a different pattern in which Effectors (CD45RO-/CCR7-/CD27-) were the main contributors, followed by Effector Memory (CD45RO+/CCR7-/CD27-), Transitional Memory (CD45RO+/CCR7-/CD27+), and Central Memory (CD45RO+/CCR7+/CD27+), respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="xob2">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Boosting with VGX-3100 expands proinflammatory cytokine production from T cells and expands polyfunctional CTL phenotypes</title><p>As the production of IFN&#x003b3; is a strong measure of a Th1-associated immune response but is not always directly associated with lytic activity,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref></sup> we further analyzed T cell responses driven by administration of a boosting dose of VGX-3100 in regards to the production of TNF&#x003b1;&#x02014;a cytokine which exhibits both a proinflammatory effect as well as the ability to drive cell death in tumor tissues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref></sup> Examination of HPV-specific responses across the study population revealed that HPV16- and HPV18-specific TNF&#x003b1; production was markedly increased after administration of the boost in both the CD8+ and CD4+ T cell compartments, with the former increasing nearly twofold (0.11 versus 0.19%) and the latter increasing more than 2.5-fold from pre- to postboost (0.16 versus 0.41%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>) amounting to a cumulative increase of over twofold in the T cell compartment as a whole (0.27 versus 0.60%, respectively). Analysis on a subject-by-subject basis revealed seven of the nine evaluable subjects (77.8%) had an increase in HPV-specific TNF&#x003b1; production from one or both T cell compartments, with one subject showing increased activity in the CD4+ compartment only, one subject showing increased production in the CD8+ compartment only and the remaining five subjects showing increased TNF&#x003b1; production from both T cell compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). Magnitudes of TNF&#x003b1; production in these subjects ranged from 0.06 to 0.76% in the CD4+ compartment and 0.08 to 0.58% in the CD8+ T cell compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). Observation of the relative contributions of response broken out by maturation status reveals a slightly different pattern as compared with IFN&#x003b3; production. Both Effector (RO-/R7-/27-) and Effector Memory (RO+/R7-/27-) were the primary producers of HPV16 and HPV18-specific TNF&#x003b1; in both the CD4+ and C8+ T cell compartments, with minor production stemming from the Transitional (RO+/R7-/27+) and Central Memory (RO+/R7+/27+) populations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="xob3">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>).</p><p>Apoptotic death of tumor cells can be mediated through the immune system via mechanisms other than TNF&#x003b1;, and in particular may stem in large part from the synthesis and release of lytic proteins such as granzyme B and perforin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30 bib31 bib32">30&#x02013;32</xref></sup> Therefore, we also assessed the CD8+ T cell compartment for HPV-specific concurrent expression of these lytic proteins with varying combinations of IFN&#x003b3;, TNF&#x003b1; and CD107a&#x02014;the latter being an established marker of cytolytic degranulation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref></sup> Using these markers, we focused on three distinct CD8+ T cell profiles: (i) those that co-expressed granzyme B and perforin concurrent with a cytokine (IFN&#x003b3;, TNF&#x003b1;, or both) in the absence of CD107a (termed GrzB+Prf+/CD107a-/Cytokine+), (ii) those that coexpressed granzyme B and perforin concurrent with CD107a but in the absence of a cytokine (termed GrzB+Prf+/CD107a+/Cytokine-), and (iii) those that were positive for granzyme B, perforin, CD107a and at least one cytokine (termed GrzB+Prf+/CD107a+/Cytokine+). The first described population would constitute CD8+ T cells that were HPV specific and had lytic potential but did not degranulate within the 6-hour window of the assay (as evidenced by being CD107a-). Such cells would likely not be capable of direct lysis within that narrow timeframe, but would harbor the correct lytic proteins to mediate this type of cell death if prolonged stimulation allowed for them to degranulate. Moreover, expression of TNF&#x003b1; from these cells could mediate receptor/ligand-mediated lysis and the production of IFN&#x003b3; could aid in sensitizing tumor cells to receptor-mediated lysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34 bib35 bib36">34&#x02013;36</xref></sup> The second population would constitute those CD8+ T cells that were HPV specific and harbored lytic potential as well as the ability to degranulate as evidenced by being positive for CD107a. The final population expresses all markers consistent with a high-functioning population of CTLs, which have the capability of killing tumor cells by multiple mechanisms including direct lysis via lytic proteins, receptor/ligand-mediated lysis and sensitizing tumors to lysis by lytic granules. All three populations require concomitant expression of at least three antigen-specific regulated markers, thereby enforcing a requirement for polyfunctionality in order to be considered for analysis. Examination of these phenotype&#x02019;s across the study population revealed that total HPV16 and HPV18-specific activity was augmented by administration of the boost over two-fold as compared with preboost activity (0.04 versus 0.10%, respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). Analysis on a subject-by-subject basis revealed seven of the nine evaluable subjects (77.78%) had an increase in HPV-specific polyfunctional CTL phenotypes, with four of the seven showing changes restricted to only one of the above described phenotypes and the remaining three showing activity in all three phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). Total magnitude of response taking all three phenotypes into account in subjects with detectable changes after the boost showed a range of 0.03 to 0.20% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). These data together suggest that boosting subjects with VGX-3100 can augment HPV-specific T cell profiles associated with enhanced antigen-specific killing activity through multiple mechanisms including receptor/ligand and lytic degranulation.</p></sec><sec><title>Genes associated with inflammatory, cytotoxic, and effector responses are regulated in an antigen-specific manner in PBMCs after a booster dose of VGX-3100</title><p>Genetic analysis of PBMCs using Reverse Transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RTqPCR) affords the opportunity to examine various parameters of an inflammatory response in an exploratory manner, broadening the possibility of identifying immune signatures from cells that had either been unstimulated or stimulated with HPV antigens encoded by VGX-3100. Comparison of these samples allowed us to identify a set of genes that were differentially regulated based on HPV16/18-specific activation. Results of this analysis are presented in a heatmap in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> for the seven patients from whom we had evaluable sample. Five gene transcripts associated with a proinflammatory response were found to be upregulated in the majority of patients tested after antigenic stimulation: CXCL10, CXCL11, PTGS2, IL-15, and TBX21. CXCL10 and -11 are also known as Interferon Gamma Inducible Protein 10 and 9, respectively (IP10 and IP9) and are activated downstream of Interferon Gamma production, a hallmark of an inflammatory Th1 response.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref></sup> PTGS2 is also known as cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and is a well established proinflammatory molecule.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref></sup> IL-15 (interleukin 15) drives the expansion and activation of CD8+ T cells, including the induction of the synthesis of lytic proteins necessary for an effective cytotoxic response.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref></sup> Additionally, TBX21 (also known as Tbet) is a transcription factor known to directly activate transcription of Interferon-&#x003b3; and is associated with increased antigen-specific CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref></sup> Moreover, three transcripts were found to be downregulated in patient PBMCs in an antigen-specific manner: CCR7, IL-10, and HMOX1. CCR7 is a chemokine receptor that is well established as identifying cells that will home to and remain in the lymph nodes in a Central Memory or Naive phenotype. Thus its downregulation is suggestive of an antigen-specific shift towards an effector phenotype. IL-10 (interleukin 10) is a known suppressive factor for the induction of an inflammatory and cytotoxic response, thus its downregulation after antigenic stimulation aids in ensuring these responses are not turned off. HMOX1 encodes for heme oxygenase 1, which has been shown to mediate the anti-inflammatory effect of IL-10 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>), thus it&#x02019;s downregulation in concert with IL-10 supports the notion of a lack of activation in this suppressive pathway. Taken together, the modulation of these genes in an antigen-specific manner suggests that PBMCs exhibit a variety of proinflammatory and cytotoxic hallmarks after receiving a boost with VGX-3100.</p></sec><sec><title>Boosting with VGX-3100 supplements cosynthesis of granzyme B and perforin in activated HPV-specific CD8+ T cells generated by VGX-3100 priming</title><p>Chronic viral infections are frequently associated with immune exhaustion or senescence in the context of immune reactivity to viral antigens.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42 bib43 bib44">42&#x02013;44</xref></sup> Although mechanisms behind these phenomena vary, a heavy and prolonged antigenic burden on the cellular arm of the immune system is thought to play a role in this immune incompetence. Study of cellular immune responses from our previous phase 1 dose-ranging trial demonstrated that HPV-specific CD8+ T cells generated by VGX-3100 were able to activate, remain active, and synthesize lytic proteins during a prolonged antigenic stimulation (120 hours).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref></sup> We also noted this ability in our phase 2 study and established a statistical association between this phenomenon and clinical efficacy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref></sup> Thus, this type of profile is believed to be key for an effective CD8+ T cell response capable of eliminating a chronic viral infection and is an important hallmark of an appropriate immune response generated by VGX-3100. In the current study, we sought to determine whether a single booster dose of VGX-3100 augmented the frequency of HPV-specific activated CD8+ T cells as well as whether or not any notable increase in cosynthesis of granzyme B and perforin occurred. To that end, we performed a prolonged antigenic stimulation (120 hours) using HPV peptide and irrelevant control peptide (Ovalbumin) on subject PBMCs that were isolated prior to and after the boost and assessed activation status and lytic protein synthesis by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). CD137 (also known as 41BB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref></sup>) was used as a marker of CD8+ T cell activation. CD137 has been established by our group and others as an accurate marker of antigen-specific activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref></sup> and its expression is linked with a functional tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte profile,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref></sup> making it particularly relevant in the context of advanced dyplasia and cancer driven by HPV infection. Analysis of the data generated by this assay reveals that the boost did not appreciably increase the frequency of total HPV-specific activated CD8+ T cells as determined by CD137 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>, left panel) which was in part due to pre-existing responses noted prior to the boost. As nonspecific CD8+ T activation by irrelevant (control) peptide was low or nonexistent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>, left panel) the presence of pre-existing HPV-specific responses within the assay are likely tied to initial dosing with VGX-3100 in the previous trial. Further examination of HPV-specific CD8+ T cells showed that while no major change in frequency was noted, a statistically significant shift in HPV-specific coexpression of granzyme B and perforin was present (<italic>P</italic> = 0.026, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>, right panel), suggesting that the boost augmented the production of lytic effector molecules within these activated HPV-specific CD8+ T cells. Taken together, these data suggest that initial dosing with VGX-3100 drives persistent CD8+ T cell responses and that a boost is able to impart a statistically significant increase in the ability to cosynthesize lytic proteins associated with antigen-specific lysis of virally infected and tumor cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Boosting with VGX-3100 expands putative HPV-specific T cells localizing to cervical tissues</title><p>Following our observation of increased HPV-specific T cell responses in the peripheral blood after a boost with VGX-3100, we were next interested in determining if HPV-specific T cells were able to be detected in the cervical mucosa and if the frequencies of these sequences increased after the boost. Previous studies in humans have shown the ability of intramuscular immunization to elicit cellular responses at cervical sites during HPV infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref></sup> as well as elicit both cellular and humoral immune responses at mucosal sties in the absence of viral infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref></sup> As cervical biopsies were not performed during the trial, we did not have any tissue available for immunohistochemistry for direct visualization of infiltrating lymphocytes. However, high-throughput TCR sequencing of the hypervariable complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) of the TCR &#x003b2; chain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref></sup> has previously been utilized to identify HPV-specific clonal expansions in the cervical tissue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref></sup> In the current study, samples from the cervix were collected in the form of Digene swabs both before and after the boost was administered. We thus performed TCR sequencing from digene samples in order to determine if a single boost of VGX-3100 influenced putative TCR signatures in cervical tissue. To that end, paired cervical specimens and PBMC samples from a subset of immunized patients (<italic>n</italic> = 6) both pre- and postboost were obtained and allocated for TCR sequencing.</p><p>As cervical samples were not collected in a manner allowing for restimulation, these swabs were processed without any <italic>ex vivo</italic> expansion. Initial analysis revealed that the frequency of numerous TCR sequences was increased in the postboost cervical swab when compared to the same patient&#x02019;s preboost sample (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="xob4">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>). To determine whether these expanded TCR clones were putative HPV-specific sequences, we used patient matched PBMC samples as a reference point, reasoning that we could identify HPV-specific TCR signatures on a per-patient basis by performing antigen-specific PBMC expansion followed by sequencing. To that end, we expanded peripheral HPV-specific T cells from the pre- and postboost timepoints by stimulating PBMCs for 5 days with HPV peptides followed by TCR sequencing. TCR clones that were found in greater frequency in the postboost expanded PBMCs as compared to the preboost were designated as putatively HPV specific based on their antigen-specific expansion. To help confirm that the TCR sequences identified in this way truly were HPV specific, we utilized PBMCs from three different cord blood samples as a negative control, reasoning that clonal expansion seen in these samples after HPV peptide stimulation would constitute nonspecific amplification. One of three cord blood samples contained four sequences that were elevated after HPV peptide stimulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="xob6">Supplementary Table S2</xref>) and these sequences were subsequently excluded from further analyses.</p><p>We next analyzed the sequencing runs from cervical samples for the presence of HPV-specific TCR signatures as we had defined above. Results of the analysis reveal that all patients assayed showed an expansion of HPV-specific TCR clones in the cervical tissue following a boost with VGX-3100 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). The degree of expansion of these clones in the cervical tissue varied from patient to patient, with some expansions reaching nearly 600-fold when comparing preboost and postboost timepoints. The five sequences with the greatest fold-increase postboost for each patient are listed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref> and additional sequences are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="xob8">Supplementary Table S4</xref>. Interestingly, we found that the majority of TCR sequences that increased postboost did so at a much greater frequency in the cervix as compared to the periphery (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="xob7">Supplementary Tables S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="xob8">S4</xref>), suggesting the ability of these T cells to move out of circulation into cervical tissue. Taken together, these data indicate that boosting with VGX-3100 is able to expand HPV-specific T cells in the periphery and that these cells have the ability to expand and home to the cervical mucosa, a necessary component of a T cell response whose aim is to eliminate viral infection in these tissues.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Persistent infection with a high risk HPV types such as HPV16 or HPV18 is strongly correlated with an increased risk of adenocarcinoma of the cervix, making elimination of infection of paramount importance in the prevention of this cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51 bib52 bib53">51&#x02013;53</xref></sup> High-grade cervical dysplasia is treated by surgical excision in the form of conization or loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14 bib15 bib16">14&#x02013;16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">53</xref></sup>). While these procedures are often effective, they are not a targeted approach to elimination of HPV infection. Indeed, analysis of patients at varying intervals after LEEP procedures reveal that many remain HPV positive and the mean recurrence rate of CIN2/3 after LEEP is roughly 10%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17 bib18 bib19">17&#x02013;19</xref></sup> The development of a method of treatment of high-grade dysplasia that leads to the complete resolution of infection would not only treat and regress dysplastic lesions caused by HPV infection, but would also prevent recurrence of dysplasia. The patient&#x02019;s own immune system presents itself as the natural choice for the development of such a treatment, as it has been previously established that the induction of an HPV-specific immune response, particularly a cellular response, is often identified in the context of resolution of HPV-driven pathology and elimination of viral infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref></sup> Moreover, the establishment of immunological memory presents itself as an attractive concept for this purpose as a durable cellular immune response that was capable of mediating regression of an initial infection should be able to control and eliminate future HPV infections of the same type. The ability to boost this response would aid in further ensuring that immune system was capable of controlling HPV-driven pathology and eliminating infection. To this end, we have designed an immunotherapy based on the induction of HPV-specific T cell responses generated via the use of plasmid DNA delivered by <italic>in vivo</italic> electroporation.</p><p>We report here data generated from a follow-on phase 1 trial in13 women who had previously received VGX-3100, an HPV16/18 candidate DNA immunotherapy for treatment of advanced cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. Review of safety data showed no SAEs or grade 3 or 4 AEs, consistent with our findings from the phase 1 dose ranging study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref></sup> The immunological data reported here are the first data generated in regards to the ability to boost responses driven by VGX-3100 with subsequent dosing. Analyses conducted after administration of a single 6&#x02009;mg boost of VGX-3100 revealed a therapy-driven increase in the production of HPV-specific antibodies as well as markedly increased cytokine production from both the CD4+ and CD8+ T cell compartments in the form of IFN&#x003b3; and TNF&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). Investigation of CTL phenotypes such as expression of lytic proteins (granzyme B, perforin), degranulation markers (CD107a), and activation markers on CD8+ T cells (CD137) additionally revealed an increase in the frequency of HPV-specific putative CTLs as well as in the ability of activated HPV-specific CD8+ T cells to cosynthesize granzyme B and perforin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). Moreover, genetic hallmarks of a proinflammatory response were noted including the regulation of gene transcripts that are influenced by the production of IFN&#x003b3; as well as a downregulation of gene transcripts associated with the repression of an inflammatory response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Of great interest was the finding that boosting with VGX-3100 not only influenced peripheral immune responses, but also the frequency of putative HPV-specific TCR signatures in cervical tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This finding falls in line with the immune signatures noted in our phase 2b efficacy study in which we noted a statistically significant influx of CD8+ T cells into the cervical mucosa in patients who exhibited regression of CIN2/3 lesions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref></sup> Taken together, these data suggest that VGX-3100 induces durable immune responses and that boosting patients previously dosed with VGX-3100 with a single 6.0&#x02009;mg injection is safe, well tolerated, and capable of further expanding these responses.</p><p>The data presented here are encouraging in regards to treatment of advanced cervical dysplasia on multiple fronts: the ability to boost the magnitude of response by administering an additional dose of VGX-3100 opens an avenue for the continued use of this immunotherapy in the treatment of patients with high-grade dysplasia, allowing for the opportunity of immune mediated lesion regression and viral elimination in a higher frequency of patients. Moreover, when taken in the context of our phase 2b results in which greater than 80% of patients treated with VGX-3100 whose CIN2/3 regressed did so in the form of regression to normal tissue, a pattern is established in which robust HPV-specific cellular immune responses are durable, can be boosted and are ultimately statistically associated with histological regression.
