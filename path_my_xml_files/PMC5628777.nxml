Incidence of awareness in patients undergoing cardiac surgery is significantly higher than the overall incidence of 1%&#x000a0;during general surgery. Awareness during cardiac surgery can be prevented by a number of methods. One such method is the supplemental, intraoperative use of&#x000a0;sedative agents. Propofol, a bisubstituted phenol, is an&#x000a0;intravenous general anesthetic that&#x000a0;has been shown to reduce the incidence of awareness. Dexmedetomidine&#x02014;an alpha<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic agonist with anxiolytic, opioid, and general anesthetic-sparing properties&#x02014;is being considered for maintaining intraoperative depth of anesthesia. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of dexmedetomidine on depth of anesthesia and to compare it with the effect of propofol in cardiac surgery.</p><p>Methods</p><p>This was a prospective, randomized, double-blind study conducted in a tertiary-care hospital. Sixty patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I-III planned for elective open heart surgery were randomized into two groups of 30 patients each. Each patient of the dexmedetomidine group received an initial loading dose of dexmedetomidine at 1 mcg kg<sup>-1</sup> over 10 minutes followed by infusion at the rate of 0.2&#x02013;0.6 mcg kg<sup>-1</sup> hr<sup>-1</sup>. Patients of the propofol group received propofol infusion at the rate of 0.25<sup>-1</sup> mg kg<sup>-1</sup> hr<sup>-1</sup>. An identical technique&#x02014;of standard general anesthesia and routine physiological monitoring&#x02014;was used in both groups. Bispectral scores were recorded at predetermined intervals during surgery and the target bispectral index (BIS) was kept at 50&#x000b1;10. The patients were assessed for awareness and recall 24 hours after tracheal extubation using the Brice Questionnaire.</p><p>Results</p><p>Intraoperative BIS scores remained within the target range in both groups; however, the BIS scores showed variable trends between the groups and were significantly lower in the dexmedetomidine group (p &#x0003c; 0.001). None of the patients in either group had recall of intraoperative events.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>Administration of dexmedetomidine was as effective in reducing awareness and recall in cardiac surgery compared to propofol. Thus, dexmedetomidine can be used as an alternative sedative agent to prevent awareness and recall in cardiac surgery.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>bispectral index</kwd><kwd>cardiac surgery</kwd><kwd>dexmedetomidine</kwd><kwd>propofol</kwd><kwd>brice questionnaire</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta><notes><p content-type="disclaimer">The content published in Cureus is the result of clinical experience and/or research by independent individuals or organizations.

Of these monitors, the bispectral index (BIS) has been most widely adopted in clinical practice. The BIS monitor incorporates a proprietary algorithm that analyzes signals from a processed scalp EEG. The monitor shows a dimensionless number between 0 and 100, with lower numbers reflecting deeper anesthesia&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>-<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Propofol, a bisubstituted phenol, is an&#x000a0;intravenous&#x000a0;general anesthetic that is given to patients for titratable sedation and hypnosis due to its quick onset and offset&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].&#x000a0;A continuous infusion of the standard rate of propofol has been shown to reduce the incidence of awareness&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].&#x000a0;Dexmedetomidine, an alpha2-adrenergic agonist, has been approved for use as a sedative-analgesic. It has anxiolytic, sympatholytic, opioid, and general anesthetic-sparing properties&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].&#x000a0;However, little&#x02014;if any&#x02014;information has been published on the effect of dexmedetomidine on the depth of anesthesia in cardiac surgery. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of dexmedetomidine on depth of anesthesia and compare it with that of propofol by using BIS values and to study the feasibility of dexmedetomidine and propofol as sedative agents in maintaining depth of anesthesia and in preventing intraoperative awareness.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>This study was conducted at the Department of Anesthesiology at Sher-i-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences, Srinagar, after receiving the approval of the&#x000a0;institutional ethical committee. The study included 60 patients aged 15&#x02013;60 years with American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I-III and planned for elective open heart surgery&#x000a0;under general anesthesia. The study was conducted in a prospective, randomized, double-blind manner. Proper informed consent was taken from all patients included in the study.</p><p>Patients having neurological/psychological disorders, renal/hepatic dysfunction, or allergy to propofol or&#x000a0;dexmedetomidine were excluded from the study, as were patients on antipsychotics or sedatives&#x000a0;and those belonging to New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IV (left ventricular ejection fraction less than 40%). Patients with infusions of catecholamines or vasodilators before anesthesia were also excluded.</p><p>Patients were randomly allocated to two groups&#x02014;dexmedetomidine and propofol&#x02014;of 30 each, using computer-generated random numbers in sealed envelopes. Patients were premedicated with oral diazepam 5 mg the night before surgery. Intravenous access was obtained in the operating room. Routine physiological monitoring included electrocardiography (ECG), pulse oximetry, non-invasive blood pressure, temperature and neuromuscular monitoring, urine output, and&#x000a0;BIS. Baseline haemodynamic variables were recorded. BIS was obtained using disposable sensors (Aspect Medical Systems, Inc., Norwood, MA). EEG electrodes were placed in a bifrontal montage after skin preparation with disinfectant alcohol and slight rubbing. The EEG signal acquired and the BIS displayed on the monitor (Mindray WATO EX-65, China) were recorded. Patients were induced with propofol (1&#x02013;2.5 mg kg-1), morphine (0.1&#x02013;0.2 mg kg-1), isoflurane (minimum alveolar concentration 1.2), and vecuronium (0.1&#x02013;0.2 mg kg-1) for tracheal intubation. The dexmedetomidine group received a bolus dose of dexmedetomidine (1 mcg kg-1 over 10 minutes), followed by infusion (0.2&#x02013;0.6 mcg kg-1 hr-1). The propofol group received a propofol infusion at the rate of 0.25-1 mg kg-1 hr-1. Target BIS was kept at 50&#x000b1;10. The lungs were ventilated with 100% oxygen using intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV). Tidal volume and respiratory rate were&#x000a0;adjusted to maintain an end tidal carbon dioxide rate of 30&#x02013;35 mmHg. A central venous catheter&#x000a0;and arterial cannula were inserted subsequently for transduction of central venous pressure and invasive blood pressure. Anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane and intermittent additional boluses of 0.05 mg kg-1 morphine were administered before skin incision and sternotomy, at commencement, and toward the end of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Muscle relaxation was maintained with vecuronium bromide (0.01&#x02013;0.02 mg kg-1). Heart rate and mean arterial pressure were kept within 25% of the baseline. Tachycardia and hypertension were treated with esmolol and nitroglycerine as appropriate. Hypotension was&#x000a0;treated with fluid boluses, phenylephrine, and inotropes, as appropriate. The Maquet HL20 heart lung machine (MAQUET, Germany) and membrane oxygenator were used during conduct of CPB. After the aortic root had been cannulated, the necessary cannulae were placed and moderate hypothermic CPB (28&#x02013;32&#x000b0;C) was initiated. While patients were on full CPB flows, lungs were not&#x000a0;ventilated. Mean perfusion pressure was maintained between 50&#x02013;80 mmHg during CPB and any deviation was treated with nitroglycerine or phenylephrine boluses as appropriate. Myocardial protection was achieved with cold potassium-enriched blood cardioplegia solution and topical application of cold saline and ice slush. Patients&#x02019; temperature was regulated using a heat exchanger. The fresh gas flow was adjusted to maintain the normal acid-base balance using the alpha stat strategy and rewarming was performed to 37&#x000b0;C. At our institute, it was neither usual nor feasible to add isoflurane to the CPB circuit; therefore,&#x000a0;isoflurane was used before and after CPB and infusion of propofol or dexmedetomidine was&#x000a0;continued during CPB.</p><p>BIS scores were recorded during surgery at the following time points: prior to induction; post-intubation; at sternotomy; before CPB and&#x000a0;five&#x000a0;minutes after onset of CPB; before and after aortic cross-clamping; every 15 minutes after aortic cross-clamping; after&#x000a0;aortic cross-clamp release; rewarming phase of CPB; before and after weaning from&#x000a0;CPB; after closure of thorax; and at the end of surgery.</p><p>After skin closure, the dexmedetomidine/propofol infusion was stopped. The patients were shifted to the CICU without reversing the muscle relaxation for elective mechanical ventilation, and extubated when standard criteria for weaning and extubation were met. The patients were subjected to a structured interview for awareness and recall 24 hours after tracheal extubation (Brice Questionnaire)&#x000a0;as under.</p><p>1.

Practitioners therefore might attempt to minimize anesthetic administration to these patients&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The precise concentration of the anesthetic required to guarantee lack of recall is unknown. Reliance on clinical signs is certainly not enough, especially with the use of muscle relaxants that abolish two of the most valuable indicators of depth of anesthesia, i.e., respiration and movement in response to surgery&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In the current scenario of cardiac anesthesia, the need for a reliable monitor that ensures unconsciousness is highly desirable. BIS monitoring is used by clinical anesthetists to titrate anesthetic agents in order to maintain loss of consciousness (LOC) and prevent intraoperative awareness&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>The current study revealed no definitive cases of intraoperative awareness. Groesdonk et al.&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]&#x000a0;evaluated 514 patients undergoing fast-track cardiac surgery. They recorded only one possible case of intraoperative awareness in more than 510 patients. The patient in question reported an episode of possible intraoperative recall, but this was determined subsequently to have been caused most likely by awakening in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU). Because the authors could not completely exclude that this patient was aware during the time of surgery, however, the occurrence of awareness in their study was specified as 0.2%.</p><p>Dowd et al.&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]&#x000a0;studied 617 patients undergoing cardiac surgery. After initiation of CPB, propofol infusion (2&#x02013;6 mg kg-1 hr-1) was started. The authors reported incidence of intraoperative awareness of 0.3%. The absence of intraoperative awareness in our study may be attributed to continuous administration of drug infusions at all times during surgery, especially during the period of CPB, and the use of a balanced anesthesia technique using inhalational agents and benzodiazepines prior to and after CPB. Dexmedetomidine infusion to prevent awareness was used by Chattopadhyay et al.&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], who studied 60 patients scheduled for laparotomy under general anesthesia. Patients received either propofol 1 mg kg-1 bolus followed by infusion (50 mcg kg-1 min-1) or dexmedetomidine 1 mcg kg-1 bolus followed by infusion (0.5 mcg kg-1 h-1). None of the patients had recall of any intraoperative events.</p><p>Although previous authors have acknowledged that the most appropriate method to investigate awareness is to conduct a structured postoperative interview, the actual timing of the interview is a matter of debate. Some advocate that patients be interviewed as soon as they regain consciousness. However, most patients will be drowsy and may therefore give an unreliable interview. Others suggest that patients be interviewed much later, even as long as one week after their operation&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. This would obviously eliminate patients already discharged from the hospital. An early interview during the first 24 hours is suggested as a reasonable time&#x02014;thus this was the timing of the postoperative interview in this study&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>Patients of both the groups had dreams which were pleasant, and the content was unrelated to surgery. In Leslie et al.&#x02019;s study&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>],&#x000a0;300 patients presenting for elective surgery were studied. Patients were interviewed on emergence and 2&#x02013;4 hours postoperatively. Dream content and form were assessed. Dreaming was reported by 22% of patients on emergence. Leslie et al. concluded that&#x000a0;dreaming during anesthesia is unrelated to the depth of anesthesia.</p><p>In the present study, BIS readings of adequate anesthetic depth were achieved among both groups at all time points of data collection; however, BIS values were lower in the dexmedetomidine group. Recovery of consciousness during general anesthesia without any recall (in the absence of surgical stimulus) has generally been associated with a BIS value of 60&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Cases of awareness during surgical stimulation with high BIS values (60) have also been reported&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Although there is at least one case report of awareness with a BIS of apparently 50&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], BIS was subsequently found to be 60 at the probable time of awareness&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>The limitations of the current study include a small sample size and the timing of&#x000a0;the postoperative interview, which may have contributed to a falsely low incidence of explicit recall. The amnestic effects of premedication as well as general&#x000a0;anesthetics may also have resulted in low incidence of intraoperative awareness.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The current prospective investigation involved the use of dexmedetomidine to prevent awareness in cardiac surgery and to compare its effectiveness with propofol. The results that we obtained by recording BIS scores intra-operatively and by assessing patients postoperatively for awareness with recall using the Brice Questionnaire revealed that dexmedetomidine was as effective in reducing awareness and recall compared to propofol. Hence, from our study, we conclude that dexmedetomidine can also be used as an alternative sedative agent to prevent awareness and recall in cardiac surgery. Nonetheless, large prospective studies are needed to confirm these results.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group content-type="competing-interests"><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="other"><title>Human Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Consent was obtained by all participants in this study.
