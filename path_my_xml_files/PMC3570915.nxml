After this time, complete physical examination especially neurological examination was done in all patients. The headache impac<italic>t test</italic> (HIT-6) questionnaire was used to evaluate the characteristics of patients&#x02019; headaches (mean of severity, duration of headaches, and frequency in a month). Then, patients were randomized using a computer-generated randomization list to receive 5 mg Enalapril or placebo twice a day for 2 months. The placebo (made by Isfahan Pharmacy faculty, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran) was matched with 5 mg Enalapril tablets (Sobhan Darou, Tehran, Iran) in all characteristics. During the study, patients were educated to complete a record about the details of each headache attack (including severity, duration, and frequency). Severity of each attack was evaluated by visual analog scale (VAS) from 1 to10. Patients were allowed to control their acute migraine attacks with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). During these 2 months, patients were recommended not to use any drugs which have an effect on migraine characteristics. Every 2 weeks, all the patients were evaluated about Enalapril complications and details of their headaches by a person blinded to Enalapril and placebo treated groups. After these 2 months, all patients were recalled and complete examination was done again and completed diary was given back.</p><p>In this study, the hypothesis that using 10 mg Enalapril daily would make the patients&#x02019; clinical status, especially their headache frequency, better was evaluated.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Standard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient consents</title><p>The study was approved by the ethical committee of the Isfahan University of Medical Sciences.
