There is no definitive treatment other than delivery. A drug that can quench the disease process could be useful to treat early onset pre-eclampsia, as it could allow pregnancies to safely continue to a gestation where fetal outcomes are significantly improved. We have generated preclinical data to show esomeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor used for gastric reflux, has potent biological effects that makes it a worthwhile therapeutic candidate. Esomeprazole potently decreases soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 (sFlt-1) and soluble endoglin secretion from placenta and endothelial cells, and has biological actions to mitigate endothelial dysfunction and oxidative stress.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>We propose undertaking a phase II, double blind, randomised controlled clinical trial to examine whether administering 40&#x02005;mg esomeprazole daily may prolong gestation in women with early onset pre-eclampsia. We will recruit 120 women (gestational age of 26+0 to 31+6&#x02005;weeks) who will be randomised to receive either esomeprazole or an identical placebo. The primary outcome will be the number of days from randomisation to delivery. Secondary outcomes include maternal, fetal and neonatal composite and individual outcomes. Maternal outcomes include maternal death, eclampsia, pulmonary oedema, severe renal impairment, cerebral vascular events and liver haematoma or rupture. Neonatal outcomes include neonatal death within 6&#x02005;weeks after the due date, intraventricular haemorrhage, necrotising enterocolitis and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. We will examine whether esomeprazole can decrease serum sFlt-1 and soluble endoglin levels and we will record the safety of esomeprazole in these pregnancies.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>This study has ethical approval (Protocol V.2.4, M14/09/038, Federal Wide assurance Number 00001372, IRB0005239), and is registered with NHREC (ID 3649) and the Pan African Clinical Trial Registry (PACTR201504000771349).

In particular, fetuses delivered at less than 33&#x02005;weeks&#x02019; gestation are at significant risk of severe disability including cerebral palsy, stroke (intracerebral bleeding), retinopathy of prematurity, chronic lung disease and death.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>If an affordable and safe treatment was available that could temporise the disease progression of pre-eclampsia, clinicians could safely delay delivery and gain gestation to improve fetal outcome. This could save the lives of many infants and decrease the hospital burden caused by iatrogenic prematurity. Such a treatment would be in keeping with the United Nations Millennium Development Goals to reduce child mortality and improve maternal health.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><p>The pre-eclamptic placenta releases antiangiogenic soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 (sFlt-1) and soluble endoglin (sEng) into the maternal circulation.

An online, web-based sequence generator system will be used. It will be linked with codes for placebo and treatment tablets provided by the manufacturer contracted to produce the trial medication. Both the researchers and participants will be blinded.</p><p>The gestational age at diagnosis is likely to affect allowable length of pregnancy prolongation. To ensure treatment group allocation is balanced for this potential variable, we will stratify randomisation into two strata based on gestational age. Strata 1 includes a gestational age of 26+0 up to and including 28+6&#x02005;weeks (500&#x02013;1200&#x02005;g if gestation is unknown). Strata 2 includes a gestational age of 29+0 up to and including 31+6&#x02005;weeks (1200&#x02013;1800&#x02005;g if gestation is unknown). Thus, randomisation will include blocking within each gestational age stratum. We propose using blocks of 4&#x02013;6 with the size and order randomly assigned.</p><p>Once the participants have been randomised, the treatment pack with the same code will be allocated to the participant. All treatment packs will be identical and will contain either active tablets or placebo. The researchers will have no access to the randomisation list. This process will ensure that there is allocation concealment throughout the conduct of the trial.</p></sec><sec id="s3f"><title>Participant enrolment</title><p>Participants will be identified after they have been admitted to Tygerberg Hospital (tertiary referral centre) with a diagnosis of early onset pre-eclampsia for expectant management. An information leaflet will be given to all potential participants and informed consent will be obtained (see online supplementary information 2 and 3). Each participant will be given an individual treatment pack containing either esomeprazole or placebo which will be produced by a contracted manufacturer IDT pharmaceuticals (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.idtaus.com.au">http://en.idtaus.com.au</ext-link>). Labelling, storage and preparation will be done according to the requirements of the Medicines for Human Use (Clinical Trials) regulations.</p></sec><sec id="s3g"><title>Intervention</title><p>Participants will be randomised to daily administration of either active tablets containing 40&#x02005;mg of esomeprazole or an identical placebo tablet orally once a day. Participants will remain under the care of the hospital treating team, and the study will not alter or interfere with the care given routinely to women with early onset pre-eclampsia, including on when to deliver.</p></sec><sec id="s3h"><title>Routine expectant management for pre-eclampsia</title><p>Expectant management for early onset pre-eclampsia involves admission to hospital, and close maternal and fetal surveillance. Maternal surveillance includes four hourly blood pressure measurement, twice daily clinical assessment, daily urinalysis and twice weekly assessments with blood tests (full blood count, renal function tests and hepatocellular enzymes if haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelets syndrome is suspected) and 24&#x02005;h urinary protein measurement on admission. Fetal surveillance includes ultrasound assessments to assess growth of the fetus, the amniotic fluid index and fetal well-being including Doppler velocimetry of the umbilical artery, the ductus venosus and the middle cerebral artery. If there are no signs of fetal growth restriction or fetal compromise, the ultrasound is repeated two weekly to ensure there has been adequate trajectory of fetal growth. If there are signs of fetal growth restriction or fetal compromise, the frequency of ultrasound surveillance will be increased. Six hourly cardiotocographs are performed to assess the ongoing fetal condition. We will follow the Tygerberg Hospital protocols to monitor preterm fetal growth restriction and delivery may occur on fetal grounds if required.</p><p>All participants will receive two doses of &#x003b2;-methasone 24&#x02005;h apart to reduce the risks of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, intracranial haemorrhage and necrotising enterocolitis. A single repeat dose is usually given 1&#x02005;week later. Most participants will be on antihypertensive treatment with the aim to stabilise the systolic blood pressure between 140 and 150&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg and the diastolic blood pressure between 90 and 100&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg. The medications used to treat the blood pressure will be documented. All women should already be receiving calcium, iron and folic acid supplementation.</p><p>Clinical care will be left up to the discretion of the clinical team. The indication for delivery will be a clinical decision. Indications for delivery may include failure to control blood pressure, the development of major maternal or fetal complications, or intrauterine fetal death. Expectant management will usually end at a gestation of 34&#x02005;weeks.</p></sec><sec id="s3i"><title>Sample size and stratification according to gestation at recruitment</title><p>The reported duration that fetuses remain in utero after diagnosis of preterm pre-eclampsia is a mean of 11&#x02005;days (SD of 7&#x02005;days) and a median 9&#x02005;days (range of 1&#x02013;47&#x02005;days).<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> These data are derived from a descriptive study on expectant management of early onset pre-eclampsia at Tygerberg Hospital, where we propose to undertake this study.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> For 90% power, with a two-sided &#x003b1; set of 0.05, 43 patients are required in each group to identify a gain in gestation of 5&#x02005;days. Given these data were skewed, the sample size has been multiplied by 1.15 to statistically correct for non-normality.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> This increases the number required to 50 per arm. An additional 10 per arm will be added to allow for drop-outs. Thus, a total of 120 participants will be recruited to provide sufficient power to examine our primary outcome. (Power calculation performed using PASS V.12 software. Hintze, J. (2013). PASS 12. NCSS, LLC. Kaysville, Utah, USA).</p></sec><sec id="s3j"><title>Sample collection</title><p>Blood samples will be routinely collected twice a week. Two sets of specimens will be drawn, the routine pre-eclamptic monitoring samples and the trial samples. The routine blood samples include measurements of the haemoglobin, the platelet count and the urea and creatinine levels. These will be used by the managing clinicians to determine disease severity and may trigger delivery. The second set of samples will be the trial blood samples. These samples will be stored and will only be measured after delivery of the patient. These include measurements of sFlt, sEng and endothelin 1. These results will not be made available to the managing clinicians and will not affect management.</p><p>There are few data available on the pharmacokinetics of esomeprazole in pregnancy. In healthy males, the plasma elimination half-life is approximately 1&#x02013;1.5&#x02005;h and the peak plasma concentration occurs within 1&#x02013;4&#x02005;h after dosing. We propose to perform pharmacokinetic testing on a subgroup to determine if there are differences in the pregnant population. Fifteen patients in each group will undergo pharmacokinetic testing, so that blinding and allocation concealment is not affected. Blood will be drawn from an indwelling catheter in a forearm vein at 5&#x02005;min before the medication is given (reference sample) and then at the following dosing interval: 15, 30 and 45&#x02005;min and then at 1, 1, 5, 2, 4, 8 and 24&#x02005;h after the initial dose is given. The sampling will be repeated on day 5.</p><p>Urine samples will be collected two times per week and sent for spot protein: creatinine ratios. 24&#x02005;h protein excretion is routinely measured only once on admission but for the purposes of this study we will repeat it weekly. Cord blood and placental samples will be collected at delivery.</p></sec><sec id="s3k"><title>Withdrawal from the study</title><p>All participants will be informed that they are free to withdraw from the study at any time, and that this will not affect their clinical care.

We have powered the study for a further 5-day prolongation. This surrogate primary outcome marker has been chosen as it provides a sample size that is feasible and attainable for a phase II trial to test efficacy. Powering the trial to neonatal outcomes would require far greater numbers. If esomeprazole is proven to be effective, this trial would then form the basis for a larger multicentre trial powered to detect meaningful improvements in neonatal outcomes.</p><p>The secondary outcomes include maternal, fetal and neonatal mortality and morbidity, maternal serum biomarkers (including sFlt, sEng and endothelin 1) and placental samples (see <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="bx3">boxes 3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="bx5">5</xref> for more information regarding secondary outcomes). We will present a composite outcome of the important maternal outcomes which include maternal death, eclampsia, pulmonary oedema, severe renal impairment or the need for dialysis, cerebral vascular event and the development of a liver haematoma or rupture. Other maternal outcomes will be compared as individual outcomes as listed in <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="bx3">box 3</xref>. We will present a composite outcome for fetal outcomes. This will include poor prognostic signs on ultrasound, significant changes on the cardiotocograph that necessitate delivery, intrauterine fetal demise and growth restriction (see <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="bx4">box 4</xref>). The composite outcome for neonatal outcomes will include neonatal death within 6&#x02005;weeks after the due date, severe intraventricular haemorrhage, necrotising enterocolitis or bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Individual neonatal outcomes will be compared as listed in <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="bx4">box 4</xref>. We will measure weekly the biomarkers sFlt, sEng and endothelin 1 which are antiangiogenic factors likely to play a role in the maternal endothelial dysfunction that is central to the pathophysiology of pre-eclampsia (ie, it would be advantageous if treatments can decrease circulating levels of these circulating factors). Esomeprazole levels will be tested on a selected subgroup to determine if the pharmacokinetics are altered in pregnancy. Esomeprazole levels will also be determined in the cord blood to assess placental transfer. The placenta will be examined histologically, and we will quantify mRNA and protein expression of haeme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and sFlt-1 and sEng will be measured (see <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="bx5">box 5</xref>). HO-1 is an endogenous antioxidant protein that may be beneficial in pre-eclampsia. We postulate placental HO-1 will be upregulated by esomeprazole. mRNA will be quantified by quantitative PCR, and protein will be quantified by western blot and densitometric analysis of the band obtained on the gel blot.

If a treatment were to be discovered, it would have a major impact on both maternal and perinatal health. An ideal drug would ameliorate the biological disease process of pre-eclampsia in the mother and placenta, reduce the risk of serious complications from developing and allow pregnancies that were complicated by the disease at an early gestation to gain gestation without putting the mother and fetus at significantly increased risk.</p><p>However, there is currently no treatment besides delivery of fetus and placenta. Furthermore, there have been very few candidate-proposed treatments that have reached human trials. Thadhani <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> proposed the use of apheresis (or dialysis) to reduce the sFlt-1 fraction in the blood as a means to treat pre-eclampsia. That was a case series of eight patients where three had serial apheresis treatments with a possible prolongation of the pregnancy as a result. However, this is perhaps too invasive a treatment to be widely used to treat pre-eclampsia and its usefulness still remains unproven. As a result of preclinical studies, mainly on animal models, the anticholesterol drug pravastatin is being evaluated as a possible treatment for pre-eclampsia (STAMP trial, UK-based study).<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> We are not aware of other significant trials of orally available small molecules to treat pre-eclampsia.</p><p>It is known that the pre-eclamptic placenta releases antiangiogenic sFlt-1 and sEng into the maternal circulation, causing widespread maternal endothelial dysfunction and organ injury.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Pre-eclampsia is also associated with oxidative stress. A drug that can decrease sFlt-1 and sEng production, decrease endothelial dysfunction and oxidative stress may be a potential treatment for pre-eclampsia. We have generated preclinical data suggesting esomeprazole may have such actions. On the basis of this preclinical data, we are now proposing to undertake this phase II randomised clinical trial.</p><p>We propose recruiting 120 women at Tygerberg Hospital, in the Western Cape Provence of South Africa. There are two advantages to running the trial at this site. South Africa has a very high incidence of pre-eclampsia. Second, Tygerberg Hospital is a tertiary referral centre with a neonatal intensive care unit, a maternal critical care unit, an adult intensive care unit and an academic centre that actively contributes to the global scientific literature. Thus, we believe running this trial at Tygerberg Hospital represents a balance between obtaining sufficient number of cases of preterm pre-eclampsia, and offering modern obstetric and perinatal care, making the results potentially generalisable to both developed and developing countries.</p><p>Pravastatin is undergoing a randomised clinical trial in women with early onset pre-eclampsia (STAMP trial) and for women at risk of developing pre-eclampsia.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> However, pravastatin has been assigned to pregnancy category X by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) categorisation system and database for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. The FDA classifies category X drugs in pregnancy as medications where studies in animals or humans have demonstrated fetal abnormalities and/or there is positive evidence of human fetal risk based on adverse reaction data from investigational or marketing experience, and the risks involved in use of the drug in pregnant women clearly outweigh potential benefits.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Esomeprazole is classified as a category C drug in pregnancy by the FDA. Category C is for drugs where animal reproduction studies have shown an adverse effect on the fetus and there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in human, but potential benefits may warrant use of the drug in pregnant women despite potential risks.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Esomeprazole may very well then be a safer option than pravastatin for treating pre-eclampsia.</p><p>Additional safety information on the use of proton pump inhibitors in pregnancy is also now available as they have been extensively used in pregnancy for the treatment of gastro-oesophageal conditions. Large population-based cohorts and systematic reviews (including administration in the first trimester) have not found any adverse effects in pregnancy and specifically, these studies have not shown any increased risk for congenital abnormalities, spontaneous miscarriage or preterm delivery. The most recent systematic literature review which was published in 2009 included 1530 pregnancies exposed to proton pump inhibitors and had 133&#x02005;410 non-exposed matched controls.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> The largest study to date, published in 2010, spanned a 13-year period and involved 840&#x02005;968 pregnancies of which 5082 were exposed to proton pump inhibitors in the first trimester of pregnancy. This study concluded that exposure to proton pump inhibitors, even during the first trimester of pregnancy, was not associated with an increased risk of major birth defects.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> In 2012, a further large study involving 112&#x02005;022 pregnancies of which 1186 pregnancies that had been exposed to proton pump inhibitors confirmed there was no associated increase risk for congenital anomalies with proton pump inhibitor use. Importantly this study also found no increase in fetal growth restriction or adverse neonatal outcomes (including premature delivery and low Apgar scores) in pregnancies exposed to proton pump inhibitors in the first, second or third trimesters of pregnancies.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Thus, esomeprazole is likely to be safe in pregnancy. Furthermore, we will also only be using treatment for a relatively short period in the late second and early third trimesters, well past the time of organogenesis.</p><p>We have powered our study to the primary outcome, which is to show esomeprazole can safely prolong gestation for five days. We believe such a gain of gestation in preterm pre-eclampsia is likely to result in significantly better neonatal outcomes. However, a limitation in this trial is that we have not specifically powered to detect improvements in maternal, fetal or neonatal outcomes (although these are planned secondary outcomes). The trial would need to be significantly larger to detect such clinical improvements. Given esomeprazole has not been used to treat pre-eclampsia before, it seemed more pragmatic to first undertake the trial as planned. If this trial yields a positive result, a further phase III multicentre randomised trial may be required to be sufficiently powered to demonstrate improvements in clinical outcomes.</p><p>A further potential novelty of this trial is that we will measure biomarkers that reflect disease severity. We will measure circulating levels of sFlt-1 and sEng in serial samples obtained from the mother. These antiangiogenic factors are considered to play an important role in inciting maternal endothelial dysfunction and end-organ injury seen in pre-eclampsia. Their importance as biomarkers is highlighted by the fact that in the STAMP trial, the primary outcome is to examine whether pravastatin can decrease circulating sFlt-1 levels in the mother. Furthermore, we will measure expression of key molecules in the placental samples obtained at delivery.</p><p>Pre-eclampsia kills mothers, fetuses and neonates and is responsible for severe maternal and neonatal morbidity. This is especially the case in the developing world where there is a lack of resources, including staff, equipment and finances. Currently there is no treatment apart from delivery. If a treatment were to be discovered it would have dramatic effects on maternal and neonatal outcomes. Esomeprazole has shown potential as a therapeutic agent in preclinical work on pre-eclampsia. Further advantages of esomeprazole are that it is available in tablet form, is safe during pregnancy and is not expensive. This makes it an ideal candidate as a global therapeutic for pre-eclampsia. It is therefore imperative for this trial to be performed. If esomeprazole were proven to be effective at prolonging gestation in early onset pre-eclampsia it would be the first treatment option for this group of vulnerable mothers and could play an important role in decreasing the clinical burden of this dangerous condition.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to acknowledge Professor Jane Norman and Justus Hofmeyr for their contributions to the protocol development.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> CAC, SPW and ST developed and designed the trial.
