The other drugs being evaluated for this purpose include VEGF Trap, combrestatin, sirolimus, squalamine (inhibits plasma membrane ion channels), vatalanib and pazopanib (receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors) and bevasiranib (small interfering RNA).</p><p>Ranibizumab is a recombinantly produced, humanized, antibody (Fab) fragment that binds all biologically active isoforms of VEGF-A.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] It has only one antigen-binding domain. Ranibizumab received United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) approval for the treatment of neovascular AMD on June 30, 2006. Bevacizumab is a humanized full-length antibody that is derived from the same monoclonal antibody as ranibizumab.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] It has two antigen-binding domains and a longer half life of about 17-21 days. On February 26, 2004, the USFDA approved bevacizumab as a first-line treatment for intravenous use in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>]</p><p>Although ranibizumab is USFDA-approved for the treatment of CNVM secondary to AMD, it is indeed a costly treatment option. On the other hand, bevacizumab has been widely used off label for the treatment of CNV (at a dose of 1.25 mg in 0.05 ml)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] and is a relatively inexpensive treatment option when a single vial of bevacizumab is shared among multiple patients on the same day. Infact, ranibizumab should be atleast 2.5 times more efficacious than bevacizumab for it to be cost-effective.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>]</p><p>The cost difference between ranibizumab and bevacizumab could be highly significant for people who have limited or no health insurance coverage and this aspect assumes a greater significance in the Indian scenario. Thus, there is a very urgent need of carrying out large multicentric randomized controlled prospective studies comparing these two drugs with respect to their efficacies and safety profile. Two such studies are already underway (IVAN[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] and CATT[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] ),but the complete results are not yet available. Our study aimed to determine and compare the efficacy and safety of intravitreal ranibizumab and bevacizumab in treatment of CNVM due to AMD in the Indian scenario.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Approval from the institutional ethical committee was obtained for performing this prospective randomized study. Patients attending outpatient department of a tertiary hospital in Kolkata with complaints of dimness or blurring or distortion of vision, were subjected to complete ophthalmological examination. Patients were subjected to visual acuity testing by early treatment diabetic retinopathy study (ETDRS) chart, intraocular pressure measurement by applanation tonometry, gonioscopy, Amsler Grid assessment, slit-lamp examination and biomicroscopy after pupillary dilatation using +90 diopter (D) lens and direct and indirect ophthalmoscopy. Patients suspected to have wet AMD were referred to a tertiary eye institute in Kolkata for digital fundus fluorescein angiography (after adequate medical clearance) and optical coherence tomography (OCT), macular scan, to reach a definite diagnosis of CNVM formation.</p><p>Patients fulfilling all the following criteria were included:</p><p>

</p><p>Patients fulfilling the criteria of our study were informed of the nature of treatment that they would be offered, the potential risks, benefits, adverse effects, alternative treatment options and possible treatment outcomes. This was explained in their native language. Patients who wished to enroll signed a consent form. In the hospital where this study was carried out, the patients did not pay for their treatment and the hospital took care of the financial aspect of all treatments (including the cost of ranibizumab and bevacizumab injections) given to the patients. The consultant ophthalmologist had the discretion to prescribe suitable treatment for his/her patient after discussing the same. Informed consent was also obtained on subsequent treatment visits requiring intravitreal injections.</p><p>The study aimed to enroll a total of 120 patients over a period of about 6 months. This number was arrived at by the investigators after considering the sample size of the available literature of relevant studies at the time of initiating this study. Using random number tables, 60 numbers were randomly picked up from 1 to 120 and assigned to group A while the remaining sixty numbers were assigned to group B. This randomization of the 120 numbers into two groups was done before initiation of enrolment itself. Upon initiation of enrollment, the patients were numbered sequentially based on the serial order of enrolment in the study. Depending on the enrolment number, the patients were automatically assigned to either group A or B based on the prior randomization of numbers 1-120 into two equal groups using random number tables.</p><p>The patients in group A were given intravitreal injections of 0.5 mg ranibizumab (Lucentis) in 0.05 ml in the operation theatre, taking full aseptic measures on three consecutive months (Months 0, 1 and 2). Similarly, the patients in group B were given intravitreal injections of 1.25 mg bevacizumab (Avastin) in 0.05 ml in the operation theatre taking full aseptic measures on three consecutive months (Months 0, 1 and 2). The injections were given through the pars plana route 3.5-4.00 mm behind the limbus by the investigators, who were blinded to the type of injection. The patients were followed up for 6 hours after injection to check for visual acuity, intraocular pressure and status of the optic disc.</p><p>The patients were followed up monthly for the next 18 months. All assessors were masked to the group of patient they were following up. Visual acuity and assessment of CMT using Stratus OCT 3000 using six radial lines of 6 mm each at the macular region was performed along with measurement of blood pressure and enquiry about any unusual new extremity pain for each patient at each follow-up visit. Repeat injections (of the same drug as the initial one, at the same dose) were given to any patient who showed an increase in CMT of more than 100 &#x003bc;m after the initial three injections in either group or a fall in BCVA by more than 5 ETDRS letters.</p><p>The primary outcome measures were the changes in BCVA and CMT from baseline (month 0) to month 18.

Both were found to be equally efficacious with regard to bringing about improvement in BCVA (functional improvement) or improvement in CMT (structural improvement).</p><p>When we analyzed cases with predominantly classic CNVM only in the two groups (ranibizumab and bevacizumab groups), we found that the average increase in BCVA or average decrease in CMT in the two subgroups were better than the outcomes achieved in the whole group or the minimally classic and occult subgroups. At the end of 18 months, the ranibizumab group showed overall increase of 3.55 ETDRS letters over the baseline value, whereas predominantly classic ranibizumab subgroup showed an increase of 5.24 ETDRS letters equivalent over baseline. Similarly, in the bevacizumab group at the end of 18 months, overall increase of 3.96 ETDRS letters occurred over the baseline value, whereas the predominantly classic bevacizumab subgroup showed an increase of 5.4 ETDRS letters equivalent over baseline. This finding is in concurrence with the findings of the ANCHOR[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] and MARINA[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] trials where it was observed that predominantly classic CNVM reported a better improvement in visual acuity as compared to minimally classic and occult lesions. The probable reason for this is that predominantly classic lesions are diagnosed earlier because of the more rapid visual decline typical of this group, thereby allowing for earlier initiation of treatment so that more photoreceptors can be salvaged.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] Also, the sub retinal pigment epithelium RPE location of occult lesions may hinder the anti-VEGF molecule's penetration to the VEGF receptor, thereby resulting in relatively lesser visual acuity gain.</p><p>In both the groups, no significant adverse effects were reported, with subconjunctival hemorrhage being the most common adverse effect in both groups, followed by increased intraocular pressure and mild ocular inflammation. These observations are in line with the observations of Mojica <italic>et al</italic>. and Fung <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] There were no reported cases of endophthalmitis in the ranibizumab group in the PIER study.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] According to the Fung <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] the incidence of endophthalmitis after using intravitreal injections of bevacizumab was 0.01%. Endophthalmitis, lens injury or retinal detachment was not observed in any patient in our study.</p><p>The mean number of injections required in our study in the bevacizumab group (4.3) was less than the number required in the ranibizumab group (5.6). This finding is similar to that of Fung <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] and this can probably be explained by the fact that bevacizumab is a full-length molecule with a longer half life as compared to the fragmented molecule of ranibizumab which has a shorter half life. Repeat injections were not required in 25.93% in ranibizumab group and 21% in bevacizumab group.</p><p>There are few reported studies comparing head on head the efficacies of ranibizumab and bevacizumab till the time this article was written.

Subramanian <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>]in their prospective randomized double masked single center study over 6 months concluded that visual outcomes of bevacizumab in wet AMD appear to be no different from ranibizumab. Their study had a total of 20 patients.</p><p>However, Chang <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] concluded otherwise. In their retrospective comparative study, they concluded that short-term effectiveness of ranibizumab treatment, as measured by incremental improvement in OCT parameters, was significantly greater than bevacizumab treatment.</p><p>Our study, a prospective randomized trial conducted across two centers in Kolkata, India, with 104 subjects and a total of about 302 injections in the ranibizumab group and about 216 injections in the bevacizumab group, studied results over 18 months. Parameters studied included both change in BCVA and CMT and the adverse effects of the two drugs over 18 months. We found no statistically significant difference in the efficacy and safety of ranibizumab and bevacizumab when used as intravitreal injections for treatment of CNVM due to wet AMD.</p><p>Thus, from our present study we can conclude that both ranibizumab and bevacizumab are safe and efficacious treatment options as intravitreal injections in the treatment of CNVM due to AMD and that the two do not have statistically significant difference between them in terms of bringing about BCVA and CMT improvement.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kvanta</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Algvere</surname><given-names>PV</given-names></name><name><surname>Berglin</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Seregard</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Subfoveal fibrovascular membranes in age-related macular degeneration express vascular endothelial growth factor</article-title><source>Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci</source><year>1996</year><volume>37</volume><fpage>1929</fpage><lpage>34</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">8759365</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Otani</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Takagi</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Oh</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Koyama</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Ogura</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Matumura</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Vascular endothelial growth factor family and receptor expression in human choroidal neovascular membranes</article-title><source>Microvasc Res</source><year>2002</year><volume>64</volume><fpage>162</fpage><lpage>9</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">12074642</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Zarbin</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Szirth</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Current Treatment of Age-Related Macular Degeneration</article-title><source>Optom Vis Sci</source><year>2007</year><volume>84</volume><fpage>559</fpage><lpage>72</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">17632299</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Michels</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Rosenfeld</surname><given-names>PJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Puliafito</surname><given-names>CA</given-names></name><name><surname>Marcus</surname><given-names>EN</given-names></name><name><surname>Venkatraman</surname><given-names>AS</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Systemic bevacizumab (Avastin) therapy for neovascular age-related macular degeneration twelve-week results of an uncontrolled open-label clinical study</article-title><source>Ophthalmology</source><year>2005</year><volume>112</volume><fpage>1035</fpage><lpage>47</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15936441</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="webpage"><article-title>First-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer [Internet].
