Although the widely used Oxford Knee Score (OKS) was developed to assess outcomes of knee replacement in trial populations,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref> several PCTs have set maximum OKS thresholds (ranging from 18 to 32), above which patients are ineligible for TKR.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18 b19 b20 b21 b22 b23 b24">18&#x02013;24</xref> However, we are not aware of any clinical or cost-effectiveness justification for these thresholds. Furthermore, many patients with higher OKS have significant symptoms or limitations to daily activities that could be improved by surgery. If rationing policies are to be adopted, cost-effectiveness analysis offers the only fair basis for designing them since it ensures that NHS resources are allocated to maximise the health gained from available resources. As treatments are generally considered cost-effective if they cost &#x0003c;&#x000a3;20&#x02008;000&#x02013;&#x000a3;30&#x02008;000 per QALY gained,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref> restricting TKR to those patients for whom the procedure costs &#x0003c;&#x000a3;20&#x02008;000&#x02013;&#x000a3;30&#x02008;000/QALY gained would be a reasonable approach, potentially realising savings that could be invested in other treatments giving greater health gains. However, we are aware of no published evidence assessing how the cost-effectiveness of TKR varies with OKS.</p><p>We therefore use data from the Knee Arthroplasty Trial (KAT)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref> to assess the appropriateness of rationing knee replacement by OKS, age, BMI and clinical characteristics, by calculating the cost-effectiveness of TKR in different patient subgroups.

A cost-utility analysis was conducted, which assessed cost-effectiveness as the cost per QALY gained to capture the quality of life gains associated with TKR.</p><p>Data on costs and quality of life following TKR were taken from the KAT trial (ISRCTN 45837371): a pragmatic, partial-factorial, unblinded randomised controlled trial in which 2352 participants attending 34 UK centres were randomly allocated to undergo TKR with/without a metal-backed tibial component, with/without patellar resurfacing and/or with/without a mobile bearing.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref> Five-year trial results demonstrated that patients experience substantial improvements in quality of life and functional status following knee replacement that are maintained out to 5&#x02005;years<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>; further follow-up is ongoing.

The OKS is a validated 12-item questionnaire for assessing health status and outcomes in relation to knee replacement that gives an unweighted total score ranging from 0 (severe problems on all items) to 48 (no problems on any item).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref> The EQ-5D is a generic health state preference measure<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>; health state preference values (&#x02018;utilities&#x02019;) for EQ-5D profiles were based on time-trade-off valuations by members of the UK general public.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref> EQ-5D utilities range from &#x02212;0.594 (extreme problems on all five domains) to 1 (perfect health) and indicate the value placed on different levels of health. The number of QALYs that each patient accrued following TKR was calculated as the area under the utility curve, with linear interpolation between utility measurements; those patients who died were assumed to remain at the last observed utility until death.</p><p>Healthcare resource use data (including knee-related outpatient, general practice and physiotherapy consultations and theatre time, hospital days, complications and knee components used during the primary admission for TKR and during any knee-related readmissions or revisions) were collected prospectively for all KAT participants and valued at 2007&#x02013;2008 prices, as described previously.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref> Costs incurred after year 1 were discounted at 3.5% per year based on current UK recommendations.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref></p><p>The number of QALYs gained from TKR was calculated as the number of QALYs observed minus the number of QALYs expected without TKR.

Bootstrapping was used to capture uncertainty around incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) and correlations between costs and QALYs with/without TKR; the regression models for costs and outcomes were run for each of the 125 bootstrap samples drawn from each imputed KAT data set and results combined using Rubin's rule.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref> Predicted costs and the predicted number of QALYs accrued with and without TKR in different patient groups were calculated from regression coefficients and used to estimate ICERs.

If the decision rules were simplified further to provide TKR to all patients with baseline OKS &#x0003c;39, all but 1700 of the 61&#x02008;651 patients currently receiving TKR in England and Wales in 2009/2010<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref> would be eligible. Allowing for other baseline characteristics had minimal effect on patient numbers or predicted costs or benefits, suggesting that decisions about suitability for TKR can be based on OKS alone.</p><p>Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the effect of extending the time horizon of our analysis up to 10&#x02005;years and of assuming that EQ-5D utility would have fallen by 0.5% per year without TKR,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref> that all knee-related ambulatory consultations would have occurred without TKR and that the mean length of stay has fallen by 41% (5.9&#x02005;days<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref> vs 10.0) since the KAT operations took place in the period 1999&#x02013;2003. Changing any of these assumptions produced lower ICERs than the base case analysis, confirming that the current analysis is highly conservative and suggesting that TKR may be cost-effective for ASA grade 1&#x02013;2 patients with baseline OKS as high as 43. Excluding patients with incomplete data had no effect on conclusions. Although statistically significant, adding an age-squared term to the regression model had no effect on the conclusions, while a sensitivity analysis adding an OKS-squared term suggested that TKR may be cost-effective for all patients of ASA grade 1 or 2. Recoding BMI as a dummy variable indicating whether or not patients were obese (BMI &#x02265;30) did not change the conclusions, and obesity had no significant effect on costs or QALYs.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>We found TKR to cost &#x000a3;5623/QALY gained for the average patient (similar to estimates from previous studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6 b7 b8 b9 b10">6&#x02013;10</xref>) and therefore represent very good value for money compared with the &#x000a3;20&#x02008;000&#x02013;&#x000a3;30&#x02008;000/QALY threshold typically used in NHS decision making.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref> Our study also confirms previous findings<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> that costs and benefits vary with age and comorbidity but evaluates such characteristics, and pre-operative knee function, in multivariate analyses, which has not (to our knowledge) been done previously. We found pre-operative OKS to be the best predictor of post-operative costs, outcomes and cost-effectiveness.</p><p>Our analyses were based on patient-level data from a large trial with detailed prospective collection of costs, utilities and baseline characteristics that permit extensive subgroup analyses. KAT used a pragmatic design with broad inclusion criteria and no restrictions on peri- or post-operative care other than randomised aspects of component design<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>; as a result, the trial cohort is similar to the national Patient Reported Outcome Measures cohort, and costs and benefits are likely to be comparable to those in routine clinical practice. Furthermore, unlike some previous economic evaluations, our study took full account of uncertainty and included all knee-related NHS costs accrued in the first 5&#x02005;years after TKR. The main limitation of our analysis was the small number of patients with high OKS. Since KAT recruited only 37 patients with OKS &#x0003e;35, further studies are required to evaluate TKR in this patient subgroup. Analyses were also based on post hoc comparisons between outcomes before and after TKR, rather than between randomly assigned treatment groups. As a result, our study does not provide unbiased estimates of the QALY gains from TKR, and regression towards the mean may have caused our study to overestimate the quality of life improvement attributable to TKR and/or the effect of pre-operative OKS on QALY gains.</p><p>We made several highly conservative assumptions, in particular, assuming that patients would have accrued no knee-related costs and would have remained at baseline utility without TKR, whereas previous studies have found that patients accrue substantial costs and show clinical worsening without TKR.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref> We also assumed that those patients who died before hospital discharge would have survived for 5&#x02005;years if they had not had TKR; in reality, those patients dying soon after TKR tend to be older<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref> and frailer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref> pre-operatively, and some studies suggest that patients undergoing hip replacement have higher long-term survival than the general population<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref> (although this may be due to patient selection<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>). When these assumptions were relaxed, TKR was cost-effective for ASA grade 1&#x02013;2 patients with baseline OKS &#x0003c;44. The costs and benefits of TKR are likely to vary between centres and over time due to variations in patient demographics, component prices, length of stay and operation time; sensitivity analyses demonstrated that TKR may have become more cost-effective since the KAT procedures were conducted in the period 1999&#x02013;2003 due to reductions in length of stay.</p><p>Our analyses show that if TKR were to be rationed based on cost-effectiveness, OKS would be a reasonable tool to use to set the threshold, although there may, of course, be practical difficulties with using a patient-reported measure to determine treatment eligibility: particularly if patients know how their questionnaire responses will be used or if test-retest reliability is low in this setting. The decision to operate must also take into consideration other factors, such as radiographic findings and patient choice. Based on regression and subgroup analyses, we can be confident that TKR costs &#x0003c;&#x000a3;20&#x02008;000/QALY for all ASA grade 1&#x02013;2 patients with baseline OKS &#x0003c;40 and for ASA grade 3 patients with OKS &#x0003c;35. Using these thresholds to determine who received treatment would avoid around 2000 TKR procedures per year in England and Wales, saving around &#x000a3;11.8 million/year. However, the higher thresholds suggested by sensitivity analyses using less conservative assumptions suggest that TKR is cost-effective for all but 100 patients/year, which is unlikely to achieve sufficient savings to warrant rationing of TKR. Although the cost-effectiveness of knee replacement was also influenced by gender and age, taking account of these factors as well as OKS and ASA grade would increase the complexity of eligibility criteria, reduce equality of access to healthcare and have minimal effect on NHS budgets.</p><p>The results also demonstrate that the thresholds proposed by some PCTs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18 b19 b20 b21 b22 b23 b24">18&#x02013;24</xref> are inappropriate and would deny a highly cost-effective treatment to thousands of patients with severe arthritis. The current situation also introduces a postcode lottery with different PCTs using different eligibility criteria. We estimate that limiting knee replacement to patients with OKS &#x02264;26 would prevent &#x0003e;10&#x02008;000 people from receiving TKR. This would be inequitable as TKR costs &#x000a3;10&#x02008;697/QALY gained for this group, whereas the NICE routinely recommend treatments with ICERs in the region of &#x000a3;20&#x02008;000&#x02013;&#x000a3;30&#x02008;000/QALY gained<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref> and are willing to pay substantially more for end of life care.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref> Furthermore, the finding that TKR and subsequent monitoring is more costly for patients with low OKS suggests that delaying TKR until symptoms have deteriorated may be a false economy. Although some PCTs have considered restricting TKR further for obese patients,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref> we found BMI to have no significant effect on costs (p=0.442), QALY gains (p=0.098) or the incidence of peri- or post-operative complications (p&#x0003e;0.26). Although BMI remained non-significant even when ASA grade was omitted from regression analyses, it is difficult to isolate the effect of obesity from other correlated variables (eg, comorbidity); as a result, further research on obesity may be warranted, particularly since a previous study observed a significant correlation between BMI and costs.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref></p><p>Eligibility criteria for rheumatoid arthritis patients and patients with ASA grade 4 remain unclear, although ASA grade 4 patients would normally be considered unfit for surgery, and the decision to operate on such patients would be based on a case-by-case consideration of whether the benefits outweigh the risks. While our study focused on the costs and benefits of TKR, patients with high baseline OKS often undergo unicompartmental knee replacement; further research is needed to evaluate how the cost-effectiveness of unicompartmental replacement varies with OKS.</p><p>In conclusion, TKR is highly cost-effective for the vast majority of patients who currently undergo this procedure in the UK. Although costs and health benefits vary with baseline OKS, the rationing thresholds proposed by some PCTs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18 b19 b20 b21 b22 b23 b24">18&#x02013;24</xref> are not supported by evidence on health outcomes or cost-effectiveness.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Supporting Statement</title></caption><media xlink:href="bmjopen-2011-000332-s1.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d32e1184" position="anchor" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d32e170" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2011-000332.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d32e171" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2011-000332.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank all those involved in the KAT trial for their role in running the trial and collecting the data used in this study, particularly other members of the KAT Project Management Group: Suzanne Breeman, Marion Campbell, Jackie Ellington, Nick Fiddian, Adrian Grant, Linda Johnston and Richard Morris.
