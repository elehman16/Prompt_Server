ultrasound with bee venom is effective in treating delayed onset muscle soreness of the
biceps brachii muscle, using the visual analogue scale, range of motion test (flexion and
extension), and serum creatine kinase level. [Subjects] Twenty women participated in this
study. [Methods] Repeated eccentric contractions were used to induce delayed onset muscle
soreness in the elbow flexor of the subjects. The subjects were randomized to be treated
with ultrasound alone or ultrasound with bee venom. We evaluated the effects of treatments
in the 2 groups. Individual subjects were assessed using the visual analogue scale, range
of motion test, and serum creatine kinase level. The assessment parameters were evaluated
4 times: before exercise and 24, 48, and 72 hours after exercise. [Results] The visual
analogue scale scores were significantly different before and after the experiment in both
the group treated with ultrasound and the group treated with ultrasound and bee venom. The
difference in elbow flexion and extension before and after the experiment was
significantly different in both groups. No significant difference was found in the serum
creatine kinase levels before and after the experiment. [Conclusion] Treatment with
ultrasound and bee venom is effective for managing delayed onset muscle soreness.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Eccentric exercise</kwd><kwd>Bee venom</kwd><kwd>Ultrasound</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>People enjoy sports and leisure activities, but using muscles for long periods of time
causes muscle soreness. Delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) is pain and stiffness felt in
muscles several hours after resistance movement or unaccustomed, strenuous exercise. The
soreness is felt most strongly 24 to 48 hours after the exercise<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup> and is thought to
be caused by eccentric (lengthening) exercise. DOMS is thought to be caused by neuromuscular
dysfunction, such as shortened muscle length or limited range of motion (ROM) in terms of
the physiological response to muscle injury. It has been attributed to the increased tension
force and muscle lengthening from eccentric contraction rather than from concentric
contraction<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. In DOMS, injury of the
muscle and connective tissue affects ROM and serum creatine kinase (CK) levels<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.
The activity of muscle enzymes in blood is a useful indicator to evaluate the stress exerted
with exercise. The enzyme CK is assayed in blood tests as a marker<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the study of Child and Jacobs et al., exercise was
performed by 14 healthy subjects who repeated 3 sets of the exercise 10 times at 80% of
maximum strength for 7 days. It was reported that the level of CK was highest at 48&#x02013;72 hours
after eccentric exercise<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Many treatments have been used for DOMS. With regard to physical and kinematic approaches
of stretching<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>, sonophoresis with
ultrasound<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup> has been used for DOMS.
Low-intensity ultrasound has been reported to be effective for reducing pain and swelling
and for increasing the range of movement in damaged skeletal muscles<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>To date, many studies have analyzed the clinical application of ultrasound to infiltrate
various drugs through the skin<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. In a
recent study, mixed local anesthetic and anti-inflammatory agents were used to reduce
inflammation and pain<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In Oriental medicine, bee venom (BV) is used as a local anesthetic and anti-inflammatory
agent. Injecting BV into tissue can control inflammation and pain while reinforcing
immunity. BV has the unique pharmacological function of stimulating the immune system as a
biochemical foreign body<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The main ingredients of BV are various enzymes, peptides, and low-molecular-weight organic
substances (non-peptide substances). The main peptides in BV are melittin, apamin, and
adolapin, and they have powerful anti-inflammatory and analgesic functions<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Local analgesic and anti-inflammatory
factors are activated in lesions by injecting BV, as the level of cortisol in blood is
elevated and the biosynthesis of prostaglandin is inhibited<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Doyle<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>
reported that BV had both anti-inflammatory and analgesic actions.</p><p>In those respects, the present study was aimed at verifying the effectiveness of using
ultrasound with BV for treatment of DOMS.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects in this study were adult women who were 21 to 34&#x02005;years old and worked in J
hospitals. They were randomized into those who were treated with ultrasound and bee venom
(the BVUS group; n = 10) (M&#x000b1;SD age 27.42&#x000b1;2.57&#x02005;years, height 159.71&#x000b1;3.25&#x02005;cm, weight
48.42&#x000b1;2.99&#x02005;kg) and those who were only treated with normal ultrasound (the US group; n = 10)
(M&#x000b1;SD age 28.85&#x000b1;3.62&#x02005;years, height 160.71&#x000b1;6.10&#x02005;cm, weight 50.71&#x000b1;5.79&#x02005;kg). The women
participated voluntarily and fully understood the purpose of this study. None of the
subjects performed any heavy exercise for their upper extremities or were on any medication
for 1 month prior to the study. They had no skeletal and neuromuscular dysfunction, no upper
extremity pain or open wounds, and no history of neurosurgery or psychiatric disorders, and
had a normal response in an allergic reaction test to BV. This study was approved by the
Ethics Committee of the Eulji University Graduate School of Health Science.</p><p>For BV allergy testing, 0.05&#x02005;mL of diluted BV (a ratio of BV:saline=1:1000) was injected
intradermally into the forearm. After verification that the tested lesion resulted in a
wheal with a diameter of less than 10&#x02005;mm and erythema with a diameter of less than 26.5&#x02005;mm
after 10 to 15 minutes, subjects were cleared to participate in this study<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>First, the maximum load for each subject was investigated for the elbow flexor using
1-repetition isometric maximum exercise. Subjects then performed eccentric resistance
exercises with 70% of the 1-repetition isometric maximum (e.g., maximum load 5&#x02005;kg &#x000d7; 7/10 =
3.5&#x02005;kg). The exercises were performed 7 times with 10 repetitions, and the subjects took a
break time for one minute per exercise<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>.
This unit of exercise was designated 1 bout. If the muscle fatigue does not occur after
repeating 1 bout, the exercise was repeated until the subjects could not exercise due to
muscle fatigue. The subjects were excluded from all exercise and treatment for 24 hours
after eccentric exercise of the biceps brachii muscle.</p><p>Ultrasound was applied to the belly of the biceps brachii muscle at a frequency of 1&#x02005;MHz,
intensity of 1.0&#x02005;W/cm<sup>2</sup>, and speed of 2.5&#x02005;cm/s for 10 minutes in each session. As
a coupling medium, ultrasound gel and diluted bee venom (0.001%) mixed at a ratio of 9:1 was
used for the experimental group, and pure ultrasound gel was used for the control group. Ten
milliliters of coupling medium was used in both groups. For this research into the impact of
the treatment on DOMS, the VAS, ROM (elbow flexion and extension), and CK level were
measured as the assessment parameters just before exercise and 24, 48, and 72 hours after
exercise.</p><p>SPSS 18.0 was used for statistical analysis. The data were analyzed by repeated measures
ANOVA to compare time following exercise in each group and the independent t-test to compare
differences between pre- and post-measurement values in both groups. The level of
statistical significance &#x003b1; was 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The VAS was significantly different after the experiment compared with before the

The reduction of locomotion caused by muscle flexibility training can last up to 4 days, and

significantly improved elbow flexion but had no impact on pain threshold and pain index in a
study comparing elbow flexion and extension, mechanical pain threshold, and the pain
index.</p><p>In this study, the reduction in pain (VAS) was significant (p&#x0003c;0.05) at 72 hours after
the exercise in the US and BVUS groups. In addition, the reduction in pain was more
significant in the BVUS group than in the US group due to absorption of BV. Melittin and
apamin are thought to reinforce immunity with powerful anti-inflammatory and analgesic
actions based on a mechanism of infiltration through intercellular lesions.</p><p>In the range of measured movements, the BVUS treatment showed significant improvement in
not only elbow flexion but also elbow extension. In contrast to the study by Craig et
al.<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>, BVUS improved articular movement
and reduced pain. Potteiger<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup> reported
that the level of CK significantly increased 24 hours after exercise and was a marker of
muscle damage.</p><p>The level of serum CK was significantly elevated after maximum eccentric exercise of the
biceps followed by a break for 24&#x02005;h. This result suggested that DOMS may have been induced
in the biceps, and the level of serum CK when sampled at 72&#x02005;h was about 8,000 U/L.</p><p>Previous studies with ultrasound reported that ultrasound treatment with piroxicam gel was
effective for recovery from muscle injury induced by eccentric exercise<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. Hoogland<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that sonophoresis with ultrasound at a frequency of 1&#x02005;MHz
could penetrate soft tissue to about 9 to 50&#x02005;mm and that a frequency of 3&#x02005;MHz could
penetrate to about 2 to 16.5&#x02005;mm. Based on Hoogland&#x02019;s<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup> study, we concluded that ultrasound at a frequency of 1&#x02005;MHz in this
study was effective enough for soft tissue when used with the BV coupling medium. In
particular, the application of ultrasound with the BV coupling medium was effective for pain
reduction (measured using the VAS) and recovery of flexion and extension impairment caused
by DOMS. In addition, BVUS did not lower the serum CK level, but the CK level was lower at
72 hours after the exercise in the BVUS group than in the normal US group.</p><p>For recovery from DOMS, BVUS in conjunction with other physical and kinematic interventions
is an effective procedure for pain relief and improving the mobility of muscle.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><person-group><name><surname>Kisner</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Colby</surname><given-names>LA</given-names></name></person-group>: Therapeutic exercise, 4th ed.
