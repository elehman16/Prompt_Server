However, clinical outcomes may have been affected in the control group by the monthly empathetic phone calls from a research officer. Psychological distress, especially anxiety, was high, present in up to 40% of participants, and improvement in anxiety was seen over 12&#x02005;months in both groups, not only those receiving health mentoring calls but also those receiving only a regular &#x02018;contact&#x02019; phone call. Self-management coping capacity also improved in both groups. The PIH scale used in this study was developed to assess self-management knowledge and behaviour objectively,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref> where self-management embodies five aspects: knowledge, negotiation of care, engaging in positive health behaviour, monitoring and managing symptoms, and managing impacts on function. The four key factors in the scale, knowledge, coping, recognising and managing symptoms and adhering to treatment, explained 80% of the variance and had high internal consistency in a study on a population with a range of chronic conditions, including diabetes, osteoporosis, arthritis, cardiovascular and respiratory diseases.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref> To our knowledge, this is the first study to show a significant change in self-management capacity using the PIH scale in COPD.</p><p>In the HM group, intrusiveness or reawakening of stress associated with illness experiences showed moderate evidence towards improvement. A study that used a composite measure of interference with aspects of life and involved nurse-assisted patient-centred collaborative management using monthly phone calls also resulted in a reduction in perceived illness intrusiveness compared to UC in a comparable primary care recruited COPD population but again without improving QOL.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref> However, the positive effect of patient-centred self-management support on stressful COPD-related memories needs to be noted.</p><p>The limitations of the study were the high rate of misclassification of COPD in general practices, which impacted on enrolment,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref> and higher than expected withdrawal rates, especially in the HM group, which reduced the intended statistical power. The strengths of the study were the inclusion of a credible attention control group, suggesting that health mentoring was responsible for the observed benefits of self-management capacity and formal assessment of nurses&#x02019; adherence to delivery of mentoring.</p><p>A previous study of health mentoring delivered by community health nurses in hospital-recruited patients with COPD with more severe disease, who also used a daily symptom diary, resulted in significantly improved aspects of health-related QOL measured using the SF-36, PF and GH, over 12&#x02005;months compared to UC.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref> In that study, the UC group did not receive any phone calls and the HM made an initial home visit followed by phone calls whose frequency was not predetermined. Importantly in that study, HM training differed, being based on motivational interviewing and assessment of readiness to change using the transtheoretical model.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref> The present study focused on self-management, building rapport and collaborative partnerships with patients with COPD, as well as the application of a specific framework for health behaviour changes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref> Our population also had less severe disease, where behavioural interventions need to be focused on for preventing deterioration in COPD.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></p><p>The apparent benefit from brief regular phone contacts was unexpected but may relate to the impact of personal contact in the light of the known social isolation often imposed by COPD.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref> While it is possible that we were merely seeing regression to the mean with this change, this is unlikely as there is generally progressively worsening QOL<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref> and psychological morbidity in COPD.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref> A likely explanation is that control calls were therapeutic, providing participants with regular empathetic support. Satisfaction with social support, especially emotional support, predicts adjustment to chronic illnesses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref> and brief or minimal interventions that enhance this are effective for improving psychosocial adjustment to cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref> and stroke.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref> There are no such data for COPD.</p><p>Translating self-management support into positive health behaviour changes is likely to depend on individual motivation, which fluctuates and is affected by personal and external factors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref> and individual perception of COPD.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref> This may partly explain why health mentoring produced better self-management capacity and knowledge, although no effect was seen on QOL. The change in attitude detected may be followed by clinical improvements, which although slight may be important at an individual level. A high proportion of mentored participants in this study made plans to increase physical activity,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref> which emphasises its importance to patients. The HM intervention aimed to promote health behaviour change most relevant to the individual with COPD, that is, to be patient centred; however, had we included an action plan for walking for each participant, the results might have been different. A positive relationship has been shown in COPD between exercise and psychological well-being,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref> but it is possible that the intensity of physical activity undertaken was insufficient to cause a change in the overall QOL. Indeed, making clinically important, sustained improvements in physical activity in COPD is difficult. In another study, after three counselling sessions by general practice nurses (total 1&#x02005;h) assessing and communicating cardiovascular disease risk with motivational interviewing, there were no positive changes in physical activity or in any other lifestyle risk factor compared to a minimal intervention.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref> A lifestyle activity intervention that did improve QOL gave patients 36&#x02005;h of face-to-face and telephone contact time plus group exercise sessions, which would not be practical in community care.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></p><p>Community nurses acted as HMs in our study, in accord with the recommended change in focus for community health and health systems towards prevention.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref> With a wider role envisaged for general practice nurses, training in health mentoring could increase availability of self-management support with the benefits we have demonstrated on self-management capacity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref> In our study, nurses received formal training as HMs over 2&#x02005;days, complemented by ongoing support. Training of similar length in motivational interviewing for community nurses in general practice gave no advantage over a minimal intervention.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref> However, our study differed in that we specifically measured the important aspect of adherence to delivery of a behavioural intervention.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref> We identified areas for improvements in HM training. Whereas community nurses&#x02019; adherence to the delivery of the component of praise for positive changes was high, adherence was low for some key cognitive and behavioural skills, for example negative self-talk and identification of barriers.</p><p>In summary, health mentoring delivered by community health nurses increased the self-management capacity of people with COPD in the community but did not change QOL. A short empathetic phone call had some positive effects and should be further assessed. Optimising training and supporting HMs&#x02019; skill development in routine practice will also be an important area for future research.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e251" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2013-003097.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e252" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2013-003097.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank H Courtney-Pratt who recruited mentors and facilitated support groups.
