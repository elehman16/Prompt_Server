immediate family/friends who engaged them in deliberate activities/communication in the

dysarthria, limiting their ability to communicate through speech, writing or
gesture.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269215512450042">1</xref></sup> This
restricts everyday activities and social participation, has adverse psychological effects
and negatively impacts on families and informal caregivers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269215512450042">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269215512450042">3</xref></sup></p><p>The ACT NoW Study (Assessing Communication Therapy in the North West), used a mixed-methods
approach (randomized controlled trial and qualitative study) to examine the effectiveness,
cost-effectiveness, service use and service users&#x02019; views of early, intensively resourced,
flexible intervention delivered by speech and language therapists, compared with an
equivalent amount of contact but not therapy provided by &#x02018;visitors&#x02019; (employees not
volunteers).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269215512450042">4</xref></sup> This
paper focuses on the qualitative study. It explored, through individual interview, trial
participants&#x02019; perceptions of the process and outcomes of either the intervention (speech and
language therapy) or attention control (visitor contact).</p><p>Patients were externally randomized to either speech and language therapy which commenced
as soon as clinically indicated at a maximum frequency of three contacts per week for up to
16 weeks, or to a visitor. Visitors were trained to deliver social attention and activities
absent of any intuitive form of communication therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269215512450042">5</xref></sup> Both the intervention and the attention
control were, therefore, defined in part by human agency.</p><p>This study seeks to disentangle the effects of the person (visitor or speech and language
therapist) from what they actually did (intervention or attention control) within the trial.
This is needed because, while trials are good at providing robust evidence about whether an
intervention is effective, they are less good at explaining why a result has
occurred.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269215512450042">6</xref></sup> This is
a particularly pertinent issue for non-pharmacological trials where the personal and social
context in which an intervention occurs inevitably will assert some kind of
influence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269215512450042">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269215512450042">8</xref></sup></p><p>The qualitative study was designed to enable participants to identify factors which they
regarded as important in evaluating the process as well as the outcomes of their
experiences. The analysis of these perceptions, while standing alone, was also intended as
contributory evidence toward explaining potential variations in effectiveness within and
between groups in the trial. This paper is, therefore, published as a companion to the
randomized controlled trial. It contributes to the debate about the implications of the main
trial results for professional behaviour, patient experience and service delivery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="section9-0269215512450042"><title>Methods</title><p>Both trial participants and carers were involved in the qualitative study but only results
from participant interviews are reported here. The study&#x02019;s formal research aims were:</p><list list-type="bullet" id="list1-0269215512450042"><list-item><p>to explore participants&#x02019; experiences of speech and language therapy intervention or
visitor attention control;</p></list-item><list-item><p>to evaluate from participants&#x02019; perspectives the effectiveness of speech and language
therapy intervention or visitor attention control, both in terms of process and
outcome;</p></list-item><list-item><p>to compare the perceived impact on participant well-being of speech and language
therapy intervention or visitor attention control.</p></list-item></list><p>We approached all participants in the ACT NoW study who had completed their post-outcome
(six-month) assessment between June 2008 and April 2009. ACT NoW exclusion criteria meant
that there were no potential participants with pre-existing learning disabilities or
dementia likely to prevent benefits from therapy, subarachnoid haemorrhage, serious medical
conditions (e.g. terminal disease), unable to complete eligibility screening even after
three attempts or, with communication problems that had already resolved.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269215512450042">4</xref></sup></p><p>The study obtained Multicentre Research Ethics Committee approval (06/MRE03/42). Informed
consent for participation in the qualitative study was obtained from each participant
separately from their informed consent to participate in the randomized controlled trial.
This was (1) to ensure that any concerns about having to be interviewed did not unduly
influence recruitment to the main trial; (2) to distinguish the aims of the qualitative
study from other aspects of the trial so that it would be clear what might be expected of
those who agreed to be interviewed.</p><p>The original intention had been to purposively sample, based on such criteria as severity
of impairment, age, gender, ethnicity, socio-economic status. However there were limited
numbers of eligible participants at the time of data collection, therefore a whole sample
approach was used. Of the 36 potential participants, 22 agreed to take part drawn from 8 out
of the 12 sites in which ACT NoW took place. Of those who did not participate, 5 had
withdrawn from the trial, 6 did not consent, 2 declined information about the qualitative
study and 1 was readmitted to hospital. Sixteen (73%) participants had a baseline
communication impairment that was rated in the &#x02018;severe&#x02019; category on the Therapy Outcome
Measure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269215512450042">9</xref></sup> This
proportion is similar to that in the non-participant group (<italic>n =</italic> 11) (79%)
and in the larger sample (<italic>n =</italic> 170) in the randomized controlled trial
(68%).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269215512450042">4</xref></sup></p><p>Twelve participants had been randomized into the speech and language therapy group, 10 into
the visitor group. There were 13 men and 9 women in the sample with a median age of 73 years
(range: 53&#x02013;98 years). Five had a diagnosis of dysarthria, 12 of aphasia and 5 had both
aphasia and dysarthria. The self-rated Communication Outcomes After Stroke (COAST)
scale<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269215512450042">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215512450042">11</xref></sup> was designed to ascertain
perceived level of communication disability and impact on daily life. Eleven of the
qualitative sample scored above the median on COAST, 6 had scores up to the median and in 5
of cases there were three or more missing values, indicating a more severe degree of
disability.</p><sec id="section10-0269215512450042"><title>Interviews</title><p>Qualitative interviewing of participants with aphasia/dysarthria is entirely
possible<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269215512450042">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269215512450042"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269215512450042">14</xref></sup> but some basic assumptions of
qualitative interviewing cannot be taken for granted, such as sustained narrative
engagement. Typically people with aphasia or dysarthria can vary considerably in the
extent to which they might have impairments in expression and/or understanding.
Adaptations by the interviewer and a more structured approach to data elicitation are
helpful.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215512450042">11</xref></sup> We
maximized the potential involvement of participants with the greatest difficulty
communicating by training the interviewer (TG) in the techniques of Supported Conversation
for adults with Aphasia (SCA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215512450042">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269215512450042">16</xref></sup> and
through the design of the interview.</p><p>The interview method incorporated prompt cards for expressions, pictorial representations
of activities and visual analogue scales to represent degrees of emotion or
opinion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269215512450042">6</xref></sup> These
communication ramps could be used in different ways depending on the individual&#x02019;s degree
and kind of communication difficulty. They could be ignored, or used simply as an
aide-memoire to remain focused on the topic of discussion. They might replace specific
words/expressions that the participant was unable to articulate, or pointing to them
combined with gesture might be used to convey meaning. What was important was that the
form of the interview and the means of the interview were maximally flexible to encourage
participation from people with different communication needs and strengths. The ACT NoW
research user group, made up of people with aphasia and/or dysarthria, also supplied the
interviewer with training through means of role play and feedback on mock interviews in
which they both participated and critically observed.</p><p>The interview schedule was divided into three sections: (1) questions that invited a
discussion of what had taken place during their contact with the speech and language
therapist or visitor (description); (2) questions that encouraged participants to explore
what they thought about the contact with speech and language therapist or visitor
(appraisal); (3) and questions that invited participants to judge the impact of their
experience on themselves or others (evaluation). All interviews were video recorded to
capture verbal and non-verbal expression.</p></sec><sec id="section11-0269215512450042"><title>Analysis</title><p>The data varied in style of expression, degree of elaboration and intelligibility. The
vast majority were amenable to conventional forms of transcription. In two of interviews
there was either so little spoken language expression and/or non-verbal communication that
the intended meaning was uncertain. In a further three there were some instances of
ambiguous content. We developed a data transformation protocol to manage data where
conventional transcription was not possible. It was guided by three principles: (a) a
respect for participants&#x02019; efforts to ensure that their opinions were recorded, by whatever
media of communication they could use; (b) a concern not to over-interpret data where the
meaning was not clear; (c) to develop a process that had the potential to address the
three levels of meaning sought in the data collection: description, appraisal and
evaluation.</p><p>The data transformation involved the re-presentation of data in a prose form amenable to
conventional data processing. There were four stages, involving authors TG and AY.</p><p>All data were watched and conventional verbatim transcription applied where there was
clarity &#x02013; this included the marking in written form of any gestural communication where
meaning was straightforward.</p><p>All data were re-watched and where there were gaps in the verbatim text transcription the
researcher added notes using the QSR NVivo tool &#x02018;data-bites&#x02019;. These notes addressed the
possible meaning of the data and degree of certainty of interpretation.</p><p>Where the researcher was less confident about the interpretations, an experienced speech
and language therapist watched the relevant sections of video and independently
interpreted the meaning. If there was disagreement, the speech and language therapist and
researcher discussed their interpretations until a collaborative meaning was reached.
Where agreement was still not possible, the data section was not used.</p><p>A new document was created in NVivo consisting of a prose summary made up of content
statements derived from the data-bite notes. A link was then created between the
re-presentation and the original transcript to insert the prose in the appropriate section
of the original interview.</p><p>We used a thematic analysis approach because we were primarily concerned with
understanding the content of what participants said and drawing out conceptual frameworks
based on their perceptions and experiences, rather than analysing how they expressed
themselves and the narratives they might form.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269215512450042">17</xref></sup> An open coding approach influenced by
the research aims generated 40 initial codes. Consensus was sought on overlapping or
redundant codes resulting in an agreed final list of nine. The analysis derived from each
thematic category was written out separately, before considering their inter-relations and
reaching an overarching interpretation consisting of six topics, reported below.</p><p>These topics do not map onto the three research aims in a linear way. They are guided by
the participants&#x02019; emphases not by the structure of the questions asked. The topics are
representative of the most significant issues from participants&#x02019; perspectives which
emerged from the exploratory interviews. In the direct quotations used, we changed some of
the examples participants gave as they revealed specific interests that might make the
participant identifiable.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="section12-0269215512450042"><title>Results</title><sec id="section13-0269215512450042"><title>Mood</title><p>Participants identified the positive effect on their mood of their speech and language
therapy or visitor experiences as a key marker of effectiveness. This positive impact
could occur either as a result of contact with someone who was friendly and supportive
serving to lift them out of a low mood, or because such contact could distract them from
the difficulties of living with the consequences of stroke:<disp-quote><p>If you&#x02019;ve had a stroke, which is a dreadful thing to have, it&#x02019;s on your mind the
whole time and I thought well, at least I&#x02019;m doing that, I&#x02019;m starting to have these
conversations. Which I did . . . it stopped me thinking, it put me in someone else&#x02019;s
spot for an hour, didn&#x02019;t it? I stopped thinking about number one and started thinking
about somebody else . . . It&#x02019;s very easy to get involved in your own little thing
isn&#x02019;t it? . . . he [the visitor] would tell me different things. Yeah, I think it was
good. (Visitor contact)</p></disp-quote></p><p>The professional identity or role of the individual speech and language therapist or
visitor was of far less importance than their personal qualities in generating such
positive effects. Participants identified five helpful characteristics for positive
interactions during contact:</p><list list-type="bullet" id="list2-0269215512450042"><list-item><p>the ability to put someone at ease;</p></list-item><list-item><p>the ability to make an individual feel important;</p></list-item><list-item><p>the visitor/speech and language therapist displaying a positive mood themselves;</p></list-item><list-item><p>being empathic;</p></list-item><list-item><p>being a good communicator.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec id="section14-0269215512450042"><title>Confidence</title><p>Both speech and language therapy and visitor experiences were viewed by participants as
helping to enhance personal confidence but differences in the process of care were
observed. Those with visitor experience described enhanced confidence in terms of the
normalizing effects of regular contact with a stranger. Visits meant they had to engage in
social interaction and face their concerns about communicating with someone who did not
know them well. They had to practise everyday tasks like getting up to answer the door,
making a cup of tea and show they could cope beyond their immediate family. Those with
speech and language therapy experience tended to view improvements in confidence as direct
consequences of specific tasks and newly acquired strategies, rather than indirect
benefits of social encounters.</p><p>
<disp-quote><p>Very um . . . helpful she&#x02019;d [the therapist] point out where you were going wrong and,
and finding you . . . how to get it right . . . just build your confidence up so
where, where you think &#x02018;oh, I can&#x02019;t do that word,&#x02019; just, just try a different way or .
. . work out what you could say instead, take out words you couldn&#x02019;t say y&#x02019;know so
y&#x02019;know like when they say, oh, I use three words instead of one it&#x02019;s because you can&#x02019;t
do the one (laughs) so use three, it&#x02019;s easier. (Speech and language therapy)</p></disp-quote>
</p></sec><sec id="section15-0269215512450042"><title>Recognising progress</title><p>Participants strongly emphasized the importance of being able to recognize their own
progress. The extent of improvement was often of less importance than the sense of moving
forward.</p><p>
<disp-quote><p>He&#x02019;s [the visitor] done a good job, I was talking to everybody and I don&#x02019;t know,
maybe I&#x02019;m going back, but everybody says, me sister says &#x02018;you can talk a lot better, I
can understand you now. (Visitor contact)</p><p>It doesn&#x02019;t seem that much but it is a big thing doing things like that for you and
one of the girls on the . . . me, meat thing [in the supermarket], she were good
&#x02018;cause I just had to point to what I wanted, but I saw her last week, she said &#x02018;ooh,
yes, we know what you can say now can&#x02019;t you?&#x02019; Y&#x02019;know. (Speech and language
therapy)</p></disp-quote>
</p><p>There was a difference in how speech and language therapy or visitor contact was seen as
contributing to the observation of progress. Those with therapy experience described how
the therapist might deliberately point out their areas of weakness or skills they needed
to develop/re-learn in a targeted way. Before and after measures of how well they were
doing were also built in.</p><p>For those with visitor experience, the emphasis was on self-perceived differences. Having
to communicate socially with the same person over time was seen as a good basis for
self-judgements of improvement. For some people, the fact that the conversation partner
was not someone who knew them well was important because they had to make additional
efforts to understand and be understood. For some participants who lived alone or had very
limited contact with family and friends, an assured social encounter was a prerequisite
for testing out whether they were getting better. Without it they might not talk regularly
with anyone.</p><p>For many participants there was an acknowledgement of spontaneous improvement (e.g. in
speech or mobility). Consequently, the extent to which the visitor or speech and language
therapist contact was seen to be a contributory factor also varied. Nonetheless, the sense
of being able to recognize one&#x02019;s own progress was of overriding importance.</p></sec><sec id="section16-0269215512450042"><title>Guidance and support</title><p>Participants gave very different descriptions of the kind of guidance and support they
had received from speech and language therapists or visitors. Visitors were trained not to
engage in deliberate strategies of therapeutic activity. The fact that participants did
not perceive them to be doing so is important for evidencing the fidelity of the attention
control within the trial design. By contrast, participants strongly perceived the
purposefulness and structure of speech and language therapy, referring to &#x02018;building
blocks&#x02019;, &#x02018;strategies&#x02019; and &#x02018;deliberate learning&#x02019; that was not evident in the data from
those with visitor experience. However, unique to descriptions of the visitor experience
was the value participants placed on being able to give to the visitor, usually in
relation to knowledge and know how. The reciprocity was regarded as therapeutic.</p><p>
<disp-quote><p>I gave her [the visitor] the name of one or two greenfly sprays that I found useful.
Now it could well have been that she knew all that, but she accepted it in the sense
that it was new to her, so it made me feel as though I was achieving something
imparting information. (Visitor contact)</p></disp-quote>
</p></sec><sec id="section17-0269215512450042"><title>Meeting individual needs</title><p>Participants highly valued speech and language therapists or visitors who could make
their interaction seem specifically relevant to the individual. The most effective
examples of encounters were ones that felt tailored to who the participants were, not just
what their clinical problem might be.</p><p>
<disp-quote><p>I&#x02019;m . . . football fanatic so most of the things she [the therapist] got me to read
and do was over football and that&#x02019;s where . . . the letter &#x02018;M&#x02019; came into it. I found I
struggled saying [inaudible] . . . [Manchester] United, she did football teams to make
it interesting for me. She&#x02019;d pick my interests out and put it into a way of teaching
me that I enjoyed. I think that&#x02019;s why I enjoyed the speech therapy so much. (Speech
and language therapy)</p></disp-quote>
</p><p>On the rare occasion when a participant expressed dissatisfaction with the contact they
had received, failure to recognize individual need or to contextualize the response to the
individual&#x02019;s circumstances, were usually components of the problem.</p></sec><sec id="section18-0269215512450042"><title>Amount and intensity</title><p>Participants valued a high amount of contact, whether with speech and language therapists
or visitors. High amount of contact was defined by frequency, number and length of visits
and/or amount of time spent with them. Furthermore, the amount of support was perceived to
be closely connected with the benefit. More contact felt like more benefit in quite a
straightforward equation for the majority of participants. Some participants also
discussed the importance of frequency of contact being tempered with sensitivity to
meeting the particular needs which participants were experiencing at any given time. Part
of this sensitivity was about flexibility and awareness of how easy it might be to feel
overloaded which could undermine the benefits of a large amount of contact. This was true
both among those who had speech and language therapy and those who had a visitor. No
concerns were expressed that the large amount of contact had come too early in their
recovery process.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="section19-0269215512450042"><title>Discussion</title><p>The qualitative study nested within the randomized controlled trial was designed: (1) to
generate data in its own right on participants&#x02019; experiences; (2) to be integrated with the
results of the main trial in order to understand better some of the mechanisms underlying
the main trial&#x02019;s results; (3) to contribute to implications for policy and practice that
might be drawn from the main trial&#x02019;s results.</p><p>The principal result of the main trial was: &#x02018;that people with aphasia or dysarthria who
receive an early, well-resourced but individually tailored best practice Speech and Language
Therapy communication intervention demonstrate similar levels of functional communication
ability at six months to those who receive visiting from a non-therapist employed to provide
an attention control consisting largely of informal conversation but no specific
communication training&#x02019;.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269215512450042">4</xref></sup></p><p>The qualitative study also found that no major differences in impact or effectiveness were
perceived depending on whether participants had a speech and language therapist or a
visitor. However, in addition it identified that there were factors common to both
experimental conditions which participants perceived as important based on their experience
of one or the other. Namely, that the person with whom they had contact, whether a visitor
or speech and language therapist, was valued for being an empathic, good communicator who
could put them at their ease, engage with them in an individualized manner which made them
feel important, lifted their mood and contributed to their self-perceived sense of progress
and confidence.</p><p>It was not that participants were blind to the identity or role of the person with whom
they had contact within the trial. Nor that the differences in the activities of visitor or
speech and language therapist could not be discerned. It was that both sets of people,
speech and language therapists and visitors, were valued for similar qualities and effects
arising from shared positive factors common to both experimental conditions. Neither the
findings from the main randomized controlled trial nor the qualitative study imply that
regular contact with any non-professional can have beneficial effects for someone with
aphasia or dysarthria in the early weeks following a stroke. The qualitative study points to
specific conditions that would have to be met for that contact to have a positive
effect.</p><p>The qualitative study was able to identify differences in the experiences of participants
about the processes of speech and language therapy and visitor contact. Speech and language
therapy was regarded as purposeful and its effects explicitly measurable. Contact with a
visitor was regarded as something from which indirect benefits were discernible and measures
of progress largely self-reflective. This is important in reinforcing the fidelity of the
attention control within the overall randomized controlled trial design as well as
demonstrating that the skills techniques and expertise of speech and language therapists are
evident to the lay participant. Participants did not perceive the speech and language
therapists and visitors to be doing more or less the same thing.</p><p>The findings from the qualitative study demonstrate that early, regular and sustained
contact with an individual outside of the participants&#x02019; immediate family/friends was
strongly perceived to be of benefit. The amount and intensity of contact, whether from a
speech and language therapist or a visitor, was strongly liked and equated by participants
with greater perceived effectiveness provided that due attention is paid to the possibility
of an individual feeling overloaded.</p><p>It is worth remembering that the randomized controlled trial in which this qualitative
study was nested recruited people in the acute stage of stroke and offered up to four months
of intervention. Therefore, early, well-resourced intervention (average 20 contacts) had
high user acceptability as long as it was flexible to individual needs. This finding is an
important contribution to how the implications of the randomized controlled trial results
are interpreted for future policy and practice in stroke rehabilitation. Seen from this
study&#x02019;s participants&#x02019; perspective, &#x02018;early and lots of it&#x02019; is a stronger message than any
residual concerns about whether that contact should be provided by a speech and language
therapist or visitor.</p><sec id="section20-0269215512450042"><title>Strengths and weaknesses of the study</title><p>The main weakness of this study is the small numbers available to participate which
precluded a purposive approach to sampling. The strongly positive data about early and
sustained contact might be biased by nature of the sample. It is unknown whether those who
chose not to participate had more negative views and therefore were less inclined to make
the further commitment to be interviewed. Also, participants were only interviewed once
which meant that it was not possible to trace how initial reflections on their experience
might change with time as recovery and/or enduring disability becomes apparent. Although
care was taken to ensure that the qualitative analysis was undertaken independent of and
prior to the analysis of the randomized controlled trial, influences between the two parts
of the study will inevitably have occurred within a common ACT NoW team. The study is also
limited by the fact that only service users were interviewed. There is no parallel
qualitative data from the speech and language therapists or visitors involved.</p><p>The main strength of this study is that the qualitative component of ACT NoW focused on
the main trial experience, rather than being an element of pre-trial design. It is
therefore possible to integrate its findings with those of the randomized controlled
trial. It is also a strength that the qualitative study succeeded in engaging a wide
diversity of participants, including those with the most severe communication impairments
and collecting data at a very early stage in stroke patients&#x02019; experience. A diagnosis of
aphasia is a common exclusion criterion from many rehabilitation trials and other research
designs. Our results show that this exclusion is unjustifiable. It marginalizes people
with communication problems and produces evidence that is unrepresentative of the clinical
populations we seek to serve.</p><boxed-text id="boxed-text1-0269215512450042" position="float"><caption><title>Clinical messages</title></caption><p>For someone with aphasia or dysarthria in the early weeks following a stroke,
