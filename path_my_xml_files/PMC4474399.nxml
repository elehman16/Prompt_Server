In this randomized, multicenter, open-label Phase IIb study, sunitinib plus mFOLFOX6 (oxaliplatin plus leucovorin plus 5-fluorouracil) was compared with bevacizumab plus mFOLFOX6 as first-line therapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Patients were stratified by performance status, baseline lactate dehydrogenase level, and prior adjuvant treatment, and randomized 1:1 to receive sunitinib 37.5 mg/day for 4 weeks on and 2 weeks off plus mFOLFOX6 every 2 weeks or bevacizumab 5 mg/kg every 2 weeks plus mFOLFOX6 every 2 weeks. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival. Secondary endpoints included objective response rate, overall survival, safety, and quality of life.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Enrollment was closed early following accrual of 191 patients, based on an interim analysis showing an inferior trend in the primary progression-free survival efficacy endpoint for sunitinib. Ninety-six patients were randomized to sunitinib plus mFOLFOX6 and 95 to bevacizumab plus mFOLFOX6. Median progression-free survival was 9.3 months and 15.4 months, respectively, but the objective response rate was similar between the study arms. Median overall survival was 23.7 months and 34.1 months, respectively. Dose reductions and interruptions were more common with sunitinib. Hematologic toxicity was more common in the sunitinib arm.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>While the results of the sunitinib arm are comparable with those of previously reported FOLFOX combinations, the sunitinib-based combination was associated with more toxicity than that observed with bevacizumab and mFOLFOX6. The bevacizumab arm had an unexpectedly good outcome, and was much better than that seen in the Phase III trials. Combination therapy with sunitinib plus mFOLFOX6 is not recommended for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>antiangiogenesis</kwd><kwd>bevacizumab</kwd><kwd>combination therapy</kwd><kwd>metastatic colorectal cancer</kwd><kwd>oxaliplatin</kwd><kwd>sunitinib</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Inhibition of angiogenic pathways has improved outcomes in a number of common malignancies.

In a Phase II study of single-agent sunitinib in 84 patients with chemorefractory mCRC, one partial response was observed in a patient previously treated with bevacizumab, and stable disease for &#x02265;6 months was reported in two patients previously treated with bevacizumab and eleven patients who were bevacizumab-na&#x000ef;ve.<xref rid="b7-cmar-7-165" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>A Phase I dose-escalation study evaluating sunitinib for the first-line treatment of mCRC showed that the maximum tolerated dose was 37.5 mg/day on schedule 4/2 (4 weeks on, 2 weeks off) when used in combination with standard doses of irinotecan, leucovorin, and 5-fluorouracil.

Prior to starting new cycles of treatment, hematologic parameters had to have recovered to grade &#x02264;1. Treatment was continued until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Dose reductions or delays of sunitinib, bevacizumab, or mFOLFOX6 components were permitted to manage treatment-related toxicities. Sunitinib doses could be increased to 50 mg/day or reduced to 25 mg/day or 12.5 mg/day based on tolerability. Crossover between treatment arms was not permitted. Patients remained on study until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. However, they were allowed to continue the treatment they had been randomized to if the investigator judged that there was evidence of clinical benefit. Patients who discontinued oxaliplatin due to oxaliplatin-related toxicity continued therapy with 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin plus sunitinib or bevacizumab. Those who discontinued treatment with all chemotherapy prior to disease progression continued treatment with sunitinib or bevacizumab as assigned at randomization (those receiving sunitinib were permitted to escalate the dose to 50 mg daily on schedule 4/2 at the investigator&#x02019;s discretion). Patients who discontinued all treatment prior to disease progression were followed for disease progression until initiation of a subsequent anticancer therapy in the absence of documented disease progression or until death, whichever occurred first. Patients were followed for at least 28 days after the last dose of study drug for adverse events, and were followed for overall survival until the study was terminated in May 2011.</p></sec><sec sec-type="intro|methods"><title>Study objectives</title><p>The primary objective was to compare the efficacy of sunitinib and mFOLFOX6 with bevacizumab and mFOLFOX6 in terms of progression-free survival.

Efficacy evaluation was based on investigator&#x02019;s assessment using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.0 criteria.

The FACT&#x00026;GOG-Ntx is a treatment-specific subscale for neurotoxicity related to systemic chemotherapy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The sample size for the primary efficacy endpoint of progression-free survival was determined based on the assumptions that the median progression-free survival for patients receiving bevacizumab plus mFOLFOX6 as first-line treatment was 10 months and that a 40% improvement in median progression-free survival (14 months) in the sunitinib arm was clinically significant. A total of 234 progression-free survival events were required for a one-sided stratified log-rank test with a significance level of 0.05 and power of 80% to detect a statistically significant difference between treatment arms. Assuming accrual was accomplished over a 12-month period and follow-up was continued for at least 24 months after the last patient was enrolled, a total sample size of approximately 290 patients (145 patients per treatment arm) was required. This sample size also allowed for assessment of differences in the secondary endpoint of overall survival. With an expected median overall survival of 20 months in the comparator arm, a total of 223 deaths were required to observe a difference in median overall survival from 20 months (bevacizumab arm) to 28 months (sunitinib arm) using a one-sided, stratified log-rank test with an overall significance level of 0.05 and power of 80%. The planned follow-up duration for overall survival was 47 months.</p><p>Analyses were performed for all patients who were enrolled into the study (efficacy analyses) and who received at least one dose of study medication (safety analyses). Descriptive statistics were used to summarize patient characteristics, safety, and patient-reported outcomes. Kaplan&#x02013;Meier methods were used to estimate median progression-free survival and overall survival, and stratified log-rank tests (one-sided, &#x003b1;=0.05) were used to detect statistically significant differences between the two treatment arms with 80% power. Progression-free survival was derived based on tumor assessments by the investigators. Patients were stratified by ECOG performance status (0 versus 1), prior adjuvant therapy (yes versus no), and baseline lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels (high, defined as &#x0003e;1.5&#x000d7; the upper limit of normal versus low, defined as &#x02264;1.5&#x000d7; the upper limit of normal).

More patients had dose reductions in the sunitinib arm than in the bevacizumab arm (41.7% versus 14.0%, respectively). Likewise, more patients had dose interruptions in the sunitinib arm than in the bevacizumab arm (45.8% versus 7.5%, respectively).

The most common serious adverse events (occurring in at least three patients) not related to disease progression were febrile neutropenia, intestinal obstruction, and dehydration in the sunitinib arm, and deep vein thrombosis, which was only reported in the bevacizumab arm. Among the reported serious adverse events, eight patients (4.2%) died during treatment or within 28 days of the last dose of study drug; these included five deaths (5.2%) in the sunitinib arm (two due to progressive disease, one due to aspiration, one due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction, and one due to pulmonary hypertension) and three (3.2%) in the bevacizumab arm (all attributed to progressive disease).</p><p>Most adverse events and hematologic abnormalities were manageable with dose modifications or delays. The most common adverse events related to mFOLFOX6 plus either sunitinib or bevacizumab that caused dose modification were neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, and the most common adverse event related to sunitinib or bevacizumab that caused dose modification was diarrhea in both arms (but to a greater extent in the sunitinib arm). The most common adverse event related to mFOLFOX6 that caused dose modification was peripheral neuropathy (to a greater extent in the bevacizumab arm).</p><p>Forty patients (41.7%) in the sunitinib arm and 39 patients (41.9%) in the bevacizumab arm discontinued treatment during the study as a result of adverse events.

Mean baseline FACT-C scores were similar in both groups. No clinically meaningful or statistically significant differences were observed between treatments in either the FACT-C subscales or the FACT&#x00026;GOG/Ntx neurotoxicity subscale from baseline to cycle 4 day 1. Functional well-being subscale scores worsened in the sunitinib group (mean &#x02212;0.78 points) but improved in the bevacizumab group (mean 1.56 points). The mean difference between treatments was &#x02212;2.34 points (95% CI &#x02212;3.98 to &#x02212;0.70; <italic>P</italic>=0.006).

Overall toxicity, and hematologic toxicity in particular, was greater in the sunitinib arm. This is not surprising, as oxaliplatin-containing regimens such as mFOLFOX6 have long been known to cause neutropenia and thrombocytopenia,<xref rid="b17-cmar-7-165" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b19-cmar-7-165" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> and have been reported with the use of sunitinib as a single agent.<xref rid="b20-cmar-7-165" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> The combination of sunitinib with cytotoxic chemotherapy appears to produce an even greater incidence of cytopenias.<xref rid="b8-cmar-7-165" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b21-cmar-7-165" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="b22-cmar-7-165" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></p><p>Although overall response rates were equivalent, progression-free survival (as confirmed by independent third party review) and overall survival were much longer in the bevacizumab-containing arm. One possible explanation is that the higher incidence of some adverse events in the sunitinib arm required more dose reductions, dose interruptions, and cycle delays, leading to a shorter overall median duration of treatment in the sunitinib arm. The shorter progression-free survival and overall survival observed in the sunitinib arm do not seem to be obviously related to toxicity, as the number of patients who discontinued due to toxicity was relatively low. Furthermore, the progression-free survival of 9.3 months and overall survival of 23.7 months in the sunitinib arm are comparable with those seen in other studies with similar regimens.<xref rid="b3-cmar-7-165" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b14-cmar-7-165" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> However, the progression-free survival of 15.4 months and overall survival of 34.1 months in the bevacizumab arm were much better than that reported previously with other bevacizumab-containing regimens in the first-line treatment of mCRC, including bevacizumab combined with capecitabine plus oxaliplatin (XELOX),<xref rid="b3-cmar-7-165" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> or with oxaliplatin and/or irinotecan-based chemotherapies (FOLFOX4, FOLFIRI, FOLFOXIRI).<xref rid="b3-cmar-7-165" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b23-cmar-7-165" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Based on previous trials, the median progression-free survival was expected to be approximately 10 months, and this estimate was used for the sample size calculation in this study. It is possible that this was an exceptional group of patients and that sunitinib caused them to do worse than they would have done otherwise, but the measured baseline characteristics of the patients in the study were well balanced and did not differ significantly from those reported for larger trials in this indication. Other possible explanations are a deleterious impact of combined treatment with sunitinib and mFOLFOX6 or a negative interaction between sunitinib and chemotherapy. Indeed, in terms of tolerability, the schedule selected may have been suboptimal. The dose of sunitinib was selected based on the maximum tolerated dose in a Phase I study in combination with FOLFIRI.<xref rid="b8-cmar-7-165" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> However, at that time there were no data to support using this dose with FOLFOX regimens, which have more overlapping toxicities with sunitinib (eg, thrombocytopenia). Yoshino et al recently reported that sunitinib plus mFOLFOX6 had acceptable tolerability in treatment-na&#x000ef;ve colorectal cancer, but that a 2-week on/2-week off schedule (schedule 2/2) was generally more manageable than schedule 4/2.<xref rid="b24-cmar-7-165" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> In a recent study of patients with advanced solid malignancies, including mCRC, the combination of sunitinib with mFOLFOX6 had acceptable tolerability. The most common adverse events were neutropenia, fatigue, and thrombocytopenia. The maximum tolerated doses were 50 mg/day on schedule 2/2 and 25 mg/day on a continuous daily dosing schedule. Schedule 4/2 was evaluated but the maximum tolerated dose was not established.<xref rid="b21-cmar-7-165" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></p><p>A small molecule VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, regorafenib, was recently shown to improve progression-free survival and overall survival compared with best supportive care as a single agent in the salvage setting;<xref rid="b25-cmar-7-165" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> however, it has been difficult to show significant improvement in outcome by adding drugs of this class to standard cytotoxic therapy. Another VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, vatalanib, did not improve progression-free survival or overall survival when added to FOLFOX4 in the first-line or second-line setting.<xref rid="b14-cmar-7-165" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="b15-cmar-7-165" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Recently, the results of the HORIZON II and III trials showed that adding the VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, cediranib, to an oxaliplatin-containing regimen produced a modest benefit in progression-free survival but no improvement in overall survival,<xref rid="b26-cmar-7-165" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> and no benefit compared with adding bevacizumab.<xref rid="b27-cmar-7-165" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> A large randomized trial of adding sunitinib 37.5 mg/day on schedule 4/2 to FOLFIRI in first-line therapy was also negative, with no significant effect on progression-free survival but greater toxicity, more deaths as a result of toxicity, and significantly more dose delays, dose reductions, and treatment discontinuations in the sunitinib arm.<xref rid="b28-cmar-7-165" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Bevacizumab, on the other hand, has been shown to improve both progression-free survival and overall survival in combination with older regimens when compared with chemotherapy alone.<xref rid="b1-cmar-7-165" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b3-cmar-7-165" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p>While inhibiting the same pathway, small molecule VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors and bevacizumab differ from each other in their targets, pharmacokinetics, and toxicity profiles.<xref rid="b29-cmar-7-165" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> The development of robust predictive markers may help explain these differences. In conclusion, the combination of sunitinib with mFOLFOX6 was more toxic and less effective than bevacizumab and the same chemotherapy.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We would like to thank all of the participating patients and their families, as well as the global network of investigators, research nurses, study coordinators, and operations staff who contributed to this study.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>JRH, EPM, MW, and AK have no conflicts of interest to declare.
