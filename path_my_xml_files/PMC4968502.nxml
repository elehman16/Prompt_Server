assigned to an experimental or control group (n=15 each). Participants in both groups
performed balance training in a seated position on a gym ball for 20 minutes per session,
five sessions per week, for 4 weeks. Members of the experimental group also performed
mental practice for 10 minutes before the balance training. After the intervention,
balance measuring equipment (Good Balance, Metitur, Finland) was used to quantitatively
measure balance ability. [Results] Significant post-training gains were observed in the

basal plane, while postural balance is the ability to continuously maintain equilibrium
within the basal plane according to one&#x02019;s center of mass (COM) and maintain postural control
to cope with diverse motions and external swaying<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Balance abilities are complicated functions derived from
integration of the nervous and musculoskeletal systems that involve diverse functional
factors such as integration of the stimuli emanating from the visual, hearing, and
vestibular organs; proprioceptors and sensory receptors in the central nervous system;
visual spatial cognitive ability; muscle tone that responds to environmental changes both
quickly and accurately; muscular endurance; and joint flexibility<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Mental practice, which is frequently used to improve balance ability, was recently
presented in diverse areas for the purpose of mastering motor skills and improving motor
learning<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Mental practice is a motor
learning method that imparts and improves motor skills and involves imagining movement
scenes without making any body movements. Gerardin et al.<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that imagining movement scenes and performing exercises
identically activated the frontal lobe. Although diverse studies on mental practice have
been conducted to date, most addressed improving the upper limb functions of stroke
patients, while few have examined mental practice as an approach to improving balance
ability. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to examine the effects of mental
practice on the balance abilities of normal individuals.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Thirty subjects were randomly assigned to an experimental or control group (n=15 each). The
selection criteria utilized were as follows: no history of orthopedic surgery on a lower
limb, never taken any drug due to a neurologic problem, and no musculoskeletal system
disease. The general characteristics of the study subjects are summarized in <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>General characteristics of the study subjects (n=30)</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Characteristic</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">EG (n=15)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CG (n=15)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (years)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">21.8 (2.0)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">22.6 (1.3)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Height (cm)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">166.5 (5.4)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">169.7 (3.3)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weight (kg)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">60.2 (8.1)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">62.2 (6.5)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>EG: experimental group; CG: control group.

study, and all subjects provided informed written consent prior to participating.</p><p>Participants in both groups performed balance training in a seated position on a gym ball
for 20 minutes per session, five sessions per week, for 4 weeks. Participants in the
experimental group also completed a mental practice regimen for 10 minutes before each
balance training session.</p><p>The gym ball exercises included maintaining proper posture in a seated position on a gym
ball, laterally moving one&#x02019;s body weight, and moving one&#x02019;s body weight back and forth. For
the mental practice sessions, the subjects were allowed to maintain a comfortable seated
position on a chair and the laboratory environment was kept dark and as quite as possible.
The subjects listened to a voice file describing the imaginary act of maintaining balance in
a seated position on a gym ball. During the warm-up stage, muscle relaxing training was
implemented for 2 minutes to ensure psychological stability. In the recordings, the
first-person viewpoint was used as described by the classification methods presented by
Mahoney and Avener<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. During the mental
practice exercises, each subject was allowed to maximally feel the sole pressure and
proprioceptive sensory information from the ankles, knees, and hip joints when carrying out
the weight shift training; the mental practice was performed for 6 minutes. The cooling down
stage was used to direct the subject back to reality and become psychologically stabilized.
This stage lasted 2 minutes.</p><p>After the intervention, balance measuring equipment (Good Balance, Metitur, Finland) was
used to quantitatively measure each subject&#x02019;s balance ability. To measure balance function,
the subject was instructed to stand on a triangle platform and maintain a symmetrical
posture with the feet shoulder width apart. A visual fixed point was located in front of the
subject to minimize head movements. The subject&#x02019;s arms were placed comfortably at the hip
joints and the center of pressure (COP) was measured for 30 seconds in the standing posture
with the eyes open. COP was measured three times and average values were calculated.</p><p>The data analysis was performed using SPSS version 20.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
Means and standard deviations were calculated for all variables. Before the intervention,
group differences in general characteristics were compared using the independent t-tests and
&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> tests. Intragroup comparisons of variables before and after training were
conducted using paired sample t-tests. Intergroup comparisons of pre- and post-test
differences in variables were performed using the independent t-test. Intergroup effect
sizes were calculated using the Cohen d coefficient<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>, where an effect size &#x0003c;0.2 reflected a negligible mean
difference; 0.2&#x02212;0.5, a small difference; 0.5&#x02212;0.8, a moderate difference; and &#x0003e;0.8, a
large difference. The statistical analysis was performed at the 95% confidence level, and p
values &#x0003c;0.05 were considered significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p><xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> provides a summary of the subjects&#x02019;

gross motor activity&#x0201d;<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Mental practice
enhances motor skills by facilitating the imagining of proprioceptive senses such as visual,
auditory, tactile, motor, olfactory, and taste without any external stimuli.</p><p>Theories that explain the mechanism of mental practice include Paivio&#x02019;s theory<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>, the psychoneuromuscular theory<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>, and the cognitive&#x02013;symbolio learning
theory<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Paivio&#x02019;s theory proposes that visually imagining the carrying out of movements promotes
cognitive function and motivation<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>,
whereas the psychoneuromuscular theory purports that practicing tasks to be performed in
advance using imagination reinforces the neurological pathways necessary to conduct the
required movements, thus enhancing one&#x02019;s ability to perform the movements<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. On the other hand, the cognitive&#x02013;symbolio
learning theory proposes that imagining movements provides opportunities to practice their
order and enables advanced planning, thus improving efficiency when the movements are
actually carried out<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Weiss et al.<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that excitation
was observed in the same brain regions during mental practice and physical training,
especially the supplementary motor area of the brain during mental practice.</p><p>Based on the results of previous studies, it can be said that the neuromuscular responses
that appear when movement performance is imagined are similar to those observed when the
movements are actually performed. Therefore, imagining the movements that are used to carry
out a task reinforces the neurological pathways required to actually perform the movements,
thereby improving one&#x02019;s ability to perform them. The results of the present study suggest
that balance ability is improved in accordance with the psychoneuromuscular theory.</p><p>The limitations of the present study are that it was difficult to evaluate whether the
imagining practice learning level was appropriate and the intervention period was too short
to generalize the results. In addition, subjects could not be controlled after the
experimental period and the number of subjects was small. Therefore, in future studies, if
the experimental intervention period is extended and environmental factors are more
thoroughly addressed, positive generalizable results might be obtained. In addition, if
visual and perceptive sources of stimuli were applied with the auditory stimulus, the
effects of the mental practice exercise might be further enhanced.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Suzuki</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Fujisawa</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Machida</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Relationship between the berg balance scale and static
