muscle function. [Subjects] We used the right legs of 40 healthy male students. [Methods]
Subjects were divided into an AID group, which performed stretching, and a control group,
which did not. We examined and compared muscle function before and after stretching in the
AID and control groups using a goniometer and Cybex equipment. [Results] A significant
increase in flexibility and a significant decrease in muscle strength output were observed
in the AID group after the intervention. [Conclusion] These results suggest that AID
induces an increase in flexibility and a temporary decrease in muscle output strength.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Active individual muscle stretching</kwd><kwd>Muscle function</kwd><kwd>Flexibility</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Stretching was introduced in a sports coaching program on TV at the beginning of the 1980s
in Japan, which led to the publication of many stretching-associated books for the general
public and a so-called stretching boom<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Based on previous studies, the common aims of stretching are to improve joint range of
motion (flexibility), decrease muscle tension<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>, improve circulation<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>, relieve muscle pain<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>, prevent injury, and improve athletic performance<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Stretching using the responses of the
nervous system such as proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation is currently attracting
attention in the field of sports. Stretching is also performed in combination with yoga or
Pilates, which attaches importance to postures and breathing techniques. Thus, various types
and purposes of stretching have been reported. However, a number of theories on the
association between stretching methods and their effects exist, and this issue is still
controversial.</p><p>Individual muscle stretching (ID stretching) developed by Suzuki et al.<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup> aims to increase muscle flexibility and
extensibility, and improve joint range of motion and dexterity associated with muscles. ID
stretching has been widely used in hospitals, clinics, and the field of sports, mainly by
physical therapists, since 1999. ID stretching is characterized<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup> by passive static stretching of individual muscles using Ib
inhibition, detailed anatomical and physiological knowledge, such as that of muscle
arrangements and responses to stimuli, and combination with isometric contraction, depending
on the degree of muscle tension required. Our previous study<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup> of ID stretching showed improvements in flexibility, a decrease in
muscle strength output, and psychologically positive changes, which were better than those
of conventional passive static stretching. However, in the conditioning field, it is
important that not only physical therapists and trainers perform ID stretching, but also
that patients and athletes control and perform this stretching by themselves.</p><p>Even if the extensibility and flexibility of soft tissues representative of the muscles
improve, they readily decrease due to posture, exercise, or stress<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, muscles treated by ID stretching to reduce
muscle tension or pain, should be continuously stretched by patients or athletes to maintain
soft tissue function<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Unlike passive ID
stretching, which is performed by therapists, active ID stretching (AID) was developed in
2007<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup> and is performed by patients and
athletes by themselves. AID has since been performed as a bedside or home exercise by
patients or athletes under the management of a physical therapist. However, to the best of
our knowledge, no studies have evaluated the effects of AID on muscle function. Therefore,
this study was performed to evaluate the effects of AID on muscle function, using a
goniometer (Medica) to determine range of motion, and an isokinetic dynamometer
(Cybex770-NORM, Medica).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>The subjects were 40 healthy male students (40 right lower limbs) with no previous
history of disease in their lower limbs. Their mean age was 20.8 &#x000b1; 1.6&#x02005;years, their mean
height was 171.8 &#x000b1; 5.4&#x02005;cm, and their mean body weight was 66.4 &#x000b1; 7.3&#x02005;kg.</p><p>This study was approved by the Research Ethical Committee of Fukuoka Hoken Gakuin, and
oral and written explanations about the contents and risks of this study were given to all
subjects prior to the study. All subjects signed the consent form after understanding the
study contents, and participated in this study.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Subjects were randomly and evenly allocated to 2 groups (20 subjects each) which
performed (AID group) or did not perform AID (control group).</p><p>The soleus was evaluated as an ankle plantar flexor muscle. Range of motion testing
(ROM-T) and measurement of isokinetic plantar flexor muscle strength were performed before
and after stretching. To evaluate flexibility, ROM-T was performed according to the
methods established by the Measurement Standards Committee of the Japanese Association of
Rehabilitation Medicine<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. The ankle
dorsiflexion range of motion was measured using a goniometer, perpendicularly from the
knee-flexed position to the fibula as the primary axis, and the 5th metatarsal bone as the
movement axis. Two physical therapists (clinical experience, 12.5 &#x000b1; 2.6&#x02005;years) other than
the authors were performed these measurements. One performed fixation, and the other
performed the measurement, and after exchanging roles, the measurement was taken again. An
isokinetic dynamometer (Cybex770-NORM) was used to measure isokinetic muscle strength
output. Based on the study of Yoshino et al.<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>, evaluations were performed at low (60 deg/sec), intermediate
(180 deg/sec), and high (300 deg/sec) angular velocities. A ankle dorsiflexion with
maximum effort was performed 3 consecutive times, and the mean peak torque achieved at
each angular velocity was calculated<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Measurements at one angular velocity were taken on 1 day. To avoid order effects,
measurements at the 3 angular velocities were randomly taken on different days.</p><p>To stretch the soleus in the AID group, the right forefoot was bilaterally held with both
hands, and the right ankle was dorsiflexed while the center of gravity was posteriorly
moved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig.1.</label><caption><p> Active individual muscle stretching of the soleus</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jpts-26-341-g001"/></fig>). External force applied to the test limb during stretching was controlled at 5 kgf
using a hand-held dynamometer (FET-102, Medix Japan) which was used for the quantitative
evaluation of muscle strength<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. The stretching instructors were 2
physical therapists (clinical experience, 10.5 &#x000b1; 2.4&#x02005;years) other than the authors and the
physical therapists who performed ROM-T. One of the two physical therapists gave
instructions, and the other took the measurement. The control group did not perform
stretching, and measurements were taken after a resting time similar to the stretching
time of the AID group.</p><p>To induce exercise conditions before the evaluation, all subjects performed an ergometer
exercise (5&#x02005;min, 60&#x02005;W)<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Statistical analysis was performed as follows. Flexibility was analyzed using two-way
repeated measures analysis of variance with the group (2 levels: AID &#x000d7; control) and the
measurement value of the foot dorsiflexion range of motion (2 levels: before &#x000d7; after
stretching) as the two factors. Muscle strength output was analyzed using a 3-way analysis
of variance with the group (2 levels: AID &#x000d7; control), peak torque values of the two groups
(2 levels: before &#x000d7; after stretching), and the angular velocity (3 levels: 60 &#x000d7; 180 &#x000d7; 300
deg/sec) as the 3 factors. Fisher&#x02019;s PLSD was used for multiple comparison tests. p &#x0003c;
0.05 was regarded as significant in all analyses. SPSS 12.0.J for Windows was used as the
statistical software.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Both the group and ROM value had main effects on flexibility. A comparison between the two

isokinetic muscle strength output.</p><p>A significant improvement in flexibility after stretching was observed in the AID group,
but not in the control group. This finding together with those of previous studies indicates
the responses of the nervous system to stretching. Helda et al.<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that a prolonged stretch of muscle spindles
inhibited their afferent activity, which resulted in a decrease in muscle tension. Fowles et
al.<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that prolonged static
stretching induced responses in Golgi tendon organs and nociceptors, which inhibited muscle
tension. These responses of the nervous system can also be explained by a delay and decrease
in the integral value<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup> of the stretch reflex, and a decrease in muscle tension
may also have resulted in improvements in flexibility. We speculate that these responses by
the nervous system occurred in the body since, AID can also be classified as static
stretching, and results similar to those in previous studies were obtained. The reason why a
few improvement trends were seen in the control group was same position has range of motion
measurement and AID and thinks that a temporary stretching effect was given.</p><p>Muscle strength output after the intervention was lower in the AID group than in the
control group. This result together with those of previous studies suggests the involvement
of the physical properties of muscle tissue. Morse et al.<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup> reported a decrease in the elasticity of muscle connective tissue
(increased extensibility) as acute changes immediately after stretching. Cramer et al.<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup> demonstrated that the sarcomeres of muscle
fibers were stretched by stretching and Teramoto et al.<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that tendons were also stretched. These studies suggest
that muscle fibers are longer after stretching than before, due to the physical
characteristics of the muscle. Based on the muscle tension-length relationship, a certain
muscle length is necessary to exert maximum contraction tension<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>. Since muscle length was reported to be longer after
stretching than before, even at the same joint angle, due to sarcomere/tendon elongation,
muscle strength may decrease after stretching<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup>. This increase in muscle length may have caused decrease in muscle
strength output which was observed as an acute change immediately after stretching in the
present as well as previous studies.</p><p>An evaluation of isokinetic muscle strength output exerted at each angular velocity
revealed a decrease after the intervention only at an angular velocity of 60 deg/sec in the
AID group. Nelson et al.<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that
the effects of stretching were marked at 60 deg/sec because this low angular velocity
resembles the velocity of isometric exercise, and muscle contraction occurs at a lower
velocity. AID as well as ID stretching, in which an individual muscle is selected for
stretching, was more susceptible to Ib inhibition, which had inhibitory effects on muscle
tension. Muscle tension may have been associated with the decrease in muscle strength output
at the low angular velocity in the AID group.</p><p>The results of this study suggest that AID as self stretching, as well as passive static
stretching<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>, improves flexibility and decreases muscle strength output, showing
potential in the self-conditioning field. In this study, the expression &#x0201c;a decrease in
muscle strength output&#x0201d; was used; however, changes in muscle tension and the inhibitory
effects of muscle tension, which may be present in the background, were not evaluated.
Neurophysiological studies using electromyography<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,
<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><sup>)</sup> should be performed in the future to
more thoroughly evaluate the inhibitory effects of muscle tension. In addition, an
evaluation that assesses performance using basic and sport actions<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup> is required, because many muscles are involved in actual
joint exercise. An evaluation of the duration of effects<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup> of home exercise utilizing AID is also needed.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><person-group><name><surname>Inoue</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Koyanagi</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Nakae</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: Athlete Care Manua.
