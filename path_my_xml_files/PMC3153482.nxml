The study was carried-out in the Outpatient Hypertension Clinic of the Cardiology Division of the Hospital de Cl&#x000ed;nicas de Porto Alegre (Porto Alegre, RS Brazil). Patients had uncontrolled blood pressure. The factors studied &#x02013; cognition, memory, anxiety and psychiatric disorders &#x02013; were analyzed using specific instruments. Performance in the Mini-Mental was the main exposure variable, since it assesses the overall cognitive function. The outcome &#x0201c;adherence to treatment&#x0201d; was determined by the presence of plasma levels of hydrochlorothiazide (qualitative analysis), prescribed for all patients, using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC Shimadzu&#x000ae;) coupled to the Micromass&#x000ae; mass spectrometer. Blood sampling was collected in the last consultation.</p><p>Fifty-six adult patients over 18 years of age, with uncontrolled hypertension (BP &#x02265;140/90 mmHg), were included in the analysis. These subjects were under drug treatment with hydrochlorothiazide alone or in association, and were submitted to a serial of tests of cognition, anxiety and psychiatric disorders. Patients were followed-up for six months and the tests were applied by a pharmacist in one of the five consultations in the follow-up.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Measurement instruments</title><p>Mini Mental State Exam &#x02013; <italic>Mini-mental</italic> (MM) <xref rid="pone.0022925-Folstein1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> encompasses issues of temporal and spatial orientation, data registry, attention and calculation, evocation of registered data and language, each one with a specific evaluation.

The probability of non-adherence having normal MM was 10&#x00025;.</p><p>WSST showed greater sensitivity for non-adherence than MM (91&#x00025;), and lower specificity (45&#x00025;), using 3 as the cut-off point. The probability of having an altered WSST was 1.7 times higher among those who did not adhere to treatment, compared to those who did adhere. The probability of non-adherence with normal WSST was 4.8&#x00025;.</p><p>When it was considered the presence of alteration in both tests, the specificity remained similar to the MM alone, but there was reduction in the sensitivity (25&#x00025;) and in the likelihood ratio (1.0). Considering the presence of at least one altered test, there was an increase in the sensitivity (83&#x00025;) and reduction in the specificity (38&#x00025;) and likelihood ratio (1.4).</p><p>The proportion of patients with evidence of anxiety and psychiatric disorder in any of the several tests employed was not statistically different between the adherence and non-adherence groups (data not shown).</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study of patients with hypertension submitted to a clinical trial of pharmaceutical care it was possible to identify an independent association between cognitive deficit and low adherence. Anxiety and psychiatric disorders were not associated with low adherence.</p><p>The Mini-mental was the only test that showed an independent association between deficit of cognition and low adherence to treatment. This test showed also some power to detect (sensitivity of 66&#x00025;) and rule out (specificity of 81&#x00025;) lack of adherence in this context. A study conducted in Japan found a sensitivity of 75&#x00025; and a specificity of 81.5&#x00025; for non-adherence with MM, using 26 as the cut-off point, for patients hospitalized with diabetes and intolerance to glucose <xref rid="pone.0022925-Miura1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.</p><p>While some studies use MM as screening process for the selection of patients for verification of the loss of cognitive functions <xref rid="pone.0022925-Contardo1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0022925-Hayes1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, we recommend the use of this instrument as a determiner of the approach of the pharmacist with regard to the patient.</p><p>Furthermore, non-adherent patients had a worse performance in other tests, despite the absence of statistical significance. A beta error can not be discarded. Interestingly, the issue of memory was not similar between the tests. This may be due to the different domains treated in each test &#x02013; auditive <italic>versus</italic> visual memory, memory of isolated symbols (as words and numbers) <italic>versus</italic> memory of more complex context (as a short story), as well as the role of each one of these domains in the posterior evocation of the medical recommendations.</p><p>The digit span, WWST and short story, although evaluating immediate and short-term memory, showed no difference between the groups being compared, possibly because the scores obtained were so poor (equal to or less than the minimum expected) for all patients, regardless of the group.</p><p>In the case of the short story, patients need to recall ten points from an entire situation, not only words, and the average scores for immediate and short-term memory were 50&#x00025; and 37&#x00025;, respectively. This test could represent a medical recommendation situation where the patient is told a series of things he must follow. Using this scenario, it is necessary to consider the sufficiency of immediately, remembering only half of what was said and about the fitness of the 1/3 law <xref rid="pone.0022925-Sanz1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> regarding the memory of information minutes after hearing it. We may have revealed the need to use more than verbal communication tool to instruct patients, perhaps combining this with support material whenever necessary.</p><p>The tower and church shadow test, which evaluates immediate and short-term visual memory, did not reveal any association with adherence to treatment. Patient performance was good, recalling 70&#x00025; of all shadows right after visualization and 60&#x00025; 15 minutes later, indicating good visual memory in this sample. Therefore, the interventions that use this memory could probably be used to instruct these patients.</p><p>The Memory Self-Assessment Scale was hard to apply and probably quite complex for understanding. Therefore, this instrument is not appropriate for assessing non-adherence.</p><p>The findings for the tests that evaluated anxiety and psychiatric disorders did not contribute to identify reasons for non-adherence to drug treatment. A beta error cannot be fully discarded. These data differ from Campos' findings, in a report that describes symptoms of anxiety as an independent risk factor for non-adherence <xref rid="pone.0022925-Campos1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> in patients with AIDS and the Kuhl' findings, in a study that describes anxiety was related to lower adherence to several important risk-reducing recommendations after myocardial infarction <xref rid="pone.0022925-Kuhl1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>.</p><p>Pharmaceutical care has been used to improve adherence to treatment of hypertension <xref rid="pone.0022925-Castro1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0022925-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. The evaluation of cognition by the Mini-mental test and eventually the word span short-term may help to identify patients at higher risk of low adherence to treatment in the pharmacist consultation.</p><p>Our study has some limitations that deserve mention. In view of the criteria of selection, which included the necessity to understand the request for consent, diminished the probability of having enrolled participants with relevant psychiatric disorders or high anxiety. Despite the small sample size, however, the association of cognitive deficit and lost of memory emerged, but the absence of some associations may be ascribed to a beta error. On the other side, the diagnosis of adherence by plasma levels of hydrochlorothiazide and the full evaluation of cognitive performance are strengths of our investigation.</p><p>In conclusion, cognitive impairment reduces the adherence to treatment of patients with hypertension. The screening for such abnormalities should be considered in the pharmaceutical care of patients, in order to minimize its influence upon the adherence to the treatment.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Competing Interests: </bold>The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding: </bold>This study was supported in part by grants from FIPE-Hospital de Cl&#x000ed;nicas de Porto Alegre and CNPq/Brazil and had the cooperation of the Institute of Science and Technology for Pharmaceutical Innovation and the Institute of Science and Technology for Health Technology Assessment (IATS)l.
