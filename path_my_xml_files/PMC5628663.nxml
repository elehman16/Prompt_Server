However, IV iron treatment has been associated with acute hypersensitivity reactions. The comparative risk of adverse events (AEs) with IV iron preparations has been assessed by a few randomized controlled trials, which are most often limited by small patient numbers, which lack statistical power to identify differences in low-frequency AE such as hypersensitivity reactions.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Ferumoxytol versus Ferric Carboxymaltose for the Treatment of Iron Deficiency Anemia (FIRM) is a randomized, double-blind, international, multicenter, Phase III study designed to compare the safety of ferumoxytol and ferric carboxymaltose (FCM). The study includes adults with hemoglobin &#x0003c;12.0 g/dL (females) or &#x0003c;14.0 g/dL (males), transferrin saturation &#x02264;20% or ferritin &#x02264;100 ng/mL within 60 days of dosing, and a history of unsatisfactory or nontolerated oral iron therapy or in whom oral iron therapy is inappropriate. Patients are randomized (1:1) to ferumoxytol 510 mg or FCM 750 mg, each given intravenously on days 1 and 8. Primary end points are the incidence of moderate-to-severe hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, and moderate-to-severe hypotension. All potential hypersensitivity and hypotensive reactions will be adjudicated by a blinded, independent Clinical Events Committee. A secondary safety end point is the composite frequency of moderate-to-severe hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, serious cardiovascular events, and death. Secondary efficacy end points include mean change in hemoglobin and mean change in hemoglobin per milligram of iron administered from baseline to week 5. Urinary excretion of phosphorus and the occurrence of hypophosphatemia after IV iron administration will be examined as well as the mechanisms of such hypophosphatemia in a substudy.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>FIRM will provide data on the comparative safety of ferumoxytol and FCM, two IV iron preparations with similar dosing schedules, focusing on moderate-to-severe hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, and moderate-to-severe hypotension. The study plans to enroll 2000 patients and is expected to complete in 2017.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>anaphylaxis</kwd><kwd>ferumoxytol</kwd><kwd>ferric carboxymaltose</kwd><kwd>hypersensitivity</kwd><kwd>hypotension</kwd><kwd>iron deficiency anemia</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Anemia is a common condition, with an estimated 1.6 billion individuals affected worldwide,<xref rid="b1-jbm-8-155" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> of whom 500&#x02013;800 million have the most common form, iron deficiency anemia (IDA).<xref rid="b2-jbm-8-155" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> The burden of disease is higher in underdeveloped countries, but there are approximately 5 million people in the USA with IDA.<xref rid="b2-jbm-8-155" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> IDA can result from insufficient iron absorption, inadequate dietary iron, blood loss, or an increased physiological requirement for iron (eg, during pregnancy).<xref rid="b1-jbm-8-155" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Although IDA frequently coincides with chronic kidney disease (CKD), it is associated with a number of other conditions, such as heavy menstruation, certain gastrointestinal diseases affecting iron absorption, and cancer.<xref rid="b1-jbm-8-155" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Therapy with oral iron is not always suitable for managing IDA because of gastrointestinal side effects, poor absorption, and often poor adherence to treatment.<xref rid="b3-jbm-8-155" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p>Intravenous (IV) iron therapy is commonly used for the treatment of IDA as an alternative to oral iron to restore iron stores, raise hemoglobin levels, and reduce erythropoiesis-stimulating agent doses in those receiving treatment.<xref rid="b4-jbm-8-155" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> However, IV iron administration is associated with a number of safety concerns, including the potential for inducing iron overload, oxidative stress, an increased risk of infection, and hypersensitivity reactions.<xref rid="b5-jbm-8-155" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Of these safety issues associated with IV iron treatment, severe acute hypersensitivity reaction &#x02013; or reactions resembling hypersensitivity reactions &#x02013; is one that concerns clinicians the most.<xref rid="b4-jbm-8-155" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Symptoms such as dyspnea or respiratory compromise and hypotension can also raise suspicion for hypersensitivity reactions, but true anaphylaxis may not be present.

However, recent data have shown that hypophosphatemia after IV iron infusion can be mediated by an increase in intact fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23), which in turn reduces tubular reabsorption and leads to renal phosphate wasting.<xref rid="b21-jbm-8-155" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="b24-jbm-8-155" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="b25-jbm-8-155" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> While the data implicating FGF-23, vitamin D, and bone metabolism in the development of hypophosphatemia following IV iron administration are of interest, a knowledge gap remains when encountering this potential AE in clinical practice.</p><p>There are limited data comparing rates of acute adverse reactions associated with various IV iron preparations. Prior direct comparative studies of IV iron preparations were generally small, open-label, or not statistically powered to detect small but meaningful differences in rare AEs between agents (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-jbm-8-155">Table 1</xref>).<xref rid="b26-jbm-8-155" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b31-jbm-8-155" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Conversely, a number of epidemiologic studies that retrospectively analyzed large claims databases have examined the relative risk of AEs with ferumoxytol versus other IV iron products (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-jbm-8-155">Table 1</xref>).<xref rid="b32-jbm-8-155" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b34-jbm-8-155" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> For example, a retrospective cohort analysis of Medicare Part A and Part B claims for 2009&#x02013;2012 found no significant difference in hypersensitivity symptoms (hazard ratio [HR], 1.04; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.94&#x02013;1.16) or hypotension (HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.52&#x02013;1.34) between non-CKD ferumoxytol users and matched users of other iron compounds; results were similar for patients with nondialysis-dependent CKD.<xref rid="b34-jbm-8-155" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> Data from an evaluation of the US Renal Data System found that patients receiving dialysis in clinics that switched from iron sucrose or ferric gluconate to ferumoxytol due to formulary reasons had similar incidences of major AEs as those patients receiving dialysis in clinics that continued to provide iron sucrose or ferric gluconate. Specifically, the risks were similar in the ferumoxytol group compared with the iron sucrose/ferric gluconate group for all-cause (HR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.85&#x02013;1.07), cardiovascular (HR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.83&#x02013;1.19), and infectious mortality (HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.61&#x02013;1.25).<xref rid="b32-jbm-8-155" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> A third study assessed the risk of anaphylaxis at first administration among patients treated with various IV iron products from the Medicare claims database; iron dextran had a risk of 85 per 100,000 persons, while ferric gluconate, ferumoxytol, and iron sucrose had risks of 47, 34, and 16 per 100,000 persons, respectively.<xref rid="b33-jbm-8-155" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Although such retrospective epidemiologic studies may provide more rigorous information than spontaneous reports of postmarketing surveillance data, they are often affected by various sources of confounding and bias, especially involving patient selection.

The marketing of Rienso<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> has been discontinued in Europe and Canada for business reasons. FCM is currently registered in 46 countries and marketed in 37 countries worldwide and is also the only other IV iron approved in the USA that may deliver a complete course of therapy in two doses. The dose of FCM to be administered in this trial is 1.500 g (delivered as 2 &#x000d7; 750 mg), which is consistent with the approved and marketed doses of FCM in the USA (Injectafer<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>).</p><p>Currently, no large prospective comparative trials evaluating the risk of hypersensitivity reactions and/or hypotensive events with ferumoxytol versus other iron formulations have been published.

The primary end point is to characterize the incidence of moderate-to-severe hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, and moderate-to-severe hypotension. A secondary safety end point is the composite of moderate-to-severe hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, serious cardiovascular events, and death. Secondary efficacy end points will examine the mean change in hemoglobin and the mean change in hemoglobin per milligram of iron from baseline to week 5. The hypophosphatemia substudy will examine changes in blood and urine markers of phosphate and bone metabolism, including fractional excretion of phosphate, parathyroid hormone (PTH), FGF-23, and vitamin D.</p></sec><sec><title>Assessments</title><sec><title>Safety assessments</title><p>All events considered representing possible hypersensitivity reactions and hypotension will be adjudicated by an independent, blinded Clinical Events Committee (CEC) using prespecified criteria described in the protocol. The CEC is composed of five clinicians familiar with IV iron therapy and its potential associated AEs, allergic/hypersensitivity reactions, and adjudication of clinical events in trials. Each event considered to represent a possible hypersensitivity reaction or hypotension will have an adjudication packet created, which includes all relevant clinical information available from the case report forms, source documents (including the Targeted Hypersensitivity Questionnaire), and requested information (eg, hospitalization discharge summaries). For all patients with a possible hypersensitivity event, blood samples for measurement of serum tryptase are collected 1&#x02013;2 hours after the start of the event and collected again during the week 2 visit to obtain a baseline value, as tryptase levels are expected to normalize within 2 weeks following a hypersensitivity reaction. Each event is adjudicated by two members of the CEC (one immunologist and one internal medicine specialist) as well as by the CEC Chair who is an allergist/immunologist. In the event, the members are not in agreement as to whether or not the event represents a hypersensitivity reaction and/or hypotension, a teleconference will be held to review the case and achieve consensus of all available CEC members.</p><p>Hypersensitivity reactions will be recorded and adjudicated by the CEC. Hypersensitivity is defined as a local or generalized response following exposure to a putative allergen, which includes one or more objective signs and symptoms potentially suggesting hypersensitivity, including generalized erythema or pruritus, urticaria (hives, welts, or wheals), flushing, dyspnea, wheezing, bronchospasm, tachypnea, stridor, rapid-onset edema (facial, laryngeal, or pharyngeal) syncope, and dizziness. Anaphylaxis is defined as a severe, systemic, potentially fatal allergic reaction with a sudden onset and will be categorized based on the criteria of Sampson et al<xref rid="b7-jbm-8-155" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t4-jbm-8-155">Table 4</xref>). Hypotension is defined as a &#x0003e;30% decrease from baseline in systolic BP or a decrease of &#x0003e;20 mmHg in systolic BP along with symptoms (eg, dizziness/lightheadedness, fatigue, syncope, lack of consciousness, or blurred vision).</p><p>AEs are collected while the patient is present in the clinic during the 1-hour postdosing observation period and at follow-up visits at weeks 2 and 5. Postdose vital signs are obtained at approximately 5, 10, and 30 minutes following completion of the infusion. AEs are assessed by the investigator for severity and relationship to study medication; any signs or symptoms potentially representing hypersensitivity reactions, even if felt to be unlikely, are captured and adjudicated by the independent CEC.</p></sec><sec><title>Laboratory tests</title><p>Laboratory tests including chemistry, hematology, iron panel, and spot urine (for creatinine, phosphorus, albumin, and glucose) are obtained at baseline and at specific follow-up visits.</p><p>Assessments are completed on day 1 (dose 1), day 8 (dose 2), week 2, and week 5. The end points for the hypophosphatemia substudy are the temporal associations of C-terminal and intact FGF-23, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, and PTH, with changes in blood phosphorus and fractional excretion of phosphate. Patients participating in the substudy will have an additional sample of serum obtained at the time of the routine blood draws for the main study on day 1, day 8, week 2, and week 5.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>The safety population will include any randomized patient who received any amount of study drug. All safety analyses will be performed on the safety population; the treatment group is based on actual treatment received. The intention-to-treat population will include all randomized patients who had any exposure to study drug and will serve as the primary efficacy analysis population. The evaluable population will include all randomized patients who met all inclusion criteria and did not violate any exclusion criteria or have any significant protocol violations/deviations considered to impact study integrity.</p><p>For the primary and secondary end point analyses, the proportion of patients who meet the criteria of treatment-emergent moderate-to-severe hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis and/or hypotension for the primary end point, and the composite safety end point of moderate-to-severe hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, serious cardiovascular events, and deaths for the secondary end point, will be presented by treatment group. Based on an assumed AE rate of 3.3% for the primary safety end point in both treatment groups, a sample size of 2000 patients will provide approximately 90% power for the noninferiority test using a noninferiority margin of 2.64%. The assumed AE rate for the primary end point is based on the rate of these events that occurred in two earlier pivotal randomized controlled trials conducted in a similar population of patients who were unable to tolerate or had inadequate response to oral iron therapy. Noninferiority with respect to the primary end point will be concluded if the upper limit of the 95% CI for the difference in rates (ferumoxytol minus FCM) does not exceed the noninferiority margin of 2.64%.</p><p>Descriptive statistics, graphic approach, and statistical modeling methods will be used for the exploratory analysis of treatment-related hypophosphatemia and the temporal association of C-terminal and intact FGF-23, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, and PTH with changes in blood and urine phosphorus and fractional excretion of phosphate.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The relative safety of IV iron preparations regarding acute infusion-related hypersensitivity reactions is not well characterized.
