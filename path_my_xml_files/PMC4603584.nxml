Over decades, anticoagulation therapy has been used prudently in them for likely increasing the risk of intra-/extra-cranial hemorrhagic complications. However, recently rivaroxaban, a new oral anticoagulant, is proved to be as effective as traditional anticoagulants, while carrying significantly less risk of intracranial hemorrhage. Therefore, we assumed that patients may benefit from rivaroxaban if treated soon after TIA or minor stroke, and designed this adequately powered randomized study, TRACE.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and design</title><p>The <italic>Treatment of Rivaroxaban</italic> versus <italic>Aspirin in Non-disabling Cerebrovascular Events</italic> (TRACE) study is a randomized, double-blind clinical trial with a target enrollment of 4400 patients. A 14-days regimen of rivaroxaban 10&#x000a0;mg daily or a 14-days regimen of aspirin 100&#x000a0;mg daily will be administrated to randomized participants with acute TIA or minor stroke, defined as National Institute of Health Stroke Scale scores &#x02264;3. The primary efficacy end point is percentage of patients with any stroke (ischemic or hemorrhage) at 14&#x000a0;days. Study visits will be performed at the day of randomization, day 14 and day 90.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Even though the new oral anticoagulants seem to be both safe and effective, few clinical trials have been carried out to test their effect on non-disabling cerebrovascular events. Treatment with rivaroxaban may prevent more cerebrovascular events with an acceptable risk profile after TIA or minor stroke, compared with aspirin, thus helping to improve the outcome of the disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>No. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.clinicaltrial.gov/ct2/show/NCT01923818">NCT01923818</ext-link></p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Acute minor ischemic stroke</kwd><kwd>Transient ischemic attack</kwd><kwd>Rivaroxaban</kwd><kwd>Aspirin</kwd><kwd>Anticoagulation</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Transient ischemic attack (TIA) and acute minor ischemic stroke (MIS), defined as a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score &#x02264;3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], represent the largest group of patients with cerebrovascular disease. A total of 150,000 suspected TIAs and MIS are referred to secondary care for assessment and investigation in England alone each year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], and approximately 300,000 TIAs are diagnosed each year in the United States [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Though TIA and MIS have commonly been referred as non-disabling cerebrovascular events, they often prognosticated a high risk of recurrent disabling stroke. Previous studies reported that [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] the risks of subsequent stroke were as high as 10.5&#x02013;18.5&#x000a0;% at 90&#x000a0;days after TIA or MIS, over a half of which occurred in the first week. Some even believed that the recurrent stroke risk was likely to be much higher than commonly thought, about one third patients with ischemic stroke have had an earlier TIA or MIS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>Thrombylisis therapy, antiplatelet therapy and anticoagulant therapy play important roles in treatments of ischemic cerebrovascular disease. Intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) was identified as the only pharmacological treatment for acute ischemic stroke approved by the US FDA in 1996 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], however, it usually excluded the MIS patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. About one third of those, who hadn&#x02019;t accepted intravenous t-PA treatment since stroke symptoms were mild on hospital arrival, would have a poor final stroke outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>For long time, aspirin has been considered as the standard antiplatelet therapy for ischemic cerebrovascular diseases. Two large clinical trials indicated that over 2&#x02013;4&#x000a0;weeks treatment with aspirin after acute ischemic stroke reduced the risk of recurrent ischemic stroke by 30&#x000a0;% with a small increase in intracranial hemorrhage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Previous trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] on secondary prevention of noncardiogenic ischemic stroke had reported a combination of clopidogrel and aspirin had no further benefit compared with aspirin only. However recently, CHANCE study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] excitingly reported that, not associated with increased hemorrhage events as compared with aspirin monotherapy, dual antiplatelet therapy (clopidogrel and aspirin) reduced the risk of recurrent stroke in patients with TIA and acute MIS. The results shed a light on exploiting possibly more effective medical therapy for patients suffered non-disabling cerebrovascular diseases.</p><p>Over 50&#x000a0;years, anticoagulants have been used to treat patients with acute ischemic stroke for preventing early recurrent stroke and improving neurological outcomes with the cited reasons including: (1) to halt neurological worsening; (2) to prevent early recurrent embolization; (3) to improve neurological outcomes. Although, traditional anticoagulant has showed effectiveness of recurrent stroke prevention, its use was very limited in patients with ischemic cerebrovascular events because of higher incidence of bleeding events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Proper treatment for non-disabling cerebrovascular events should be effective, as well as safe and convenient. Recently, new oral anticoagulants have received extensive attentions because of the following advantages, 1) directly targeting the coagulation cascade with rapid onset/offset of action; 2) fewer side effects (especially lower rates of major hemorrhage); 3) lower risks for drug-drug interactions; 4) more predictable responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. One of the new anticoagulants, rivaroxaban, a direct factor Xa inhibitor, has been approved in US for prevention of deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) and venous thromboembolism (VTE) in surgery and for prophylaxis of the risk of stroke in people with abnormal heart rhythm (non-valvular atrial fibrillation) at 2011, and for treatment of DVT and pulmonary embolism at 2012. Recent published trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] confirmed that rivaroxaban reduced the mortality of severe cardiovascular events and improved outcome with less fatal bleeding in the patients with atrial fibrillation and in the secondary prevention of patients with acute coronary syndrome. Moreover, rivaroxaban showed the best cost-effectiveness of stroke prevention in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation within the 3 novel oral anticoagulants, i.e. apixaban, dabigatran and rivaroxaban [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p>Till now, no specific acute therapy is available for the vast majority of patients with acute non-disabling cerebrovascular events other than antiplatelet therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. This new anticoagulant agent, rivaroxaban could be a more effective, as well as safe and convenient option. Therefore, in this study we will enroll Chinese patients with TIA and acute MIS, who would show particularly high risk for recurrent ischemia, low risk for hemorrhage and relatively stable systematic conditions after cerebrovascular events onset. And they will be randomly treated with rivaroxaban (10&#x000a0;mg daily) or aspirin (100&#x000a0;mg daily) to assess the safety and efficacy of the new medication.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Study objective</title><p>The Treatment of Rivaroxaban versus Aspirin in Non-disabling Cerebrovascular Events (TRACE) study (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov">www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link> identifier NCT01923818) is a randomized, double-blind, multicenter, controlled clinical trial in 4400 Chinese patients with acute TIA or minor stroke. The primary objective of this trial is to determine whether rivaroxaban is safe, when added to standard care, and can reduce the risk of any stroke (both ischemic and hemorrhagic) when initiated within 24&#x000a0;h of symptom onset in high-risk patients with TIA or MIS.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study participants</title><p>Totally 4400 patients will be recruited through 60 emergency departments of general hospitals in China.

After the first several days, the ideal target blood pressure would be &#x0003c;140/90&#x000a0;mm Hg. Patients with dyslipidemia would be administrated with statin therapy according to low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level. Those patients already taking statins at the time of onset of TIA or ischemic stroke would continue their statin therapy. Patients with diabetes would receive glycemic control according to plasma glucose level. Patients would be suggested early mobilization and several lifestyle modifications, include salt restriction, weight loss, the consumption of a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy products, regular aerobic physical activity, smoke quitting and limited alcohol consumption.</p><p>The study has been approved by the Medical Ethical Reviewing Committee of the Fourth Military Medical University Medical Center.

The results from our preliminary study were used to calculate the sample size (unpublished data). A relative risk reduction of 28&#x000a0;% (relative risk with addition of rivaroxaban is 0.72) was the smallest difference we would attempt to detect.

Although previous study showed that rapid assessment and early treatment after a non-disabling cerebrovascular event resulted in a much lower risk of recurrent stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], few established or effective therapies were used in clinical work. Aspirin is the current standard antiplatelet therapy to prevent recurrent stroke in patients with acute cerebrovascular event, but the effect is modest, and moreover weakened by a small increased risk of intracranial hemorrhage. Traditional anticoagulant, if administrated immediately after acute ischemic stroke, could decrease risk of recurrent stroke compared to patients untreated or received antiplatelet agent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. However, since increased rate of bleeding complications, the usefulness of anticoagulation is still in dispute.</p><p>There&#x02019;re few clinical trials to test the effect of new oral anticoagulants on non-disabling cerebrovascular events, even though these agents seem to be safe and effective. Rivaroxaban (a direct factor Xa inhibitor), one of the new anticoagulants, has received attention widely. Recently it has been confirmed effective in prevention and treatment of DVT, VTE and pulmonary embolism, and showed improved outcome in patients with atrial fibrillation and with acute coronary syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>However, effects of rivaroxaban for prevention of the early recurrent risk after TIA and acute MIS are still unsettled. Anticoagulant therapy, with the new drug rivaroxaban, might prevent more cerebrovascular events with an acceptable risk profile after TIA or MIS compared with mono-antiplatelet therapy, thus would be helpful to improve the outcome of the disease.</p><p>We designed TRACE trial as a randomized, double-blind, multicenter, controlled clinical trial in China. We would assess the hypothesis that a 14-days rivaroxaban regimen followed to aspirin administration is superior to aspirin alone for the treatment of high-risk patients with acute nondisabling cerebrovascular event.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Trail status</title><p>The trial was registered at Clinicaltrials.org and the study is open for recruitment.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>CT</term><def><p>Computed tomography</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DWI</term><def><p>Diffusion weighted imaging</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DVT</term><def><p>Deep-vein thrombosis</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MIS</term><def><p>Minor ischemic stroke</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MRI</term><def><p>Magnetic resonance imaging</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>mRS</term><def><p>Modified Rankin Scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NIHSS</term><def><p>National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TIA</term><def><p>Transient ischemic attack</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>t-PA</term><def><p>Tissue plasminogen activator</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VTE</term><def><p>Venous thromboembolism</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p>Fang Yang, Wenrui Jiang and Ya Bai contributed equally to this work.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>ZG: the principal investigator for this project who led the conceptualization, design, funding applications and made a strategic decision of this research protocol.
