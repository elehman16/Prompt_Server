Early treatment strategies beyond lifestyle changes and metformin include adding one or more oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs), incretin-based therapies or basal insulin. Once lifestyle changes and metformin treatment have been initiated, various factors influence the order in which further pharmaceutical interventions are prescribed during the course of diabetes treatment. Efforts have been made over the years <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref> to create algorithms for diabetes management; however, it is becoming clearer that individualized treatment regimens are necessary for effective diabetes management <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. Navigating through the multitude of treatment choices can, however, be difficult for physicians, especially considering the lack of comparative studies available targeting specific patient populations at various stages of disease progression.</p><p>In general, initiation of insulin therapy is often postponed and only added after two or more OADs and/or glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists have proven inadequate to achieve or maintain glycaemic control <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. However, safer and more user-friendly insulin preparations could be used at an earlier stage in a more advantageous manner to aid patients in achieving glucose control.</p><p>Insulin degludec (IDeg) is a new basal insulin that uses a novel mechanism of protraction resulting in a flat, stable profile and with a duration of action greater than 42 h <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. IDeg provides substantial reductions in glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) with low rates of overall and nocturnal hypoglycaemia, and is the only basal insulin with the potential of being dosed at any time of day with the possibility of changing injection time in response to changes in patients&#x02019; daily schedules, without compromising efficacy or safety <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>.</p><p>In this comparative study between the basal insulin IDeg and the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DDP-4) inhibitor sitagliptin (Sita), we investigated the differences in efficacy and safety between these two treatment options.

Inc., Whitehouse Station, NJ, USA) as add-on to treatment with 1 or 2 OADs (metformin, SU, glinides or Pio). Participants were stratified according to the use of Pio at screening, and the stratification was employed to ensure an approximately equal distribution of Pio users in the two treatment arms. The trial was open-label because of the distinctive difference in the mode of trial product administration. IDeg was injected once daily at any time of day, between waking up and bedtime, as long as there was a minimum of 8 and a maximum of 40 h maintained between injections. Sita 100 mg was administered orally once daily. IDeg was titrated weekly applying a treat-to-target approach to achieve a pre-breakfast self-measured plasma glucose (SMPG) target of &#x0003c;5.0 mmol/l (90.0 mg/dl). Plasma glucose (PG) was measured by the subjects at home using a blood glucose meter that included plasma calibrated test strips converting blood glucose values to PG values. The insulin starting dose was 10 units, and based on the average of three consecutive pre-breakfast SMPG values before each visit, a new dose was recommended in accordance with a titration algorithm (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) via an electronic data capture system. The investigator could accept or reject the recommended dose. The subjects recorded in their diary every day throughout the trial if the IDeg injection was taken in the morning (between getting up and breakfast), daytime (between breakfast and main evening meal) or in the evening (between main evening meal and bedtime). The Safety Committee from the sponsor (Novo Nordisk) that performed ongoing safety surveillance and the external cardiovascular Event Adjudication Committee (EAC) were masked to treatment.

Confirmed hypoglycaemia was defined as hypoglycaemic episodes with a PG value of &#x0003c;3.1 mmol/l (56 mg/dl) (regardless of symptoms) or severe episodes where assistance from another person was required. Confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes occurring between 00:01 hours and 05:59 hours (inclusive) were classified as nocturnal, and those occurring between 06:00 hours and 00:00 hours (inclusive) as diurnal. Cardiovascular events were reviewed by an independent EAC. Laboratory analyses were performed at Quintiles Central Laboratories in Argentina, India, Scotland, Singapore, South Africa, Switzerland and USA. The following validated questionnaires assessed HRQoL outcomes: Diabetes Medication Satisfaction Questionnaire (DiaMedSat), Diabetes Productivity (DPM), Short-Form 36 Health Survey version 2 (SF-36 v2), Treatment-Related Impact Measure&#x02014;Diabetes (TRIM&#x02013;D) and Hypoglycaemic Episode&#x02014;Interview Questionnaire.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical methods</title><p>All statistical analyses were performed using <sc>sas</sc> version 9.1.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). This trial&#x02019;s primary objective was to confirm the superiority of IDeg to Sita as assessed by change in HbA1c from baseline to after 26 weeks. Superiority was considered confirmed if the upper bound of the two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) was &#x0003c;0%. Type I error was controlled by adopting a hierarchical (fixed-sequence) testing procedure for selected endpoints in the following order: change in HbA1c, change in FPG, HbA1c responders [&#x0003c;7% (&#x0003c;53 mmol/mol)] and responders (&#x0003c;7%) without hypoglycaemia. The sample size was determined based upon this primary objective using a t-statistic under the assumption of a one-sided test of size 2.5% and a 0.4% mean treatment difference and standard deviation (s.d.) estimate of 1.3% for HbA1c.</p><p>Subjects in the full analysis set (FAS), defined as all subjects randomly allocated to treatment were included in the statistical assessments of all efficacy endpoints and treatment comparisons of hypoglycaemia, body weight and lipids. Other safety endpoints were evaluated in subjects exposed to treatment (safety analysis set). A single site was closed down and subjects from this site were excluded from the FAS before unblinding of treatment groups. These subjects were included in the safety analysis set. Missing values were imputed using the last observation carried forward (LOCF) method.

The number of treatment-emergent confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes per subject-year of exposure was analysed using a negative binomial regression model including treatment, antidiabetic therapy at screening, sex and region as fixed factors and age as covariate, using all reported treatment-emergent episodes.

For patients where initiation of insulin would result in both short- and long-term added benefits with regard to glycaemic control, efforts need to be made to illustrate the direct benefits in efficacy that insulin has over currently available OADs while also trying to break down the known barriers to initiate insulin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. The results from the present trial demonstrated that IDeg dosed at any time of day, with the possibility of adapting the injection time from day to day, was well tolerated and effectively improved glycaemic control in individuals with type 2 diabetes inadequately treated with 1&#x02013;2 OADs. The population studied consisted of middle-aged, overweight or obese individuals with diabetes duration of&#x0223c;8 years. The majority of individuals were treated with two OADs (metformin and SUs) at study entry, thus the population mimics a prevalent group of patients seen in everyday clinical practice. Treatment with IDeg lowered HbA1c by 0.43%-points more than did Sita, and the odds of achieving the goals of HbA1c &#x0003c; 7% (&#x0003c;53 mmol/mol) and HbA1c &#x02264; 6.5% (&#x02264;48 mmol/mol) were 60 and 98% higher with IDeg than with Sita, respectively. The 9-point SMPG profile showed that IDeg was also more effective than Sita in reducing both fasting and postprandial PG. In accordance with the ADA/EASD position statement, none of the mean level of postprandial PG in the IDeg group exceeded 180 mg/dl <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. The efficacy results seen in this study are in general agreement with previous results seen for both IDeg and Sita. In insulin-na&#x000ef;ve subjects treated with 1&#x02013;2 OADs, IDeg has been shown to effectively reduce HbA1c with non-inferiority to IGlar <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. When added to metformin, Sita has been shown in earlier studies to reduce HbA1c between 0.6 and 1.0% from baseline levels of 7.5&#x02013;8.7% (58&#x02013;72 mmol/mol) over 6&#x02013;12 months&#x02019; therapy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>.</p><p>One of the greatest concerns for individuals with diabetes is the risk of hypoglycaemic episodes and, in particular, those occurring during sleep (nocturnal hypoglycaemia). With superior glycaemic control of IDeg compared with Sita, it was expected that the rate of hypoglycaemic episodes would be higher, as turned out to be the case. As the rate of hypoglycaemia in general was low in both treatment groups in this trial, in particular during the night, the rate of nocturnal confirmed hypoglycaemia was not shown to be statistically different. Moreover, no clustering of hypoglycaemic episodes at any time-point during the trial was observed. It is well known that SU use can be associated with higher risk of hypoglycaemia. As three quarters of all subjects entering the study were continuously treated with an SU/glinide in addition to trial drugs, a <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis was performed in order to analyse if the use of concomitant OADs affected the incidence of confirmed hypoglycaemia. As expected, in both treatment groups the <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis identified a marked decline in the number of hypoglycaemic episodes in individuals not treated with SUs/glinides.</p><p>In accordance with previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>, no weight gain was observed with Sita, whereas a small weight gain was observed with IDeg, in similar magnitude as is commonly found with initiation of basal insulin treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. Flexibility in dosing times may be of importance for patients. Data from a large survey have shown that approximately one third of patients report insulin omission/non-adherence on average 3 days within the last month due to being, for example, too busy, travelling or stressed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. In this study, 42% of subjects treated with IDeg chose to change the injection time of their basal insulin at least once. This depicts the advantage of the option of flexibility when needed in a clinical context.</p><p>Limitations to the trial include the open-label design but, as the trial drugs were administered as injection (IDeg) and as oral agent (Sita), a blinded study was not an option. Poor control at baseline [mean baseline HbA1c: 8.8&#x02013;9.0% (73&#x02013;75 mmol/mol) and mean baseline FPG: 9.4&#x02013;9.9 mmol/l (169&#x02013;178 mg/dl)] may favour the addition of IDeg, which specifically targets FPG, compared with Sita, which has more of an effect on postprandial glucose.</p><p>In conclusion, the results from this trial demonstrated that the basal insulin, IDeg, as add-on to 1&#x02013;2 OADs dosed once daily at any time of the day, was superior to Sita in terms of improving glycaemic control as measured by reduction in HbA1c in subjects with type 2 diabetes. Although hypoglycaemia rates are naturally higher when treating with insulin, the marked improvements in efficacy and, in the case of IDeg, the possibility of flexibility with regard to dose timing when needed, support the benefits of earlier initiation of basal insulin in relevant patient groups.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was supported financially by Novo Nordisk A/S, Denmark, who was also responsible for the design, conduct, analysis and reporting of the study with input from the authors.
