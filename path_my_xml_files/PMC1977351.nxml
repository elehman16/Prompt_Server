The present analysis concerns the local recurrence rates for the 122 lumpectomy patients who did not receive breast irradiation. The cumulative rate of local breast recurrence was greater in the 12-week than the 36-week group, P = 0.02. Similarly, in the lumpectomy patients, the cumulative rate of distant recurrence was greater in the 12-week than the 36-week group, P = 0.04. In conclusion, our results suggest that adjuvant chemotherapy impacts on local breast recurrence in a similar manner to other sites in Stage II breast cancer patients treated by lumpectomy without radiation. Despite the use of a conventional 36-week adjuvant chemotherapy regimen, the local breast recurrence rate was substantial.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00065-0138.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="130" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00065-0139.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="131" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00065-0140.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="132" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
