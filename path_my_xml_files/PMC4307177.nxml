Since treatment in ICUs is highly specialised and depends on technical equipment, like ventilators, it is costly and accounts for a large percentage of the total hospital expenditure. In 2011, 43% of the patients in Danish ICUs were medical patients, the rest surgical patients. The majority of the surgical patients were hospitalised acute. Mortality during the stay in ICU was 12.7% and 30-day mortality 21.2% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. An intensive care admission can have substantial consequences for patients and studies show that ICU survivors have a decreased quality of life and an increased mortality for years after discharge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>

The first ventilators were rather primitive and highly uncomfortable for the patients, making the sedation practice necessary. Though ventilators are now advanced and allow for better patient-ventilator interaction, the routine of continuous sedation is still widespread. Continuous sedation has a reputation of being unavoidable for patients to tolerate the ICU environment, the necessary procedures and so forth. A study from USA in 1991 showed that almost all patients on ventilators were sedated, some by intermittent administration, while 62% received continuous intravenous sedative infusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. A study from Scandinavia in 2004 showed that only 15% of the ICUs who answered the questionnaire applied daily awakening of the sedated patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. A total of 53% of the ICUs used a sedation scale to monitor sedation depth. A study from Denmark in 1999 showed that sedatives were used extensively in Danish ICUs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>It has been shown that the level of melatonin in the blood, which is closely related to a proper diurnal sleep rhythm, is disturbed in sedated, mechanically ventilated patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. This disturbed melatonin rhythm could play a role in the development of delirium, which is common in critically ill patients, with a prevalence of up to 80% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>During the last two decades, several randomised clinical trials have been conducted in an attempt to determine the adverse effects of continuous sedation during mechanical ventilation and to reduce the level of sedation in critically ill patients. The outcomes have primarily been &#x02018;days on mechanical ventilation&#x02019; and &#x02018;length of stay&#x02019; in ICU and in hospital. Brook <italic>et al</italic>. published a randomised clinical trial, which indicated that the use of protocol-controlled sedation could reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation, the length of stay in the ICU, and the number of tracheostomies performed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>In 1998, Kollef <italic>et al</italic>. performed a non-randomised cohort study, which showed that continuous intravenous infusion of sedatives was associated with significantly longer mechanical ventilation, increased length of stay in the ICU and in hospital, compared with patients receiving only bolus doses of sedatives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In 2004, De Jonghe <italic>et al</italic>. showed that the use of a sedation algorithm, based on a regular assessments of the level of consciousness and an attempt to help the critically ill patients tolerate the intensive care environment, resulted in a significantly shorter duration of mechanical ventilation, using a historical control group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>In a trial from 2000, Kress <italic>et al</italic>. randomised 128 critically ill patients receiving mechanical ventilation to continuous intravenous sedation with or without a daily wake-up trial, in which the infusion of sedatives was discontinued [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. When it had been ensured that the patient was co-operable and awake, the patient was put back to sleep using the continuous intravenous sedation. The trial showed that the group of patients who were awakened daily had a significantly shorter stay in the ICU and a significantly shorter duration of mechanical ventilation. Also, fewer diagnostic computed tomography (CT) scans of the cerebrum were performed in patients who were awakened daily [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Since Kress <italic>et al</italic>.&#x02019;s trial it has been the golden standard to awaken patients on a daily basis if continuous intravenous sedation is used.</p><p>In 2005, Arroliga <italic>et al</italic>. carried out a prospective, multicentre, cohort study with 5,183 adult patients who were mechanically ventilated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In this non-randomised study, it was observed that the use of sedatives for critically ill, mechanically ventilated patients was associated with longer duration of mechanical ventilation, a longer weaning period, and a longer stay in the ICU. It was concluded that randomised clinical trials specifically designed to evaluate the effect of sedation compared with no sedation should be performed on critically ill, mechanically ventilated patients to shed light on this important issue.</p><p>Most critically ill, mechanically ventilated patients in ICUs throughout the world are still routinely sedated. In the department of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care at Odense University Hospital, we have had a non-sedation policy during the last decade. We use appropriate analgesics as intravenous bolus doses, but we do not sedate the patients. We undertook a randomised clinical trial to assess if this policy was in fact to the benefit of the patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. One hundred and forty patients on mechanical ventilation were included and randomised to either the current golden standard of continuous sedation with a daily wake-up trial or to our standard therapy with no sedation. We were able to show that the non-sedated group had a significantly shorter time on mechanical ventilation (four days), a significantly shorter stay in the ICU (nine days), and a significantly shorter stay in hospital (24 days). The mortality was 22% in the non-sedated group and 38% in the sedated group (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.06). A <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis demonstrated that the rate of acute renal failure was significantly lower in the non-sedated group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. A neuropsychologist examined a smaller cohort of the surviving patients. This psychological study demonstrated that the rate of post-traumatic stress was not significantly higher among patients who had been awake compared to those who were treated with the standard strategy of sedation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>To identify other randomised clinical trials assessing the effects of sedation versus non-sedation in mechanically ventilated, critically ill patients, we undertook a systematic literature search. We searched the following databases from inception to October 2013: Medline, Embase, Cinahl and the Cochrane Library, Central. Only one randomised clinical trial of sedation versus non-sedation was identified, namely the one we performed in Odense University Hospital [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>The results from our previous trial showed that non-sedation in critically ill, mechanically ventilated patients might have substantial beneficial effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Our objective is now twofold: (1) to examine whether it is possible to implement non-sedation in other ICUs, and (2) to assess the clinical effects of non-sedation more thoroughly, randomising a sufficient number of patients to reach statistical power, to demonstrate or reject a significant reduction of mortality.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Trial conduct</title><p>We will obtain informed consent from the patients who are sufficiently awake; otherwise the informed consent will be obtained from the closest relative and the patient&#x02019;s general practitioner, alternatively the Medical Health Office.</p><p>The trial is approved by the Data Protection Agency (#2008-58-0035, approval for the Region of Southern Denmark) and the regional ethics committee (Region Southern Denmark).</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Trial objectives and hypotheses</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>Objectives</title><p>The objective will be to assess the benefits and harms of the current golden standard of treatment, where mechanically ventilated ICU patients will be continuously sedated and awakened daily, compared with a strategy with non-sedation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Hypotheses</title><p>The primary hypothesis is that non-sedation compared to sedation and a daily wake-up trial will:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Reduce mortality.</p></list-item></list></p><p>The secondary hypotheses are that non-sedation compared to sedation and a daily wake-up trial will:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Reduce the incidence of a composite outcome of death, acute myocardial infarction (AMI), stroke, pulmonary embolism and other thromboembolic events.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Reduce the number of organ failures.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Increase the days alive without mechanical ventilation.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Increase the days alive outside the ICU.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Increase the days alive outside the hospital.</p></list-item></list></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Trial design</title><p>The non-sedation (NONSEDA) trial is an investigator-initiated, randomised, clinical, parallel-group, multinational, superiority trial designed to include 700 patients from at least six ICUs in Denmark, Norway and Sweden (Additional files <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Randomisation</title><p>Patients will be randomised to one of the two groups within 24 hours after intubation.

Specifically, it is recorded if failure of non-sedation is related to agitated delirium, oxygenation problems, or an unstable circulation. There will be no cross-over between the groups. If a patient in the non-sedated group needs sedation a daily wake-up trial will be performed. During this wake-up trial, it is evaluated if the patient again can tolerate non-sedation.</p><p>We expect that 15 to 20% of the patients in the non-sedated group will have difficulties tolerating the non-sedation strategy, mostly because of agitated delirium (18% discontinued the non-sedation in the previous study conducted at Odense University Hospital [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Selection of trial sites and personnel</title><sec id="Sec16"><title>Trial sites and setting</title><p>Odense University Hospital.
