<italic>Background.</italic> Pretreatment with the angiotensin-converting inhibitor captopril or volatile anesthetic isoflurane has, respectively, been shown to attenuate myocardial ischemia reperfusion (MI/R) injury in rodents and in patients. It is unknown whether or not captopril pretreatment and isoflurane preconditioning (Iso) may additively or synergistically attenuate MI/R injury.<italic> Methods and Results.</italic> Patients selected for heart valve replacement surgery were randomly assigned to five groups: untreated control (Control), captopril pretreatment for 3 days (Cap3d), or single dose captopril (Cap1hr, 1 hour) before surgery with or without Iso (Cap3d+Iso and Cap1hr+Iso). Rabbit MI/R model was induced by occluding coronary artery for 30&#x02009;min followed by 2-hour reperfusion. Rabbits were randomized to receive sham operation (Sham), MI/R (I/R), captopril (Cap, 24 hours before MI/R), Iso, or the combination of captopril and Iso (Iso+Cap). In patients, Cap3d+Iso but not Cap1hr+Iso additively reduced postischemic myocardial injury and attenuated postischemic myocardial inflammation. In rabbits, Cap or Iso significantly reduced postischemic myocardial infarction. Iso+Cap additively reduced cellular injury that was associated with improved postischemic myocardial functional recovery and reduced myocardial apoptosis and attenuated oxidative stress.<italic> Conclusion.</italic> A joint use of 3-day captopril treatment and isoflurane preconditioning additively attenuated MI/R by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Myocardial ischemia reperfusion (MI/R) injury is a major perioperative complication that is associated with significant morbidity and mortality in coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and in patients undergoing heart valve replacement surgery [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] using cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), especially in patients with comorbidities (e.g., age [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and diabetes [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]). Volatile anesthetic preconditioning (e.g., isoflurane preconditioning, Iso) provides cardioprotective effects during CABG [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Given that the isoflurane preconditioning cardioprotection is optimal or effective only when duration of the index ischemia is limited within 25&#x02013;40 minutes [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] while the typical period of cardiac ischemia during CABG surgery is usually longer than 60 minutes, the cardioprotective potential of Iso in the clinical settings is limited. Moreover, in aging [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and diabetes [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], in which myocardial oxidative stress and inflammation are increased concomitant with reduced endogenous antioxidant capacity, cardioprotection of Iso is diminished or abolished.</p><p>Increased systemic oxidative stress induced by robust production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) has been suggested as the main cause which adversely affects postoperative cardiac functional recovery in patients undergoing CABG surgery using CPB [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. ROS not only increases oxidative stress by increasing lipid peroxidation but also reduces myocardial antioxidant capacity by diminishing endogenous antioxidant enzymes activities (e.g., superoxide dismutase) [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In addition, proinflammatory cytokines release (e.g., tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>) is also enhanced after CPB [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], which may further increase ROS production and exacerbate myocardial function [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Experimental studies show that Iso confers cardioprotection against myocardial IRI by stimulating the generation of small amount of ROS which triggers cardiac protective signaling pathways [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. On the other hand, experimental studies showed that volatile anesthetic preconditioning exert cardioprotective effects against myocardial ischemic reperfusion injury through reducing nuclear factor- (NF-) kB-dependent inflammatory gene expression and decreasing TNF-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> production [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>Captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, has been shown to be cardioprotective in the prevention and regression of left ventricular hypertrophy or attenuation of MI/R injury in both clinical [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and experimental settings [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Captopril pretreatment exerts cardioprotective effects by increasing tissue antioxidant activity, scavenging different types of ROS, and thus prevents lipid peroxidation [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Captopril by inhibiting angiotensin-converting enzyme activity reduced the degradation of bradykinin, resulting in enhanced formation of prostacyclin and nitric oxide, and in turn increases myocardial antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and confers cardioprotective effects [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Therefore, the mechanism of captopril cardioprotection is totally different from that of isoflurane preconditioning. Thus, it is plausible that captopril in combination with isoflurane preconditioning may synergistically or additively attenuate MI/R in clinical settings. Therefore, we hypothesized that alternative use of captopril pretreatment and isoflurane preconditioning may confer superior protection against MI/R injury to either isoflurane or captopril regimen alone and that the mechanism of the additive/synergistic effect is related to reducing cardiomyocytes apoptosis and myocardial oxidative stress.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2.

The rabbits were ventilated with 100% oxygen and end tidal PCO<sub>2</sub> were maintained between 35 and 45&#x02009;mmHg. Myocardial ischemia reperfusion (I/R) was produced by exteriorizing the heart through a left thoracic incision and occluding the LAD (left anterior descending artery) with a silk slipknot.

Discussion</title><p>The novel finding of the present clinical and animal studies is that the application of 3-day captopril treatment, but not 1-hour captopril treatment, in combination with isoflurane preconditioning before prolonged index ischemia was superior to either captopril treatment (3 days or 1 hour) or isoflurane alone in reducing postischemic myocardial oxidative stress, proinflammatory cytokines release, and myocardial injury. Combinational use of captopril as well as isoflurane preconditioning confers antioxidative stress and anti-inflammatory effects not only during ischemia but also during reperfusion stage in patients undergoing CPB. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that captopril and isoflurane preconditioning can additively attenuate myocardial ischemia reperfusion (MI/R) injury.</p><p>When ischemia occurs, the oxygen and nutrient supply to the myocardium is reduced due to the decrease of blood flow. This deprivation of oxygen as well as nutrient supply results in the accumulation of sodium, hydrogen, and calcium ions, culminating in tissue acidosis, which leads to mitochondrial membrane depolarization, ATP depletion, and inhibition of myocardial contractile function [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Reperfusion, in turn, elicits rapid alterations in ion flux, stimulates a robust formation of ROS [<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], and promotes the proinflammatory cytokines release [<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], which eventually results in or exacerbates MI/R injury [<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Modulation of the early events induced by ischemia is of particular importance in combating MI/R. In the present study, in patients with CPB, a joint use of captopril and isoflurane preconditioning significantly reduced MI/R-induced proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>, IL-6, and ICAM-1) release during CPB, which was associated with reduced myocardial injury during CPB and after CPB (reperfusion), and this protective effect of captopril in combination of isoflurane preconditioning is superior to captopril treatment for 3 days or 1 hour alone. Solenkova et al. reported that, in isolated rabbit heart model, cardioprotection of ischemic preconditioning is dependent on activation of adenosine receptors during the first minutes of reperfusion following termination of the index ischemia [<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Similarly, Kin et al. showed that the first minute of the onset of reperfusion is critical to the cardioprotective effects of ischemic postconditioning, which protects the heart against MI/R injury by inhibiting oxidant generation and oxidant mediated injury in rats [<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. These together with the results from our present study jointly support the notion that inhibition of myocardial oxidative stress and inflammation occurred during ischemia or in the early minutes at the onset of reperfusion is important for developing cardioprotective strategies against MI/R. Results from our present study provide a clue that inhibition of myocardial oxidative stress and inflammation as early as during ischemia plays a pivotal role in ameliorating myocardial injury in MI/R. Of note, in animal study, captopril, isoflurane, and their combination all mimic the protective effects of IPC in reducing myocardial injury during ischemia, while there is no significant difference observed among all treatment groups (IPC, Cap, Iso, and Iso+Cap). This is not consistent with the results seen in our human study which showed that additive effects of captopril and isoflurane preconditioning exist as early as ischemia induction (CPB). One possible explanation is that the severity of MI/R injury is different between patients with CPB and animals received MI/R in the current study and that captopril treatment for 24 hours in animals may not precisely mimic that in our human study (3 days or 1 hour before CPB).</p><p>Increased oxidative stress and evaluated inflammation have been suggested as the main cause of MI/R injury. We previously showed that antioxidant N-acetylcysteine and allopurinol confer cardioprotective effects in rat subjected to MI/R [<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and isoflurane preconditioning and propofol postconditioning synergistically reduced MI/R injury in patients undergoing CPB by upregulating endothelial nitric oxide synthase protein expression and reducing oxidative stress and proinflammatory cytokines release [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Similarly, in the present study, in animal model of MI/R, captopril, isoflurane preconditioning, and their combination all reduced MDA (marker of lipid peroxidation) and increased SOD activity, which were accompanied with decreased myocyte apoptosis and reduced myocardial injury and inflammation. Captopril in combination with isoflurane preconditioning confers superior protection to either captopril or isoflurane alone in rabbits subjected to MI/R. However, in patients with CPB, captopril (3 days or 1 hour) in combination with isoflurane preconditioning and captopril treatment alone, for 3 days but not 1 hour, reduced MI/R injury and mycocardial inflammation. This inconsistence suggests that captopril cardioprotective effects maybe depend on the duration of the treatment. van den Heuvel et al. demonstrated that captopril treatment for 3 months reduces the incidence of ischemia-related events after myocardial infarction, but a high incidence of clinical events occurred with withdrawal from captopril after 3-month treatment relative to 1-year captopril treatment [<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. This is consistent with our present finding that no cardioprotective effect was observed in patients treated with captopril 1 hour before CPB, while 3-day captopril treatment exerted profound protection. It is of notice that, although captopril treatment for 1 hour alone did not show a protective effect in patients underwent CPB in the current study, captopril treatment for 1 hour in combination of isoflurane preconditioning conferred cardioprotective effects, indicating that captopril treatment may facilitate isoflurane preconditioning to confer protection. Captopril by inhibiting angiotensin-converting enzyme activity reduces the degradation of bradykinin, resulting in enhanced formation of prostacyclin and nitric oxide (NO), consequently exerting its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and conferring cardioprotective effects [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. NO has been proven as a trigger and mediator of isoflurane preconditioning cardioprotection. Isoflurane preconditioning by increasing endothelial nitric oxide synthase (NOS), but not inducible or neuronal NOS, enhances NO production and confers cardioprotection in a rabbit MI/R model [<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. These together suggest that captopril and isoflurane preconditioning can confer additive/synergistic effects in combating MI/R. This is confirmed in our present clinical study and animal study. However, further study is needed to elucidate the specific molecular mechanism governing the synergy of captopril and isoflurane preconditioning in the setting of MI/R.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>In summary, we demonstrated that isoflurane preconditioning, combined with captopril treatment (3 days but not 1 hour), acts additively in attenuating postischemic myocardial reperfusion injury as determined by the surrogate markers of myocardial injury and function. Further large-scale and long-term studies are required to confirm the clinical benefit of this novel pharmacologic regimen, which may offer a promising therapeutic approach to cardioprotection patients undergoing cardiac surgery.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was supported, in part, by grants from the Natural Science Foundation of Hainan Province, China (808242), and Scientific Research Foundation of Department of Health of Hainan Province, China (2010-77).</p></ack><sec sec-type="conflict"><title>Conflict of Interests</title><p>No competing interests are declared.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' Contribution</title><p>Zhengyuan Xia and Guogang Tian designed the study.
