This emphasis on esthetics has led dentists to seek resources that respect the standards established by society, but without compromising the integrity of the teeth, as the treatment philosophy should be the maximum preservation of sound dental tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>Tooth discoloration is classified based on the etiology. Extrinsic factors cause superficial changes in color, such as staining due to the consumption of coffee, tea, soft drinks, etc. Intrinsic factors, whether congenital or acquired, cause more complicated discoloration that is difficult to treat, as such discoloration is incorporated into the structure of the teeth and generally only removed through the use of more aggressive procedures that can have a negative effect on sound dental tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>Esthetic problems in childhood and adolescence can exert a significant influence on one&#x02019;s psychosocial development and interactions with peers.

Indeed, children, adolescents and young adults have become increasingly concerned with dental esthetics, which may have an important psychological impact on quality of life and may be one of the driving forces behind the current demand for dental materials and noninvasive procedures aimed at improving tooth color [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>Tooth whitening is the procedure most commonly employed by professionals and patients and is considered the least invasive esthetic treatment for improving the appearance of one&#x02019;s smile.

At-home whitening should be supervised by a dental professional and consists of the application of different concentrations of a peroxide gel (carbamide or hydrogen) to the teeth with the aid of personalized molds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. A number of publications have attested to the efficacy and biological safety of the at-home method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Since the first proposal for home tooth whitening by Haywood and Heymann [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in situ</italic> studies have demonstrated that whitening does not harm dental tissues and allows surprising esthetic results when properly employed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>It is important to understand the action mechanism of the whitening agent and possible chemical interactions with dental tissues to minimize undesirable effects, such as tooth sensitivity. Hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) is the main whitening agent employed. It is a thermally unstable free radical with a low molecular weight, which penetrates the enamel and dentin through diffusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Complex molecules of organic pigments in the tissues are broken down into simpler hydrophilic molecules through an oxidation-reduction reaction by the action of perhydroxyl ions originating from the degradation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. These simpler molecules are easily removed from the dental tissue when in contact with water, thereby providing the desired whitening effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. This is the action mechanism of peroxide in both the whitening process performed in the dentist&#x02019;s office and the self-administered method performed in the comfort of the patient&#x02019;s own home [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>The concentration of the whitening agent and exposure time on the dental surfaces are important aspects to consider. Haywood and Heymann [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] proposed the home whitening of vital teeth with a 10% carbamide peroxide gel applied with the aid of molds. This protocol is still considered the gold standard for comparisons with novel methods. The main problems reported in studies involving different concentrations of carbamide peroxide (10 to 22%) are linked to the duration of use and contact between the gel and dental surfaces (an average of 6&#x000a0;hours, which is considered high by current standards) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and the occurrence of gingival irritation and dental sensitivity during treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>Currently, carbamide peroxide has been replaced by hydrogen peroxide in molds at concentrations of 6 to 9.5%. With the aim of accelerating the home whitening process, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> has become increasingly popular. The main advantage is the shorter application time (30 to 90&#x000a0;minutes), through the greater concentration of the product (10% carbamide peroxide leads to the formation of 3.5% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>Most authors agree that whitening agents greatly improve a patient&#x02019;s self-esteem [4-6,21]. The benefits of current whitening systems and the desires of consumers, fueled to some extent by the standards of beauty dictated by society [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], have stimulated the development of over-the-counter products sold in pharmacies and supermarkets without the need for a prescription or professional supervision [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].

In the last 10&#x000a0;years, other over-the-counter whitening agents have been added, such as toothpastes, mouthwashes and chewing gum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>Despite the increase in over-the-counter whitening products, the small concentrations of peroxide lead one to have doubts regarding their true whitening potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Moreover, the fact that these materials are employed without technical supervision causes discomfort in the scientific community, especially with regard to the abrasiveness of the components, possible morphological alterations and adverse effects on enamel exposed to more concentrated whitening agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].
