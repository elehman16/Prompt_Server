Skin lesions in 0.5&#x02013;20% of cases are accompanied with arthritis. The most common form of the disease is psoriasis vulgaris, which is exhibited in the form of annular plaques in the body extensors such as elbows, lower waist, and around the umbilicus.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Psoriasis may last for several years and in some patients it recurs and some patients recover.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] It may be so modest that is not diagnosed or it may be so severe that covers much of the body surface.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Psoriasis is a common skin disease, which is more common in the north of Iran.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Psoriasis does not seriously disturb the patients&#x02019; physical capabilities; however, it has crucial effects on their psychological status.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Thus, patient's social and psychological problems mainly result from the physical problems and cause a negative picture and self-image; therefore, it leads to attenuation in the individual's position in family and his/her self-confidence. Such problems gradually lead to lethargy and sometimes depression. Finally, the patient cannot continue his/her life normally, and this may exacerbate the psychological complications in these patients.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>Psoriasis patients have exhibited a high risk for depression, anxiety, and suicide.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] From cognitivists&#x02019; view, physical problems emerge under the effect of interpersonal problems and their imagination of themselves and others, which results in forming the schema.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Some of the schemas especially the ones formed due to childhood bitter experiences-may be the main focus of personality disorders, cognitive character problems, and many I-axis disorders. When people surround to the schema, they accept its accuracy. Inefficiency of schemas is revealed when individuals&#x02019; schemas are confirmed in their routine style of life and their interactions with others, even if their initial impression is untrue and they would never try to fight the schema or avoid it, but they accept them as true.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Initial maladaptive schemas are inefficient mechanisms that directly or indirectly end in the psychological affliction.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Schema, particularly the ones mainly formed owing to the childhood unpleasant experiences, are deep and widespread patterns or themes comprised of memories, excitements, cognitions, and corporal emotions that persist throughout life. They are about self and relation with others and completely inefficient.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Initial maladaptive schema is the result of the human tendency for &#x0201c;cognitive harmonization.&#x0201d; Although the individual knows that the schema bothers him/her, he/she is convenient with it, and this comfort leads him/her to the conclusion that his/her schema is right. The outcome of such a perspective is that the schema affects processing of subsequent experiences. Schema plays a fundamental role in the patient's reflection, emotion, behavior, and communication with others and in an inevitable and conflicting way drag the adulthood life to childhood unpleasant condition, which is generally harmful for the patient.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>Through distortion, the person puts his finger on data consistent with schema and ignores or disvalues the ones contradicting the schema. Emotionally, the person may block the excitements related to a schema; once an emotion is blocked, the schema will not reach consciousness. Thus effective steps cannot be taken to change or improve it.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Behaviorally, the person is involved in self-defeating patterns, unconscious selection, and staying in relations and situations that drive and continue the schema while he/she avoids making relationships that improve the schema. Interpersonally, patients communicate with others in such a manner that stimulates their negative responses, thus reinforcing their own schema.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>Schema therapy is an influential treatment in reducing the emotional reactions and symptoms and elevating the patient's quality of life (QoL). Another treatment is mindfulness, which has been expanded in therapeutic works by others.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Considering mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT), individual created mindfulness-based stress reduction and for chronic pains he/she suggested mindfulness exercises such as body search, mediation while walking, yoga exercise, and awareness of every day's life, the individual also taught the participants how to do their work consciously. The individual took major steps in controlling stress through exercises, lectures, educational videotapes, and workshops.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>Various mechanisms have been considered to define how mindfulness skills can decrease symptoms and change behaviors. These mechanisms include exposure, cognitive alterations, self-regulation, body relaxation, and acceptance. MBCT group instruction accompanied by concentrating skills in 10 sessions during the second half of pregnancy was influential on the pregnant women's stress, pain, fear, and pregnancy-induced anxiety, which lead to the positive emotions.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Some investigators showed that the patients with psoriasis, who underwent ultraviolet therapy and simultaneously mindfulness-based intervention (mediation), experienced reduced stress and increased wound healing. Psychological and physical treatment of psoriasis is mutually interactive. On one hand, negative psychological aspects of psoriasis have a direct effect on the patient's mental health.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>Moreover, it potentially affects the disease desperation and this psychological status affects treatment motivation and the expectancy for recovery and it intervenes with treatment trend; on the other hand, control or improvement in psoriasis symptoms plays a crucial role in enhancing the patients&#x02019; QoL and their mental wellbeing.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] However, sectional treatments of psoriasis such as topical treatment, light therapy, systemic and biologic medication, and other complementary therapies merely prevent disease recurrence, and they have not managed to provide recovery until now.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Several studies have proved that the mindfulness-based therapy has a positive effect on hypertension, stress, anxiety of the pregnant women, QoL, chronic skeletal pains, physical symptoms of the patients with irritable bowel syndrome, and depression of the multiple sclerosis patients.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] In addition, these studies have proved that the schema-based therapy and primary maladaptive schemas have positive effects on the social anxiety and widespread anxiety disorder in the women, respectively.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Furthermore, one recent study has shown that the patients with psoriasis, who received mindfulness as an adjunct to their usual therapy, experienced a significant improvement in both psoriasis severity and QoL.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>This study aimed to compare the effects of the schema and mindfulness-based therapies on the maladaptive schemas in the psoriasis patients with the psychopathological symptoms. The innovation of this study is the effectiveness of the schema therapy on the maladaptive schemas of chronic diseases. Since no information is available which shows that patients with psoriasis are classified into the class of chronic diseases, who more likely to have personality disorders? Therefore, this conception needs further investigations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>A useful consort flowchart is attached [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Flowchart 1</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Flowchart 1</label><caption><p>The sample template for the consort diagram showing the flow of participants through each stage of a randomized trial</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ABR-6-4-g001"/></fig><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Patients</title><p>The design of this study was semi-experimental with the post- and pre-tests. The statistical populations were all the patients with psoriasis (<italic>n</italic> = 24, 11 males, 13 females, age range 20&#x02013;50 years), who referred to the Isfahan Al-Zahra Hospital in Iran, Dermatology Clinic, from February to September 2014. Twenty-four patients with the low general health and pathological criteria were chosen using the available sampling method. The patients were diagnosed with psoriasis symptoms through a clinical interview and the dermatologist's diagnosis. Subsequently, the patients were divided into three groups of the schema-based therapy (<italic>n</italic> = 8), mindfulness therapy (<italic>n</italic> = 8) and control (<italic>n</italic> = 8). The inclusion criteria were as follows: Patients with psoriasis according to the dermatologist diagnosis, not being detected with the psychotic disorders, based on the clinical interview and criteria of the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (DSM), having mental disorders, based on the general health questionnaire (GHQ), not taking the psychiatric medicines. The exclusion criteria were also as follows: Patients with physical diseases, being stressed after an accident during the current month, and consumption of alcohol and narcotics.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Instrumentation</title><sec id="sec3-1"><title>General health questionnaire</title><p>Goldberg GHQ contained 28 questions and evaluated four minor scales of corporal signs, anxiety, social function, and depression symptoms which assessed the person's general health during the last month. In this questionnaire, Likert scoring method was employed which was in the form of. A Likert scale is a psychometric scale usually involved in research that uses questionnaires. It is the most extensively used approach to scaling responses in survey research, such that the term is often employed interchangeably with rating scale, or more accurately the Likert-type scale, even though the two are not synonymous. The highest testing score in this method was 84. A lower score in this questionnaire indicated a higher level of general health. The score of 23 was the cutting score that was if the examinee's score equals 23 or more, it would be screened as suspected. In the Goldberg and Wiliams questionnaire, the final coefficient for having the whole questionnaire is reported to be 0.95. The Williams questionnaire, components of the longer patient health questionnaire, offers psychologists concise, self-administered tools for assessing depression. It incorporates the DSM-IV depression criteria with other leading significant depressive symptoms into brief self-report instruments that are usually employed for screening and diagnosis, as well as selecting and monitoring treatment.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-2"><title>Young schema questionnaire</title><p>Young schema questionnaire-short form with 75 articles evaluates 15 initial maladaptive schemas.

The stability of this questionnaire for the Iranian society is 0.94.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>General framework of the mindfulness therapy</title><p>General framework of mindfulness therapy was as follows: The program consisted of eight 90 min sessions and a briefing session was intended before the beginning of the program. Overall emphasis of the program was on learning to direct attention towards the inner experience and seeing what happens during this process and then on the application of those things that have been achieved through performing mindfulness practices in dealing with real-life challenges. The general trend was that each session began with the completion of an emotion scale and doing a breathing exercise. After that, a brief overview of the previous session was articulated, and agenda of the current meeting was expressed. Next, the assignments of the previous session were reviewed and then mindfulness exercises and activities related to each session were done. The session continued with breathing exercise and refilling the emotion scale. Finally, the session ended with the distribution of compendium of tips and learning materials that had been prepared in sessions and a review of the assignments. Application of MBCT intervention programs is among the most important programs in the year of 1992 by Teasdale.</p><sec id="sec3-3"><title>The formulating mindfulness training sessions</title><p>

People with this schema are too sensitive to the other people's criticism, rejection, blame, and improper comparisons.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</p><p>People with the maladaptive schema of emotional deprivation and social isolation think that desires and needs of emotional support from others will not be satisfied sufficiently, the possibility of undesirable interpersonal relationships are very high and should withdraw from relationships. Because they are different with others and not belonging to a particular person, thus they exclude themselves from family. They believe that they are unable to continue living or being happy without the support of others.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</p><p>Due to radical inhibition of actions, emotions and spontaneous communications in order to avoid rejection from others, they have an inhibition in anger, expression of positive momentum and vulnerability as well as having a sense of shame. These people have an excessive emphasis on rationality and ignoring the emotions and feelings. They have a maladaptive schema of obedience so that they feel forced towards excessive transferring of their control to another person that this often occurs for avoiding anger, withdrawal, or revenge and these behaviors lead to a kind of withdrawal in patients and make them be rejected by another party.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</p><p>In general, in patients with maladaptive schema failure in progress, entitlement/grandiosity, inadequate self-control and self-discipline, self-sacrifice, seeking confirmation/drawing attention, unrelenting standards, self-punishment, the possibility of disintegration and dissatisfaction of health will increase.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] Patients with skin diseases because of faulty thinking pattern always may enter a new period of mental health problems such as anxiety, depression, and physical symptoms.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Mindfulness is training people to get rid of cognitive processing that makes them vulnerable to periods of depression. Mindfulness tries to change consciousness and create a new relationship with thoughts instead of changing them to reduce rumination; this ability takes place by breeding two important skills of adoption of internal experiences (thoughts-emotions and unpleasant physical senses and not avoiding these experience). Mindfulness teaches patients to get out of the habitual skills of mind and prepare the conditions for change by directing information processing resources toward the goals of attention such as breathing or feeling the moment.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</p><p>Patients with psoriasis commonly experience thoughts related to incomplete schemas, mindfulness encourages patients to increase acceptance for dealing with emotional pain and distress to pay attention to their experiences in a manner devoid of judgment and in the present time and thereby reducing the level of psychological discomfort. This awareness could lead to an improvement in the emotional processing and the manner of dealing with chronic diseases.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</p><p>In addition, a conscious mind targets useless processes such as rumination, worry and weak emotional regulation and promotes positive emotions. Reusing of attention in this way prevents increasing or survival of faulty thoughts and makes faulty processing cycles to be less available. People learn to see their thoughts and feelings without judgment and look at them as simple mental events that come and go instead of seeing them as their own part or reflection of the fact[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] This approach reduces the level of body and muscle tensions and by being aware of their body feelings, the patients increase their awareness of physical changes that this leads to a reduction in their reported physical symptoms in the long-term and distracting of attention and awareness toward thoughts, emotions, and desires.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>In general, we can say that increasing attention and awareness compared to thoughts, emotions, and desires in mindfulness causes internal consistency and adaptive behaviors lead to positive psychological states in people and even cause improving the individual ability towards personal and social activities and creating interest in these activities.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</p><p>Patients with psoriasis have mental schemas that underestimate their ability to cope, seeing active outer thoughts and emotions and trying to avoid or escape from them can be an example of facing that cause to shutdown the fear responses and avoidance behavior. In the approach of the schema therapy, disturbed schemas will be improved, and the rate of activation and accompanying emotional intensity will be reduced.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Improvement of the schemas will be followed by a series of behavioral changes so that patients respond to the schema's provocative incentives in healthier ways, and their attitude becomes more positive about themselves and their environment.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</p><p>Through the cognitive strategy in the schemas, patients create a healthy voice in their minds and empower their healthy mindset and plan a rational position against schema. These strategies help patients to distance from the schemas and evaluate their correctness, also by inciting emotions associated with early maladaptive schemas as well as reprinting; patients will be helped for improving relative satisfying of childhood excitement and unmet needs.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</p><p>The limitations of this study were the low sample size as well as focusing study to Isfahan city population in Iran. Nevertheless, the strength point is that in addition to the schema and mindfulness therapeutic interventions that affect emotions and cognition, other treatments such as behavioral therapy should be taken into account.</p><p>In conclusion, this study showed similar effects of both schema and mindfulness therapies on the maladaptive schemas in improving the psoriasis patients&#x02019; psychological symptoms. We also suggest that due to the roles of geographical and genetic predisposition factors in psoriasis prevalence, the roles of biological and psychological variables should be also examined. Subsequently, the study can be run in the other cities.</p><sec id="sec2-7"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-8"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Gupta</surname><given-names>MA</given-names></name><name><surname>Gupta</surname><given-names>AK</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Quality of life of psoriasis patients</article-title><source>J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol</source><year>2000</year><volume>14</volume><fpage>241</fpage><lpage>2</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11204506</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Henseler</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The genetics of psoriasis</article-title><source>J Am Acad Dermatol</source><year>1997</year><volume>37</volume><issue>2 Pt 3</issue><fpage>S1</fpage><lpage>11</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Zaragoza</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name><name><surname>P&#x000e9;rez</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>S&#x000e1;nchez</surname><given-names>JL</given-names></name><name><surname>Oliver</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name><name><surname>Mart&#x000ed;nez</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Alegre</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Long-term safety and efficacy of etanercept in the treatment of psoriasis</article-title><source>Actas Dermosifiliogr</source><year>2010</year><volume>101</volume><fpage>47</fpage><lpage>53</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">20109392</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Darjani</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Mohtasham-Amiri</surname><given-names>Z</given-names></name><name><surname>Mohammad Amini</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Golchai</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Sadre-Eshkevari</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Alizade</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Skin disorders among elder patients in a referral center in Northern Iran (2011)</article-title><source>Dermatol Res Pract 2013</source><year>2013</year><fpage>193205</fpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kurd</surname><given-names>SK</given-names></name><name><surname>Troxel</surname><given-names>AB</given-names></name><name><surname>Crits-Christoph</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Gelfand</surname><given-names>JM</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The risk of depression, anxiety, and suicidality in patients with psoriasis: A population-based cohort study</article-title><source>Arch Dermatol</source><year>2010</year><volume>146</volume><fpage>891</fpage><lpage>5</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">20713823</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref6"><label>6</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Rush</surname><given-names>AJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>At the research front: Cognitive therapy for depression</article-title><source>Aust N Z J Psychiatry</source><year>1979</year><volume>13</volume><fpage>13</fpage><lpage>6</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">288461</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref7"><label>7</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Young</surname><given-names>JE</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Cognitive Therapy for Personality Disorders: A Schema-focused Approach (Rev ed)</article-title><source>Practitioner&#x02019;
