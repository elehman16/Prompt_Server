<bold>Background and study aims</bold>&#x02003;Youth undergoing pediatric endoscopic procedures
and their parents demonstrate suboptimal comprehension of the informed consent
(IC) process. We developed informational videos discussing key IC elements for
pediatric endoscopy and evaluated their effects on youth and parental
comprehension of the IC process.</p><p>
<bold>Patients and methods</bold>&#x02003;A randomized controlled trial of the video
intervention was performed among youth undergoing endoscopy and their parents at
an academic children&#x02019;s hospital. Randomization occurred at the time of
enrollment using permutated blocks. Following the IC process with the
proceduralist, subjects underwent structured interviews to assess IC
comprehension. An Informed Consent Overall Score (ICOS: range 0&#x0200a;&#x02013;&#x0200a;4) for
comprehension was calculated.</p><p>
<bold>Results</bold>&#x02003;Seventy-seven pairs of children and their parents participated.
Intervention recipients (N&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;37 pairs) demonstrated higher ICOS scores as

IC involves understanding of several key elements: (1) the nature of the procedure; (2) risks and (3) benefits of the procedure; and (4) alternatives to the procedure <xref rid="OR512-1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>. In pediatrics, parents/guardians assume responsibility for IC on behalf of the child/adolescent. However, youth under age 18 should not be excluded from medical decision-making. In 1995, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended that youth should be included in health care decision making through the parallel process of assent <xref rid="JR512-2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>.</p><p>While performance of IC for procedures involving significant risk is legally mandated, many IC studies of adult patients and parents of pediatric patients have demonstrated suboptimal comprehension of key IC elements <xref rid="JR512-3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>

<xref rid="JR512-5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
<xref rid="JR512-6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>. Similarly, we demonstrated poor comprehension of key IC elements by children and adolescents undergoing pediatric endoscopy <xref rid="JR512-7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>.</p><p>IC comprehension interventions have largely targeted adults. Effective interventions utilize various media formats <xref rid="JR512-8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>. Multimedia educational tools have also been effective in teaching youth, adolescents, and young adults (11&#x0200a;&#x02013;&#x0200a;29 years) about health maintenance and their health conditions <xref rid="JR512-9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
<xref rid="JR512-10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>.</p><p>In this study, we evaluated whether viewing an IC video in addition to standard IC discussions would lead to greater IC comprehension in youth undergoing endoscopy and their parents.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Patients and methods</title><p>We employed a randomized controlled study design to evaluate the efficacy of a video intervention augmenting IC discussions in improving parental and youth IC comprehension. Sample size was based on our prior work and selected to detect a 30&#x0200a;% difference in comprehension scores between the intervention v. control group <xref rid="JR512-7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>. The local Institutional Review Board approved the study. Informed consent and assent were obtained prior to all study procedures.</p><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>Subjects were youth (ages 7&#x0200a;&#x02013;&#x0200a;17 years) undergoing gastrointestinal endoscopy at a tertiary-care academic children&#x02019;s hospital and their parents. The study population was a convenience sample, and youth and parents were recruited in pairs and were English-speaking. </p><p>Each youth-parent pair was randomly assigned to either (a) view a video detailing key elements of IC (intervention) along with standard of care or (b) receive standard of care (where the parent receives the consent form to read) prior to undergoing IC discussions with the proceduralist (blinded to study assignment group) on the day of the endoscopy. Randomization occurred at the time of enrollment using permutated blocks. Following IC discussions, youth and their parents underwent separate structured interviews in private rooms to assess IC comprehension. Demographic data were collected and medical charts were reviewed to collect health information and procedural data. </p></sec><sec><title>Video design</title><p>Short (2 minutes, 43 second), animated videos were designed addressing the nature of the procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives for upper and lower endoscopy, respectively, using PowToon (<uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://www.powtoon.com">www.powtoon.com</uri>), incorporating multimedia instructional design principles promoted by Mayer and Moreno <xref rid="JR512-11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> (e.&#x0200a;g., combining words, graphics and/or audio to improve learning; using audio to explain graphics rather than words; avoiding unnecessary graphics, etc. to minimize cognitive load; keeping related pieces of information together and in usable smaller chunks; and using visual, auditory, or temporal cues to draw attention to critical elements of the lesson. Sixth grade language was used throughout the video. Videos were shown to youth and their parents on an iPad and are available for viewing under Supplemental Information.</p></sec><sec><title>IC process comprehension assessment</title><p>As performed in our prior study <xref rid="JR512-7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, youth and their parents underwent separate scripted, structured interviews in private rooms to assess comprehension of key IC elements (i.&#x0200a;e., the nature, risks, benefits, and alternatives of the procedure). Interviewees received points for understanding key IC elements and reporting qualified answers (as determined by a single rater (not the proceduralist) and according to items listed in <xref rid="TB512-1a" ref-type="table">Table&#x0200a;1a</xref> and predetermined based on prior work <xref rid="JR512-7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). An Informed Consent Overall Score (ICOS: range 0&#x0200a;&#x02013;&#x0200a;4) for comprehension was calculated from tallied points according to <xref rid="TB512-1a" ref-type="table">Table&#x0200a;1a</xref>.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical methods</title><p>Success of randomization was evaluated using the Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>-test or chi-squared analyses to examine demographic variable distributions by study group assignment. Youth (the entire cohort) were categorized into 2 age groups: child (age 7&#x0200a;&#x02013;&#x0200a;12 years) v adolescent (13&#x0200a;&#x02013;&#x0200a;17 years). IC comprehension outcomes were calculated as detailed in <xref rid="TB512-1a" ref-type="table">Table&#x0200a;1a</xref>. Overall IC comprehension (represented as the informed consent overall score [ICOS]) was calculated based on whether key IC elements (nature, risks, benefits, and alternatives of the procedure) were understood (ICOS&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;nature of the procedure&#x0200a;+&#x0200a;risks of the procedure&#x0200a;+&#x0200a;benefits of the procedure&#x0200a;+&#x0200a;alternatives to the procedure) where 1 point was given for understanding of each key IC element; thus the ICOS range was 0 to 4.&#x0200a;Because understanding the nature and risks of the procedure involved understanding of more than one information element (e.&#x0200a;g. understanding of the nature of the procedure would require understanding that an instrument would be used, that biopsies and pictures would be taken, and where in the gastrointestinal tract the procedure would take place), these IC comprehension outcomes were calculated as subscores (<xref rid="TB512-1b" ref-type="table">Table&#x0200a;1b</xref>) and only if subscores reached a certain threshold (Subscore&#x0200a;&#x02265;&#x0200a;3 for nature of the procedure and&#x0200a;&#x02265;&#x0200a;2 for risks of the procedure) was 1 point given for understanding the key element for calculation of the ICOS. IC comprehension outcomes were compared according to study group assignment and by age group (<xref rid="TB512-2" ref-type="table">Table&#x0200a;2</xref>). Complete comprehension (a perfect score) was also evaluated for the ICOS score and for key IC elements (i.&#x0200a;e., nature of the procedure, subscore&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;4; risks of the procedure, subscore&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;3). Multivariate analyses of ICOS outcomes were performed entering study group assignment, age group, and whether parent or child had previously undergone the procedure (<xref rid="TB512-4a" ref-type="table">Table&#x0200a;4a</xref>). Statistical analyses were performed using JMP 11 statistical software (Cary, NC).</p><table-wrap id="TB512-1a"><label><bold>Table&#x0200a;1a</bold></label><caption><title>Calculation of overall informed consent comprehension (Informed Consent Overall Score (ICOS), nature of procedure, and risks of the procedure.</title></caption><table rules="all"><col width="71*"/><col width="29*"/><thead><tr><td colspan="2">Informed Consent Overall Score (ICOS): Range 0&#x0200a;&#x02013;&#x0200a;4</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Component of understanding</td><td align="left" valign="top">Points awarded if understood</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Nature of procedure (understood [if scored at least 3 points<xref rid="FN512-1" ref-type="table-fn">1</xref>]: not understood)</td><td align="left" valign="top">1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Risks of procedure (understood [if listed at least 2 risks<xref rid="FN512-1" ref-type="table-fn">1</xref>]: not understood)</td><td align="left" valign="top">1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Benefits of procedure (understood: not understood)<xref rid="FN512-2" ref-type="table-fn">2</xref>

We demonstrated higher levels of comprehension in parents and youth who viewed an instructional video in addition to the IC discussion as compared to parents and youth engaging in the IC discussion alone. </p><p>Health literacy is the degree to which individuals have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions <xref rid="BR512-12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>. Numerous studies have demonstrated that low health literacy leads to poor health outcomes such as higher utilization of emergency services, more hospitalizations, incorrectly taking medications, and, in certain populations, higher mortality <xref rid="JR512-13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
<xref rid="JR512-14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>. The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) found that most adults read between 8<sup>th</sup>- to 9<sup>th</sup>-grade reading levels <xref rid="BR512-15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, and an updated NCES evaluation <xref rid="BR512-16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> demonstrated that 34&#x0200a;% of adults tested had Below Basic or Basic document literacy skills, where basic literacy comprises adults who can read and understand information in short, commonplace prose texts and locate easy identifiable quantitative information to solve simple 1-step math problems. However, most health care materials are written at a 10<sup>th</sup>-grade reading level <xref rid="JR512-17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>. Recommendations to improve health literacy have included simplifying written materials to 6<sup>th-</sup>grade reading level, providing pictures, and correcting font size and text crowding <xref rid="JR512-17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>. With the increasingly common use of mobile technologies, health education methods are increasingly capitalizing upon media-based methods of communication that appear to improve comprehension independent of literacy and education levels <xref rid="JR512-18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
<xref rid="JR512-19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>. Similarly, we utilized a video format incorporating multimedia principles with language at a 6<sup>th-</sup>-grade reading level to improve comprehension, which we demonstrated in parents. However, in children, intervention effect varied by age. Youth aged 7 to 12 years demonstrated lower comprehension scores than adolescents, suggesting that videos directed towards youth should target a lower grade reading level to maximize comprehension. </p><p>Effective IC interventions targeting adults have included audiovisual aids, enhanced consent forms with simplified language and diagrams, and decision trees <xref rid="JR512-20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>. The few studies that have been conducted in minors addressing IC comprehension have been for clinical trials and not for standard medical procedures <xref rid="JR512-21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>
<xref rid="JR512-22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>
<xref rid="JR512-23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>
<xref rid="JR512-24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>. In our study, we evaluated an IC intervention for a common invasive diagnostic procedure and demonstrate that youth and parents who received a multimedia informed consent intervention demonstrated significantly greater comprehension scores as compared to youth and parents who did not. </p><p>Obtaining consent from minors is controversial in the very young; however, as youth reach adolescence, obtaining assent prior to procedures and risky medical treatments is increasingly advocated <xref rid="JR512-2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>. A smooth transition from child-oriented to adult-based health systems is an important healthcare goal for youth with chronic disease advocated by national health agencies with initiation of the process by 14 years <xref rid="JR512-25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>. For youth with chronic gastrointestinal disease, repeat endoscopic procedures are often an obligatory part of medical surveillance and evaluation. Including these adolescents in the consent process for endoscopy should be part of transition preparation.</p><p>There were study limitations. First, our study was performed at a single pediatric tertiary care center. Second, we only studied English-speaking subjects and we did not perform a literacy assessment. Translation of our intervention to Spanish is an important next step in our line of investigation given the demonstrated higher prevalence of inadequate health literacy in Spanish-speaking patients v. English-speaking patients. <xref rid="JR512-26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>. Last, while we did standardize the intervention video, we could not standardize for the IC discussion between proceduralist and youth/parent. Nevertheless, entry of proceduralist as a covariate in performed analyses did not change study outcomes. </p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this study, we demonstrated that short, animated videos addressing key elements of the IC process for pediatric endoscopy were effective in improving IC comprehension in both youth and their parents.
