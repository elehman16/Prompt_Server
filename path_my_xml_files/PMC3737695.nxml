However major complications have been reported for FESS under general anesthesia resulting from impaired visibility due to excessive bleeding.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] Controlled hypotension is a technique used to limit intraoperative blood loss to provide the best possible field for surgery.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] Benefits for controlled hypotension for FESS include reduction in blood loss with improved quality of surgical field. Various agents e.g., magnesium sulfate.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] Vasodilators (sodium nitroprusside),[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] nitroglycerine,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] high doses of potent inhaled anesthetics,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] and beta adrenergic antagonist[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] have been used to achieve controlled hypotension. Some disadvantages have been reported of these techniques including delayed recovery from inhaled anesthetics, resistance to vasodilators, tachyphylaxis, and cyanide toxicity for nitroprusside. Esmolol is an ultrashort acting selective B1 adrenergic antagonist that reduces heart rate and blood pressure. It has rapid onset of action of bolus i.v. injection and infusion.

After approval of the local ethical committee, written informed consent was obtained from patients during the pre-anesthetic evaluation. Forty ASA physical status I or II patients aging 20-50 years scheduled for elective FESS. Patients with recurrent sinus surgery, hypertension, coronary artery diseases and renal, hepatic or cerebral insufficiency and patients with coagulopathies or receiving drugs influencing blood coagulation were excluded from the study. All patients had bilateral nasal polyposis with opacity of all paranasal sinuses. The patients were assessed clinically in addition to ECG, chest X ray and basal laboratory tests. Patients included in this study were randomly assigned according to computer generated randomization to receive either dexmedetomidine (DEX group <italic>n</italic>=20) or esmolol (E group <italic>n</italic>=20).</p><p>In the operating room, two cannulae were inserted, one for infusion of dexmedetomidine or esmolol and the other for administration of fluids and other drugs. A 22G radial artery catheter was inserted for continuous measurement of arterial blood pressure and blood sampling for arterial blood gas analysis. In DEX group, patients received loading dose of 1 &#x003bc;g/kg dexmedetomidine diluted in 10 ml 0.9% saline infused over 10 min before induction of anesthesia, followed by continous infusion of (0.4- 0.8 &#x003bc;g/kg/h). In E group, patients received esmolol as a loading dose 1 mg/kg was infused over 1 min followed by continuous infusion of (0.4-0.8 mg/kg/h). In both groups infusion rate was titrated to maintain MAP within 55-65 mmHg. All patients were premedicated with IV midazolam 0.05 mg/kg and fentanyl 2 &#x003bc;g/Kg. Patients received standard anesthetic technique with propofol 1-2 mg/kg supplemented if necessary by 0.2 mg/kg aliquots until loss of verbal response. The required induction doses of propofol were recorded. Endotracheal intubation was facilitated with atracurium 0.5 mg/kg with suitable sized cuffed tube. Anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane 2-4%. All patients were mechanically ventilated with 60% air/O<sub>2</sub> mixture. In both groups, signs of inadequate anesthesia as increase in the arterial pressure greater than the targeted MAP or somatic responses as Movement, tearing, or sweating) were treated with additional dose of fentanyl. Nitroglycerine was infused if these target limits could not be achieved with upper most doses. The drug infusion rate was then decreased when targeted MAP was achieved. Respiratory rate (RR) and tidal volume (TV) were adjusted according to body weight to maintain normocapnia. Patients received lactated Ringer's at 3 ml/kg and were placed in a 15&#x000b0; reverse Trendlenburg position to improve venous drainage. In both groups cottonoids soaked with epinephrine in a concentration of 1:80.000 was inserted into the nasal cavity and in between the polyps to minimize blood loss. Oropharyngeal pack was used. Endoscopic sinus surgeries in all patients were in the form of bilateral polypectomy, middle meatal antrostomy, complete ethmoidectomy and sphenoidotomy. The same surgeon performed all operations to ensure consistency in the estimation of the surgical field. He was blinded to the hypotensive agent used. When MAP reached the desired range (55-65 mmHg) and was maintained for at least 10 minutes, the surgeon estimated the quality of the surgical field using a predefined category scale adopted from that of Fromme <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>]</p><p>Average category scale for assessment of intraoperative surgical field:</p><p>0 - No bleeding</p><p>1 - Slight bleeding &#x02013; no suctioning of blood required</p><p>2 - Slight bleeding &#x02013; occasional suctioning required. Surgical field not threatened</p><p>3 - Slight-bleeding &#x02013; frequent suctioning required. Bleeding threatens surgical field a few seconds after suction is removed</p><p>4 - Moderate bleeding &#x02013; frequent suctioning required. Bleeding threatens surgical field directly after suction is removed</p><p>5 - Sever bleeding &#x02013; constant suctioning required Bleeding appears faster than can be removed by suction. Surgical field severely threatened and surgery not possible.</p><p>The ideal category scale values for surgical conditions were predetermined to be two and three. The total blood loss was measured from the suction apparatus. Infusion of the study drugs was stopped five minutes before the anticipated end of surgery, and sevoflurane was stopped at the end of the surgery and the residual neuromuscular blockade was antagonized with neostigmine (0.05 mg/kg) and atropine (0.01 mg/kg).</p><p>Monitoring included invasive blood pressure measurement, heart rate, arterial blood gases. (PaO<sub>2</sub>, PaCo<sub>2</sub>, Ph and HCO<sub>3</sub>), plasma cortisol level and surgical field score (Avarage Category scale). Plasma cortisol level was measured in three samples taken preoperatively, during hypotensive period and postoperatively. Hemodynamics and (ABGs) were recorded preoperatively (baseline), postinduction (after administration of hypotensive and anesthetic agent), intraoperatively (15, 30, 45 and 60 min), 5 and 10 minutes after stoppage of hypotensive agents and lastly after recovery. Intraoperative fentanyl consumption and requirements for additional hypotensive agent (nitroglycerine) were recorded. Emergency time, defined as the interval between the discontinuation of anesthetics to response of eye opening to verbal command,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] was recorded. After extubation and full recovery, patients were transferred to the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) to be observed where time to first analgesic rescue was recorded. Postoperative recovery was evaluated using a modified Alderet Score (0-10),[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] and time needed to achieve &#x02265;9 was recorded. Sedation score[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] was measured using the following scale at 15, 30 and 60 minutes after tracheal extubation: 1=anxious, agitated, or restless; 2=cooperative, oriented, and tranquil; 3=responsive to commands; 4=a sleep, but with brisk response to light, glabellar tap, or loud auditory stimulus; 5=a sleep, sluggish response to glabellar tap, or auditory stimulus; and 6=a sleep, no response. Patients also were asked about recalling introperative events or any sign of awareness.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Fifty patients were assigned for study eligibility.

Induced hypotension has been widely advocated to control bleeding during FESS to improve the quality of surgical field.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] In our prospective randomized study of dexmedetomidine or esmolol in combination with sevoflurane we planned to provide this optimal surgical field. Both drugs were effective in achieving MAP of 55 to 65 mmHg, and lowering the heart rate ensured good surgical condition and providing dry surgical field during FESS.</p><p>Patients who were treated with dexmedetomidine 10 min before induction of anesthesia had significant decrease in MAP and HR after administration of loading dose. This dexmedetomidine induced hemodynamic profile can be attributed to the known sympatholytic effect of &#x003b1;2 agonists. The &#x003b1;2-receptors are involved in regulating the autonomic and cardiovascular systems. Alpha 2 receptors are located on blood vessels, where they mediate vasoconstriction, and on sympathetic terminal, where they inhibit, norepinephrine release.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] At lower doses, the dominant action of &#x003b1;2 agonist is sympatholysis.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] Basar <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] investigated the effect of single dose of dexmedetomidine 0.5 &#x003bc;g/kg administration 10 min before induction of anesthesia and reported significant reduction in MAP and HR. The efficacy of dexmedetomidine in providing better surgical and less blood loss during controlled hypotension was previously reported during tympanoplasty, septoplasty and maxilofascial surgery.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>] In the current study, the induction dose of propofol was significantly lower in DEX group than in E group. This effect coinciding with the result of Peden <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>] who reported that dexmedetomidine caused a reduction in the overall dose of propofol required to produce loss of consciousness. Guven <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>] and Goksu <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>] reported better hemodynamic stability, visual analog scale for pain and clear surgical field with less side effects in DEX group than placebo group when FESS done under either conscious sedation or local anesthesia respectively. In our study we achieved ASC of &#x0003c;=2 during hypotensive period for quality of surgical field with little bleeding that did not hamper the visual clarity during the surgery. Esmolol administration in the present study was associated with significant decrease in MAP and HR compared to baseline values.</p><p>Esmolol lowers arterial blood pressure through a decrease in cardiac output secondary to negative chronotropic and ionotropic effects of &#x003b2; adrenergic antagonism. It provided a stable course of controlled hypotension and produces beneficial effects in the surgical field and in blood conservation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>] The optimal anesthetic technique seems to be relative bradycardia with associated hypotension.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>] In the present study intraoperative fentanyl consumption was significantly less in DEX group compared with E group. Several studies have found that perioperative use of dexmedetomidine was associated with a significant decrease in the consumption of inhalational agent, fentanyl, and analgesic in dose dependent manner.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>]</p><p>No significant changes were detected in the plasma cortisol level between the two groups during the intra and postoperative periods, this was attributed to the sympathoadrenal blocking action of both dexmedetomidine and esmolol inhibiting the release of catecholamine and other stress hormones.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>]</p><p>This study demonstrated prolonged postoperative analgesia in (DEX) group.
