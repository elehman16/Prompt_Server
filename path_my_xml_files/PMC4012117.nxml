Hemophilia is a class of inherited bleeding disorders characterized by a lifelong defect in the clotting mechanism and can be categorized as hemophilia A and B, when there is a deficiency of factor VIII and IX respectively (both inherited as X linked recessive). It can further be subdivided conventionally into mild (6-50 IU/dl), moderate (1-5 IU/dl) or severe (&#x0003c;1 IU/dl) depending on the level of factor activity.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Another autosomally dominant inherited bleeding disorder that is closely related to hemophilia is von Willebrand disease (vWD) characterized by qualitative or quantitative abnormalities of von Willebrand factor (vWF) leading to impaired platelet aggregation and adhesion to vascular walls, thus resulting in a bleeding tendency.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Importance of maintaining the dental and periodontal health in persons with inherited bleeding disorders has been reported by many with suggestions to expand the preventive measures and educational programs.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Though widely discussed, these hemophiliacs often face problems in acquiring the primary care. The options available in the existing literature to control bleeding during primary dental care are, factor replacement therapy (FRT), release of endogenous factor stores and clot stabilization by antifibrinolytic agents,[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] with FRT being the main mode of treatment. The development of recombinant FRT has minimized the risk of blood borne infections, but, the major disadvantage reported is the formation of antibodies or inhibitors;[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] even cost of therapy is high ranging from&#x0200a; Indian Rupees (INR or `) 6000 to 20,000, depending on the severity of the bleeding, purity, type and amount of factor used. Thus, preventive dental care with alternatives to FRT will always be safe; one such alternative is desmopressin (1-deamino-8-d-arginine vasopressin [DDAVP]),[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] that can release endogenous factor VIII from endothelial cells to the blood stream and can increase the plasma concentration in mild to moderate hemophiliacs for a short time.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] However, the problem with this is, patients who are repeatedly treated with DDAVP become less amenable due to exhaustion of endogenous stores, thus, limiting its use.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Another alternative to FRT is the synthetic amino acid derivatives of lysine such as tranexamic acid (TA) [4-(aminomethyl) cyclohexanecarboxylic acid] which has antifibrinolytic activity and works by binding reversibly to plasminogen (preventing it from forming plasmin), preventing plasminogen binding to fibrin and facilitating clot stabilization.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] TA (5% aqueous solution) has been depicted to produce therapeutic saliva concentrations when used as a mouth rinse[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and when used in conjunction with FRT has been proved to be effective in controlling hemorrhage after subgingival scaling.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>As a step forward, tranexamic acid mouth wash has been proved in another study to be as effective as FRT on its own in hemophiliacs undergoing dental scaling;[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] however, authors have prepared the mouth wash using active ingredient TA and preservatives for usage over a period of time. However, in Indian scenario, getting drug licensing is a major hurdle to freely use this mouthwash for hemophiliacs undergoing dental scaling and also the efficacy of TA is doubtful when stored for a long time. Hence, the present study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of a freshly prepared tranexamic acid mouth wash (FTAMW) from commercially available TA tablets in controlling gingival hemorrhage in hemophiliacs during dental scaling and compare it with FRT.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Ethical approval was obtained from the Institutional Ethical Committee.

Ultrasonic scaling was preferred in the present study for all patients as it is a proven fact that the bleeding will be less with minimal tissue trauma when compared to hand scaling.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p><p>Among the three vWD deficient participants, two, undergoing dental scaling under ETR in their first visit, had uncontrollable bleeding that could not be stopped with either pressure application and astringent or FTAMW; eventually needed infusion of factor injection followed by full mouth scaling. They were then instructed to use FTAMW, similar to other participants and no further bleeding was noted in their post-operative period. Even in the pilot study, we could not recruit vWD patients; hence, the results of the present study cannot be generalized for this group of patients.</p><p>In hemophilics A and B, irrespective of the regime, bleeding if reported was noticed from the buccal posterior gingival surfaces on brushing which can be due to comparatively maximum amount of calculus accumulation that increases the inflammation of the gingival tissues in these areas. Spontaneous bleeding was noticed from the lingual gingival surfaces of the lower jaw which can be due to movement of the tongue that dislodges the early clot formed. Bleeding during CTR was first noticed in the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> day after scaling which can be correlated with the half-life of factors, whereas during ETR it was on the first day of scaling. However, neither of the regimens required additional factor replacement. Thus, this study supports the use of FTAMW for hemophiliacs during their scaling procedures. Recruitment problems leading to less number of participants and bleeding noted only 4 times in a day are the major limitations of the present study.</p><p>As TAMW is proved to be successful in decreasing the hemorrhage during scaling, it can be combined with the most common form of topical treatment that involves the use of chlorhexidine gluconate gel or mouth wash with the intention of decreasing the gingival inflammation prior to scaling which in turn decreases bleeding from periodontal tissues. It is also important to educate the hemophiliacs about the cyclic pattern of deterioration of their periodontal health as they will often be less enthusiastic to brush their teeth because of concerns about bleeding.</p><p>However, it is important to remember that hemophilia is always a medical emergency and bleeding can occur at any time; no treatment should be carried out without prior planning. Any hemostatic regimen used for dental treatment should be in agreement with the individual's hemophilia reference center.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Within the limitation of our study, the usage of FTAMW was found to be an effective alternative to FRT in controlling gingival hemorrhage for people with hemophilia undergoing dental scaling, with advantages such as low cost, no risk of development of antibodies and blood product contamination. Further studies are needed in this area to affirm the use of FTAMW in clinical practice.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn
