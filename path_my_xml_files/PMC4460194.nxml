Pharmacokinetic properties of pitavastatin have been studied previously.</p></sec><sec><title>Objective</title><p>To investigate the pharmacokinetic properties of pitavastatin in healthy Chinese volunteers after single-dose and multiple-dose administration.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>An open-label, randomized, single-dose and multiple-dose study was conducted in healthy Chinese volunteers. The study included 4 stages, each separated with a 5-day washout period. A randomized, 3-way crossover design was carried out in Stages 1 to 3 for the single-dose study. Eligible subjects were randomized to receive a single 1 mg, 2 mg, or 4 mg pitavastatin calcium tablet. Blood samples were obtained predose and up to 36 hours following dosing. In Stage 4 the subjects received a 2-mg pitavastatin calcium tablet once daily for 6 days. At the last day of multiple dosing, blood samples were collected predose and up to 48 hours following dosing. Plasma pitavastatin was quantified by a validated liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method. Tolerability was assessed by the adverse events, physical examination, 12-lead ECG, and laboratory tests.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Twelve volunteers (6 male and 6 female) were enrolled in the study and 11 of them completed all 4 study stages. Following a single dose of 1 mg, 2 mg, and 4 mg, the mean (SD) T<sub>max</sub> values were 0.63 (0.17) hours, 0.65 (0.17) hours, and 0.79 (0.36) hours, respectively; the corresponding C<sub>max</sub> values were 66.80 (16.32) ng/mL, 106.09 (31.59) ng/mL, and 232.91 (66.42) ng/mL, respectively. AUC<sub>0&#x02212;36</sub> values were 190.04 (38.97) ng/mL/h, 307.87 (57.94) ng/mL/h, and 785.10 (166.08) ng/mL/h, respectively, whereas t<sub>1/2</sub> values were 10.99 (2.70) hours, 9.52 (2.58) hours, and 10.38 (4.28) hours, respectively. The AUC and C<sub>max</sub> showed dose proportionality after single dosing according to linear-regression analysis. In the multiple-dose study, a rapid absorption (T<sub>max</sub> of 0.68 [0.20] hours) and marked peak concentration of 90.99 (36.88) ng/mL were observed. AUC<sub>0&#x02212;48</sub> and AUC<sub>ss</sub> were 306.28 (130.02) ng/mL/h and 256.16 (116.34) ng/mL/h, respectively. The elimination half-life after multiple dosing was significantly prolonged, which amounted to 13.31 (2.58) hours. Comparison of the pharmacokinetic parameters between the male and female groups revealed no significant differences.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In healthy Chinese volunteers, single dosing of 1 mg, 2 mg, and 4 mg pitavastatin resulted in linear plasma pharmacokinetic properties. Compared with single dosing, multiple dosing of pitavastatin showed different distribution and elimination characteristics. Sex did not appear to affect the pharmacokinetic properties of pitavastatin.

After an overnight fast (12 hours), subjects received a single dose of 1 mg, 2 mg, or 4 mg pitavastatin calcium tablet on dosing day in each single-dose study stage. The pitavastatin calcium tablets were administered with 200 mL water. Additional water intake was permitted 2 hours following dosing. Subjects were offered a standard meal (~900 kcal; 30% protein, 60% carbohydrate, and 10% fat) 4 and 10 hours following dosing. Blood samples (~4 mL) were collected from an indwelling catheter inserted in a forearm vein before and at 0.25 hours, 0.5 hours, 0.75 hours, 1 hours, 1.33 hours, 1.67 hours, 2 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours, 8 hours, 11 hours, 24 hours, and 36 hours following dosing. In the multiple-dose study stage, subjects received a 2-mg pitavastatin calcium tablet once daily for 6 days. At the third, fourth, and fifth day, blood samples (~4 mL) were collected before dosing.

The blood sample was drawn into a plastic tube with heparin sodium as anticoagulant and then immediately centrifuged at 3500 revolutions/min for 10 minutes at 4&#x000b0;C. The supernatant plasma was transferred into a polypropylene tube and stored at &#x02013;20&#x000b0;C until drug analysis.</p><p>The volunteers were instructed to abstain from taking any drug, including over-the-counter medications, for 2 weeks before and during the study period, and to abstain from alcohol, smoking, intense physical activity, and caffeine-containing beverages during the study.</p></sec><sec id="s0035"><title>Assays of pitavastatin</title><p>Plasma pitavastatin was quantified by a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method developed and validated before the clinical study. Plasma pitavastatin quantification was conducted in the Research Center for Drug Metabolism of Jilin University. Chromatography was performed using an Agilent 1100 HPLC system (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, California) equipped with an Agilent Extend C18 column (150 mm &#x000d7; 4.6 mm; 5 &#x003bc;m) maintained at 30&#x000b0;C. The mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile-10 mM ammonium acetate in water (45:55 v/v) delivered at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. Mass spectrometric detection employed an API 4000 mass spectrometer (AB Sciex, Concord, Ontario, Canada) equipped with an electrospray ionization source operated in the negative ion mode. The curtain gases, Gas 1 and Gas 2, were nitrogen set at 15, 35, and 35 psi, respectively. The ion spray voltage was adjusted to 5000 V and the source temperature was set at 500&#x000b0;C. Detection was by multiple reaction monitoring at unit resolution for Q1 and unit resolution for Q3 with a dwell time of 200 ms/channel. Transitions of [M+H]<sup>+</sup> ions for multiple reaction monitoring were at <italic>m/z</italic> 421.9&#x02192;290.1 for pitavastatin and <italic>m/z</italic> 515.2&#x02192;276.1 for internal standard. Declustering potential and collision energy were 100 V and 38 eV for prostaglandin E1 and 90 V and 60 eV for internal standard. Mass spectrometric parameters were tuned to maximize the response of the precursor/product ion combinations. Data acquisition and integration were controlled by Applied Biosystems Analyst version 1.3 software (New York, USA).</p><p>A stock solution of pitavastatin calcium (0.2 mg/mL) was prepared in water. Calibration standards of pitavastatin were prepared by diluting the stock solutions with blank plasma to concentrations of 0.287 ng/mL, 0.957 ng/mL, 2.87 ng/mL, 9.57 ng/mL, 28.7 ng/mL, 95.7 ng/mL, and 287 ng/mL. Quality control solutions were prepared independently at concentrations of 0.957 pg/mL, 9.57 pg/mL, and 95.7 pg/mL in the same way. A stock solution (0.2 mg/mL) of the internal standard, telmisartan in methanol-water (50:50 v/v), was diluted in methanol-water (50:50 v/v) to give a 50 ng/mL working internal standard solution. All solutions were stored at 4&#x000b0;C. To 200 &#x003bc;L plasma or calibration standard or quality control sample in a glass tube, 50 &#x003bc;L formic acid and 50 &#x003bc;L internal standard working solution were added. The mixture was then shaken with 3 mL diethyl ether-dichloromethane (3:2 v/v), centrifuged for 5 minutes at 3500 g, and the organic layer was transferred to another glass tube and evaporated to dryness at 40&#x000b0;C under nitrogen. The residue was reconstituted in 150 &#x003bc;L mobile phase and the 10 &#x003bc;L was injected into the LC-MS/MS system.</p><p><xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> shows the chromatograms of a blank plasma sample, a calibration standard, and plasma sample after pitavastatin administration.

The inter- and intraday relative standard deviation of quality-control samples at concentrations of 0.957 ng/mL, 9.57 ng/mL, and 95.7 ng/mL were all &#x0003c;15%; the relative error of the above 3 concentration-level quality control samples were between &#x02212;1.25% and 1.92%, supporting the high precision and accuracy of the assay method. Extraction recoveries of pitavastatin for low-, medium-, and high-quality control samples were 89.0% (2.1%), 80.7% (0.92%), and 84.2% (3.7%), respectively. Stability tests showed the analyte was stable in human plasma under the following conditions: at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C for 80 days, after 3 freeze-thaw cycles (80&#x000b0;C to room temperature), and processed samples at room temperature for 8 hours.</p></sec><sec id="s0040"><title>PK parameters and statistical analysis</title><p>PK parameters were calculated using the noncompartmental analysis method with WinNonlin version 6.1 (Pharsight Corporation, Mountain View, California).

Vital signs were measured at screening, predose, and 0.5 hours, 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, and 24 hours postdose on each dosing day. Physical examination was performed at screening, predose, and 24 hours postdose on each dosing day. All information was recorded in the case-report form. Twelve-lead ECG and laboratory tests, including hematology, blood biochemistry, hepatic function, and urinalysis were conducted at screening and at the end of the study.

All subjects completed the 4 study stages except 1 male subject who withdrew from the study following the 1 mg and 2 mg single-dose stage because of withdrawing the informed consent. So, 12 subjects&#x02019; PK data were obtained for the 1 mg and 2 mg single-dose study and 11 subjects&#x02019; PK data were obtained for the 4 mg single-dose and multiple-dose study.</p></sec><sec id="s0060"><title>PK properties</title><p>The mean plasma pitavastatin concentration-time curves are shown in <xref rid="f0010 f0015" ref-type="fig">Figures 2 and 3</xref>.

For the 1 mg, 2 mg, and 4 mg dose levels, C<sub>max</sub> values were 66.80 (16.32) ng/mL, 106.09 (31.59) ng/mL, and 232.91 (66.42) ng/mL, respectively; AUC<sub>0&#x02212;36</sub> values were 190.04 (38.97) ng/mL/h, 307.87 (57.94) ng/mL/h, and 785.10 (166.08) ng/mL/h, respectively; and t<sub>1/2</sub> values were 10.99 (2.70) hours, 9.52 (2.58) hours, and 10.38 (4.28) hours, respectively.

The steady-state concentration and steady-state trough concentration were 11.05 (4.85) ng/mL and 2.58 (0.92) ng/mL, respectively. Multiple-dose administration of pitavastatin was characterized by some similar PK parameters with single-dose administration.

Our study revealed that pitavastatin is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, reaching peak concentration within 1 hour.

The elimination half-life after multiple dosing was significantly prolonged compared with that following single dosing (from 9.52 [2.58] to 13.31 [2.58] hours). Furthermore, the mean apparent volume of distribution after multiple dosing increased to 170.02 L compared with that after single dosing (86.93 L); the mean plasma clearance increased from 6.48 L/h (single dosing) to 8.54 L/h following multiple dosing. Those differences were statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) and furthermore, in our opinion, clinically significant. Pitavastatin is reported to be highly protein bound, primarily to albumin and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein, with a binding ratio of 96%.<xref rid="bib13 bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13,14</sup></xref> Animal studies<xref rid="bib15 bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15,16</sup></xref> indicated that pitavastatin was widely distributed in tissue, achieving the highest levels in the liver, where levels of pitavastatin were approximately 54 times higher than those found in plasma. The wide distribution and high hepatoselectivity of pitavastatin following oral administration makes it minimally exposed to peripheral tissue. Our findings about the change of apparent volume of distribution suggest that pitavastatin is more widely distributed after repeated dosing compared with a single administration. The mechanism of such change might be as follows: after single dosing, the plasma pitavastatin is still in the dynamic distribution processing from peripheral tissue (blood) to liver, and multiple dosing made the distribution saturated. Therefore, pitavastatin is more widely distributed following repeated dosing compared with single dosing. Furthermore, although the plasma clearance of pitavastatin following multiple dosing increased, it could not offset the effect of distribution increase, resulting in a prolonged elimination half-life compared with single dosing. However, the peak plasma concentration and AUC did not increase after repeated administration. The accumulation index, calculated as AUC<sub>multiple-dose</sub>/AUC<sub>single-dose</sub> and C<sub>max, multiple-dose</sub>/C<sub>max, single-dose</sub>, was 0.98 (0.28) and 0.85 (0.23), respectively. These facts indicated no accumulation of pitavastatin following repeated administration and even smaller exposure of the drug in plasma, minimizing drug toxicity and ensuring the safety of multiple dosing in clinical treatment.</p><p>In our study, the comparison of the PK parameters between the male and female subjects revealed no significant differences between groups, suggesting that sex did not appear to affect the PK properties of pitavastatin. Dose adjustments based on sex in the Chinese population are not anticipated.</p><p>Pitavastatin is a new HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor with a novel cyclopropyl moiety, which results in several differences compared with other statins. For example, pitavastatin does not undergo significant hepatic metabolism through the cytochrome P450 system. Instead, pitavastatin&#x02019;s cyclopropyl group diverts the drug away from metabolism by cytochrome P3A4 and allows only a small amount of clinically insignificant metabolism by cytochrome P2C9, minimizing its potential to cause many drug&#x02013;drug interactions.<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> Pitavastatin is rapidly taken up into the liver through organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1)<xref rid="bib18 bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18,19</sup></xref> and the polymorphism of OATP1B1 plays an important role in the disposition of pitavastatin in the human body. Chung et al<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> reported AUC and C<sub>max</sub> of pitavastatin to be 1.4- and 8-fold higher, respectively, in subjects heterozygous for the OATP*15 allele compared with those without this allele. A study by Wen et al<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> showed that the disposition of pitavastatin is significantly altered by the 388A&#x0003e;G genetic variation; that is, the AUC and C<sub>max</sub> values in the OATP 388GA + 388GG mutant group were about 80% and 71% higher than corresponding values for the 388AA wild-type group and the oral elimination of pitavastatin in the OATP 388GA + 388GG mutant group was about 35% lower than in the 388AA wild-type group. A study<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> showed that the OATP1B1*15 allele frequencies differed statistically between Asian populations. Meanwhile, Xu et al<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> reported the frequencies of 388A&#x0003e;G and 521T&#x0003e;C variant alleles in the Chinese population are similar to those in the Japanese population, but significantly different from those in whites and blacks. The OATP1B1 polymorphism may explain the interindividual variations of pitavastatin PK properties in our study to some extent. However, we lacked the volunteers&#x02019; genetic polymorphism data, which is 1 of the limitations of the study.</p><p>Lactonization is the major metabolic pathway of pitavastatin in the human body.<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> In our study, we measured plasma pitavastatin, but did not include its main metabolite (pitavastatin lactone [Pi-LAC]) for measurement, which is another limitation of our study. In a recent study in Chinese healthy volunteers, simultaneous determination of pitavastatin and Pi-LAC was conducted.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> The authors reported the interconversion of pitavastatin and Pi-LAC in human plasma. Interestingly, the authors found pitavastatin is stable and did not convert to Pi-LAC. That is the reason why the interconversion phenomenon has been ignored in most reports of quantification of pitavastatin.<xref rid="bib25 bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25,26</sup></xref></p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s0075"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In healthy Chinese volunteers, both single and multiple dosing of pitavastatin are characterized by rapid absorption and sustained concentration of pitavastatin. Linear PK data can be used to describe the PKs from single-dosing data. We found that pitavastatin steady-state concentrations were reached around the fourth day of repeated daily administration. Although multiple dosing of pitavastatin showed different distribution and elimination characteristics compared with single dosing, pitavastatin exhibited no accumulation after repeated administration. Sex did not appear to affect the PK properties of pitavastatin. All the pitavastatin doses tested were well tolerated.</p></sec><sec id="s0080"><title>Conflicts of Interest</title><p>The authors have indicated that they have no conflicts of interest regarding the
