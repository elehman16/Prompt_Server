Six groups of guinea pigs (<italic>n</italic> = 7) were sensitized to ovalbumin. Three groups of them were subjected to inhaled fluticasone propionate and salmeterol, one group during sensitization (A), one group after that (for 18 days, B), and the other one during sensitization but with 18 days delay before measurements (C).

Introduction</title><p>The most important characteristic feature of asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airway [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] which leads to airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Asthma is a two-component disease including airway inflammation [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and smooth muscle dysfunction [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Therefore, the most effective treatment is a drug which targets both components of the disease.</p><p>The combination of long acting <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-agonists (LABA) and inhaled corticosteroid is more effective in treatment of asthma than increasing the dose of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Suppression of the inflammatory process by LABA is also indicated in <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo </italic>animal studies [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Treatment with fluticasone propionate (FP) and salmeterol (SM) improved allergen-induced airway remodeling [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and was able to control peripheral blood T-cell activation in asthmatic patients more efficiently [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Bidirectional interaction between <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-agonists and steroids on various pathophysiologic aspects of asthma was documented previously [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>It was well documented that regular treatment with FP and SM combination resulted in continuous improvement in AHR with maintenance of asthma control in the majority of patients [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, there are still many questions to be answered in this field. Most studies examined the effect of FP and SM combination on lung inflammation and airway responsiveness administered after clinical manifestation of asthma both in human [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and in animal models [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and only in few studies the effect of combined therapy was examined during sensitization in animal [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>However, the effect of combined therapy, administered during, or after sensitization on the asthmatic airway inflammation is not compared yet. Therefore, in this study, the effect of an inhaled corticosteroid, fluticasone propionate and long acting <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-agonist, salmetrol during and after sensitization of guinea pigs was investigated in tracheal responsiveness to ovalbumin (OA) and total and differential white blood cell (WBC) in bronchoalveolar lavage. In addition, the effect of an allergen-free period on the efficacy of combined therapy was also examined.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2. Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>2.1.

Discussion</title><p>Tracheal response to OA, total WBC count in lung lavage and percentage of eosinophils and neutrophils increased but percentages of, lymphocytes and monocytes decreased in sensitized compared to control animals which were similar to the results of the previous studies [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The reduction in lymphocyte seen in this study may arise from the increase in total WBC number [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>The most effective agent in asthma therapy is a drug which targets both airway inflammation and smooth muscle dysfunction of the disease. Therefore, the effect of FP and SM on the tracheal responsiveness to OA, total differential WBC count which was administered during and after sensitization and during sensitization with 18 days delay in measurements was examined in this study.</p><p>The small effect of FP and SM on percentages of neutrophils in BAL fluid of sensitized animals observed in the present study may suggest that fluticasone propionate prolongs human neutrophil survival by inhibiting apoptosis by having an effect on glucocorticoid receptor [<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Reduction in the percentages of lymphocytes in BAL of all treatment groups could be due to apoptotic effect of FP and SM which was seen in cultured lymphocytes too [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The increase in the percentage of monocytes in all treatment groups seen in the present study was different from the previous observed effect of corticosteroids, that is, reducing recruitment of monocytes to the airways [<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. But it could be due to reduction of total WBC count.</p><p>The effect of FP and SM on the tracheal responsiveness to OA and total and differential WBC count in lung lavage of sensitized guinea pigs seen in the present study, was supported by those who indicated that adding LABA leads to greater improvement in different parameters of asthma than increasing the dose of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. However, the effect of FP and SM administered during (with measuring parameters immediately and after 18 days delay) and after sensitization of guinea pigs was evaluated which was the novelty of the present study.</p><p>In placebo group A (sensitized animals treated with inhaled placebo during sensitization, PA), most parameters were greater than those of placebo group B (sensitized animals treated with inhaled placebo after sensitization, PB) and placebo group C (sensitized animals treated with inhaled placebo during sensitization but measurement of different parameters were performed 18 days after the end of sensitization period, PC). There was greater sensitization in PA compared to PB and PC. The cause of these findings is perhaps due to an allergen-free period which is supported by the effect of allergen prevention in control of asthma disease [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and allergen-free period in an animal study [<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>The novelty of the present study is the evaluation of the effect of FP and SM administration after (examining parameters immediately or with 18 days delay) and during sensitization of guinea pigs. The effect of an allergen free period in animals treated during sensitization on the results of combined therapy was also examined. The improvement in most parameters in treatment group A and C (TA and TC) was greater than group B (TB). The cause of these findings is perhaps due to administration of FP and SM during sensitization which indicates the importance of the early as possible asthma therapy. In fact a permanent loss of pulmonary function or even induced remission in some patients in early treatment of airway inflammation is observed previously [<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] which supports these findings. The cause of less improvement in total WBC in TA group compared to TB is perhaps due to the greater change in this group. There was less improvement in some parameters in group TC compared to TA. The cause of these results is perhaps a nontreated period of 18 days in this group which emphasizes the role of ongoing treatment in asthmatic patients. The results also showed incomplete prevention of tracheal responsiveness to OA and total and differential WBC in treated sensitized guinea pigs with FP and SM either during or after sensitization which are other important findings of the present study.</p><p>In a previous study, the effect of FP alone administered during or after sensitization was examined [<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The present study aimed to investigate the following: (1) is the combination of fluticasone propionate and salmeterol different from fluticasone propionate alone? and (2) does an allergen-free period in animals treated during sensitization affect the results? Comparison of the results of two studies showed that treatment of sensitized guinea pigs with combination of FP and SM during sensitization leads to more improvement in most variables except neutrophil, count compared to animals treated with only FP. In sensitized animals treated with combination of the two drugs after sensitization, also improvement in total WBC was greater than those treated with FP. In addition, there was no significant difference in eosinophil and monocyte counts between two drugs treated after sensitization. However, improvement in tracheal responsiveness to OA, neutrophil and lymphocyte counts was greater in treated animals with FP alone than combination of FP and SM after sensitization. Therefore, the results of both studies showed that treatment during sensitization is more effective than after sensitization. In addition, the results showed that treatment of sensitized animals with FP and SM is more effective than FP alone especially in the group treated during sensitization.</p><p>While asthma is an airway inflammation disorder [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], in further studies, the effect of FP and SM administered during or after sensitization on serum and lung lavage levels of inflammatory mediators should be examined. In the present study, tracheal responsiveness was measured, but, in asthma, disorder of mostly small and medium airways is present. This limitation should be addressed in further studies by <italic>in vivo</italic> measurement of airway resistance in sensitized animals treated with FP and SM during or after sensitization. In addition, all aspects of asthma are not produced in sensitized animals. Therefore, related clinical studies are needed to fully address the effect of administration time of drugs on the management of asthma.</p></sec><sec id="sec6"><title>6. Conclusion</title><p>The results showed that FP and SM had a preventive effect on the tracheal hyperresponsiveness to OA and lung inflammation. This preventive effect was greater when drugs were administered during sensitization. The results indicate that asthma therapy should be started as soon as possible early during the development of airway inflammation in asthmatic patients. The role of an allergen-free environment in the treatment of asthma is also suggested.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was financially supported by the Research
